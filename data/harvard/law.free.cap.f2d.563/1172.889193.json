In No. 75-4436 (hereinafter <em>Ouza), </em>the council, spurred by the arrest of two bookstore employees on obscenity charges, revoked the occupational licenses under which an adult bookstore had been operating. In No. 75-3632 (hereinafter <em>Bayou Landing), </em>the council directed that the permanent occupancy permit for an adult bookstore be withheld, because residents of the area around the bookstore had objected to the visual displays in the windows of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">The district court dismissed both actions. In <em>Ouza </em>the court held in favor of the defendant-appellees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the close of the bookstore owners\u2019 case. The court expressed the view that the appellants had failed to make a prima facie case. In <em>Bayou Landing, </em>the court sustained the appel-lees\u2019 position after an evidentiary hearing at which periodicals allegedly similar to those sold at the bookstore were introduced. The court ruled from the bench<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the materials were not protected by the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-14\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-16\">\n<em>Bayou Landing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-17\">In August, 1975, the city-parish council directed the local building official to withhold issuance of an occupancy permit for 3919 Florida Boulevard in Baton Rouge. Appellant Bayou Landing, Ltd. had been operating an adult bookstore at the location under temporary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-18\">The record is barren of any explanation for the council\u2019s action except for the text of the resolution passed by the council ordering that the permit be withheld:</p>\n<p id=\"abj-dedup-0\">RESOLUTION 5583 AUTHORIZING AND DIRECTING THE BUILDING OFFICIAL TO WITHHOLD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>THE ISSUANCE OF AN OCCUPANCY PERMIT FOR THE PROPOSED USE OF THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 3919 FLORIDA BOULEVARD, BEING LOT 36, SQUARE 3, LOFASO TOWN.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">WHEREAS, an application has been received requesting a permit for operation of a business enterprise designated as a book store in the building located at 3919 Florida Boulevard, being Lot 36, Square 3, Lofaso Town; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">WHEREAS, because of the visual ad- \u2022 vertisements on display in the front windows of these premises, it is felt that the type of business activity contemplated is unsuitable for location in a residential community and area such as the one in which this building is situated, and the residents and property owners in the area have formally opposed the establishment of such business concern as contemplated; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">WHEREAS, this Council believes it would be in the best public interest to withhold the issuance of an occupancy permit at this location for the proposed use:</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the City Council of the City of Baton Rouge that the Building Official is hereby authorized and directed to withhold the issuance of an occupancy permit for the proposed use of the building located at 3919 Florida Boulevard, being Lot 36, Square 3, Lofaso Town, in the City of Baton Rouge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">Record 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">Since the resolution arguably trenches on the plaintiff\u2019s first amendment rights it is for the defendant to justify it. <em>See Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, </em>431 U.S. 85, 97 S.Ct. 1614, 52 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977); <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). The defendant seeks to do this first, by claiming that it is in the nature of a zoning ordinance. A city clearly can provide that certain establishments may only operate in specified neighborhoods, or must be located a specified distance from each other, even in a first amendment context. <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976). Zoning, however, connotes a non-particularized legislative process in which rules are promulgated and land areas designated on a general, prospective basis. 101 C.J.S. Zoning \u00a7 1 (\u201cZoning regulations are legislative, rather than judicial, in character\u201d). Here, there are strong indications that the resolution was not a zoning ordinance. The resolution was directed at only one business, instead of being of general applicability, even though \u201crezoning on a piecemeal or spot basis is highly suspect.\u201d <em>Four States Realty Co., Inc. v. City of Baton Rouge, </em>309 So.2d 659, 672 (La.1975). <em>See also </em>101 C.J.S. Zoning \u00a7 34. The resolution was not prospective, but instead acted to penalize that establishment <em>after </em>it became known that it was selling certain material. Furthermore, it recites as one of the reasons for its passage that \u201cresidents and property owners in the area have formally opposed the establishment of such business concern as contemplated.\u201d This reliance on public distaste for certain activities, instead of on legislative determinations concerning public health and safety again indicates that we are not dealing with zoning. In addition, the defendants have not cited any statute, ordinance, or other source defining \u201cunsuitable for location in a residential community.\u201d At oral argument, counsel for defendants stated that the city council was authorized to act to protect the public interest. These standards for restraining the dissemination of materials such as books, magazines, and films \u2014 all of which are presumed protected by the first amendment \u2014 plainly cannot pass constitutional muster.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The standards would permit the government to suppress protected expression solely because the residents of the community disapproved of the content of the expression or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>were offended by it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We also note that it was stipulated by the parties that \u201cother establishments in the area selling the same type of material were given occupancy certificates and are in fact doing business in the City of Baton Rouge.\u201d There has been no explanation, in a zoning context, as to why the plaintiff business was singled out for unique treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The ordinance at issue is also sought to be justified on general police power grounds. For instance, it recites as a reason for the refusal of a permit \u201cthe visual advertisements on display in the front windows of these premises.\u201d While a governmental body might properly refuse to license some businesses because of their window advertisements, in the first amendment context it must be sure that \u201cthe restrictions are no greater than necessary or essential to the protection of the governmental interests.\u201d <em>Baldwin v. Redwood City, </em>540 F.2d 1360, 1365 (9th Cir. 1976). <em>See Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, </em>431 U.S. 85, 91, 97 S.Ct. 1614, 52 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977). Here, if the true problem was plaintiff\u2019s advertisements, surely the city could have commanded that those be removed without so heavily intruding on the first amendment as it did when it refused to allow the bookstore to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Thus \u201c[i]f the ordinance is to be sustained, it must be on the basis of the [city\u2019s] interest in regulating the content of the communication, and not on any interest in regulating the form.\u201d <em>Linmark Associates, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 94, 97 S.Ct. at 1619. However, the resolution at issue cannot even be justified as straightforward administrative censorship. The Supreme Court has required that \u201cregulations of obscenity scrupulously embody the most rigorous procedural safeguards . . . .\u201d <em>Blount v. Rizzi, </em>400 U.S. 410, 416, 91 S.Ct. 423, 428, 27 L.Ed.2d 498 (1971); <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 66, 83 S.Ct. 631, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). There were no such safeguards in the instant case. Although the defendant argues that a public hearing was held before the resolution in question was adopted, such a mechanism merely enhances the opportunity of the majority to suppress distasteful but protected expression. The procedures envisioned by the Supreme Court are of more judicial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">Finally, the council action is not saved by the district court\u2019s ruling from the bench that the materials sold at the bookstore were obscene. First, the materials examined by the district court were not even from the Bayou Landing store in Baton Rouge, but were purchased in Jefferson Parish. Since there is a difference between pornography and obscenity, while the material from one store might be obscene the material from the other might be protected. Second, the obligation of seeking a judicial determination of the protected or unprotected categorization of literature must be placed on the government, and the government must allow a free trade in material presumed protected until it demonstrates in court that the materials are obscene. <em>See Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\">We thus conclude that the plaintiff was entitled to the relief requested in No. 3632.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-16\">\n<em>Ouza</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-17\">In October, 1975, the council revoked the occupational licenses that had been granted to Ouza, Inc., and Excalibur Books, Inc., for a bookstore on Plank Road in Baton Rouge. The events leading to the revocation began with the arrest of two of the bookstore\u2019s employees on obscenity charges. The district attorney for the parish wrote to the council, recommending that the store\u2019s operating authority be revoked because, in view of the arrests, revocation was necessary \u201cto protect the public interest.\u201d Record 28. The parish clerk then sent appellants each a letter notifying them of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>hearing regarding the district attorney\u2019s recommendation. A copy of the district attorney\u2019s letter was sent along with \u2014 and incorporated by reference into \u2014 the parish clerk\u2019s letter. The clerk\u2019s letter also stated that a basis for the proposed revocation was violation of the Louisiana obscenity statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A hearing was held by the council\u2014 in closed session at the request of appellants \u2014 and after the hearing the council passed a resolution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> revoking appellants\u2019 licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">After putting the above facts before the district court in the form of stipulations or documentary evidence, appellants rested, being of the view that they had made out a prima facie case. The district court disagreed, dismissing the case at the close of appellants\u2019 evidence. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azs-dedup-0\">Whether or not the obscenity laws of the State of Louisiana or the Parish of East Baton Rouge have been violated by the plaintiffs cannot be determined by this Court absent evidence on that issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>Plaintiffs have seen fit to rest their case without the presentation of any evidence pertaining to the issue of obscenity . Since the burden is upon the plaintiffs to prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence, and since the plaintiffs have failed or refused to present any evidence on the question of obscenity to this Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-4\">IT IS ORDERED that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary and permanent injunction and for declaratory judgment in its favor in this case be, and it is hereby DENIED, and this case is hereby DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">Record 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">We are at a loss to understand what sort of evidence the district court thought it incumbent upon the bookstore owners to present \u201con the issue of obscenity.\u201d The purport of the court\u2019s opinion is that the materials are presumed obscene. On the contrary, once a plaintiff shows that the government has restrained dissemination of materials <em>presumed </em>protected by the first amendment and introduces evidence tending to show that the restraint was based on the content of the materials, then the burden shifts to the government officials to demonstrate that any restraint imposed comported with the substantive and procedural requirements of the first amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">The judgment in No. 75-3632 is reversed with the direction that the district court grant injunctive relief. The judgment in No. 75-4436 is reversed and the cause remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">.

The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-10\">[W]hen the plaintiff says that the burden of proof is on the defendants, that burden of proof has been met by the introduction as evidence into this hearing of materials that are so filthy, absolutely filthy, that it almost makes me puke \u2014 and I hope the reporter can spell that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-11\">It has got to be the product of depraved, perverted minds that would even look at it, let alone try to sell it. And I can understand why the plaintiff did not take the witness stand to try to defend what they are doing in this case. I\u2019m sure they would have been ashamed to have done so. They did not. If they wouldn\u2019t have been ashamed to have done so, they ought to be incarcerated some place that would be suitable for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-12\">As far as prior restraint is concerned, no prior restraining is involved. I don\u2019t even believe that Justice Douglas would say that this is protected by the First Amendment. This is th\u00e9 filthiest, nastiest stuff that you can imagine. And if the City Officials did not take steps to try to put these people out of business, they ought to be impeached. As a matter of fact, I think they ought to maybe set up a separate community for people like that and put them all together where they could enjoy each other\u2019s company, instead of letting them just pollute the whole city and state and neighborhood with this kind of stuff. This is almost unbelievable. Its got to be somebody that is perverted from head to feet to try to put this stuff any place in public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-22\">I don\u2019t know what else I can say, except that this is so filthy that I will have to order the Clerk to seal this evidence because I could not have it on conscience to have that kind of evidence even available for the grown-up adult members of the Clerk of Court\u2019s office to have to see. And this evidence will be sealed, so if the Court of Appeals would like to see it, they can have an opportunity to see it, if this case has to be reviewed, but it certainly is not going to be open to the public; and it\u2019s not going to be open to the members of my court; they are not going to have to look at it, to file or anything else. It will be in an envelope under seal. It\u2019s just that filthy \u2014 and I\u2019m not a prude, but this is the worst and is as bad as you could ever imagine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-23\">Record 83-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">. <em>Interstate Circuit v.
