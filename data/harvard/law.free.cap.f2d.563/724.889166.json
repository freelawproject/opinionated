The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ordered the NLRB to turn over to Robbins Tire copies of all written statements of those who will be called to testify<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in a consolidated representation and unfair labor practice proceeding involving that company. The order required that these documents be transmitted \u201con or before April 22,1976, or, at the election of the Board, on or before a date which is at least five days prior to any hearing where the person making the statement or affidavit will be called as a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A panel of this court has denied the Board\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal, and the NLRB hearing has been held in abeyance for over a year pending the outcome of this appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-19\">First, there is a jurisdictional problem. The Board argues that the effect of the order to disclose statements of witnesses was to enjoin its proceeding against the company. It casts its argument as an exhaustion requirement, citing <em>Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938), and asserting that Robbins Tire would suffer no irreparable injury if forced to challenge the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>action afterwards on appeal, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 160(e)-(f). <em>See also Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., </em>415 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974); 51 St. John\u2019s L.Rev. 251, 254 n. 17 (1977). We need not decide whether or when a district court adjudicating a FOIA claim may enjoin ongoing or prospective NLRB proceedings in an effort to compel the disclosure required by the Act. In this case, the district court did not enjoin the hearing. The Board argues that this was the effect of its order. But whether or not an order constitutes an injunction is a question that does not turn on the subjective importance attached to it by the defendant and his resulting action in the circumstances. Like similar orders in the more conventional discovery context, this one gave the NLRB a choice. It could produce the statements, it could proceed without resort to the testimony of these particular affiants or it could forego the hearing. While the unpalatability of this choice might well form part of the rationale for finding a substantive exemption under FOIA,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it cannot be transformed into a jurisdictional question by the Board\u2019s decision to hold its hearing in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">\n<em>Exemption 7(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">The Board asserts that the statements of prospective witnesses fall within exemption 7(A), which protects against disclosure of \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings, . . . .\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A). The issue here is whether pre-hearing disclosure of the contents of statements made by those prepared to testify in support of the Board\u2019s case would actually \u201cinterfere\u201d with the Board\u2019s case. In <em>Goodfriend Western Corp. v. Fuchs, </em>535 F.2d 145 (CA1) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 895, 97 S.Ct. 257, 50 L.Ed.2d 178 (1976), the First Circuit has held that it would.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">We think our answer can be found by ascertaining what Congress meant by \u201cinterfere,\u201d bearing in mind the dictum that FOIA was a comprehensive effort to publicize all agency action and that its exemptions are to be narrowly construed. <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 360-61, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11, 21 (1976). As Judge Oakes explained in the leading case of <em>Title Guarantee Co. v. NLRB, </em>534 F.2d 484 (CA2), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 834, 97 S.Ct. 98, 50 L.Ed.2d 99 (1976),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>this language was the result of a change offered by Senator Hart to the 1974 amendments to the FOIA after the bill had been reported out of committee. The purpose of Senator Hart\u2019s proposal was to restore the original intent of FOIA to require the agency to make a particularized showing that an investigatory file\u2019s disclosure would harm its case in court. \u201c[I]t is only relevant to make [the exemption 7(A)] determination,\u201d Senator Hart emphasized, \u201cin the context of the particular enforcement proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By making this change, Congress sought to eliminate unfounded judicial notions that a document\u2019s mere status as investigatory and enforcement-related would be sufficient to justify nondisclosure. Thus, the legislative history of exemption 7(A) reveals a sort of procedural emphasis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such an emphasis is strongly supplemented by the tenor of the 1974 amendments even before Senator Hart\u2019s change. As Senator Kennedy, the principal author and floor leader of the amendments, remarked, \u201cWith the new provisions it should be clear that there can be no blanket claim of confidentiality under any of the exemptions.\u201d Source Book 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">We move next to the more substantive inquiry of what kind of interference Congress was concerned about avoiding in each particular case. Our only real clue lies in the remarks of Senator Hart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">[Exemption 7(A)] would apply whenever the Government\u2019s case in court . would be harmed by the premature release of evidence or information not in the possession of known or potential defendants. This would apply also where the agency could show that the disclosure of the information would substantially harm such proceedings by impeding any necessary investigation before the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">Source Book 333.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">The first sentence here suggests that the concern was with interference in the rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>broad sense of premature revelation. Support for this idea can be found in Senator Hart\u2019s earlier statement that he wanted to return to the purpose revealed in the legislative history of the 1966 Act. This purpose was \u201cto prevent harm to the Government\u2019s case in court by not allowing an opposing litigant earlier or greater access to investigatory files than he would otherwise have.\u201d Source Book 332, <em>quoting from </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966), <em>reprinted in </em>[1966] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News pp. 2418, 2428. If this is what interference means, then we would be obliged to give an FOIA plaintiff-as-public-citizen no more information than he would obtain as a private litigant engaging in discovery before the agency. In <em>Title Guarantee, </em>for example, Judge Oakes began his analysis by observing that disclosure \u201cwould be tantamount to the issuance of new, broader discovery rules for NLRB proceedings,\u201d given Second Circuit limitations on the duty of the Board to grant pretrial discovery. 534 F.2d at 487. However, we think that comparative discovery is not the key to the meaning of exemption 7(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">First, it is questionable whether FOIA disclosure would result in an increase in discovery rights in this court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Al-</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">though the Second Circuit has held that the National Labor Relations Act does not specifically authorize or require the Board to adopt discovery procedures,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this court, emphasizing the authority of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> has held that \u201cwhen good cause is shown to the Board it should permit discovery in order that the rights of all parties may be properly protected.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Rex Disposables, </em>494 F.2d 588, 592 (CA5, 1974), <em>citing NLRB </em>v. <em>Safway Steel Scaffolds Co., </em>383 F.2d 273 (CA5, 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 955, 88 S.Ct. 1052, 19 L.Ed.2d 1150 (1968); <em>NLRB v. Miami Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>403 F.2d 994 (CA5,1968); <em>cf. NLRB </em>v. <em>W. R. Bean &amp; Son, Inc., </em>450 F.2d 93, 96 (CA5, 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 849, 93 S.Ct. 57, 34 L.Ed.2d 91 (1972) <em>(Safway Steel </em>and <em>Miami Coca-Cola </em>place question within discretion of administrative law judge).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have also held more specifically that statements of Board witnesses are discoverable in civil contempt proceedings that the Board brings to challenge noncompliance with appellate court decrees. <em>NLRB v. Schill Steel Products, Inc., </em>408 F.2d 803 (CA5, 1969).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude from these authorities that, with respect to the statements of prospective witnesses, some right to discovery exists under the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>agree with the Board\u2019s assertion that disclosure of witnesses\u2019 statements would inevitably interfere with enforcement proceedings even in the sense that it would always allow litigants greater discovery than they otherwise would obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Second, focusing on comparative discovery rights, even if it gave us a clearer answer, would violate the spirit of the procedural reform sought by the Hart amendment. The change, as we have noted above, sought to require a showing that some \u201cspecific harm might result to [the government\u2019s] case from disclosure,\u201d <em>Deer-ing Milliken, Inc. v. Irving, </em>548 F.2d 1131, 1135 (CA4,1977). If the mere fact that one could not have obtained the document in private discovery were enough, the Board would have made naught of the requirement that nondisclosure be permitted \u201conly to the extent that . . . production would . . . interfere\u201d in some way. We must interpret the exemption to give meaning to this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Finally, tying FOIA rights to the discovery rights of the particular plaintiff presents us with a legal conundrum that suggests the improbability of such a congressional intent. In order to apply the comparative discovery test, we must look to the particular needs of the plaintiff (in order to see whether he has shown good cause for production). But the Act mandates release of information \u201cto any person.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3). For this reason, anyone\u2019s case is as strong (or as weak) as anyone else\u2019s. <em>See NLRB </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 143 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1513, 44 L.Ed.2d 29, 43 n. 10 (1975): \u201c[Plaintiff\u2019s] rights under [FOIA] are neither increased nor decreased by reason of the fact that it claims an interest in the [documents sought] greater than that shared by the average member of the public.\u201d Thus, to hold that certain groups\u2014 members of the news media, for example\u2014 are the real beneficiaries of FOIA is to create a pecking order unjustified by the language of the statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201c[A]ll citizens have a right to know\u201d what their government is doing. S.Rep.No. 813, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1965).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">In sum, we reject \u201cearlier or greater access\u201d as a kind of interference protected against by exemption 7(A). We think that the protection against interference involves a focus not on the rights of the individual FOIA plaintiff but rather on the problems posed to the particular agency proceeding. We thus proceed to an examination of the possible harms that could befall Board proceedings by pretrial disclosure of witnesses\u2019 statements.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Indeed, a precise reading of <em>Title Guarantee </em>reveals that this was the approach taken there. Although, as we have noted, Judge Oakes referred to the expansion of discovery rights, his finding of</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>exemption arose not from the mere conclusion that such rights would otherwise be expanded but from the doubt that Congress intended to so expand them in view of a (judicially perceived) likelihood for interference in the proceedings that might result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apd-dedup-0\">We cannot envisage that Congress intended to overrule the line of cases dealing with labor board discovery in pending enforcement proceedings by virtue of a back-door amendment to the FOIA when it could very easily have done so by direct amendment to Section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b), or by a blanket enactment pertaining to discovery in pending administrative enforcement proceedings. It is significant that it is never suggested in the legislative history of the 1974 amendment to the FOIA that any such modification of agency discovery rules was intended. ... In light of the delicate relationship which exists between employer and employee, we think that Congress would be very reluctant to change the rather carefully arrived at limitations and procedures for discovery in unfair labor practice proceedings by way of an act which, while dealing with disclosure generally, does not purport to affect such discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">534 F.2d at 491-92 (footnotes omitted). Senator Hart\u2019s second sentence in his aforementioned explanation of what he meant by interference (a diminished ability to collect investigatory information) suggests a similar judicial inquiry into the precise nature of the harm to the agency\u2019s case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">As we have noted, <em>Title Guarantee </em>involved a request for copies of all statements, without regard to whether the affi-ants would be called to testify. Part of the rationale for denying the right to disclosure was \u201cthe delicate relationship which exists between employer and employee.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See also Roger J. Au &amp; Son, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>538 F.2d 80, 83 (CA3, 1976) (\u201cpeculiar character of labor litigation\u201d); <em>Climax Molybdenum Co. v. NLRB, </em>539 F.2d 63, 65 (CA10, 1976) (\u201crelationship between employer and employee is a delicate one which calls for limitations on discovery\u201d). There is inherent in this concern an assumption that the Board would be unable to obtain testimony from employees to aid in its prosecution if their statements would become the knowledge of their employer. Even discounting the problem that we do not know which of the affiants here are employees,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> this sweeping assumption of intimidation is inappropriate here, where the request is limited to statements of witnesses. As this court said in <em>Schill Steel, </em>\u201cInformers who actually testify . . . surface automatically.\u201d 408 F.2d at 805.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Circuit admitted in <em>Goodfr\u00edend, </em>\u201cit may-well be that [such] circumstances minimize the possible interference with the pending proceedings.\u201d 535 F.2d at 147.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">In the present situation, there may be some risk of interference with Board proceedings in the form of witness intimidation from harassment of an employee-witness during the five days prior to the hearing,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> done in an effort to silence him or dilute the nature of his testimony. Such harassment would constitute an unfair labor practice under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(4).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>NLRB v. Scrivener, </em>405 U.S. 117, 92 S.Ct. 798, 31 L.Ed.2d 79 (1972). Any attorney interrogation of the affiants extending beyond \u201cthat legitimately necessary for the preparation of respondent\u2019s defense\u201d to the underlying unfair labor practice charge would run a risk of incurring section 8(a)(1) liability. <em>See, e: g., NLRB v. Ambox, Inc., </em>357 F.2d 138, 141 (CA5, 1966); <em>Texas Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>336 F.2d 128, 132-34 (CA5, 1964); <em>NLRB v. Hardeman Garment Corp., </em>557 F.2d 559, 563 n. 9, (CA6, 1977). Nevertheless, post hoc discipline does not necessarily dissipate the anxieties of those upon whom the intimidation may be visited. We understand the Board\u2019s position in this regard, dependent as it is upon charges initiated by others before it issues its complaints. <em>See NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 138-39, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1510-1511, 44 L.Ed.2d 29, 40-41 (1975).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">However, the Board has not introduced any evidence tending to show that this kind of intimidation (either to physical or employment security) is likely to occur during the five days between discovery and the Board hearing in this case. While we do not purport to establish an exclusive set of criteria for looking at this question, there are numerous factors that bear upon such an inquiry: whether the history of labor relations in the community and at the plant makes intimidation of these witnesses reasonably foreseeable; whether the witnesses work in jobs (with Robbins Tire or not) or have records of job performance that make intimidation of them a likely result of disclosure; the nature of the testimony which the unknown affiants are expected to give. <em>See Temple-Eastex, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>410 F.Supp. 183 (E.D.Tex., 1976) (ordering disclosure of witness statements favorable to employer).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Instead, the Board has asserted that in every case the potential for intimidation is so great as to require nondis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>closure of all statements and affidavits. This sort of per se approach to exemption 7(A) is inconsistent with the procedural reform effected by the Hart amendment. FOIA requires disclosure absent the agency\u2019s ability to prove<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the applicability of exemption 7(A) in the context of the particular proceeding involved. We hold that the Board has not sustained its burden of proving that the possibility of intimidation in this case through disclosure to Robbins Tire brings exemption 7(A) into play<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">\n<em>Exemption 7(C)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Exemption 7(C) protects these statements and affidavits from disclosure only to the extent that production would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). The district court rejected this claim since (1) Robbins Tire seeks disclosure only of statements taken from those scheduled to testify at the Board hearing and (2) the Board\u2019s own rules<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> allow disclosure of the statements after the direct examination of the witnesses at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We agree. The Board concedes that there is nothing unusual in the nature of personal or family details in these affidavits that suggests the need for protection. <em>See Title Guarantee, </em>534 F.2d at 489 n. 10 (dictum). In addition, as the district court noted, this is purely a matter of when the witnesses\u2019 statements are to be revealed, and there is therefore no privacy interest involved. \u201cDisclosure of this same information is not an unwarranted invasion of the claimants\u2019 privacy simply because it occurs before the hearing.\u201d <em>Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Irving, </em>548 F.2d 1131, 1136 (CA4, 1977). Accordingly, we need not engage in balancing privacy rights against the right of the public to be informed. <em>Cf. Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 370-82 &amp; n. 16, 96 S.Ct. 1592,1603-1609 &amp; n. 16, 48 L.Ed.2d 11, 26-33 &amp; n. 16 (1976) (exemption 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">\n<em>Exemption 7(D)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">This exemption protects against disclosure that would \u201cdisclose the identity of a confidential source.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D). The Board asserts that section 10058.4 of its Case Handling Manual requires that the affiant \u201cshould be told the truth \u2014 that the information would be used by us in ascertaining the total picture and that this would be its only use unless and until he might be called on to give information in the form of testimony at a formal hearing or in the unlikely event another agency made a valid request upon us for such information.\u201d We do not know whether this \u201cexpress assurance\u201d was given here, and we question how unconditional'an assurance of confidentiality it is anyway. However, employee-employer context might in some situations provide \u201ccircumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Texas Industries, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Inc. v. NLRB, </em>336 F.2d 128,134 (CA5,1964) (importance of preserving confidentiality of employee statements). However, as the district court held, the Board\u2019s case under exemption 7(D) fails for the same reason that exemption 7(C) fails: all the statements sought here come from those who are scheduled to testify at trial anyway. If one\u2019s identity is certain to be disclosed, we cannot characterize him as one of the sources given either express or implied assurance of confidentiality.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">\n<em>Exemption 5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Finally, the Board asserts that the statements and affidavits taken from prospective witnesses are protected from disclosure by exemption 5, which exempts \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party ... in litigation with the agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5). In contrast with its position on exemption 7(A), the Board has not met with much success with this argument. <em>See Title Guarantee, </em>534 F.2d at 492-93 n. 15 (dictum); <em>Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Irving, </em>548 F.2d 1131, 1138 (CA4, 1977); <em>Marathon LeTourneau Co. v. NLRB, </em>414 F.Supp. 1074, 1080 (S.D.Miss., 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Exemption 5, which unlike exemption 7 remained unchanged by the 1974 amendments, has been held to encompass the work-product privilege of <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947). <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132,154,95 S.Ct. 1504,1518,44 L.Ed.2d 29, 49 (1975); <em>Kent Corp. v. NLRB, </em>530 F.2d 612, 618 (CA5), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 920, 97 S.Ct. 316, 50 L.Ed.2d 287 (1976). The basic disagreement between the Board and Robbins Tire here is whether the distinction between \u201cfactual\u201d and \u201cdeliberative\u201d materials fashioned in <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 87-88, 93 S.Ct. 827, 836, 35 L.Ed.2d 119, 132 (1973), in connection with executive privilege was intended to be or can be extended to cases involving the work-product privilege. If in fact Congress meant to incorporate <em>Hickman </em>in all its complexity into exemption 5 as a sort of direct legal transplant, the witness statements in this case would be exempt from disclosure, for <em>Hickman </em>protected even relevant and non-privileged witness statements unless production \u201cis essential to the preparation of one\u2019s case.\u201d 329 U.S. at 511, 67 S.Ct. at 394, 91 L.Ed.2d at 462. Since as we have noted FOIA prohibits looking at the needs of the particular plaintiff in ruling on the applicability of the exemptions, such statements would not \u201cnormally\u201d or \u201croutinely\u201d be disclosed in private litigation. <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 149 &amp; n. 16, 95 S.Ct. at 1515 &amp; n. 16, 44 L.Ed.2d at 46 &amp; n. 16, <em>citing </em>H.R.Rep.No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1966).

The Court described in some detail the difficult language as well as the legislative history of exemption 5. While noting the problems involved in applying discovery analogies without inquiring as to individual need,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the Court observed that one thing about exemption 5 was certain: \u201cCongress intended to incorporate generally the recognized rule that \u2018confidential intra-agency advisory opinions . are privileged from inspection.\u2019 \u201d 410 U.S. at 86, 93 S.Ct. at 836, 35 L.Ed.2d at 132.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Justice White supported this position by citing the House and Senate reports to which we have referred. He then articulated the deliberative-factual distinction, and in doing so cited cases such as <em>Soucie v. David, </em>448 F.2d 1067 (CADC, 1971). <em>Soucie </em>was not confined to the executive privilege context; there the D. C. Circuit was promulgating broad guidelines for the handling of the exemption 5 issue on remand. <em>See also Bristol-Myers Co. v. FTC, </em>424 F.2d 935 (CADC), <em>cert, denied, </em>400 U.S. 824, 91 S.Ct. 46, 27 L.Ed.2d 52 (1970) (cited in <em>Mink). </em>Finally, Justice White explained that the first version of exemption 5 had definitively exempted only \u201cmemorandums or letters dealing solely with matters of law and policy.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The only reason for the change in final wording was not to weaken this deliberative-factual distinction but to assure that factual material inextricably intertwined with deliberative material would also be exempt. <em>Mink, </em>410 U.S. at 90-91, 93 S.Ct. at 837, 35 L.Ed.2d at 134. <em>Mink\u2019s </em>extensive analysis of exemption 5 as a whole shows that the case should properly be read as an exemption 5 case, not simply an executive privilege case. It paints with a broad brush, like other decisions both before and after it. <em>See, e. g., National Courier Association v. Board of Governors, </em>516 F.2d 1229, 1242 (CADC, 1975); <em>Schwartz v. IRS, </em>511 F.2d 1303, 1305 (CADC, 1975); <em>Tennessean Newspapers, Inc. v.

It was not defined as an exception to compelled disclosure in order to authorize an agency to throw a protective blanket over any type of information it might choose by the expedient of casting it in the form of an internal memorandum. <em>Bristol Myers Co. v.

The subject manual is an impersonal, mass-produced statement of established policy designed to be utilized as an educational and reference tool, not for policy-making or deliberative purposes. If this material be a \u201cmemorandum\u201d then the term would cover virtually all government documents of any description or nature. Such an interpretation would be at war not only with the plain meaning of the word but also with the spirit and purpose of the Act. Whatever the ultimate scope of this \u201cmemorandum\u201d exception may be, we are confident that these materials would remain without its reach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\"><em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>476 F.2d 699, 703-04 (CA5, 1973). There is no suggestion here that the factual-deliberative distinction only defines the scope of the executive privilege. It is inherent in the purpose of exemption 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Indeed, we suggested the answer to this case in <em>Kent Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>530 F.2d 612, 623-24 (CA5), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 920, 97 S.Ct. 316, 50 L.Ed.2d 287 (1976), in which we held protected under exemption 5 \u201cfinal investigation reports\u201d prepared by NLRB staff members. These reports summarized the evidence of unfair labor practices (gained by witness interviews such as those actually requested here) and recommended dispositions as to the various charges. Discussing the work-product privilege and <em>Hickman, </em>we held that even the factual information contained in these reports was protected. But our approach emphasized the deliberative nature of the report process into which these facts were integrated and contrasted these documents with the precise sort of \u201cprimary information\u201d that is involved in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">In our view, even the factual matters in these reports (which might not be protected by executive privilege) are protected by the work-product privilege. Writing in contemplation of forthcoming unfair labor practice litigation, an attorney must be able not only to discuss doctrinal theories but also to \u201cassemble information, [and] sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts\u201d without feeling that he is working for his adversary at the same time. <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. at 511, 67 S.Ct. at 393, 91 L.Ed. at 462. The feeling would be well justified if we allowed the FOIA to be used to force disclosure of such materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">This case is a particularly strong one for recognizing the privilege. <em>The contents of the reports are not primary information, such as verbatim witness testimony or objective data, </em>but rather are mainly reports on how the Birmingham attorneys appraised the evidence they found. Thus the reports consist largely of \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, [and] legal theories\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Rule. Such materials, if prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial, are always protected by a properly-raised claim of work product privilege, regardless of the opposing litigant\u2019s need.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">530 F.2d at 624 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\"><em>Mink, Stokes, </em>and <em>Kent </em>all admit the difficulties involved in administering a statutory standard that ordinarily turns on individual need but prohibits courts from as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>sessing such factors in the FOIA context. <em>See </em>note 17, <em>supra. </em>Whether as in <em>Stokes </em>we resolve the problem by focusing on the word \u201cmemorandum\u201d and concluding that factual witness statements are not encompassed within that term,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> or whether we conclude that in constructing its exemption 5 discovery analogy Congress had no inkling of the ramifications of the qualified part of the <em>Hickman </em>privilege,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> we cannot reconcile withholding these statements with exemption 5\u2019s narrow policy of safeguarding the thought processes of the agency as an institutional thinker.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The Board has failed to sustain its statutory burden of proof as to exemptions 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), and 5.

Senator Hart\u2019s adoption of a prior ABA Committee proposal suggests that he was particularly concerned with refusals to disclose investigatory files from closed cases. <em>See </em>Source Book 334, 336-39, 351. But we view this as simply a particular manifestation of the need to change the exemption to require an inquiry in each situation as to whether disclosure would actually \u201cinterfere.\u201d Perhaps closed files might be so closely related to collateral proceedings pending before the agency that disclosure of them would still interfere. See <em>New England Medical Center Hosp. v. NLRB, </em>548 F.2d 377 (CA1, 1976). Conversely, the particular concern with closed files in the legislative history does not indicate to us a determination that disclosure of files in open cases, simply because they are open, would necessarily qualify as interference under exemption 7(A). <em>Cf. </em>45 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 114, 124 (1976) (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201cThe <em>Title </em>court suggested that exemption 7(A) was enacted in 1974 to resolve the problem of the unavailability of closed investiga<em>tory </em>files. The withholding of investigatory files pertaining to closed cases was a particularly egregious abuse of exemption 7 which exemption 7(A) certainly was designed to eliminate. The 1974 amendments, however, were not drafted in terms that require disclosure of closed files and nondisclosure of open files. Congress could have easily formulated such a distinction. The amendments were phrased instead to require agencies to establish under exemption 7(A) that interference with agency enforcement proceedings would result from disclosure. Thus, while the phraseology of exemption 7(A) assumes that nondisclosure can be justified only in the context of a pending enforcement proceeding, it requires the courts to consider whether disclosure would be harmful to that proceeding before granting a 7(A) exemption. This clearly implies that not all documents pertaining to pending proceedings are automatically exempted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">Whether or not all investigatory statements may be per se exempt for other reasons is a question we address below.

NLRB, </em>539 F.2d 63, 65 (CA10, 1976), is irrelevant in the face of what we perceive to be a congressional directive to do so. According to one commentator, even the experts have \u201cstrongly held and widely disparate opinions on the reality of employee fear as an inhibiting factor in securing statements from witnesses.\u201d 51 St. John\u2019s L.Rev. 251, 268 n. 92 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\">. The Board\u2019s per se rule would not satisfy the burden FOIA imposes even if it had resorted to the sort of conclusory affidavit employed to provide \u201cevidence\u201d of inevitable intimidation in <em>Harvey\u2019s Wagon Wheel, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>550 F.2d 1139, 1142 (CA9, 1976). The statutory scheme requires proof of adjudicative, not legislative, facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\">. It might be argued that the mere delay that this FOIA suit creates to the Board process of enforcing the provisions of the NLRA constitutes exemption 7(A) interference. <em>New England Medical Center Hosp. v. NLRB, </em>548 F.2d 377, 384 (CA1, 1976). But giving such scope to this exemption would result in a per se rule that any FOIA suit designed to obtain investigatory files would fail if it coincided with a scheduled hearing. For the reasons we have indicated, we think this result inconsistent with the intent of the statute as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b789-14\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.118(b)(1) (1976). This rule, which is modeled after the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, applies as well to representation cases. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.118(c) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b789-15\">. We draw these explanations of what may create confidentiality from language in the conference report on the 1974 amendments to the FOIA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-16\">\u201cThe substitution of the term \u2018confidential source\u2019 in section 552(b)(7)(D) is to make clear that the identity of a person other than a paid informer may be protected if the person provided information under an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred. Under this category, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>in every case where the investigatory records sought were compiled for law enforcement purposes \u2014 either civil or criminal in nature\u2014 the agency can withhold the names, addresses, and other information that wodld reveal the identity of a confidential source who furnished the information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Source Book 230 (Conf.Rep.No. 93-138, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Of course, here the Board has offered no specific evidence concerning the Robbins Tire situation from which a court might draw such a reasonable inference. <em>See Title Guarantee, </em>534 F.2d at 489-90 n. 11 (dictum). Its exemption 7(D) position, like its positions regarding the exemptions already discussed, is a per se one. But the question here, too, is ordinarily one of fact. <em>Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Irving, </em>548 F.2d 1131, 1137 (CA4, 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b790-13\">. <em>Cf. Climax Molybdenum Co. v. NLRB, </em>407 F.Supp. 208, 209 (D.Colo., 1975), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>539 F.2d 63 (CA10, 1976); <em>accord, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>407 F.Supp. 1124, 1127 (W.D.Pa., 1976). These cases argue that all interviewees are potential witnesses and that they therefore can never be considered confidential sources. We do not express an opinion on the applicability of exemption 7(D) with respect to statements of those not scheduled to be called at the Board hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">. As noted above, we must construe FOIA exemptions narrowly. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 360-61, 96 S.Ct. at 20-21, 48 L.Ed.2d at 21. With respect to exemption 5 in particular, see S.Rep.No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965) (\u201cThe committee . . . has attempted to delimit the exception as narrowly as consistent with efficient Government operation.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b791-11\">. <em>See also </em>Davis, <em>The Information Act: A Preliminary Analysis, </em>34 U.Chi.L.Rev. 761, 795 &amp; n. 88 (1967); Note, <em>The Freedom of Information Act and the Exemption for Intra-agency Memoranda, </em>86 Harv.L.Rev. 1047, 1049 &amp; nn. 11-12 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b791-14\">. <em>See </em>note 17, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b791-15\">. <em>Cf.
