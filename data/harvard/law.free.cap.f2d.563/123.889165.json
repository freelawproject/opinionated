As formulated by the Department of Corrections, the incentive pay program was intended to apply only to those work activities of the inmates which produced some measurable saving or production from which monies for the program could be realized. The activity in which the plaintiffs were engaged was found by the prison administration not to meet the criteria for participation in the program. The District Court, on a stipulation of facts, found, in a well-reasoned opinion, that such classification of the plaintiffs\u2019 activity was not arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm on the opinion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">The District Court did not address the claim under the Thirteenth Amendment, perhaps because it was so obviously without merit. <em>See, Borror v. White </em>(W.D.Va.1974) 377 F.Supp. 181, 183; <em>McLaughlin v.
