CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">Appellee Columbia Packing Co. (Columbia) is a federally inspected meat packing plant in Boston. In 1974 Columbia and its vice president were convicted on numerous counts of bribing two federal meat inspection officials, Joseph F. Mauriello and Do-menic L. Germano. The two inspectors were themselves convicted in other proceedings of receiving bribes from other companies. The scandal revealing widespread corruption in the meat packing industry and the inspection service received extensive local publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">In November of 1974 the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) which conducts federal meat and poultry inspection initiated administrative proceedings under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 467, 671, to withdraw federal inspection services from Columbia on grounds that the company\u2019s participation in the bribery had rendered it unfit to engage in any business requiring inspection. Withdrawal of federal inspection would result in Columbia\u2019s going out of business since the company would no longer be entitled to introduce its products into the stream of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-16\">During preliminary administrative proceedings, Columbia moved for extensive discovery of documents in USDA\u2019s possession, including, \u201cAll employment and personnel files including staff evaluations of former meat and poultry inspectors Joseph F. Mau-riello and Domenic L. Germano.\u201d Between that time and the present, USD A has re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>leased information to Columbia but has withheld from the personnel files of the two inspectors material which is the subject of the present appeal. The Administrative Law Judge ruled that he was without authority to compel disclosure of the documents which Columbia sought but stayed proceedings so that Columbia might try to obtain the material by initiating a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit in the district court. Columbia filed such a suit and the district court temporarily restrained CSD\u00c1 from proceeding with the administrative action against Columbia. After much preliminary skirmishing in the district court, unnecessary to relate here, the court examined the personnel files <em>in camera. </em>In a memorandum opinion filed on June 16, 1976, the district court noted that Columbia sought the material in the files in the hope that it would tend to prove at the administrative proceeding that Columbia was the victim of extortion, a posture \u201ctending to mitigate its conduct\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court was of the opinion that the Freedom of Information Act mandated disclosure of the files unless they fell within the statutory exemption for \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). And the court rightly stated that determination of whether personnel file data fell within or without the exemption provided by \u00a7 552(b)(6) required a balancing of \u201cthe individual\u2019s privacy interest in nondisclosure against the public interest in disclosure\u201d. <em>See Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 370-73, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). In striking the balance, the district court first noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cThe privacy interests of the individual meat inspectors involved are weighty indeed. The records provide a detailed synopsis of each individual\u2019s career within the Department of Agriculture, data about family relationships, financial information and medical records. The records therefore contain \u2018intimate details\u2019 of a highly personal nature, <em>Getman v. NLRB </em>[146 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 450 F.2d 670], 675 [1971].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The court characterized the information as of the type which an employee revealed only \u201cwith an expectation, if not a promise, of confidentiality\u201d. However, the court went on to say that the privacy interest was diminished by the inspectors\u2019 involvement in bribery and their resulting convictions, events which \u201ccreated a legitimate public interest in their careers\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Turning to the public interests to be served by disclosure, the court found several. First, \u201c[i]f the records sought assist Columbia in showing that it is entitled to continued receipt of meat and poultry inspection services\u201d Columbia\u2019s enhanced defense would serve the public interest in keeping an adequate flow of meat and poultry products. The court also reasoned that the public had a substantial interest in correct administrative determinations, an interest evidently to be served by enlarging Columbia\u2019s right to discovery. Lastly, the court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201cthe public has an interest in whether public servants carry out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner. Thus, there is a public interest in records of employees who abuse their positions to determine whether the agency\u2019s personnel evaluation and supervision procedures are working well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">\u201cIn general, for records relating to the evaluation and advancement of [the inspectors] the public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interest in nondisclosure. For medical records, on the other hand, the privacy interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Because of the great number of records submitted and examined by the court <em>in camera, </em>the court will merely list without further discussion those records which must be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>closed, upon consideration of the contents of each record and the principles outlined above.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">While the district court was correct that the public has a legitimate interest in the careers of the two inspectors, we think it should not have characterized this in terms of the public\u2019s interest in an adequate meat supply (supposedly advanced by enhancing Columbia\u2019s chances of success in the administrative proceeding) nor in a general concern for \u201ccorrect administrative determinations\u201d. So labelling the interests affected came close to suggesting that the FOIA creates a right to maximum discovery in agency enforcement proceedings. However, it is settled that the disclosure provisions of FOIA are not a substitute for discovery and a party\u2019s asserted need for documents in connection with litigation will not affect, one way or the other, a determination of whether disclosure is warranted under FOIA. <em>See NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132,143 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975); <em>New England Medical Center Hospital v. NLRB, </em>548 F.2d 377, 383 (1st Cir. 1976). \u201cThe Act is fundamentally designed to inform the public about agency action and not to benefit private litigants.\u201d <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra. </em>While maximum discovery in a contested administrative proceeding may arguably advance the truth-seeking process, it may also enable a wrongdoer to play for time and divert attention from his own misconduct by conducting a lengthy collateral suit in the federal court. <em>Cf. New England Medical Center v. NLRB, supra. </em>In any event, there is no evidence that Congress in enacting the FOIA was focussing on the pros and cons of enhanced discovery in adversarial agency proceedings. Provision for more extensive discovery in the different types of agency litigation is primarily a matter either for agency regulation or separate Congressional determination. To the extent that the public interests in an adequate meat supply and fair administrative proceedings are just a restatement of Columbia\u2019s private interest in enlarged discovery, we think that these asserted \u201cpublic interests\u201d are unrelated to FOIA\u2019s purpose of \u201cinformpng] the public about agency action\u201d and are therefore of little weight in determining whether to order disclosure. <em>See Committee on Masonic Homes v. NLRB, </em>556 F.2d 214, 220 (3d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201cEmployee appraisals\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cNotificationfs] of Personnel Action \u2014 Reassignment\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cNotificationfs] of Personnel Action \u2014 Promotion\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201cReassignment[s] &amp; Change in Headquarters Career \u2014 Conditional Appointment\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">We agree, however, with the district court that \u201cthe public has an interest in whether public servants carry out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner\u201d and therefore, in these circumstances, has a legitimate curiosity as to the two meat inspectors\u2019 careers. Ordinarily the individual careers of public servants would be of small general interest, <em>cf. Campbell </em>v. <em>United States Civil Service Commission, </em>539 F.2d 58, 62 (10th Cir. 1976), but the scandal in which Columbia and the inspectors participated was far-reaching and of great notoriety. To forestall similar occurrences, the public has an interest in discerning how the officials conducted themselves prior to their discharge for bribery, how well they were supervised, and whether USD A or any of its other personnel were chargeable with any degree of culpability for their crimes. In particular, the public has an interest in knowing whether companies like Columbia were the victims of official extortion or whether the corrupt inspectors were enticed into their misconduct by the companies. While it cannot be known to what extent disclosure of documents to Columbia for use in this administrative proceeding will actu-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">\u201cAppointment Affidavits\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-14\">\u201cApplicationfs] for Federal Employment\u201d \u201cSecurity Investigation Data for Non-Sensitive Position\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-15\">\u201cStatement of Prior Federal, Civilian and Military Service and Determination of Competitive Status\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-16\">\u201cVeteran Preference Claim\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-17\">\u201cSupervisor\u2019s Appraisal Report[s]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ally so inform the public at large, Columbia\u2019s rights are not lessened, any more than they are enhanced, by the private purposes for which the documents are sought. We conclude that there is a relevant public interest, which Columbia is entitled to enforce, in production of at least some of the documents. We are also satisfied that the court did not abuse its discretion in selecting as it did among the particular records. We see no evidence that its mistaken reference to a broader discovery rationale than is warranted affected its balancing of the personal privacy interests of the two men against the very substantial public interest in full disclosure of evidence that might bear on the integrity and competence of the agency for which they worked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the court\u2019s order that the designated documents be disclosed to Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The USDA also appeals from the district court\u2019s order enjoining, until disclosure is made, the administrative proceedings which threaten to authorize termination of Columbia\u2019s inspection services. In <em>Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., </em>415 U.S. 1, 20, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 1038, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974), the Court held that courts should not enjoin renegotiation proceedings pending the resolution of an asserted FOIA claim as the \u201ceffect would be that renegotiation, and its aims, would be supplanted and defeated by an FOIA suit\u201d. However, the Court declined to go so far as to rule that Congress in enacting the FOIA and providing certain remedies therein, meant to divest courts of their inherent equitable powers. Thus the court below was not without power to issue collateral injunctive relief if circumstances warranted. The question is whether it abused its discretion in entering such an injunction in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">As noted, FOIA was not enacted to provide litigants with an additional discovery tool. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra; Bannercraft Clothing, supra </em>at 24, 94 S.Ct. 1028; <em>New England Medical Center Hospital, supra. </em>It follows that the very serious step of enjoining an agency proceeding should not be taken merely because the maximum degree of disclosure permitted by the FOIA has not been ordered in time for possible use in that ongoing agency proceeding. We think it must ordinarily be demonstrated, at least, that without access during the proceeding to the information sought, the litigant faces a probability of, very serious, specific injury which cannot be averted by any of the administrative remedies available in the course of the proceeding. <em>See Bannercraft Clothing, supra </em>at 24, 94 S.Ct. 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In the present case Columbia claims that it will be unable to assert the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s refusal to order disclosure of the documents as a defense to judicial enforcement of a USDA order depriving it of inspection services. Even accepting this as true,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Columbia has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>still not shown a particularized need for the documents, the frustration of which will result in irreparable harm. The irreparable injury which Columbia sees at the end of the road is forced bankruptcy when its inspection services are withdrawn. But its inability to use the material sought in this suit in the administrative proceeding is linked solely by speculation and conjecture to that dire result. It is speculative whether routine personnel evaluations will show that USDA was chargeable with knowledge of its inspectors\u2019 illegal activities or that its inspectors were engaged in extortion and that, therefore, Columbia should prevail. Perhaps the best that can be said for an injunction here is that in view of the criminal convictions of the inspectors, and of numerous colleagues, it is not undesirable that the administrative proceeding be conducted after settlement of the FOIA issue so as to avoid any possible appearance of governmental \u201ccover-up\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">While the question of whether or not the court abused its discretion in enjoining the agency proceeding is in our view exceedingly close, it is now largely academic: now that we have affirmed the district court\u2019s disclosure order, the injunction will have little further effect. Once the material is disclosed, the injunction will cease to apply, and the administrative proceeding will go forward. Under all the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the district court\u2019s judgment should not at this time be disturbed, but we emphasize that injunctions of this nature are not to be entered routinely.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. In its brief Columbia considerably overstates matters when it says that the district court \u201crecognized the exculpatory nature of those portions of the personnel files ordered disclosed to the extent that they would substantiate Columbia\u2019s position that it had been the victim of harassment by meat and poultry inspectors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\">. The documents listed in the appendix to the district court\u2019s opinion were described as follows:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-5\">. Agency material is disclosable in the absence of a clear showing of exemption. <em>Ditlow v. Shultz, </em>170 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 355, 517 F.2d 166, 169 (1975); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B); <em>see Campbell v. United States Civil Service Commission, </em>539 F.2d 58, 61 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Robles v. EPA, </em>484 F.2d 843, 846 (4th Cir. 1973). The \u201cpersonnel and medical files\u201d, mentioned in \u00a7 552(b)(6) are exempt only to the extent a court finds that disclosure of the particular materials in issue will amount to a \u201cclearly unwarranted\u201d invasion of privacy. <em>See Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 371-73, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). We have reviewed the files in question and do not find that the material ordered to be disclosed will cause any special embarrassment to the individuals affected such as might outweigh the beneficial effect upon public confidence of knowing that nothing of possible relevance is being suppressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\">. It would appear, as the Government now urges (although it took the opposite tack earlier) that 9 C.F.R. 335.23-2 gives the USDA ALJ subpoena power over relevant and material documents in USDA\u2019s files. If the ALJ could have subpoenaed the documents had he found them relevant, a refusal to do so on the grounds of lack of authority could be legal error, reviewable at a later stage under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(D) which provides that the reviewing court may \u201cset aside agency action, findings and conclusions found to be . . . (D) without observance of procedure required by law; \u201d <em>see Union of Concerned Scientists v. AEC, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 77, 499 F.2d 1069, 1082 (1974). While we do not decide on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>basis, the likelihood that Columbia may resist on direct appeal any adverse order entered in violation of discovery rights under agency regulations suggests a reason for denying collateral equitable relief at this time. <em>See, e. g., Sterling Drug, Inc. v. FTC, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. 237, 249, 450 F.2d 698, 710 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
