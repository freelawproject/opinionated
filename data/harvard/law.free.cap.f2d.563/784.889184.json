Krupansky presiding (Reorganization Court), which order, <em>inter alia, </em>made determinations on five separate questions which arose in the course of proceedings under \u00a7 211(h) of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (Rail Act) as amended, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 721(h).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-23\">As this Court noted in <em>In Re Erie Lacka-wanna Ry., Debtor, Appeal of Conrail, </em>558 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>F.2d 339, at 341 No. 76-2417 (6th Cir. 1977), \u00a7 211(h)(3) of the Rail Act\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alb-dedup-0\">authorizes USRA to petition the Reorganization Court for an order (consistent with \u00a7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205, and with the \u00a7 211(h)(2) agency agreement) to be entered prior to conveyance identifying and applying \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d of the debtor estate, which cash and assets are to be made available in the post-conveyance period for the payment of the pre-conveyance obligations identified in [\u00a7 211(h)(1)],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">On February 20, 1976 USRA, acting pursuant to \u00a7 211(h)(3), filed a petition with the Reorganization Court \u201cFOR ORDER FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CASH AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND FOR APPLICATION OF SUCH ASSETS TO PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF THE ESTATE.\u201d The various parties in interest, <em>i. e., </em>USRA, Conrail, the Committee of Interline Railroads, the EL Trustees, and the trustees under various mortgage indentures securing bonds issued or assumed by EL, <em>i. e., </em>Citibank, N.A., et al, (Indenture Trustees), filed statements of position on the questions raised by USRA\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">A hearing on USRA\u2019s petition was held on March 22, 1976. Shortly thereafter, on March 31, 1976, the Reorganization Court issued Order No. 506, the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Specifically, the Reorganization Court held that certain escrowed funds in question could not be made available for application as \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d under \u00a7 211(h)(3); that the Erie Lackawan-na (EL) estate\u2019s liability for vacation pay earned pre-conveyance by certain of its employees ceased as of the date of the conveyance of EL\u2019s assets to Conrail (April 1, 1976) and that this vacation pay then became the obligation of Conrail; that Conrail as agent of the EL estate must use the \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d identified pursuant to \u00a7 211(h)(3) first to pay non-\u00a7 211(h)(1) claims and only thereafter to apply the funds to claims identified in \u00a7 211(h)(1); that no obligation of EL exists on or after the date of conveyance for the principal of obligations, or for the interest which has accrued thereon post-conveyance, in respect of railroad rolling stock; and that Conrail is liable for inventories received by the EL estate prior to conveyance but not paid for at the time of conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">We affirm as to the Reorganization Court\u2019s determination that the escrowed funds in question are not \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 211(h)(3) of the Act. With respect to the railroad rolling stock and inventory issues, we reverse for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and with respect to the Reorganization Court\u2019s determination that \u201ccash and other\u2019 current assets\u201d must be used first to pay non-\u00a7 211(h)(1) claims, we reverse in light of the October 1976 amendments of the Rail Transportation Improvement Act (RTIA). The vacation pay issue is currently the subject of settlement discussions among the parties and therefore we do not address that issue at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">In Order No. 506 the Reorganization Court held that the escrowed funds carried on the EL estate\u2019s books primarily under Special Account No. 716, \u201cCapital and Other Reserve Funds,\u201d in accordance with the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s (ICC) Uniform System of Accounts for Railroad Companies, are\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-11\">specifically excluded from any Section 211(h)(3)(A) designation as not being \u201ccurrent assets\u201d within the contemplation of the Act and these funds are reserved for the purposes for which they have been specially deposited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">These escrowed funds represent pre-bank-ruptcy and post-bankruptcy sales of mortgaged property in an estimated aggregate amount of $4,152,189.39 as of the date of conveyance, April 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">We are of the opinion that the Reorganization Court properly determined that the escrowed funds in question should not be identified and applied as \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 211(h)(3) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>First, in the absence of any guidance in the Rail Act or in the legislative history as to the meaning of \u201ccash and other current assets,\u201d we ascribe that meaning which accords with generally-accepted accounting principles for the railroad industry. <em>See generally O\u2019Hara v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., </em>269 U.S. 364, 370-71, 46 S.Ct. 157, 70 L.Ed. 313 (1926). The formal designation on the EL estate\u2019s books given to the escrowed funds in question was \u201cCapital and Other Reserve Funds\u201d in conformity with the required accounting classifications prescribed by the ICC. We are of the opinion that funds formally designated as \u201ccapital\u201d assets pursuant to the ICC system of accounts cannot be conveniently identified as \u201ccurrent\u201d assets for the purpose of payment of administration claims. Indeed, as Judge Fullam of the Penn Central Reorganization Court stated in <em>In Re Penn Cent. Transp. Co., </em>411 F.Supp. 1079,1085 (E.D.Pa. 1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">I fail to see how escrow accounts which are either deposited pending resolution of disputes as to ownership and entitlement thereto, or subject to liens, or both, can reasonably be deemed \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d of the Debtor\u2019s estate within the meaning of \u00a7 211(h)(3). .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">The short answer to USRA\u2019s contentions is that, to the extent the Trustees have a present interest in the escrow funds reflected in the ICC account No. 716, these are capital assets, not current assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am5D\">Furthermore, although Judge Pratt of the Ann Arbor Reorganization Court ultimately determined that liened escrowed funds comprising the Ann Arbor estate\u2019s ICC Account No. 716 were \u201ccash and other current assets,\u201d even he conceded that there were \u201ca number of counterveiling [sic] considerations.\u201d Judge Pratt stated in <em>In Re Ann Arbor R.R., </em>414 F.Supp. 812, 824 (E.D.Mich. 1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">Foremost among those [countervailing] considerations is the force of the strict legislative intent approach. In selecting the phrase \u201ccash and current assets,\u201d Congress utilized a term with a pre-exist-ing and conventional meaning. Moreover, the failure to define the term and the patent lack of consideration of its import provide a basis for arguing that the term is limited to its technical definition. [footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">We are unable to discern any legislative intent to alter the established ICC accounting classifications for the purpose of identifying \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 211(h)(3) and accordingly, we conclude that the escrowed funds in question remain \u201ccapital\u201d and not \u201ccurrent\u201d assets for the purposes of \u00a7 211(h)(3) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Second, as already noted, \u00a7 211(h)(3)(B) provides that the application of the identified \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d must be \u201cconsistent with the principles of reorganization under section 205 of Title 11 [\u00a7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act] . . . .\u201d As did the parties in <em>In Re Penn Cent. Transp. Co., supra </em>at 1084-85, the parties in the present case have devoted much of their arguments to the question of the applicability to the present case of the bankruptcy principles enunciated in <em>In Re Penn Cent. Transp. Co. [Columbus Option </em>case], 494 F.2d 270 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 883, 95 S.Ct. 147, 42 L.Ed.2d 122 (1974), and in several other similar cases. The <em>Columbus Option </em>Court held that proceeds of the sale of unmortgaged capital assets of Penn Central Transportation Co., Debtor, could not be expended for general operations of the debtor. The Court, at 275, endorsed the test set forth in <em>In Re Third Ave. Transit Corp., </em>198 F.2d 703, 706-07 (2d Cir. 1952), for \u201cthe use of proceeds held by the indenture trustee from the sale of mortgaged assets\u201d in subsidizing the debtor\u2019s operations. The test consists of three requisites for the invasion of proceeds of such mortgaged assets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-12\">(1) \u201cthat it is imperative to obtain the funds and that they cannot be obtained\u201d from other sources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-13\">(2) \u201cthat the secured creditors . will not be injured\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-14\">(3) \u201cthat there is a high degree of likelihood . . . that the debtor can be reorganized . . . within a reasonable time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Assuming, arguendo, that the es-crowed funds in question somehow could be characterized and identified as \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d on the EL estate\u2019s books (a proposition with which we do not agree), USRA and Conrail have not demonstrated that application of the escrow funds under \u00a7 211(h)(3) would be \u201cconsistent with the principles of reorganization\u201d under \u00a7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. It is clear that at least the first two requisites of the above test have not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">With respect to the first requisite, we are of the opinion that it is not \u201cimperative\u201d to invade the liened escrowed funds because \u00a7 211(h)(1) allocates loan moneys to rectify the shortfall between the \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d of the estates and the accounts payable of the estates. While \u00a7 211(h)(1) originally authorized USRA to make loans not to exceed $230 million in the aggregate through Conrail to the estates for the payment of certain pre-conveyance obligations, the October 1976 amendments of RTIA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> increased the total amount of available loan funds from $230 million to $350 million. As the House Conference Committee Report, H.R.Rep. No. 94-1743, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 33-34 (1976), explained, this latter sum \u201cestablishes what is in effect a revolving fund from which additional loans can be made as the initial total amount of loans is reduced by projected revenues or assets becoming available to the estates for this purpose.\u201d The Conference Committee Report further stated at 34:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">It is the Conference Committee\u2019s hope that the total funds authorized by this new bill, would be sufficient to retire all claims as they are finally ascertained as to amount. If this is not the case, we would immediately seek additional Congressional authorization to provide the funds necessary to ensure the full payment of all obligations in a timely manner. <em>(Reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 5857.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Thus it seems clear that it is not \u201cimperative\u201d that the liened escrowed funds be used now to pay the \u00a7 211(h)(1) pre-conveyance obligations because such obligations can be paid from other sources, <em>i. e., </em>identified \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d supplemented by a substantial revolving loan fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Conrail and USRA contend that all of the \u00a7 211(h)(1) pre-conveyance obligations constitute administration claims which must be paid before secured or unsecured creditors, and they apparently argue that therefore, the escrowed funds in any event will eventually be used in payment of administration claims. We cannot assume, however, that all or even a portion of the escrowed funds will necessarily be used to pay administration claims, particularly those identified under \u00a7 211(h)(1); and should such funds be used for such purposes, the funds will remain subject to the right (albeit an uncertain one, <em>see </em>infra) of the Indenture Trustees for compensation for erosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">With respect to the second requisite for invading escrowed funds, we are of the opinion that the secured creditors, or bondholders holding liens against the escrowed funds, will be prejudiced by the application of such escrowed funds to the payment of \u00a7 211(h)(1) pre-conveyance obligations. Clearly, the bondholders\u2019 liens are already in a subordinate position with respect to administration claims, and as we noted in <em>In Re Erie Lackawanna Ry., Debtor, Appeal of United States, </em>558 F.2d 1262 at 1264 (6th Cir. 1977), \u201c[t]here seems to be a real question whether bondholders will receive anything from the estate.\u201d Therefore, the bondholders\u2019 security should not be im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>paired more than is absolutely necessary. As to the availability of a Tucker Act remedy for secured creditors for erosion of assets, we note the late Judge Hastie\u2019s observation that the \u201clong delays and practical uncertainties about recoupment\u201d may be unavoidable in seeking such a remedy. As Judge Hastie stated in <em>In Re Penn Cent. Transp. Co., </em>533 F.2d 1347, 1352 (3d Cir. 1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">The section 77 trustees and the reorganization court have not been relieved of their responsibility to consider and deal equitably with all claimants who have an interest in the Penn Central estate. True, the Supreme Court has determined that Penn Central creditors have an ultimate remedy under the Tucker Act for erosion losses the government has forced upon the bankrupt estate. <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>1974, 419 U.S. 102, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320. And the Court deemed that remedy constitutionally adequate. But the legitimate interests of Penn Central creditors are fairly and more fully served by additional measures calculated to prevent or minimize erosion losses and thus to avoid the long delays and practical uncertainties about recoupment that unavoidably will attend resort to a Tucker Act remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Thus it is clear that under the bankruptcy principles set forth in the <em>Columbus Option </em>case, the escrowed funds in question may not be applied to the payment of the \u00a7 211(h)(1) obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Finally, it should be noted that the parties conceded in the proceedings below that \u00a7 211(h)(3)(A) does not require <em>all </em>\u201ccash and other current assets\u201d to be applied to the payment of \u00a7 211(h)(1) claims. In fact, the present language of \u00a7 211(h)(3)(A), contrary to earlier legislative versions which included the word \u201call,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> expressly requires the Reorganization Court to identify only <em>\u201cthat </em>cash and other current assets .... which shall be utilized to satisfy obligations of the estates identified in \u00a7 211(h)(1).\u201d [emphasis added]</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Thus, again assuming arguendo, that the liened escrowed funds in question could somehow be characterized as \u201ccurrent assets\u201d on the EL estate\u2019s books, this language in \u00a7 211(h)(3)(A) makes it clear that the Reorganization Court has discretion in determining which \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d will be identified pursuant to the statute. Likewise as already. noted, \u00a7 77 bankruptcy principles give the Reorganization Court equitable discretion in determining whether certain \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d will be applied pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">We are of the opinion that the Reorganization Court\u2019s determination that the escrowed funds in question should be neither identified nor applied as \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 211(h)(3), was not an abuse of discretion and was in no sense arbitrary or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">The Reorganization Court ordered implementation of a provision in Paragraph 5(a) of the Conrail/Erie Agency Agreement which required that the \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d identified pursuant to \u00a7 211(h)(3) be utilized first to pay the accounts payable not enumerated in \u00a7 211(h)(1) and thereafter, funds remaining be utilized to pay the pre-conveyance obligations eligible for payment with loan funds pursuant to \u00a7 211(h)(1). In oral argument counsel for Conrail represented that its appeal with respect to this issue was no longer necessary by reason of certain clarifying language in \u00a7 203(b) of the October 1976 amendments of RTIA which effectively reverses the Reorganization Court\u2019s order to the extent it implements Paragraph 5(a) of the Agency Agreement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Specifically, \u00a7 203(b)(1) of RTIA amended \u00a7 211(h)(2) of the Rail Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 721(h)(2), to provide that the accounts receivable and other estate assets processed by Conrail pursuant to the Agency Agreement be used\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>for the payment of only those accounts payable which relate to the obligations of the estates identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Section 203(b)(2) of RTIA further amended \u00a7 211(h)(2) of the Rail Act by prohibiting the Reorganization Courts\u2019 enjoining, restraining, or limiting Conrad\u2019s applying any \u201ccash or other current assets\u201d toward payment of \u00a7 211(h)(1) obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Section 203 of RTIA was explained in the House Conference Committee Report, H.R. Rep. No. 94-1743, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 34-35 (1976) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">With regard to the inability to pay some of the claims at the present time with available funds, the Conference Committee is aware that some confusion exists regarding the Congressional intent as to the application of the assets of the estates to 211 claims. It was the Congressional intent that the loan funds were to be used in conjunction with the assets of the estates to meet 211 claims, and not in lieu of the assets of the estates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">Several of the reorganization courts, however, have made a different interpretation of the act. The courts have been reluctant to use assets of the estate, except current accounts receivable, to pay these claims. In addition, the court has been unclear as to what specific claims could be paid with 211(h) funds. In some cases, unfortunately, the courts have held that available estate funds should be applied to the payment of obligations which are not eligible for 211(h) funding. The end result of these interpretations prevents USRA from releasing any funds to ConRail and the other acquiring carriers to pay these claims. We have, therefore, amended 211(h)(2) to make our original intent clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\"><em>(Reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 5857-58)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">We must add, however, that \u00a7 203(b)(2) of RTIA also provided a limiting prospective effect of the amendment, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak1\">Nothing in this paragraph [\u00a7 211(h)(2)] shall be construed to affect any payment made prior to such date of enactment [October 19, 1976] with respect to obligations other than those identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">Thus it is clear from the statutory language of \u00a7 211(h)(2) as amended and from the legislative history of RTIA, that the \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d identified pursuant to \u00a7 211(h)(3), after the enactment of the October 1976 amendments of RTIA, must be utilized first in payment of the pre-conveyance obligations enumerated in \u00a7 211(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">The Reorganization Court ruled in Paragraph 8 of its Order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-14\">No obligation of EL within the meaning of Section 303(b)(3) of RRRA exists on and after the date of conveyance for the principal of obligations in respect of railroad rolling stock and no obligation of EL for the interest on such obligations exists on and after the date of conveyance except as provided in said Section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">The \u201cexception\u201d language in \u00a7 303(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Rail Act as amended, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 743(b)(3)(A)(i), provided in part that the \u201cassignor\u201d (EL) shall remain liable \u201cfor any charges or obligations which accrued\u201d prior to the date of conveyance of rail properties to Conrail. The Reorganization Court held that the principal payments on the equipment obligations (railroad rolling stock obligations were not encompassed by the \u201cexception\u201d language of the statute because principal does not \u201caccrue\u201d and therefore, when EL conveyed its rail properties including its rolling stock to Conrail, the estate was relieved of making principal payments on this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">Apparently the parties do not dispute that the interest payments on the equipment obligations which \u201caccrued\u201d prior to the date of conveyance are still owed by EL.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-17\">Conrail and USRA challenge the above ruling of the Reorganization Court on three grounds. First, Conrail and USRA argue that the record on this issue was not sufficiently developed for the Reorganization</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Court to make an informed decision. Second, Conrail and USRA argue that the language of \u00a7 303(b)(3)(A)(i) does not differentiate between principal and interest accrued prior to conveyance, but rather the statute provides that when Conrail assumes the pre-conveyance obligations of EL under the equipment obligations, it \u201cshall have a claim to direct reimbursement, as a current expense of administration, from such assignor [EL], together with interest on the amount so paid.\u201d Third, Conrail and USRA contend that the Special Court pursuant to \u00a7 209(e)(2) of the Rail Act as amended, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 719(e)(2), has original and exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the equipment obligations issue because this issue is encompassed within the Special Court\u2019s conveyance order which conveyed EL\u2019s rail properties to Conrail under \u00a7 303 of the Rail Act as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The EL Trustees on the other hand, maintain that the Reorganization Court\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201caccrue\u201d under \u00a7 303(b)(3)(A)(i) was correct. The EL Trustees also assert that the Reorganization Court properly assumed jurisdiction over the subject matter of equipment obligations because EL never sought relief on this matter before the Special Court, and because neither the jurisdiction of the Special Court nor \u00a7 209 precludes the Reorganization Court from interpreting \u00a7 303(b)(3)(A)(i) in a proceeding initiated by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We need not pass on the question of whether the issue of equipment obligations was sufficiently developed in the Reorganization Court nor on the meaning of the word \u201caccrue\u201d under \u00a7 303(b)(3)(A)(i) because we hold that the issue of liability for principal and interest payments on equipment obligations is within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 added \u00a7 209(e) to the Rail Act. Senate Report No. 94 \u2014 499, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 84 (1976), <em>(Reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 99) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">The amendment which adds subsection (e)(2) to Section 209 clarifies the post-conveyance jurisdiction of the Special Court, and makes it clear that the Special Court would have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes concerning the meaning and implementation of its transfer and conveyance orders under Section 303(b) of the Rail Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Section 209(e)(2) of the Rail Act as amended, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-12\">The original and exclusive jurisdiction of the special court shall include any action, whether filed by any interested person or initiated by the special court itself, to <em>interpret, alter, amend, modify, </em>or <em>implement </em>any of the orders entered by such court pursuant to section 743(b) [\u00a7 303(b)] of this title in order to effect the purposes of this chapter or the goals of the final system plan, [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Section 743(b) [\u00a7 303(b)] of the Rail Act as amended, generally provides for the conveyance of rail properties of the railroads in reorganization to Conrail \u201cor any subsidiary thereof, the respective profitable railroads operating in the region, States, and responsible persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">On March 25,1976 the Special Court pursuant to \u00a7 209(e)(2) entered an order directing the EL Trustees to execute documents conveying EL\u2019s rail properties to Conrail. There is no dispute in this case that this conveyance order included EL\u2019s railroad rolling stock at issue herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">On March 31, 1976, six days after the Special Court\u2019s conveyance order, the Reorganization Court in Paragraph 8 of Order No. 506 made its ruling on the railroad rolling stock at issue herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">There can be little dispute that Order No. 506 of the Reorganization Court effectively \u201cinterpreted\u201d the Special Court\u2019s conveyance order because the conveyance order expressly transferred EL\u2019s railroad rolling stock to Conrail, and Order No. 506 possibly \u201caltered,\u201d \u201camended,\u201d or \u201cmodified\u201d the conveyance order as well. Such action by the Reorganization Court is inconsistent with the Congressional mandate conferring original and exclusive jurisdiction on the Special Court to \u201cinterpret, alter, amend, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>modify\u201d its own order. It opens the door to non-uniform conveyance orders which is precisely the opposite of the intent of Congress. <em>Cf. Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>423 F.Supp. 941, 945-17 (Sp.Ct. RRRA 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1095, 97 S.Ct. 1111, 51 L.Ed.2d 542 (1977). \u201cWere we to view the Act differently, serious impediments would exist impairing the effective implementation of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We therefore hold that the Reorganization Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to pass upon the equipment obligation issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Furthermore, our results are not changed by the facts that neither party sought \u201crelief\u201d on the equipment obligation issue before the Special Court and that USRA, one of the appellants, initiated these proceedings before the Reorganization Court, for the reason that it is well settled that parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a court by their conduct or consent. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Maurer, </em>293 U.S. 237, 55 S.Ct. 162, 79 L.Ed. 338 (1934), and <em>Jackson v. Ashton, </em>33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 148, 8 L.Ed. 898 (1834).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Pursuant to the \u00a7 211(h)(2) Agency Agreement incorporated into Order No. 506 of the Reorganization Court, procedures and policies were described which were \u201cused to segregate the transactions related to operations between pre- and post-conveyance for processing under the agency agreement.\u201d These procedures were called \u201ccutoff procedures.\u201d One such cut-off procedure concerned \u201cinventory of material and supplies\u201d which covered EL\u2019s physical inventory. The Reorganization Court held that the EL Trustees would \u201cnot be responsible for payment of amounts recorded as material not paid for.\u201d In other words, Conrail was made liable pursuant to the Agency Agreement to pay for EL\u2019s inventory received but not paid for prior to conveyance of EL\u2019s rail properties to Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Conrail and USRA contend, however, that Conrail has already paid for this inventory when it was conveyed to Conrail under the Special Court\u2019s conveyance order of March 25, 1976 \u201cfree and clear of all liens and encumbrances in exchange for securities of Conrail and certificates of value as required by the Rail Act.\u201d Conrail and USRA argue that the EL estate seeks \u201ca result contrary to the Final System Plan [FSP], <em>i. e., </em>to place inventories in a special category outside the conveyance process and to seek what amounts to payments from Conrail in cash,\u201d and thereby \u201cretroactively alter the designation of the FSP and the resulting conveyance.\u201d Conrail and USRA state that the EL Trustees may appear before the Special Court at the valuation proceedings to prove the dollar value of the inventories conveyed. Conrail and USRA also maintain that any interpretation of the Special Court\u2019s conveyance order of March 25, 1976 is within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Court pursuant to \u00a7 209(e)(2), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 719(e)(2), and to the extent that part of Order No. 506 of the Reorganization Court concerning EL\u2019s physical inventory intrudes upon the Special Court\u2019s conveyance order, the finding of the Reorganization Court was beyond its subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The EL Trustees on the other hand, assert that Order No. 506 merely provides that Conrail pay for the inventory obligations for which it is receiving the benefit. The EL Trustees argue that the inventory received prior to conveyance but for which the supplier has not been paid (the \u201ccutoff\u201d situation) is not covered by the Final System Plan. The EL Trustees also maintain that the Reorganization Court at the request of Conrail, properly passed upon this cut-off issue as part of the Agency Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The Final System Plan designated that much of EL\u2019s inventories were to be transferred to Conrail. <em>See </em>Vol. I FSP at 251-52. The Conference Report on the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 amending the Rail Act, also spoke of transferring the inventory of the reorganization railroads under the Final System Plan and of the problem of computing inventory quantities more than six months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>before transfer. Senate Conference Report No. 94-595, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 206-07 (1976), <em>(Reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 221-22), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-4\"><em>It seems clear that current inventories of rail properties must be transferred in their entirety, </em>except as the Association may otherwise consent. Figures of quantity given in the final system plan for such inventories 6 to 8 months before anticipated transfer must of necessity be approximations only, particularly when the Association is not in a position to control either the rate of consumption or the rate of replacement. The dollar values given in the plan cannot be reasonably read to impose a limit on the amount of inventory of rail properties designated for transfer. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adt-dedup-0\">Therefore, the inventories involved herein clearly are encompassed within the Final System Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">As already noted, on March 25, 1976 the Special Court pursuant to the Rail Act, entered a conveyance order effectuating the goals of the Final System Plan in which the EL Trustees executed documents conveying EL\u2019s rail properties to Conrail, including inventories of the EL estate, in exchange for \u201cthe stock and other securities of the Corporation and certificates of value issued by the Association,\u201d \u00a7 303(a)(1), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 743(a)(1). As we held with respect to the equipment obligation issue, <em>supra, </em>so in like manner that part of Order No. 506 of the Reorganization Court concerning the physical inventories which EL received but did not pay for prior to conveyance of the rail properties to Conrail, interprets, alters, amends and/or modifies the conveyance order of the Special Court. Congress has reposed this judicial function to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Court. The reason for deference to the Special Court\u2019s jurisdiction is all the more compelling because the spectre of potential double liability against Conrail exists within the Reorganization Court\u2019s order, once by the \u201cstock and other securities\u201d payments, and again by the Reorganization Court\u2019s order itself. We hold therefore that the Reorganization Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to pass upon the inventory obligation issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">We reserve for future consideration and determination the issue concerning liability for vacation pay which issue is currently the subject of settlement negotiations among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">We affirm with respect to the escrow fund issue set forth herein in Part I. Furthermore, to the extent such determination has any effect after the enactment of the RTIA, we reverse with respect to the Reorganization Court\u2019s determination that \u201ccash and other current assets\u201d must be applied first to non-\u00a7 211(h)(1) obligations, the discussion of which issue is set forth in Part II. We also reverse with respect to the railroad rolling stock and inventory issues for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which issues are set forth in Parts III and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Accordingly, this case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Each party to pay own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-13\">.
