He contends that he was denied a fair trial because he was forced to stand trial before a jury in clothing which was furnished him by the United States Bureau of Prisons. Appellant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence upon which his conviction is based. In affirming his conviction we discuss only his fair trial argument, as the sufficiency of evidence challenge is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-29\">Throughout his one-day trial appellant wore an ordinary khaki shirt and trousers provided by the Bureau. Prior to trial he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>had filed a motion for the production and return of the civilian clothing he was wearing at the time of his arrest, but the motion was denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the day of trial, before the jury voir dire commenced and out of the jury\u2019s presence, appellant objected to being tried in what he considered \u201cJailhouse clothes.\u201d The court closely examined appellant\u2019s clothing while engaging him in. a discussion about his objection. The discussion was concluded when the court found that the appellant projected a neat and clean appearance which gave no indication that he was in confinement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>For purposes of this appeal neither appellant\u2019s trial clothing nor the civilian clothing he had requested were made a part of the record. When, following oral argument, we requested counsel to incorporate the clothing in the record, the Bureau of Prisons was unable to produce it. However, counsel have produced a set of khakis which they agree are substantially similar to the clothes worn at trial. We have examined the clothing and find, as did the court below, that it bears no characteristics which distinguish it as prison garb.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component of our system of criminal justice. <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976), <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 15 S.Ct. 394, 39 L.Ed. 481 (1895). Because of this presumption \u201c[n]o insinuations, indications or implications suggesting guilt should be displayed before the jury, other than admissible evidence and permissible argument.\u201d <em>Brooks v. State of Texas, </em>381 F.2d 619, 624 (5th Cir. 1967). In safeguarding the presumption of innocence we have held that trying an accused in his prison clothing infringed this fundamental right. <em>E. g., Boswell v. State of Alabama, </em>537 F.2d 100 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Hernandez v. Beto, </em>443 F.2d 634 (5th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 897,92 S.Ct. 201, 30 L.Ed.2d 174 (1971). Because our concern in prison garb cases is with the impairment of the presumption of innocence and not with a defendant\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to be tried in civilian clothing of his own choosing, <em>see United States v. Casey, </em>540 F.2d 811 (5th Cir. 1976), we must determine, on a case by case basis, whether a given set of prison clothing improperly projects an implication of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-30\">In <em>Hernandez, </em>the defendant was tried in clothing that had \u201cHarris County Jail\u201d conspicuously stamped all over it. It was the appearance of these words which led the court to find that an indication of guilt was improperly presented to the jury, not the clothing per se. In <em>United States v. Fideler, </em>457 F.2d 921 (5th Cir. 1972), the court distinguished the <em>Hernandez </em>case, saying that \u201c. . . references in <em>Hernandez </em>to prison \u2018clothing\u2019 or \u2018garb\u2019 clearly mean an <em>identifiable prison uniform . </em>.\u201d <em>Fideler </em>at 922 (emphasis added). Thus, the fact that the defendant was tried in clothing that he wore while in the prison was not deemed prejudicial absent characteristics clearly identifying the person wearing the clothing as a prisoner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Casey, </em>the court distinguished the prison clothes cases by saying that no constitutional violation occurs so long as the clothing does not badge the defendant as a criminal in the jury\u2019s eyes. It is the extent to which the defendant\u2019s clothing is communicative of his status as a prisoner (and inferentially a criminal) which determines whether or not he was denied a fair trial. <em>See also, </em>ABA Standards, Trial by Jury, \u00a7 4.1(b), p. 93 (App. Draft 1968), wherein the committee states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">This standard is intended to prevent the appearance of a defendant or witness in garments which in effect are a \u201cbrand of incarceration.\u201d . . . The person may appear in unmarked garments supplied by the custodial authorities</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We conclude that the plain khaki clothing worn by the appellant did not mark him as a prisoner in this case. Accordingly, he was not denied a fair trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-5\">. There were no reasons given by the trial court for denying this motion. The request for the clothing was made in a multi-faceted discovery motion in which appellant sought the production of evidence claimed to be material and relevant to the preparation of his defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">. The colloquy between the court and appellant was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">Counsel, is it not a fact that this khaki uniform that you have reference to is nothing but an ordinary pair of khaki pants with no identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\n<em>MR.

MOORE:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-18\">Arrows or wither (sic) it is a zig-zag. Looks like marks but the shirt doesn\u2019t have any markings on it at all, just looks like zig-zags on the seam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-19\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-20\">All right, you mean threads on the seam? <em>MR. MOORE :</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-21\">Judge, it looks like a mark or some type of markers, but it doesn\u2019t read any particular institution on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-22\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-23\">Other than that, they are what we usually see and refer to as a pair of khaki trousers. <em>MR.

We will proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-27\">\n<em>MR.

It is on one leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-29\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-30\">All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-31\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-32\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-33\">Let the defendant step up here, please. I want the record \u2014 no, just stand right out there. I can see you, Mr. Dawson, from here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-35\">I make these comments for the record in view of the fact that your attorney had made objection earlier, evidently at your behest, that you not be placed on trial attired as you are. I want the record to show that I have observed your clothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-36\">You are dressed in a pair of clean khaki pants, are you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-37\">\n<em>THE DEFENDANT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-38\">Relatively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-39\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-40\">They are relatively clean, are they not, and you are dressed in a sort of tan shirt, are you not, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-41\">\n<em>THE DEFENDANT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-42\">Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-43\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-44\">And it is clean, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-45\">\n<em>THE DEFENDANT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-46\">It\u2019s got a lot of paint on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-47\">\n<em>THE COURT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-48\">Paint?

We note in passing that a district court in our circuit has previously commented on the resemblance between khaki attire and prison uniforms, although the precise question of the propriety of trying an accused in khaki clothing was not presented. In <em>Dennis </em>v. Dees, 278 F.Supp. 354 (E.D.La.1968), <em>disapproved on other grounds, United States v. Henderson, </em>472 F.2d 556 (5th Cir. 1973), the court commented on the neutral image projected by khaki dress saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-19\">\u201cWhen this particular petitioner was presented here for his habeas corpus hearing, he was, as most others have been, dressed in khaki pants and shirt, with no indication that he was necessarily wearing a prison uniform.\u201d <em>Dennis </em>at 359.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">We also note that <em>Dennis </em>was cited by the Supreme Court in <em>Estelle v.
