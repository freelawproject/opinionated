Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b823-16\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">On July 31,1974, Zondel Katz, an individual, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, styled \u201cZondel Katz d/b/a Zondel Gardner, a General Partnership.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gulf National Bank (Bank), claiming to. be a secured creditor, filed a reclamation petition in which it asserted a right to the bankrupt\u2019s inventory as well as to any of the bankrupt\u2019s accounts. The bankruptcy judge denied the petition and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">The Trustee\u2019s first, and most general contention, is that under Mississippi law a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statement which names a partnership as the debtor is insufficient to create a perfected security interest. In particular, the issue is whether the financing statement complied with \u00a7 9-402(1) of the UCC (Mississippi Code Ann. \u00a7 75-9-402(1) (1972)), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-19\">A financing statement is sufficient if it is signed by the debtor and the secured party, gives an address of the secured party from which information concerning the security interest may be obtained, gives a mailing address of the debtor and contains a statement indicating the types, or describing the items, of collateral.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-20\">The issue arises because the financing statement was signed \u201cZONDEL GARDNER, by Zondel Katz, Partner.\u201d In the space labeled \u201cDebtor\u201d the Bank entered \u201cZONDEL GARDNER, A PARTNERSHIP.\u201d The Trustee argues that such a financing statement is so misleading that it cannot create a perfected security interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The Trustee\u2019s premise is that anyone looking for a security interest filed against Zon-del Katz would look under the letter \u201cK\u201d in the appropriate files and find nothing because this statement was filed under the letter \u201cZ.\u201d Thus, the Trustee would require creditors of partnerships to file financing statements under the name of each partner. To buttress his argument, the Trustee points to Mississippi cases which hold that a partnership is not a separate legal entity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Assuming that was the law in Mississippi for most purposes, it was changed for purposes of this case by Mississippi\u2019s adoption of the UCC. Under the UCC, a partnership is a legal entity. <em>See Loucks v. Albuquerque National Bank, </em>76 N.M. 735, 418 P.2d 191, 196 (1966). Moreover, under the UCC a partnership may be a debtor. Section 9-105(l)(d) defines a debtor as \u201cthe person who owes payment or other performance of the obligation secured.\u201d Section 1-201(30) defines \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201can individual or an organization.\u201d And \u00a7 1-201(28) defines \u201corganization\u201d to include a partnership. <em>See In re Lockwood, </em>16 UCC Reporting Service 195, 203-04 (D.Conn.1974); <em>In re Humphrey, </em>12 UCC Reporting Service 986, 989 (E.D.Tenn. 1973); <em>In re Holmes, </em>9 UCC Reporting Service 1160, 1162 (W.D.Mich.1971); <em>In re Uptown Variety, </em>6 UCC Reporting Service 221, 227 (D.Ore.1969). Since a partnership may be a debtor under the UCC, and since Katz signed the financing statement in his capacity as a partner, the Bank fulfilled the requisites of \u00a7 9-402 when it filed the financing statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The cases that the Trustee cites in support of his position are all cases involving a trade name. In those cases an entity had chosen to operate under another name. But only the original entity is the true debtor. Thus, courts have held that filing under a fictitious or trade name rather than under the actual name of the debtor may be misleading to other creditors who might search the records. In the case of a partnership, however, the UCC permits the partnership to establish its status as a separate entity and to create debts of its own. To require filing as to those debts other than under the name of the partnership would be misleading since subsequent creditors of the partnership could not discover claims against the assets of the partnership.\u2019 Furthermore, to require creditors of partnerships to file financing statements under the names of each partner would overly burden the filing system. <em>See In re Lockwood, supra; In re Humphrey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">The Bank complied with \u00a7 9-402(1) in recording the name of the debtor. Since the Bank also listed accounts as one type of collateral, its security interest in the bankrupt\u2019s accounts was perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">The Bank, however, also claims a security interest in the bankrupt\u2019s inventory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The second issue before this court then is whether the description of the collateral in the financing statement was sufficient to perfect a security interest in the inventory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 9-402(1) provides that the financing statement is sufficient if it \u201ccontains a statement indicating the types, or describing the items, of collateral.\u201d In the financing statement filed by the Bank the collateral covered was described as \u201call accounts and contracts owned by the Debtor or arising from the sale of inventory or performance.\u201d On the security agreement itself the Bank had checked the appropriate boxes to acquire a security interest in inventory as well as contract rights and accounts. Nevertheless, the Bank could perfect a security interest only in those types of collateral listed on the financing statement. See <em>In re Levine, </em>6 UCC Reporting Service 238, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>240-41, 244 (D.Conn.1969). Neither \u201caccounts\u201d nor \u201ccontracts\u201d (or \u201ccontract rights\u201d in UCC terminology) includes inventory. Section 9-106 of the UCC defines \u201caccount\u201d as \u201cany right to payment for goods sold or leased or for services rendered which is not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper.\u201d The same section of the UCC defined \u201ccontract right\u201d as \u201cany right to payment under a contract not yet earned by performance and not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That neither term includes inventory is apparent from the inclusion of inventory within the general category of \u201cgoods\u201d in \u00a7 9-109. \u201cGoods\u201d is defined in \u00a7 9-105(l)(f) as including \u201call things which are movable at the time the security interest attaches or which are fixtures\u201d and excluding \u201caccounts . . . contract rights and other things in action.\u201d In short, inventory is tangible collateral while accounts are intangible. <em>See </em>UCC \u00a7 9-105, Official Comment 3. Thus, when the Bank listed the types of collateral on the financing statement, it did not include inventory. A subsequent potential secured party who looked at the financing statement could reasonably have concluded that the Bank was financing accounts receivable and that the inventory was unencumbered. The financing statement would not have alerted him to the need for additional inquiry. The Bank\u2019s security interest in inventory was therefore unperfeeted.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART and IN PART REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-13\">. The partnership name had apparently been derived by combining the first name of the bankrupt with the surname of his partner, Theodore Gardner. On September 12, 1974, Mr. Gardner voluntarily entered his appearance in the bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-14\">. A recent amendment to the Mississippi UCC will resolve the difficulty presented in this case for the future. The new \u00a7 75-9-402(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-21\">A financing statement sufficiently shows the name of the debtor if it gives the individual, <em>partnership </em>or corporate name of the debtor, whether or not it adds other trade names or the names of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-22\">Advance Sheet General Acts, No. 8 (1977) (emphasis added). Mississippi has also adopted the Uniform Partnership Law. Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 79-12-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. <em>E. g., Scott Company of California v. Enco Construction Co., </em>264 So.2d 409, 411 (Miss. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\">. By stipulation the parties have agreed to sell the inventory. Our conclusion is intended to affect only the disposition of the proceeds from that sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b824-16\">. Because the district judge agreed with the first contention of the Trustee, he did not reach the issue of adequacy of description of the collateral. This presents solely a question of law as to which fact determinations are not prerequisite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">. By adopting the 1972 amendments to the UCC, Mississippi has eliminated the term \u201ccontract right.\u201d The single term \u201caccount\u201d is now used instead.
