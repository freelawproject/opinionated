BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"ArRJ\">[1] Appellant, Adiba Mahroom, an applicant for federal employment, brought suit against the commandant of the Defense Language Institute (DLI) at Monte-rey, California, and the Secretary of the Army, principally under Title VII of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c)], for employment discrimination upon the basis of sex and national origin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her complaint, she demanded a declaratory judgment, injunc-tive relief concerning such alleged discrimination, damages (including lost wages), cost of suit, and attorneys\u2019 fees. After providing counsel an opportunity to be heard, the district court denied appellant\u2019s motion for leave to amend her complaint and granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, dismissing the action. We affirm the denial of the motion for leave to amend, but we reverse and remand the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-16\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"amz-dedup-0\">\n<em>The 1971 Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-17\">,Mahroom, a female naturalized citizen of Iraqi descent, has twice been employed at the DLI in temporary positions as a training instructor in Arabic. She has received advanced degrees in education and was considered to be a good teacher by her supervisor at DLL</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-18\">In 1971, the DLI announced that teaching positions were open in the Arabic Department, and instructors were to be selected from highly-qualified applicants with Egyptian, Syrian or Iraqi background, in that order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mahroom applied for one of the positions; however, she did not obtain an interview or a position. As she failed to obtain employment, she filed a formal complaint on October 28,1971, alleging discrimination based upon sex and national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-19\">After an unsuccessful attempt at an informal resolution of her grievance, the complaint was forwarded to the U. S. Army Civilian Appellate Review Office. An investigator was assigned to undertake a detailed investigation of the facts. After carefully exploring the matter, the inspector reported that student demand justified establishment of selection preferences for persons proficient in the Egyptian and Syrian dialects, and recommended, therefore, a finding of no discrimination. On December 29,1971, the recommendation was approved by the Civilian Personnel Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Subsequently, Mahroom requested a hearing before an Appeals Examiner assigned to the agency by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), and a hearing was conducted on March 14-15, 1972. On June 7, 1972, the Appeals Examiner issued his report, concluding that appellant had not been the victim of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">On October 27, 1972, the Army\u2019s Director of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) accepted the finding of no discrimination. This, the final decision, was appealed to CSC\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review (BAR). On March 22, 1973, the BAR affirmed the agency decision. However, the BAR did not send Mahroom a \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Appellant thereafter sought help from the ACLU and from the San Francisco Lawyer\u2019s Committee for Urban Affairs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ACLU advised her that she had 90 days after the BAR\u2019s decision was issued in which to bring a civil suit, while the Lawyer\u2019s Committee informed her that the time for court action expired 30 days after the final decision. Upon receiving this information, appellant wrote to the BAR, asking why she was not advised of her right to sue. On July 5,1973, the CSC wrote back to her, stating that under its interpretation the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (which included 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16) was not retroactive and that, therefore, she had no right to notification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">Appellant went on to request reconsideration of the final agency decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Reasoning that she had not established a proper basis on which to reopen the prior decision, the BAR rejected the request on November 7, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">\n<em>The 1973 Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">Another teaching position in the Arabic Department at DLI opened up in early 1973. Again, appellant applied for the position and was not selected. As a result, a second complaint, alleging discrimination based on sex and national origin, was filed on July 27, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\">On August 6, 1973, the EEO officer for DLI rejected the complaint in accordance with 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.215<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the reason that it set forth identical matters contained in the previous complaint. This decision was appealed, and on November 19, 1973, the BAR affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-16\">This time appellant was given her \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter. In this letter of final action the BAR stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-17\">\u201cCivil Service Commission Regulations provide that the Board\u2019s decision is final and that there is no further right of administrative appeal. However, if the complainant is not satisfied with the decision, she is authorized by section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended on March 24, 1972 to file a civil action in an appropriate U. S. District Court within thirty (30) calendar days of her receipt of this decision.\u201d (Exhibit 1, p. 4)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-18\">Mahroom received notice of this final action on November 21, 1973. Within the requisite thirty days, she instituted this action in the district court, filing her com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>plaint on December 20, 1973. On April 24, 1975, the appellees moved to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment. As she substituted counsel on May 29,1975, the scheduled hearing on the motion was postponed. On June 23,1975, she filed a memorandum in opposition to appellees\u2019 motion and a motion for leave to amend the complaint by adding a cause of action based on the 1971 administrative complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">On August 1, 1975, both motions were heard. The motion to amend was denied, and the motion for summary judgment was granted. It is from these decisions that this appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">\n<em>The Motion for Leave to Amend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">As discussed above, when the Civil Service Commission's Board of Appeals and Review finally denied Mahroom\u2019s claim of discrimination, they did not provide her with her statutory notice of right to sue or what is commonly referred to as the \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">Mahroom\u2019s claim began in 1971. The effective date of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et </em>seq.] is March 24, 1972. Her claim was therefore pending administratively on the effective date of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">Because the Commission interpreted the Act as not retroactive to her 1971 claim, they held that she had no right to notification of her right to bring suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">Our first inquiry is to decide whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Act is retroactive to cases which are pending administratively at the time of the effective date of the Act. Or, in other words, was Mah-room entitled to notice of her right to sue once the administrative agency\u2019s decision to deny her complaint was final?</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">In <em>Koger v. Ball, </em>497 F.2d 702 (4th Cir. 1974), that court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-13\">\u201cWe conclude that Congress, being fully aware of the general rule favoring retrospective application of procedural statutes, intended by enacting \u00a7 717(c) [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c)] to grant employees consent to sue for redress of pending cases of pre-Act discrimination.\u201d (497 F.2d at 708-709)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-16\">And, in <em>Womack v. Lynn, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 504 F.2d 267 (1974) (which adopted the reasoning of the <em>Roger </em>opinion, <em>supra </em>), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-17\">\u201cSection 717(c) is merely a procedural statute that affects the <em>remedies </em>available to federal employees suffering from employment discrimination. Their <em>right </em>to be free of such discrimination has been assured for years. We hold that this remedial statute applies retroactively to proceedings already pending at the time of its effective date, March 24, 1972.\u201d (504 F.2d at 269) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-18\"><em>Womack </em>was followed in <em>Grubbs v. Butz, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. 82, 514 F.2d 1323 (1975). Other cases which follow this reasoning are: <em>Weahkee v. Powell, </em>532 F.2d 727 (10th Cir. 1976) ; <em>Huntley v. Dept. of H.E.W., </em>550 F.2d 290 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Eastland v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>553 F.2d 364, 369 (5th Cir. 1977) ; and <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, </em>507 F.2d 1300 (2nd Cir. 1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>425 U.S. 820, 824 n. 4, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402. (The Supreme Court observing that it had \u201cno occasion to disturb\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s decision on retroactivity). <em>See also Bunch v. United States, </em>548 F.2d 336 (9th Cir. 1977) and <em>Davis v. Valley Dist. Co., </em>522 F.2d 827 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. den., </em>429 U.S. 1090, 97 S.Ct. 1099, 51 L.Ed.2d 535 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-21\">Following this line of authority we hold that the Equal Employment Opportunity Act is retroactive to embrace claims administratively pending on its effective date and is therefore applicable to Mahroom\u2019s 1971 action. Under the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-12 gives the Commission the authority to issue suitable procedural regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act. In exercise of this authority, the Commission promulgated, among others, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.234 and \u00a7 713.282.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.234, at the time in question,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-4\">\u201cThe Board of Appeals and Review shall review the complaint file and all relevant written representations made to the board. . . . The board shall issue a written decision setting forth its reasons for the decision and shall send copies thereof to the complainant, his designated representative, and the agency. . The decision of the board is final, <em>but shall contain a notice of the right to file a civil action in accordance with \u00a7 713.282.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.282 in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-8\">\u201cThe Commission shall notify an employee or applicant of his right to file a civil action, and of the 30-day time limit for filing, in any decision under \u00a7 713.234.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">The thirty-day time limit referred to in these regulations is set out by Congress in section 717(c) of the Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c)] which provides that \u201c[w]ithin thirty days of receipt of notice of final action .. an employee or applicant for employment if aggrieved by the final disposition of his complaint, . . may file a civil action as provided in section 706\u201d [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5].</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">Therefore, under this statute, as interpreted by the agency designated to interpret and enforce it, notice must be given to the employee or applicant that he has the right to bring an action in federal court and that he has thirty days in which to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-12\">This thirty-day time period is jurisdictional. If an aggrieved party does not file his suit within that time limit, the federal courts have no power to entertain the suit. <em>Cleveland v. Douglas Aircraft Co., </em>509 F.2d 1027, 1029 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Wong v. Bon Marche, </em>508 F.2d 1249 (9th Cir. 1975). <em>See also, Brown v. General Services Administration, </em>425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-14\">The question which arises once it has been determined that notice is required is when does the thirty-day period begin to run. In <em>Gates v. Georgia-Pacific Corporation </em>492 F.2d 292, 295 (9th Cir. 1974), we held that \u201cthe 30 day period within which the civil action may be brought commenced when the January 23, 1969, <em>formal notice </em>was received.\u201d (emphasis added) We limited <em>Gates </em>to its facts and left open the specific question of what form of notice would trigger the thirty-day period in other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-15\">The appellee contends that the thirty-day period began to run as soon as Mahroom received notice of the BAR\u2019s final decision, regardless of whether or not she received any \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter. We disagree and hold that the thirty-day time limit does not begin to run until the aggrieved party has received actual formal notification of his statutory right to sue in federal court. By this we mean receipt of the so-called \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-16\">In holding this way, we follow such authority as <em>Coles v. Penny, </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 277, 531 F.2d 609 (1976), where the District of Columbia Circuit held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-17\">\u201c . . . the thirty-day period within which a civil action may be filed did not begin to run until July 18,1973 \u2014 the first time at which appellant was notified [by way of a \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter] that he had a right to bring a civil action within thirty days.\u201d (531 F.2d at 617)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-19\">And, in <em>Garner v. E. I. DuPont DeNemours &amp; Co., </em>538 F.2d 611 (4th Cir. 1976), that court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-20\">\u201cIn conclusion, we hold that, for reasons substantially similar to those given by Judge McGowan in <em>Coles, </em>it was within the regulatory power of the EEOC in interpreting \u00a7 706(f)(1) of Title VII to treat only a formal \u2018right to sue\u2019 letter from the EEOC as constituting the requisite statutory \u2018notice\u2019 which started the permissible period for initiating a federal court case under Title VII.\u201d (538 F.2d at 615)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>Other cases which support this result are: <em>Lacy v. Chrysler Corp., </em>533 F.2d 353, <em>en banc, </em>(8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. den., </em>429 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 381, 50 L.Ed.2d 325; <em>Tuft v. McDonnell Douglas, </em>517 F.2d 1301 (8th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. den., </em>423 U.S. 1052, 96 S.Ct. 782, 46 L.Ed.2d 641 (1976); <em>Williams v. Southern U. Gas Co., </em>529 F.2d 483 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. den., </em>429 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 381, 50 L.Ed.2d 325 and <em>Page v. U. S. Industries, </em>556 F.2d 346 (5th Cir. 1977). <em>See also, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 47, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974), and <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 798, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (where the Supreme Court noted that one of the jurisdictional prerequisites to Title VII suits was that the claimant <em>receive </em>and act upon the Commissioner\u2019s statutory notice of the right to sue).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">As we mentioned above, Mahroom did not receive any \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter. What she did receive was a letter from the BAR which denied her claim of employment discrimination and stated that \u201cCivil Service Regulations provide that the decision of the Board is final and that there is no further right of administrative appeal.\u201d (Exhibit 1 at 104)</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Act is a remedial statute to be liberally construed in favor of the victims of discrimination. <em>Davis v. Valley Dist. Co., </em>522 F.2d 827, 832 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>EEOC v. Wah Chang Albany Corp., </em>499 F.2d 187, 189 (9th Cir. 1974). Accordingly, \u201ccourts confronted with procedural ambiguities in the statutory framework have, with virtual unanimity resolved them in favor of the complaining party.\u201d <em>Davis v. Valley Dist. Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., </em>431 F.2d 455, 461 (5th Cir. 1970). The broad structure and purpose of Title VII, as established by Congress, relies upon laymen, operating without legal assistance, to initiate both administrative complaints and lawsuits. Congress did not intend that such laymen, not schooled in the finer points of legal procedure, be presumed to know exactly what procedural step they must next take in order to perfect their claims, especially when they have been conclusively told that they have no further rights or remedies. By holding that Mahroom must be specifically informed in the \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter that she has a right to sue and how much time she has in which to bring the suit, we give effect to the intent and purpose of Congress in enacting Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">In this case, Mahroom was a layman and operated without legal assistance for her 1971 claim. Because the BAR wrote and told her that their decision was final, it is not reasonable or within the policy of Title VII to hold that she should have known that she had only thirty days to institute suit from that time. The reasoning for this was persuasively stated in <em>Coles v. Penny, supra, </em>in a factual situation strikingly similar to the facts of this case. In <em>Coles </em>the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-9\">\u201cThirty days is not a long period in which to expect a <em>pro se </em>complainant to become aware of and exercise his statutory right to sue. Consider the situation in which the appellant found himself in this case. After two years of administrative consideration, his claim was denied by the Board of Appeals and Review. The notice he received \u2014 that \u2018Civil Service Regulations provide that a decision of the Board is final and that there is no further right to administrative appeal\u2019 \u2014 -had a definite ring of finality to it. A trained lawyer might realize that <em>judicial </em>review commences when <em>administrative </em>appeals end, but we do not believe that such a realization is likely to spring forth full blown in the mind of a layman; the notice actually received may rather have stifled any inclination appellant might have had to pursue the matter any further. It may be more than coincidental that appellant filed a timely action regarding his 1972 complaint, as to which he received notice of his right to sue, whereas his failure to bring an action regarding his 1970 complaint followed a less informative and possibly misleading notice.\u201d (531 F.2d at 615) (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>Since Mahroom has <em>never </em>received a \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter on her 1971 action, our next inquiry is whether her right to bring suit can continue indefinitely until the \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter is received. More specifically, the question is whether Mah-room should have been able in 1975, to amend her complaint (filed on her 1973 discrimination action) to include her 1971 action. The situation is this. In 1971 she complained of discrimination. Her claim was denied. She was told the decision was final, but was not told she could sue. She did not sue. In 1973 she again complained of discrimination. Her claim was again denied. She was told the decision was final. However, this time she was told that under the statutes she did have a right to sue within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">Under the facts of this case, we find that the thirty-day time limit to file a federal suit on <em>both </em>her 1971 and 1973 claims began to run when she in fact received the \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter on November 21, 1973, in regard to her 1973 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">We find that if Mahroom would have brought suit on her 1971 action (or alternatively, amended her 1973 complaint to include her 1971 action), within the thirty days following receipt of her \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter on November 21, 1973, the action would have been timely. This is the precise result that the Fourth Circuit arrived at in <em>Coles v. Penny, supra, </em>under that nearly identical factual situation. In that case, the appellant Melvin Coles had filed a 1970 discrimination claim. It was denied and \u201cfinalized\u201d much the same as Mah-room\u2019s claim was. He also was given no notice of right to sue. In 1972 he filed another discrimination claim. This claim was also denied, but he was given the statutory notice of his right to sue. Within thirty days of this \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter he filed a suit on his 1970 claim, as well as a new 1972 claim. The district court found the 1970 claim untimely and granted summary judgment against Coles. The Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding (as quoted, supra) that the thirty-day time limit did not begin to run on the 1970 claim until receipt of the \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter, which involved his later 1972 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">Because of our holding that Mahroom\u2019s right to sue on the 1971 claim was only timely within thirty days of receipt of the November 21, 1973, \u201cRight-to-Sue\u201d letter, her motion to amend the complaint over one year and seven months later, was untimely. The district court properly denied that motion as it was without jurisdiction at that time to hear the 1971 claim. <em>Cleveland v. Douglas Aircraft; Wong v. Bon Marche, </em>and <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1432-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-8\">\n<em>The Motion for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-9\">Under <em>Chandler v. Roudebush, </em>425 U.S. 840, 96 S.Ct. 1949, 48 L.Ed.2d 416 (1976), applicants for federal employment bringing suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) have the same right to a trial <em>de novo </em>as is enjoyed by applicants for employment in the private sector under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-10\">In their memorandum for support of the motion for summary judgment, appellees contended that no trial <em>de novo </em>was required for suits brought under \u00a7 2000e-16. This position, of course, was directly rejected in <em>Chandler. </em>However, <em>Chandler </em>does not require a <em>de novo </em>hearing in every instance; if a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 would be properly disposed of by summary judgment, then it is appropriate for a district court to handle similarly a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-11\">Summary judgment is appropriate only when the movant has proven that there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See </em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). Since the motion for leave to amend was properly denied, the only controversy before the district court concerned the 1973 discrimination action. The 1973 action is allegedly barred under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.215 for setting forth \u201cidentical allegations\u201d as in the 1971 action. It is true that the 1971 and 1973 complaints do set forth the same claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>discrimination, i. e., discrimination on the basis of sex and her Iraqi national origin. Appellees countered these claims by responding each time that priority was given to applicants proficient in the Arabic-Egyptian dialect and that Mahroom was not the victim of any discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">While the complaints do state similar actions, we feel that the 1973 complaint did state a cause of action new and separate from the 1971 complaint because in 1973 she was competing against a different set of applicants with potentially different qualifications than she competed against in 1971. Other facts may also be different. Her not being selected from the 1973 applicants has not yet been considered in the administrative process. We feel that it is totally inappropriate to forever bar an applicant for federal employment from either administrative or judicial consideration of a discrimination charge simply because that individual had claimed similar acts of discrimination at an earlier time and had not prevailed. Mahroom\u2019s 1973 action was not \u201cidentical\u201d to her 1971 action. We do not believe that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.215 was intended to prevent the hearing of discrimination complaints on new causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">Therefore, the stated grounds for the dismissal of her complaint by the CSC were erroneous. The district court, in turn, was in error when it granted summary judgment. The factual allegations raised by appellant had never been heard and such a hearing is required by <em>Chandler v. Roude-bush, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">Therefore, we reverse and remand for a trial <em>de novo </em>in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chandler. </em>We, of course, do not preclude further summary judgment motions, if appropriate. We express no opinion regarding the merits of Mahroom\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-8\">The reply brief of appellant has not been considered. No good cause has been shown for the late filing and the motion to strike the reply brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART. REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">. Appellant also brought suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.

In each Arabic language class at DLI, a specialization in one of these dialects is taught. Appellant is trained solely in the Arabic-Iraqi dialect; however, preference in the selection process was to go to those trained in the Arabic-Egyptian dialect. The stated reasons for this preference were simply that there were more students interested in that dialect and that there was a sufficient supply of instructors trained in the Iraqi dialect to handle the demand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">.
