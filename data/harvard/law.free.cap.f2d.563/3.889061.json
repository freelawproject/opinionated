The first order, said to be in response to certain United Kingdom actions taken against American-owned carriers, required British Airways to file its existing schedules of service to and from the United States by September 28, 1976, and to file proposed schedules for any new or modified service thirty days before making the schedule changes. <em>In re the Schedules of Air VBI Limited, </em>Order 76-9-74, No. 29778 (CAB Sept. 14, 1976). The second order denied a stay of the first, schedule-filing order (except as to Washington-London Concorde service). Order 76-9-161 (Sept. 30, 1976). The third order was issued in response to a letter from President Ford to the CAB, dated October 9, 1976, in which the President stated that, because Britain and the United States had resolved their differences, \u201cprompt rescission of the Board\u2019s [first or schedule-filing] order . would be appropriate and in the interests of our foreign policy.\u201d The CAB then vacated its earlier orders and terminated their effectiveness nunc pro tunc as of October 8, 1976. Order 76-10-110 (Oct. 26, 1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because British Airways had not filed any schedules between September 28 and October 8, 1976, however, the Board indicated in the October 26 order that the airline would be subject to \u201cenforcement liability\u201d for that period. <em>Id. </em>at 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-19\">A schedule-filing order such as the one under review may be required under 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 213.3(c) (1975) when the CAB finds that the government of the holder of a foreign air carrier permit has taken action impairing or limiting an American air carrier\u2019s operating rights in the foreign country. When such an order is entered against a foreign air carrier, the carrier cannot make changes in equipment or in times or frequency of arrival and departure for thirty days, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 213.3(b). The CAB can also issue a schedule-limitation order that limits the number of flights the subject airline can make to or from the United States, with the order expressly subject to \u201cstay or disapproval by the President of the United States within 10 days after adoption .,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 213.3(d). Here an order limiting petitioner\u2019s United States schedules was issued by the CAB on September 29,1976. The October 9 letter of the President to the CAB referred to above was issued in response to this schedule-limitation order and disapproved it within the requisite ten-day period, <em>id. </em>The letter then went on to refer to the schedule-filing order here under review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction to review these orders is premised on 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486. That section makes reviewable in the courts of appeals \u201c[a]ny order . . . issued by the Board . . ., except any order in respect of any foreign air carrier subject to the approval of the President as provided in <em>[id. </em>\u00a7 1461] . \u201d Insofar as here relevant, Section 1461 requires that presidential approval be obtained whenever the CAB desires to amend or otherwise modify a foreign air carrier\u2019s operating permit or certificate. Thus, if the CAB\u2019s schedule-filing directive to British Airways were considered an amendment of the carrier\u2019s permit, advance presidential approval, which was not obtained, would have been required, and this court would be without jurisdiction to review the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">We believe that the orders here involved did not amend British Airways\u2019 permit. In 1970, by an order approved by the President, the Board .amended the permits of 48 foreign carriers, including that of British Airways\u2019 corporate predecessor, to make the permits subject to the provisions of certain regulations adopted on the same date. It was under these regulations, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 213.1-.6 (1975), that the Board issued its schedule-filing directive in the instant case. The directive thus amounted to implementation of a previously approved condition and did not modify British Airways\u2019 permit. An implementation effort of this nature does not require separate presidential approval. <em>Dan-Air Services, Ltd. v. CAB, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 297, 475 F.2d 408, 412 (1973) (per curiam). Therefore this court has jurisdiction to review the orders before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The fact that the CAB did not have to. obtain presidential approval before it ordered British Airways to file schedules, however, does not mean that it was free as a matter of law to ignore the disapproval embodied in the presidential letter of October 9 relative to the schedule-filing order under review, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>The Board recognized this by largely deferring to the President\u2019s wishes and vacating its schedule-filing order nunc pro tunc as of October 8, 1976. But at the same time it insisted that it was acting as \u201can independent agency,\u201d and to show its independence it decided to hold British Airways liable for its failure to file existing schedules in the September 28-October 8 period, though, \u201cto strike a balance,\u201d not for failure to file proposed schedules thirty days in advance, <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>We believe that the Board\u2019s insistence on its independence in this matter represents a misunderstanding of its role with regard to foreign air carriers and of the extent of presidential primacy on issues related to foreign affairs. We accordingly set aside the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">In <em>Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman Steamship Corp., </em>333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948), the Supreme Court discussed the \u201cinver[sion] [of] the usual administrative process\u201d that Congress intended when it made CAB decisions relating to foreign air carriers subject to presidential approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">Instead of acting independently of executive control, the agency is . subordinated to it. Instead of its order serving as a final disposition . . ., its force is exhausted when it serves as a recommendation to the President. . Presidential control is not limited to a negative but is a positive and detailed control over the Board\u2019s decisions, unparalleled in the history of American administrative bodies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 109, 68 S.Ct. at 434.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A necessary implication of the President\u2019s \u201cpositive and detailed control\u201d under the statute, we believe, is the power to disapprove particular actions taken by the Board under broad regulations that the President has previously approved. <em>Cf. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, </em>184 F.2d 66, 71 (2d Cir. 1950) (power of President to withdraw approval), <em>cert. denied, </em>340 U.S. 941, 71 S.Ct. 504, 95 L.Ed. 679 (1951). Were this power lacking, presidential approval of broad regulations would in effect give the CAB carte blanche in an area in which Congress has quite clearly indicated that the President, not the CAB, is supreme. It is in an area of foreign policy, moreover, in which the President\u2019s decisions, to use Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s words for the Supreme Court, \u201care delicate, complex, and involve large elements of prophecy.\u201d 333 U.S. at 111, 68 S.Ct. at 436. In such an area, an agency of the United States Government, even if independent for other purposes, is subordinated to executive control \u201c[ijnstead of acting independently . . .,\u201d 333 U.S. at 109, 68 S.Ct. 431, at least when the Chief Executive has been given positive and detailed control by the Congress. <em>See Chicago &amp; Southern Air </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Lines, Inc. v. Waterman Steamship Corp., supra, </em>333 U.S. at 109-10, 68 S.Ct. at 435 (President is \u201cthe Nation\u2019s organ in foreign affairs\u201d; his powers and those of Congress are \u201cpooled\u201d in this area \u201cto the end that commercial strategic and diplomatic interests of the country may be coordinated and advanced without collision or deadlock between agencies\u201d); <em>In re British Overseas Airways Corp. Permit Amendment, </em>29 C.A.B. 583, 594 (1959) (CAB cannot be equated with U.S. Government with regard to foreign carriers; there is a \u201cdivision of functions,\u201d with the President making the final decision for the Government).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Once it is accepted that the CAB must take the President\u2019s word as supreme in a case of this nature, it follows that the Board\u2019s orders here under review must be set aside. The Board itself recognized that it was not following the President when, in its third order, which vacated the first two but preserved a basis for enforcement liability, it explicitly stated that the Board\u2019s deference to presidential wishes \u201cwill not be unqualified.\u201d Order No. 76-10-110, <em>supra, </em>at 2. The President\u2019s letter to the Board, moreover, although not phrased as a directive, could not be more clear as to the action that the President had \u201cdetermined\u201d to be \u201cappropriate and in the interests of our foreign policy.\u201d <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">That this determination was embodied in a letter issued in response to the Board\u2019s schedule-limitation order of September 29, 1976, reinforces the view that the President was exercising his full prerogative in the area and demonstrates the importance of the schedule-filing order in the overall settlement of the then-current dispute between the United States and Great Britain. The only action required of the President under the regulations was approval or disapproval of the schedule-limitation order; by inclusion of the reference to the schedule-filing order, the President made it clear that he was exercising the full extent of his presidential control. The \u201cprompt rescission\u201d that the President called for is not anywhere suggested to be a partial rescission, and the common meaning of the verb \u201crescind,\u201d at least in law, involves declaring something (usually a contract) abrogated from its inception, so that the parties are restored to the positions they would have occupied had no action been taken initially, <em>see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1471 (4th ed. 1951). Rescission in this sense has been denied British Airways by the CAB\u2019s preservation of a basis for enforcement liability, contrary to the express determination of the President.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">We therefore set aside the Board\u2019s orders. Because we have concluded that the orders improperly ignored a presidential directive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>made in the exercise of his statutory and constitutional powers, we need not reach the other attacks on the orders made by British airways.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Petition for review granted. Orders set aside in accordance with opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\">. Despite the CAB\u2019s vacation of these orders, at least the first of them remains before us because the petition for review as to it was filed prior to the CAB\u2019s vacation order, and the vacation order itself was explicitly made \u201csubject to any necessary approval by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\u201d Order No. 76-10-110, at 4; <em>see id. </em>at n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-21\">. During the pendency of this review proceeding, an administrative enforcement proceeding against British Airways was initiated by the CAB. The enforcement proceeding has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>stayed by agreement of the parties. According to the CAB\u2019s third order, British Airways is to be held liable only for its failure to file existing schedules; no liability for failure to file proposed schedules is contemplated. <em>See id. </em>at 3 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\">.

If there were any doubt as to the President\u2019s intention, it is resolved by tracing the underlying advisory memoranda. At our request the Department of Justice, on behalf of the Counsel to the President, the Department of State, and the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, furnished the court with memoranda pertaining to the draft of the President\u2019s letter of October 9. This material is short and simple. The Department of State wrote the Office of Management and Budget on October 8, 1976. It pointed out that, in view of the satisfactory solution worked out with the British, the basis for the issuance of the schedule-filing order under review was \u201cno longer valid,\u201d and that \u201cwithdrawal of the order has substantive importance, since the requirement . . . significantly reduces the scheduling flexibility of [the British] airlines.\u201d State therefore recommended that the President\u2019s letter \u201cstrongly urge the CAB to withdraw its order 76-9-74 of September 14, 1976.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s \"Memorandum for the President,\u201d also dated October 8, points out that \u201cState . . . recommends that you advise the Board that recission [sic] of its September 14, 1976, order is appropriate and in our foreign policy interests.\u201d It goes on to note: \u201cIn view of the foreign policy issues inherent in this case, the interested executive agencies defer to the recommendations of the Department of State. The National Security Council concurs with the Department of State recommendation.\u201d The final draft of the letter expressly used the term \u201crescission,\u201d <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra, </em>which carries with it, we think a definite retroactive meaning of significance, as discussed in the text. Rather than \u201cstrongly urge\u201d the agency, as State had suggested, which would imply a power in the Board of independent action, the final draft pointedly uses the terminology, \u201cI have . determined,\u201d which is consistent with an exercise of presidential prerogative, not subject to independent action by the agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
