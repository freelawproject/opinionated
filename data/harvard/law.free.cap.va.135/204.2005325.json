But as the excess value of the property was established by the evidence and the requisite notice could not have been otherwise than inferred by the jury from the evidence, and the reference to the property left on the premises might have been treated as surplusage, there was no error in the instruction of which the defendant could complain.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b232-6\">9.

On October 1 or 2, 1920, the plaintiff landlord placed in the hands of an officer a distress warrant against the lessee for the unpaid rent for the months of July, August and September, 1920, which was levied on October 2, 1920, upon two' certain trucks and automobile repair parts then on the said premises and belonging to the lessee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>There is some mention made in the testimony for the defendant lienholder of its having lent the lessee some money prior to the beginning of said tenancy upon the security of a bill of sale of one of these trucks given by the lessee in 1919 before this truck was taken to the said premises, but as the possession of this truck was not taken and held by the defendant lienholder, such possession being retained by the lessee, so that such truck came upon the premises during the tenancy unencumbered, so far as the evidence discloses, by any lien having preference over the landlord\u2019s common law or statutory rights, this circumstance may be disregarded as immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">The lessee arranged with the defendant lienholder to pay off the lien of the distress warrant and also enough additional money to satisfy $700.00 overdraft owing by lessee to such lienholder, upon the security of the trucks and automobile parts which the distress warrant had been levied upon as aforesaid. Accordingly, on October 5, 1920, the defendant lienholder lent the lessee $1,480.00, took his note therefor, secured by a bill of sale of one of the said trucks and- of said automobile parts, executed that day, and thereafter, on the same day, removed both of said trucks and said automobile parts from the said premises, and- on the same day stored the two trucks with a storage company, taking its negotiable receipts therefor, by which the storage company agreed to deliver the same to the order of the defendant lienholder, or bearer, upon surrender of the receipts, respectively, on payment of certain stipulated charges, and on October 18, 1920, stored the automobile parts with the same storage company taking a like receipt therefor, containing the same agreement; and the defendant lien creditor on October 5, 1920, prior to removing the property from said prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ises, paid the officer $780.00, the amount of the distress, warrant, being all of the rent in arrear then due the-plaintiff landlord, together with interest and costs;, entered on its books the satisfaction of said $700.00 overdraft indebtedness of the lessee; and, thereafter,, held the said bill of sale of that date, of the aforesaid, truck covered thereby and the said 1919 bill of sale covering the other truck, as aforesaid, and the storage-company receipts, after obtaining them, all as - collateral security for said loan of $1,480.00 to the lessee; and still held such collateral security at the time the-instant action was instituted, which was on March 8, 1921, the trucks and automobile parts having remained in storage with said storage company until the action was instituted; and, indeed, the trucks remained in such storage until May 4, 1921, which was after the. verdict (which was returned on April 21, 1921), and but a short time before the judgment under review was-entered (which was on May 17, 1921). On May 4, 1921, the defendant lienholder assigned the storage-company receipts for said trucks to a third party. It. does not appear from the record whether the storage company receipt for the automobile parts has ever been assigned, or that the parts have ever been removed from said storage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\">The evidence, without conflict, shows that the value of the property removed from the premises as aforesaid exceeded the $750.00, the amount of the one year\u2019s-rent which thereafter became due, for the recovery of which the action was brought, and that the same was-not secured to the plaintiff landlord by the defendantlienholder before the property was so removed, and that this rent still remained wholly unpaid at the time, the judgment under review was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">There was other evidence concerning the issuance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>levy of a distress warrant on December 6, 1920, on certain property in tbe possession of tbe lessee on said premises for the rent for October and November, 1920, which proved to be wholly unavailing because the lessee during the month of December was adjudged a bankrupt and most of the property thus levied upon was found not to belong to the lessee, so that the amount realized by the trustee and turned over to the referee in bankruptcy was only a trifling sum, which was consumed in costs in the bankruptcy proceedings, leaving nothing for the landlord or for any of the creditors of the lessee; and this and other evidence tended to show that at the time of said removal of said property from the premises on October 5th, sufficient property liable for the rent was not left on the premises to satisfy the aforesaid balance of the year\u2019s rent which was not then in arrear but was to and did thereafter become due.

Neither this nor the preceding section shall affect any lien for taxes, levies, or militia fines. (Code 1887, section 2792).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">This statute as first enacted in Virginia appears in 1 Revised Code 1919, section 7, page 448; by its terms it was applicable to persons taking any goods or chattels lying or being on leased premises \u201cby virtue of any writ of execution (or) on any pretence whatsoever\u201d (the word \u201cor\u201d being evidently a printer\u2019s error and no part of the statute), and provided that such goods or chattels should not be so taken \u201cunless the party so taking the same, shall, before removal of the goods from off such premises, pay or tender to the landlord or lessor thereof or his agent, all the money or tobacco due, for the rent of the said premises, at the time of taking such goods or chattels in execution.\u201d On the margin we find this note of the revisors of such Code: \u201cGoods upon leasehold lands not to be taken in execution until rent in arrear be paid. 8 Anne, chap. 14, sec. 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The statute of 8 Anne, chapter 14, section 1, so far as material, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\u201cFor the more easy and effectual recovery of rents reserved on leases * * ; * * * no goods or chattels whatsoever lying or being in or upon any \u2018leased premises\u2019 shall be liable to be taken by virtue of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u2022execution, on any pretence whatsoever, unless' the party at whose suit the said execution is sued out shall before the removal of such goods from off the said premises, by virtue of such execution or extent, pay to the landlord of the said premises or his bailiff, all such sum or sums of money as are or shall be due for rent for the said premises at the time of the taking such goods or chattels by virtue of such execution; provided the said arrears of rent do not amount to more than one year\u2019s rent; and in \u2022case the said arrears shall exceed one year\u2019s rent, then the said party, at whose suit such execution is sued out, paying the said landlord or his bailiff one year\u2019s rent, may proceed to execute his judgment as he might have \u2022done before the making of this act; and the sheriff or \u2022other officer is hereby empowered and required to levy and pay to the plaintiff as well the money so paid for xent as the execution money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The statute, as first enacted in Virginia, was subsequently limited in its scope so as to apply to.one year\u2019s rent only, but was made to apply to the portion of such rent to become due, as well as to that in arrears; and the statute was enlarged in its scope from time to time so as to embrace other taking and removal of \u2022goods than under execution, until it finally attained the form in which we find it in section 5524 of the present Code, aforesaid; but the object of the statute and the nature of the duty imposed by it on those violating its xequirements, who are mentioned in it, are the same as \u25a0of the said statute of 8 Anne; and hence the settled construction of the latter statute by the English decisions, with respect to the liability imposed by it on the persons violating its requirements, must be taken to have been adopted in this State when the statute was first enacted and subsequently amended here from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><bracketnum>[3-5]</bracketnum> It is true, as urged in behalf of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>lienholder in the instant ease, that, accurately speaking, neither section 5524 nor section 5523 of the present Code (which were sections 2792 and 2791 of the Code of 1887) gives the landlord any lien for rent (Burks\u2019 Pl. &amp; Pr. [1st. ed.], sec. 13, pp. 12-14); although in some of the cases discussing the subject statutes like section 5524 are referred to as giving the landlord a lien. But it is apparent from the facts of such cases that what is meant thereby is that such statutes give the landlord the right to have the property remain on the premises subject to his inchoate lien unless the terms of the statute permitting removal thereof are complied with. (See <em>Wades </em>v. <em>Figgatt, </em>75 Va. 575; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>45 W. Va. 319, 31 S. E. 998; <em>Burket </em>v. <em>Boude, </em>3 Dana (Ky.) 209. Compare <em>Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>95 Va. 231, at page 247, 28 S. E. 209.) In this State the only methods by which a landlord can obtain a lien for rent, prior to a judgment and execution therefor, is by distress warrant or attachment levied on the property liable for rent while it is on the leased premises, or within thirty days after its removal therefrom. (See chapter 227 and section 6416 of the Code.) Until a lien is thus obtained the landlord\u2019s right to a lien is inchoate in this State. <em>Dime Deposit Bank </em>v. <em>Wescott, </em>113 Va. 567, 75 S.

R. Co., </em>111 U. S. 228, 4 Sup. Ct. 369, 28 L. Ed. 410, or <em>C. &amp; O. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>92 Ya. 495, 504, 23 S. E. 935, 44 L. R. A. 457, and note, precisely in point, although the principle involved therein is a kindred one to that involved in the case before us. These authorities and the instant case are alike in this: The statutes dealt with therein must be looked to, and their provisions must be interpreted in the light of their object\u2014of the mischief sought to be remedied and the relief intended to be afforded\u2014in order to determine whether they impose any duty to individuals for the violation of which the statute means to give to the individual a cause of action against the one violating the duty: But, speaking broadly, the statutes dealt with by the authorities just mentioned, other than those referred to in Lord Coke\u2019s Institutes, where they are held to impose such a duty and to confer such a cause of action, impose a duty less specific in its nature than does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the statute involved, in the instant case; the liability for the violation of the former statutes has to be determined more in accordance with the rules governing liability in actions of tort for negligence, than is required by the last named statute, according to the settled construction of it aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We come now to the consideration of the construction of the statute involved in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> It was settled at an early day, by a long line of English decisions, that \u25a0 under the statute of. 8 Anne, chapter 14, section 1, aforesaid, the removal of the goods mentioned in the statute, after notice that the rent is in arrear, without first complying with the terms thereof upon which the permission of removal was thereby given, was. a wrong to the estate of the landlord, for which he might maintain an action in case against the person removing the goods and recover a personal judgment against him for the value of the \u2022goods removed, if not in excess of the amount of one year\u2019s rent in arrear, and, if the goods removed were in excess of that amount, then for the amount of the rent in \u2022arrear, for one year, and costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">- Under the English decisions, in such case, the notice need not be of the exact amount of the rent in arrear. -Notice that any of the rent mentioned in the statute was in arrear put the person removing the property upon inquiry and was equivalent to notice of the exact amount, if his failure to make inquiry of the landlord as the only reason he did not know of the.amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> No other circumstances, such as whether or not other goods liable for rent sufficient to satisfy the rent in arrear were left on the premises, or whether the landlord could have levied a distress warrant on the goods before they were removed, or whether there was a conversion of the goods which prevented such levy, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>fraud or other conduct whatsoever on the part of the person removing the goods, which was the proximate cause of the loss or damage to the landlord sought to be recovered in the action, being inquired into, or considered as at all essential to the right of recovery of the landlord in such action to the extent aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Where the proceeding was against an officer the practice was for the landlord, in lieu of an action in case, to proceed against the officer by motion, upon which a rule was issued against the officer to show cause against such judgment as aforesaid being entered against him for the money in .his hands derived from the sale under the execution which should have been paid to the landlord, if the money was still in the officer\u2019s hands, and if wrongfully paid out, then against him personally; there being in such proceeding by motion the same liability upon the officer as if there had been an action in case against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Palgrave </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>1 Strange, 212; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>3 Taunt. 400; <em>Hoskins </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>1 M. &amp; S. 245; <em>Henchett </em>v. <em>Kimpson, </em>2 Wils. 140; to cite only a few of the decisions on the subject. See also 7 Com. Dig., pp. 261-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The said statute of 8 Anne, or substantially the same statute, was enacted also in New York, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and such statutes have been given the same construction by the decisions of those States as the statute of 8 Anne by the English decisions. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Schenk, </em>2 Johns. (N. Y.) 479; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>11 Johns. (N. Y.) 185; <em>West's Adm'r </em>v. <em>Sink, </em>2 Yeates (Pa.) 274; <em>Burket </em>v. <em>Boude, </em>3 Dana (Ky.) 209, 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In the last cited case the Kentucky court says that the statute involved was a transcript of the statute of 8 Anne and \u201cthat the interpretation which has been given to the latter statute by the English courts has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>been heretofore adopted by this court as a guide for the interpretation of the\u201d Kentucky statute in question. The court further says this: \u201cThe landlord has two remedies against an officer who takes property from the demised premises by execution, without paying the rent. First, he may move the court to which the execution is returnable for a rule upon the officer to. pay over the money raised by the sale under execution, or so much thereof as will satisfy his rent. Or, second, he may maintain an action on the ease against him for taking and removing the property under execution before his year\u2019s rent is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u201cIn the former action he waives the tort in the taking of the property, affirms the sale, and asks an application of the fund raised, * * * .1 Strange 97, 643; 2 Strange 1024; 7 Com. Dig. 262-3, title rent, letter D. 8; Bradley on Distress, 215, 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201cBut when the action on the case is brought, it is brought for the wrongful act of the officer, in taking and removing the property, * * * . Besides, the statute expressly prohibits the removal of the property before the year\u2019s rent is paid. In case it is removed, what is the criterion of damages? Surely the value of the thing removed, provided that value does not exceed the year\u2019s rent. To that amount he is injured, * * * and to that amount he has a right to recover in this action * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">It follows from what we have said above that there was no error committed by the trial court of which the defendant lienholder complains in the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\"><bracketnum>[8, 9]</bracketnum> To have fully and accurately stated the law as applicable to the case the instruction given should have predicated the direction to the jury to find for the plaintiff as stated therein upon their finding the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>facts that the defendant at the time of the removal of the property had notice that further rent would become due thereafter and that the value of the property removed was not less than the amount of such rent, to-wit, $750.00; and there should have been no reference to the subject of what property was left on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Under section 5524 aforesaid, as under the statute of 8 Anne, the liability of the person removing the property is not dependent upon notice to him of the exact amount which is unpaid of rent mentioned in the statute. Notice of any rent'so mentioned being in arrear or to become due, puts the person removing the property upon inquiry and is equivalent to notice of the exact amount of such rent, if by inquiry of the landlord he would have ascertained the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">But it appears from the statement of facts preceding this opinion that the excess value of the property was established by the evidence without conflict; that the aforesaid notice was had, was not the subject of any controversy before the jury and could not have been otherwise than inferred by the jury from the circumstances disclosed in evidence; and the reference to what property was left on the premises may be treated as surplusage. Hence, there was in truth no error in the instruction of which the defendant could justly complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The instructions asked for by the defendant were properly refused and the motion to set aside the verdict was properly denied in view of the conclusions which we have reached above.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> It is urged in argument for the defendant that such conclusions mil lead to the result that customers of retail merchants, who are tenants of leased premises, will be unable to purchase articles of merchandize and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>remove them from the premises without being liable to the landlord for their value, if there is any unpaid rent in arrear at the time, or which thereafter becomes due to the landlord, under the tenancy. But that result by no means follows. It has been uniformly held, as we believe, that by leasing the premises to such a tenant with knowledge that he is going to conduct such a business thereon, or by thereafter knowingly assenting thereto, the landlord will be held to have waived his inchoate or statutory lien upon a shifting stock of goods and all right to assert a personal liability to him for rent against purchasers of articles of merchandise from the tenant in the regular course of retail trade. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Whitwell, </em>9 Iowa 152, 158; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>13 Wall. 14-17, 20 L. Ed. 478. We do not think that what is said in <em>Offterdinger </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>92 Ya. at p. 651, 24 S. E. 246, is at all to .the contrary. What is there said has no reference to this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The case will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
