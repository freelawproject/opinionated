The indictment was in the general form prescribed by section 7 of the act, and upon the trial of the defendant, Quivers, the jury rendered a general verdict finding him guilty and fixing his punishment at six months in jail and a fine of five hundred dollars. The lower court overruled a motion for a new trial and entered judgment in accordance with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The defendant introduced no evidence, and the material facts, not in any way disputed, may be briefly stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The sheriff of York county had been informed \u201cthat there were a lot of bootleggers,\u201d and he was looking out for them. One night about nine o\u2019clock he met Quivers and Russell driving in a cart or jumper, and called to them to stop. They failed to heed his command, and he turned the car in which he was riding and overtook them. On the seat between them he found a quart \u25a0bottle of corn liquor in a sack, and he also found in Quivers\u2019 pocket a pint bottle containing ardent spirits. \u2022Quivers made no explanation or statement whatever, nor did Russell, so far as the record discloses. The \u25a0sheriff did not have either a search warrant or a warrant \u25a0of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">There are four assignments of error which we shall dispose of in the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">1. When the sheriff stated on the witness stand that he had acted without any warrant, the defendant moved the court to strike out and withdraw from the jury the whole of his testimony on the ground that the evidence was illegally obtained, but the court overruled the motion, and the defendant excepted. Two other witnesses introduced by the Commonwealth, who were with the sheriff at the time of the arrest, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>substantially as the sheriff did, their testimony being objected to on the Same ground, but the objection was. overruled, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In the brief of counsel for the defendant it is said that the trial court erred in permitting the witnesses \u201cto testify in regard to the ardent spirits found in the pocket of the accused and on the seat of the cart in which he and Moses Russell were riding, because the sheriff had no authority to stop and arrest and search them for ardent spirits without a search warrant.\u201d In support of this contention counsel for the defendant rely upon chapter 345 of the Acts of 1920 (in force when the search and arrest were made), and the cases of <em>Gouled </em>v. <em>United States, </em>255 U. S. 298, 41 Sup. Ct. 261, 65 L. Ed. 647, and <em>Amos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>255 U. S. 313, 41 Sup. Ct. 266, 65 L. Ed. 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"> It is manifest that these authorities do not sustain the proposition for which they are cited. Section 4 of chapter 345 of the Acts of 1920 (Acts 1920, page-517), expressly provides that any officer empowered to enforce the laws with reference to intoxicating liquors, may enter any vehicle of travel without a search warrant for the purpose of police inspection. The sheriff, therefore, acted under and not against the authority of the statute upon which the defendant relies. Having thus found, on the seat between them, evidence that the occupants of the ear were committing a misdemeanor in his presence, it was Ms right and duty to arrest them, and to search their persons for further evidence of their guilt. As we said in <em>Lucchesi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 872, 94 S. E. 925, quoting from <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U. S. 383, 392, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, 344, 58 L. Ed. 652, 655 (L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177): \u201cThe right on the part of the government * * * to search the person of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>cused, when lawfully arrested, to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime * * * has been- uniformly maintained in many cases,\u201d and had been \u201calways recognized under English and American law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">For the purpose of .this ease we are not called upon to say whether we are prepared to approve in their fullest extent the <em>Gouled </em>and <em>Amos Cases, </em>cited <em>supra, </em>because-they are markedly different from the case at bar, and' are not in conflict with the action of the trial court in admitting the evidence here complained of. The <em>Gouled Case </em>related to private papers in which the government had no interest and which it had no right to confiscate, and the <em>Amos Case </em>involved the invasion of the defendant\u2019s home without a warrant of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">It is not contended, or even intimated, on behalf of the defendant, and there is no evidence in the record,, that the sack in which the quart bottle was found should be regarded as personal baggage, or that it was-closed, or was any such container as the statute (Ch. 345, Acts 1920, sec. 4) exempted from search without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">2. The two bottles found in the possession of the defendant, and their contents, were admitted in evidence over his objection, and this is assigned as error, \u201cbecause the sheriff had no warrant and no authority to seize and take possession of the same.\u201d Of this we need only repeat that the sheriff\u2019s action was fully authorized by the statute which the defendant invokes,, and by the kindred rules of common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">3. It is also insisted that the court ought not to have allowed the half pint bottle found in defendant\u2019s pocket to be used in evidence, \u201cbecause it does not appear from the record that the possession of this bottle and its contents was a violation of the prohibition law.\u201d The possession and transportation of ardent spirits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>one\u2019s pocket is a plain contravention of the statute. <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>123 Va. 810, 815, 96 S. E. 766; <em>Snarr\u2019s Case, </em>131 Va. 814, 819, 109 S. E. 590; <em>Sager\u2019s Case, </em>134 Va. 732, 114 S. E. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">It is further urged that the quart bottle ought not to have been permitted in evidence, because, being found on the seat of the cart between the defendant and Moses Russell,\u201d it was not in the exclusive possession of the defendant, Quivers; citing <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>130 Va. 761, 107 S. E. 700. The <em>Henderson Case </em>has no application here. The facts in that ease were wholly different and it was controlled by a wholly different statute. Section 28 of the prohibition law made the finding of the quart bottle in the buggy <em>prima facie </em>evidence of guilt of both occupants thereof. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 738, 111 S. E. 127; <em>Wampler </em>v. <em>Town of Norton, </em>134 Va. 606, 113 S. E. 733. Moreover, the bottle was found in what clearly appeared to be an exclusive joint possession of both occupants, and neither one of them offered any disclaimer or explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">4. The remaining assignment of error is that the court ought to have set aside the verdict because it did not appear that the offense was committed in York county. The sheriff testified that he was the sheriff \u201cof York county,\u201d that he <em>resided </em>\u201cin Poquoson district,\u201d and that the arrest and search took place \u201cin the lower end of Poquoson district.\u201d The law requires the sheriff to reside in the county for which he holds the office. Va. Const., sec. 32; Code, sees. -2703, 2704. There is plainly no merit in this assignment. <em>West </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 747, 750-751, 99 S. E. 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment complained of is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
