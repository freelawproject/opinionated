Blankenship, </em>130 S. C., 131; 125 S. E., 420, that even in an equitable action, the Court has no power to compulsorily order a reference, except under the circumstances detailed in Section 593, Code of Civil Procedure, 1922 (citing <em>Ferguson v. Harrison, </em>34 S. C., 169; 13 S. E., 332), none of which exist in the case at bar. The alternative is for the Circuit Judge, sitting as a chancellor in an equity case, to take the testimony and decide the case. If the appellants had opposed the reference upon this ground, and had followed up the objection with appropriate exception, their position would have been \u2022 sustained. But their objection was based upon the refusal of the Circuit Judge to frame issues for the jury, in compliance with the motion which had been duly noticed. This was a matter within his discretion as is plainly disclosed in Rule 23 of the Circuit Court rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">The judgment of. the Court is that the judgment of the Circuit Court be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-12\">Mr. Chiee Justice Gary and Messrs.
