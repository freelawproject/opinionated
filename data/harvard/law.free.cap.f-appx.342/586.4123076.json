Wiggins, an Alabama prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">After being convicted and sentenced to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment for first-degree rape, Wiggins filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition, alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing (1) to call a newspaper reporter to testify regarding a newspaper article wherein the victim\u2019s sister allegedly stated that the victim consented to have sex with Wiggins because she had a \u201cmind of a child,\u201d (2) to argue that the victim did not have the \u201cmind of a child\u201d because she graduated from high school, and (3) to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony that she had never had sex by showing that she was common-law married.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">After the state responded, a magistrate judge issued a report, finding that, because Wiggins never raised these ineffective-assistance claims in state court, Wiggins\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims were unex-hausted and therefore procedurally barred. Over Wiggins\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and denied Wiggins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. This Court granted Wiggins\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-18\">Whether the district court erred in finding the following ineffective assistance of counsel claims to be procedurally barred from federal habeas review: (a) counsel\u2019s failure to call a newspaper reporter, Kaysha Drexle, as a witness; (b) counsel\u2019s failure to challenge evidence that the victim \u201chad the mind of a child\u201d based on her graduation from high school; and (c) counsel\u2019s failure to use known information that the victim was common-law married to Bill Morgan to impeach her testimony that she had never had sex with anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">\u201c[I]n an appeal brought by an unsuccessful habeas petitioner, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the [COA].\u201d <em>McClain v. Hall, </em>552 F.3d 1245, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>1254 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 25, 2009) (No. 09-5004). A habeas petitioner abandons the claims he does not address on appeal. See <em>Atkins v. Singletary, </em>965 F.2d 952, 955 n. 1 (11th Cir.1992). While this Court is lenient when interpreting the arguments of a <em>pro se </em>litigant, it will not act as <em>de facto </em>counsel. <em>See GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Neither of Wiggins\u2019s briefs addresses the single issue set forth in the COA regarding the district court\u2019s decision that his ineffective-assistance claims were procedurally barred from federal habeas review. Instead, Wiggins\u2019s initial brief argues only the substantive issue of his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Moreover, Wiggins\u2019s reply brief argued that he was actually innocent of the rape offense and failed to address the procedural bar question, even after the government pointed out that Wiggins had waived the procedural bar issue by failing to address it in his initial brief. There simply is nothing in Wiggins\u2019s briefs for this Court to construe liberally as an argument related to the procedural bar issue in the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Wiggins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
