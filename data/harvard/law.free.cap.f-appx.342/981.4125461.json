The IJ found that Angwafo was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application for asylum within one year of entering the United States. Alternatively, the IJ ruled that Angwafo was not a credible witness and therefore failed to demonstrate his eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s credibility findings and the IJ\u2019s finding that Angwafo was statutorily barred from receiving asylum, concurring that Angwafo had failed to establish with credible evidence that he was eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Angwafo concedes that this court may lack jurisdiction to review his asylum claim and raises no challenge to the IJ\u2019s timeliness determination. Rather, he contends that he presented credible testimony in support of his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">This court \u201cmust examine the basis of [its] subject matter jurisdiction, on [its] own motion if necessary.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 302 (5th Cir.2005). To be statutorily eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he filed an application for asylum within one year of his latest arrival in the United States. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Because the IJ\u2019s determination was based on factual findings, this court is without jurisdiction to review Angwafo\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-95 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">This court gives great deference to a factfinder\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility and will not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA or the IJ with respect to witness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, this court \u201cwill not review decisions turning purely on the immigration judge\u2019s assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court will, however, review the record to determine whether an adverse credibility determination is \u201csupported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record.\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). This court will reverse the IJ\u2019s credibility determination \u201conly if the record 'compels\u2019 a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Here, the IJ gave specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility determination that were based on the petitioners\u2019 testimony and documentary evidence contained in the record. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. This court has held that \u201cwhere the judge\u2019s credibility determinations are supported by the record, we will affirm them even if we may have reached a different conclusion, because we will reverse only if the record compels a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Mwembie, </em>443 F.3d at 410 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The record in this case does not compel a different conclusion regarding the petitioners\u2019 lack of credibility. Rather, the record as a whole supports the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Because \u201c[w]e cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations ... we will not review decisions turning purely on the immigration judge\u2019s assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78. The denial of relief in this case was based on the finding that the Angwafo failed to provide credible evidence in support of his claims, and the adverse credibility determination was supported by specific, cogent reasons. We therefore decline to review the decision denying relief in this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">The petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1003-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
