Sharif was ordered to be removed based on his 2006 conviction in Texas state court of soliciting a minor/aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of fourteen, which DHS determined to be an aggravated felon conviction for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Sharif argues that \u00a7 1228(b) is not applicable to him and that his Texas conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Although this court lacks jurisdiction to review the final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We review legal questions, such as whether Sharifs conviction constitutes an aggravated felony, and constitutional claims <em>de novo. See Lann-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 461 n. 7 (5th Cir.2006); <em>DeZavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Sharifs first argument is that an alien in \u00a7 1228(b) proceedings must be in a state or federal facility before commencement of those proceedings. Sharif has waived that argument by failing to brief it adequately. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Sharif next contends that \u00a7 1228(b) applies only to aliens who are not legal permanent residents (\u201cLPR\u2019s\u201d) and aliens who are conditional LPR\u2019s. Because his status as a conditional LPR was revoked before the removal proceedings, Sharif asserts that \u00a7 1228(b) is not applicable to him as a conditional LPR. Because, however, \u00a7 1228(b) is nonetheless applicable to Sharif as a Non-LPR, his argument lacks merit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1228(b)(2)(A). Moreover, as to Sharifs claim that \u00a7 1228(b)\u2019s distinction between LPR\u2019s and conditional LPR\u2019s violates his equal protection rights, he lacks standing because, as he asserts, \u00a7 1228(b) is not applicable to him as a conditional LPR. Even if he had standing, his argument fails to state a valid equal protection claim. <em>See Stefanoff v. Hays County, </em>154 F.3d 523, 525-25 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">In determining whether Sharifs offense is an aggravated felony, we apply a categorical approach, referring only to the statutory definition of the crime rather than examining the underlying facts of the offense. <em>Larin-Ulloa, </em>462 F.3d at 463. Because, however, the statute of conviction defines multiple offenses, \u201cat least one of which does not describe an aggravated felony,\u201d we apply a modified categorical approach and may examine additional documents to determine whether the conviction was \u201cnecessarily for a particular crime defined by the statute that meets the aggravated felony criterion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). At issue is whether Sharif\u2019s Texas offense constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d or attempted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), (U).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Sharif asserts that <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), requires a state statute to have a federal counterpart to qualify as an aggravated felony offense. His argument is not supported by <em>Lopez. See Lopez, </em>549 U.S. at 57, 127 S.Ct. 625. Moreover, <em>Lopez </em>is distinguishable from the instant case, because <em>Lopez </em>involved a different portion of the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d than does the portion at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Examination of the charging document shows that Sharif was convicted under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 15.031 of \u201cCriminal Solicitation of a Minor\u201d with intent to commit \u201cAggravated Sexual Assault\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.021. Pursuant to the definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d in <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604 (5th Cir.2000), Shai\u2019ifs Texas offense is an aggravated felony conviction, thereby rendering him removable as charged. <em>See Hernandez-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 763, 766 (7th Cir.2005). Moreover, to the extent that Sharif argues that his Texas offense could not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the \u201cminor\u201d involved was actually an adult, that argument lacks merit. <em>See id. </em>at 766-67; <em>United States v. Farner, </em>251 F.3d 510, 511-12 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b989-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
