Walter Wood, Jr., the Executive Director of the Alabama Department of Youth Services (\u201cDYS\u201d). Hardy\u2019s complaint alleged First Amendment retaliation and procedural due process claims, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and a state law claim of fraud, all stemming from his termination from his position as a DYS counselor. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">A. Sexual Harassment Complaint Against Hardy</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In June 2005, DYS employee, Tera McMillian (\u201cMcMillian\u201d), complained that Hardy, her supervisor, had sexually harassed her. DYS\u2019s Personnel Manager, Debra Spann, investigated McMillian\u2019s complaint and interviewed Hardy on June 28, 2005. During the taped interview, Spann and Hardy discussed two incidents that McMillian alleged were sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">On July 14, 2005, while Spann\u2019s investigation was pending, Hardy filed a grievance against McMillian. Hardy complained that McMillian had made unsubstantiated derogatory statements about him and had encouraged other employees to file false charges against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hardy filed the grievance because he felt he was being \u201cset up\u201d during Spann\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">On July 19, 2005, Spann advised Defendant Wood by letter that she had completed her investigation and found McMillian\u2019s sexual harassment complaint valid. Spann recommended that Hardy be disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">On November 4, 2005, Defendant Wood sent Hardy a letter informing Hardy of Spann\u2019s recommendation. Wood advised Hardy that he was alleged \u201cto have made sexual advances and/or to have created a hostile working environment\u201d for McMilli-an and \u201cto have attempted, among other things, to cause an investigation against [McMillian] for her having filed a complaint against [him].\u201d Defendant Wood specified that Hardy allegedly had violated State Personnel Board rules prohibiting disruptive conduct, use of abusive language, the serious violation of departmental rules and sexual harassment. Wood cited the respective rule numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Defendant Wood also notified Hardy that a hearing on the alleged violations would be held on November 10, 2005, and that Hardy could be represented by an attorney and present witnesses and other evidence. Wood explained that he would review the evidence presented at the hearing and make a decision regarding disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">B. Disciplinary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">The hearing, held on November 15, 2005, was conducted by Marcia Calendar, DYS\u2019s Assistant Director. Hardy was represented by counsel, who submitted numerous documents and presented the testimony of eight witnesses. Afterward, in a December 8, 2005 letter, DYS Assistant Director Calendar advised Defendant Wood that she found the allegations against Hardy were substantiated and recommended that Hardy\u2019s employment be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-16\">On January 6, 2006, Defendant Wood advised Hardy by letter that (1) the evidence presented at the November 2005 hearing supported a finding that Hardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>had violated the Rules of the State Personnel Board, again listing each rule by number, and (2) Hardy was terminated and had ten days to request a hearing with the Alabama State Personnel Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">C. ALJ Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">At Hardy\u2019s request, a hearing was held on May 8 and June 10, 2006, before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) with the Alabama Department of Personnel. Hardy was represented by counsel, who introduced exhibits and called witnesses. Hardy testified that he had filed the grievance against McMillian because McMillian asked other staff members to say negative things about him during Spann\u2019s sexual harassment investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Following the hearing, the ALJ prepared a recommended order finding that, although Hardy\u2019s inappropriate comments to McMillian warranted only discipline, his impermissible use of the grievance process to retaliate against McMillian for filing a sexual harassment complaint warranted termination. On October 17, 2007, the State Personnel Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions and affirmed Hardy\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">D. This Civil Action</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Hardy, represented by counsel, filed this action in state court. After Defendant Wood removed the action to federal court, Wood moved for summary judgment on all claims. The district court granted Wood\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Hardy\u2019s First Amendment retaliation, federal procedural due process and state law fraud claims. Subsequently, the district court denied Hardy\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment as to his procedural due process claim, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Hardy filed this appeal <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">A. Summary Judgment Order</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">On appeal, Hardy argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his constitutional claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court concluded that Defendant Wood was entitled to qualified immunity on these claims because Hardy had not presented any evidence that Wood had violated Hardy\u2019s First Amendment or due process rights in terminating him. <em>See Lewis v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>561 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that a public officer acting within his discretionary authority is entitled to qualified immunity if the district court concludes either that there was no constitutional violation or that the constitutional right allegedly violated was not clearly established). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">To establish a claim of First Amendment retaliation, a public employee must show that his speech was protected by the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Amendment, that is, that he was speaking \u201cas a citizen on a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Battle v. Bd. of Regents for Ga., </em>468 F.3d 755, 760 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). Hardy did not present any evidence that he was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern when he filed his grievance. The undisputed evidence shows that Hardy filed his internal grievance with Spann, DYS\u2019s Personnel Manager, to complain about the way in which the sexual harassment investigation against him was being conducted. At the November 15, 2005 pre-termination hearing, Hardy himself described his grievance as addressing a \u201cjob-related\u201d dispute and explained that he filed the grievance because he thought the investigation against him was unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Hardy argues that his grievance bore on a matter of public concern because permitting one of his subordinates to pursue a baseless sexual harassment claim against him would undermine his ability to supervise other employees. In other words, Hardy contends that he pursued his grievance to maintain discipline and order at a public institution. However, \u201c[a] public employee may not transform a personal grievance into a matter of public concern by invoking a supposed popular interest in the way public institutions are run.\u201d <em>Boyce v. Andrew, </em>510 F.3d 1333, 1344 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that welfare workers\u2019 job-related complaints to supervisor did not address matter of public concern) (quotation marks omitted). Because Hardy spoke as an employee about a job-related matter when he filed his grievance, his speech was not protected by the First Amendment. Thus, Hardy did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant Wood violated his First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Hardy also argues that summary judgment was improper as to his pre-termination procedural due process claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A \u201ctenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. Of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). Notice in the pre-termination context is sufficient if it notifies the public employee of the charges against him and is timely. <em>Harrison v. Witte, </em>132 F.3d 679, 684 (11th Cir.1998). The pre-termination hearing does not have to be \u201ca full evidentiary hearing,\u201d or \u201cestablish conclusively the propriety of the termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the employee \u201cneed only be given an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Hardy had a constitutionally protected interest in his employment, the undisputed evidence shows that Hardy was given adequate pre-termination notice and an opportunity to be heard. First, Spann and Hardy discussed McMillian\u2019s sexual harassment charges in the taped June 28, 2005 interview. Spann informed Hardy of specific events McMillian claimed constituted inappropriate behavior. Second, Defendant Wood\u2019s November 4, 2005 letter informed Hardy of the allegations against him, including that he (1) made sexual advances towards McMillian, and (2) attempted to instigate an investigation against McMilli-an because she had filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. Wood\u2019s letter listed by number the personnel rules Hardy allegedly violated. The letter informed Hardy there would be a pre-termi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>nation hearing on the allegations, at which he could present evidence and be represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The record shows that, at the pre-termi-nation hearing, Hardy was represented by counsel, submitted numerous documents and called eight witnesses in his defense. Indeed, one of the documents Hardy placed in evidence was DYS\u2019s grievance procedure, indicating that he understood that his filing of the grievance was at issue in the hearing. Because the undisputed facts show that Hardy was informed of the charges against him and had an opportunity to present his side of the story, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Wood violated Hardy\u2019s right to procedural due process before Hardy\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Finally, there is no dispute of fact as to Hardy\u2019s state law fraud claim. To establish fraud under Alabama law, the plaintiff must show that: (1) the defendant made a false representation; (2) concerning a material fact; (3) that the plaintiff relied upon; and (4) that the plaintiff was damaged as a result. Ala. Code \u00a7 6-5-101; <em>George v. Associated Doctors Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>675 So.2d 860, 862 (Ala.1996). The undisputed record belies Hardy\u2019s claim that Defendant Wood deceived him into thinking that the November 15, 2005 pre-termination hearing would focus only on McMillian\u2019s sexual harassment allegations and not on the propriety of Hardy\u2019s filing of the grievance. Wood\u2019s November 4, 2005 letter accurately informed Hardy that the hearing would concern both McMillian\u2019s sexual harassment allegations and Hardy\u2019s attempt to have McMillian investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">B. Rule 59(e) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"ACr\">[4] We also reject Hardy\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The proper grounds for a Rule 59(e) motion are newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact. <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007). Hardy\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion merely reasserted arguments raised in opposition to Defendant Wood\u2019s summary judgment motion or made new arguments that could have been, but were not, made before summary judgment was entered. <em>See Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of Wellington, </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that a Rule 59(e) motion should not be used to relitigate summary judgment issues or raise arguments or present evidence that could have been raised before judgment was entered). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hardy\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-11\">. Although a copy of the grievance is not in the record, the parties agree that these were Hardy's allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\">. Hardy appealed his dismissal to the Circuit Court of Montgomery, which reversed the State Personnel Board's order and reinstated him. However, since the district court's summary judgment order, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals has reversed the Circuit Court and concluded that substantial evidence supports the State Personnel Board\u2019s determination. <em>See Ala. State Pers. Bd. v. Plardy, </em>\u2014 So.2d-, 2008 WL 5424073, at *10-13 (Ala. Civ.App.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-17\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's ruling on summary judgment. <em>Baker v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., </em>531 F.3d 1336, 1337 (11th Cir.2008). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment \"if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate, we view all facts and reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Baker, </em>531 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\">. On appeal, Hardy does not argue that he was deprived of due process after his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. We review a district court's denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Lockard </em>v. <em>Equifax, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1259, 1267 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
