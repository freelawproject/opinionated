Finch challenges the amount of methamphetamine attributed to him in the presentence investigation report and the enhancement of his sentence for causing a substantial risk of harm to a minor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">On October 7, 2008, officers of the Sheriffs Department of Bulloch County, Georgia, went to Finch\u2019s residence to investigate whether he had a car that had been reported stolen. At the sight of the officers on Finch\u2019s property, Victoria Foley discarded a device used to smoke methamphetamine, and she and Marlena Taylor fled. When Taylor was apprehended, she told officers that Finch and Benjamin Roberts were inside the home. After one officer recalled that there was an outstanding warrant to arrest Finch, officers entered the house and discovered Finch asleep in a bedroom. The officers found Roberts and Julie Livingston in another bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Officers secured Finch\u2019s house and the surrounding property. The officers entered a large storage building about 20 feet from Finch\u2019s house and saw a bucket of crushed pseudoephedrine tablets. After Finch refused to consent to a search of his property, the officers obtained a search warrant. The officers returned to the storage building, where they found a white plastic bucket that contained several coffee filters and a strainer; a refrigerated tank containing anhydrous ammonia; a green backpack that contained packages of salt, funnels, liquid Heet, Liquid Fire drain cleaner, and lithium batteries; a blue backpack that contained a strainer and muriatic acid; two Mason jars that had been used to manufacture methamphetamine; two pump sprayers that emitted hydrochloric gas; and a silver thermos that contained anhydrous ammonia. The officers next searched Finch\u2019s home and discovered several cans of starting fluid; a device used to smoke methamphetamine; a digital scale; coffee filters; and Xanax tablets. The officers seized 108.3 grams of methamphetamine from Finch\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">For the next several days, officers interviewed Finch and his cohorts about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>methamphetamine operation. Finch admitted that he had entered a conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine five months before his arrest. Finch stated that the conspirators produced between 7 and 54 grams each week and he received 3.5 grams for his participation. Finch stated that he witnessed three members of the conspiracy manufacture methamphetamine in a shed behind Glenn Shuman\u2019s property in Brooklet, Georgia. Finch said that the group produced as much as 80 grams of methamphetamine at each cook, and he had seen 80 grams of methamphetamine at Shuman\u2019s residence on October 5, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Other cohorts described Finch\u2019s role in the methamphetamine operation. Roberts, Livingston, and Taylor admitted that they had lived with Finch and had shared methamphetamine. Kelly Coesens told investigators that she and Finch \u201cused methamphetamine extensively\u201d the weekend before his arrest. Foley, who had been discovered outside Finch\u2019s home, told officers that she had purchased two grams of methamphetamine from Finch on two occasions and that Finch supplied all the methamphetamine used by Taylor, Roberts, and Livingston. Foley stated that Brian Dean, a member of the methamphetamine operation, and Taylor had a two-year-old daughter who had been at Finch\u2019s home the morning of October 7, 2008. Foley also stated that she had transported Finch, Taylor, and Taylor\u2019s daughter to Shuman\u2019s residence, where they obtained anhydrous ammonia that the group brought to Finch\u2019s residence in a silver thermos. Shuman admitted that he and Finch had manufactured methamphetamine on two occasions and that the silver thermos that had been discovered in the large storage building belonged to Jason Thorne, another member of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">While Finch was incarcerated, he gave an inmate a telephone number to call to order methamphetamine. After the inmate told authorities about the encounter, federal agents arranged for the inmate to speak to Finch a second time. During their second encounter, Finch advised the inmate to tell the female who answered the telephone to contact \u201cJJ,\u201d an alias for Thorne, to obtain methamphetamine. Finch told the inmate that he had two tanks of anhydrous ammonia hidden near the Ogeechee River.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Finch, Taylor, Thorne, and a codefen-dant were indicted for conspiring to manufacture, possessing -with intent to distribute, and distributing 50 grams or more of methamphetamine or 500 grams or more of a mixture of a substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii). The government offered to recommend that Finch receive a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility in exchange for his plea of guilty to the lesser-included offense of conspiracy to manufacture, to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute a quantity of methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1). Finch admitted, as part of the factual basis of the plea agreement, \u201cthat his plea of guilty constituted proof of the lesser included offense ... without any drug quantity threshold being alleged for penalty enhancing purposes.\u201d The district court accepted Finch\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The presentence investigation report attributed to Finch \u201ca minimum of 350 grams of methamphetamine mixture.\u201d The report based its calculation \u201con the 108.3 grams of methamphetamine mixture seized [from Finch\u2019s property] on October 7, 2007, and a historical quantity based on statements of codefendants, unindicted co-conspirators, and witnesses.\u201d The report provided a base offense level of 30, United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5) (Nov.2007), increased that level by six points because the decision to transport anhydrous ammonia in a thermos created a substantial risk of harm to a minor, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(10)(D), and decreased that level by three points for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. The report provided a sentencing range between 235 and 293 months of imprisonment based on Finch\u2019s criminal history of VI as a career offender. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. Because the statutory maximum sentence was 20 years, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), the Sentencing Guidelines provided a sentence between 235 and 240 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Finch objected to the presentence report on two grounds. Finch argued that he was responsible for 108.3 grams of methamphetamine and the report relied on unreliable sources to attribute to Finch an additional 241.7 grams of methamphetamine. Finch also argued that there was no evidence to establish that transporting the thermos of anhydrous ammonia put Taylor\u2019s two-year-old daughter at risk of harm and the six-level enhancement was intended to apply when a minor is near a methamphetamine laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the government presented evidence to respond to Finch\u2019s objections. Victoria Foley testified that, after she transported Finch, Thorne, Taylor, and Taylor\u2019s two-year-old daughter to Shuman\u2019s house, the group smoked methamphetamine, and they returned to Finch\u2019s house with a thermos of anhydrous ammonia. Ross Butler, a forensic chemist, testified that transporting anhydrous ammonia in a thermos or other unapproved container is extremely dangerous because the substance must be kept at very low temperatures and, if it exceeds negative 28 degrees, the substance could erode the thermos or cause it to burst and emit toxic gas that could cause those exposed to suffocate. Butler also testified that the various chemicals discovered in Finch\u2019s storage building were highly flammable and the inhalation of those chemicals could burn the respiratory system or cause death. Agent Kent Musey testified about the methamphetamine seized from Finch\u2019s residence and the statements by Finch\u2019s cohorts attributing additional amounts of methamphetamine to Finch.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The district court overruled Finch\u2019s objections to the presentence report. The district court ruled that the report provided a \u201cfair analysis\u201d about Finch\u2019s responsibility for 350 grams of methamphetamine. The court also ruled that, based on the testimony about the volatility of anhydrous ammonia and its proximity to Taylor\u2019s child, \u201cthe six point[]\u201d enhancement was \u201cwarranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The district court warned Finch that he faced a \u201csevere sentence\u201d because he \u201c[had] never taken a proceeding seriously.\u201d The court acknowledged that Finch was addicted to methamphetamine, and the court stated that the drug had \u201cruined\u201d Finch\u2019s life and, \u201cby [his] involvement as a manufacturer and distributor, [Finch] [had] no doubt ruined the lives of others.\u201d Based on \u201c[a]ll the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)[,] ... Finch\u2019s record and disregard, and aplomb ... to continue aiding and abetting drug distribution even after his arrestf,]\u201d the district court sentenced Finch to 240 months of imprisonment. \u201c[B]ecause [Finch] entered a plea and agreed to waive [his] appeal,\u201d the district court \u201c[took] 12 months off\u2019 Finch\u2019s sentence and imposed a term of 228 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">We review for clear error \u201ca district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs used to establish a base offense level[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). We review <em>de novo </em>the application of the risk-to-a-minor enhancement to a sentence. <em>United States v. Florence, </em>333 F.3d 1290, 1292 (11th Cir.2003). The district court may apply the enhancement when it finds \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s actions placed a minor at risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Finch challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, Finch complains the district court credited unreliable evidence to attribute to Finch more methamphetamine than the amount seized from his residence. Second, Finch contends he is not entitled to a six-level enhancement because the transportation of anhydrous ammonia was not sufficiently dangerous to place Taylor\u2019s child at risk. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The district court did not clearly err by attributing to Finch 350 grams of methamphetamine. The government presented reliable and specific evidence that Finch was responsible for more methamphetamine than that discovered by law enforcement. <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir.1995). In addition to the 108 grams seized from Finch\u2019s residence, Finch admitted that during the conspiracy he had participated in about 20 methamphetamine cooks that produced between 7 and 54 grams, for which he received 70 grams of methamphetamine; he had participated in methamphetamine cooks at Glenn Shuman\u2019s residence that produced 80 grams of methamphetamine; and he had observed 80 grams of methamphetamine at Shuman\u2019s residence two days before the search of his house. <em>See United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cFor sentencing purposes a member of a drug conspiracy is liable for his own acts and the acts of others in furtherance of the activity that the defendant agreed to undertake and that are reasonably foreseeable in connection with that activity.\u201d (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1))). Victoria Foley, Kelly Coe-sens, and Glenn Shuman told authorities that Finch either sold or provided to them additional amounts of methamphetamine. Ample evidence supported the amount of methamphetamine attributed to Finch.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The district court also did not err by enhancing Finch\u2019s sentence for creating a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor. The district court was entitled to credit testimony from Foley that she, Finch, Thorne, and Taylor transported anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container and in a vehicle occupied by Taylor\u2019s two-year-old daughter. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir.1995). Based on the serious hazards created by handling anhydrous ammonia, the district court did not err by finding that Finch\u2019s participation in that conduct exhibited a reckless disregard for the safety of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AC_\">Finch\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
