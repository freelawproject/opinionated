Ajah has not challenged the district court\u2019s reasons for refusing to consider the affidavit and thus has abandoned any challenge to that refusal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). In his motion for new trial, Ajah merely stated that he \u201cwas denied effective trial [counsel] because [he] wanted and asked to testify on his own behalf at trial, but his attorney did not allow him. His attorney told him it would not be a good idea.\u201d His conclusional allegation of deficient performance without an allegation of prejudice was insufficient under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), failed to demonstrate that the interest of justice required a new trial, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a), and was insufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing, <em>see United States v. Demik, </em>489 F.3d 644, 646 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 982, 128 S.Ct. 456, 169 L.Ed.2d 319 (2007). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Ajah\u2019s motion for a new trial without holding an evidentiary hearing. We decline to consider the merits of the ineffective assistance claim at this time. See <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Ajah argues that he met the criterion of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5) and thus the district court erred in denying him a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(11). As the party seeking this sentencing adjustment, Ajah had the burden of proving the facts to support the adjustment. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146 (5th Cir.1996). In the district court, Ajah merely asserted that he had provided and was prepared to provide complete and truthful information to the Government prior to the sentencing hearing. He did not point to his post-arrest cooperation and proffer statements or offer any evidence or argument at sentencing in support of the adjustment. Thus, he failed to carry his burden. <em>See Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d at 146. Additionally, the district court\u2019s finding, that Ajah had not truthfully provided all information and evidence to the Government is plausible in light of the record and, thus, not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The district court did not err by not applying the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(11) adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Ajah also contends this his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court gave no real consideration to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the sentence at the top of the advisory guidelines range is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Ajah did not point out in the district court any of the specific circumstances he now contends that the court erred in failing to consider. The record demonstrates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine that a sentence at the top of the guidelines range was sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Ajah has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that we apply to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
