On appeal, Hill argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying, <em>sua sponte, </em>a sentence reduction on the basis that he was accountable for 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, when he had not filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and did not have an opportunity to present evidence to the district court regarding the drug amount. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005). We will not remand for clear error unless we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Id. </em>We may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1433 n. 9 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">Under the law of the case doctrine, the district court and this Court are \u201cbound by findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court of appeals in a prior appeal of the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996). Accordingly, a decision may only be challenged at a later time if (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made contrary decisions of law applicable to an issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would create manifest injustice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>A district court has subject matter jurisdiction, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if his sentencing range has been lowered by a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201cupon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on [the court\u2019s] own motion.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). Before Amendment 706, a base offense level of 38 applied to drug offenses involving at least 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2000). Now, a base offense level of 38 applies to an offense involving at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and a base offense level of 36 applies to an offense involving at least 1.5, but less than 4.5, kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), (2) (2008). We have held that a defendant who was accountable for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 did not lower his base offense level and, therefore, his guideline range was not reduced. <em>See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. Thus, if a defendant is responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not reduce his applicable guideline range, and he is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id..</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">If a district court is authorized to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), it may do so only after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce a sentence does not provide a basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). <em>\u201c[AJll </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">As an initial matter, the district court did not act outside its jurisdiction by denying a sentence reduction. Hill\u2019s initial 2008 motion for appointment of counsel was properly, and liberally, construed as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, because it contained arguments as to why Hill should receive a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>See Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that courts may liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Second, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Hill was accountable for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. The sentencing court adopted the factual findings in the PSI, which included a finding that Hill was accountable for \u201cat the minimum ... approximately 4.5 kilograms\u201d of crack cocaine. The PSI\u2019s description of the offense conduct also showed that Hill was responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, since it provided that Hill: (1) sold 10.6 grams of crack cocaine to a confidential source; and (2) at a minimum, bought 3.5 grams of crack cocaine twice a week for two years, 113.4 grams of crack cocaine twice a week for two months, and 7 grams of crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>cocaine three times a week for two years. These transactions amounted to 4.737 kilograms of crack cocaine. Hill did not object to these factual findings at sentencing, thereby admitting the findings for the purpose of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt is the law of this circuit that a failure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Moreover, we recognized on direct appeal of Hill\u2019s original sentence that the district court found that the offenses involved distributing 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>176 Fed.Appx. 22, 25 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Hill did not object to the drug quantity amount on direct appeal, and even if we had the authority to review this issue again, the law of the case doctrine precludes us from reviewing the finding that Hill was accountable for 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See Stinson, </em>97 F.3d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In sum, the district court properly found that Hill was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706, because he was responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and his offense level remained 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1); <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. The court also did not err by not considering the 3553(a) factors because these factors only need to be considered if a defendant is eligible for \u00a7 3582 relief, and Hill was not eligible for relief. <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (stating a district court first must discern whether an amendment would lower a guideline range and then consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determining whether, and to what extent, to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence). Moreover, the district court could not have resentenced Hill based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone because they do not provide an independent basis for reconsideration of his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (only authorizing a court to reduce a sentence where a defendant\u2019s original sentencing range has been reduced by the Sentencing Commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Likewise, contrary to Hill\u2019s suggestion, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not provide an independent basis for \u00a7 3582 relief, and the transition from mandatory to advisory guidelines did not grant the district court jurisdiction to reduce Hill\u2019s sentence. <em>See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369 (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent basis for a sentence reduction); <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
