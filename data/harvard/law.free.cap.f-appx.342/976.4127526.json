The Government responded that it chose not to call all of its potential witnesses because such testimony \u201cwouldn\u2019t have added any more evidence\u201d. The Government then stated: \u201cIf [defense counsel] had really wanted to answer some of the questions \u2014 \u201d. The court interrupted, stated the Government\u2019s comments were improper, and instructed the jury to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-21\">Salcido maintains the district court abused its discretion when, following a hearing on his new-trial motion, it denied the motion by written order. Salcido maintains the Government\u2019s comments suggested the uncalled witnesses\u2019 testimony would have bolstered the Government\u2019s evidence and improperly shifted the burden of proof to him. In addition, he contends that the district court\u2019s instruction failed to cure these defects because it ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>dressed the burden shifting but not the bolstered evidence of possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">A district court\u2019s grant or denial of a defendant\u2019s new-trial motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 893 (5th Cir.1997). The motion should not be granted \u201cunless there would be a miscarriage of justice or the weight of the evidence preponderates against the verdict\u201d. <em>United States v. Wall, </em>389 F.3d 457, 466 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d at 898).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Where a defendant claims a miscarriage of justice occurred due to prosecutorial misconduct, our analysis consists of two steps. \u201cFirst, we assess whether \u2018the prosecutor made an improper remark.\u2019 If so, ... we ask whether the defendant was prejudiced.\u201d <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>571 F.3d 401, 408 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Fields, </em>483 F.3d 313, 358 (5th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">If we conclude the prosecutor made an improper remark, our court considers three factors in determining whether the misconduct constitutes reversible error: \u201c(1) the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, (2) the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge, and (3) the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction\u201d. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Guevara, </em>162 F.3d 863, 874 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">The Government\u2019s remarks were not improper. In <em>Stephens, </em>we examined an exchange similar to that between Salcido\u2019s defense counsel and the Government. 571 F.3d at 407-08. There, our court held the Government\u2019s comments were a response to defense counsel\u2019s statements and not an attempt to shift the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 408. Here, the comments were likewise a response to defense counsel\u2019s statements and did not constitute misconduct. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the Government\u2019s comments were improper, Salcido fails to show the requisite prejudice. For obvious reasons, our court affords considerable weight to the district court\u2019s \u201con-the-scene assessment of the prejudicial effect\u201d. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>72 F.3d 1200, 1207 (5th Cir.1996). Here, in denying the new-trial motion, the district court concluded: the magnitude of the prejudicial effect was small; the immediate objection and curative instruction were effective; and there was adequate other evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Salcido, </em>No. MO-08-CR-114, slip op. at 3 (W.D. Tex. 19 Nov. 2008). And, as in <em>Stephens, </em>the district court gave a curative instruction, in addition to its general burden-of-proof instruction. <em>See Stephens, </em>571 F.3d at 408 n. 9. Moreover, evidence of Salcido\u2019s guilt was more than sufficient to support the verdict. <em>See id. </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
