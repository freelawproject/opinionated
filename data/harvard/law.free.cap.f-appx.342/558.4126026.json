The BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a continuance, despite Giunco\u2019s assertion that his initial immigration counsel was ineffective for failing to timely apply for immigration relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In his petition, Giunco argues that the BIA erred by finding that he abandoned his application for relief. He maintains that he had a path to lawful permanent residence through non-discretionary relief, a visa as a religious worker. Giunco argues that he would have been eligible for adjustment under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, if his initial immigration lawyer had not defrauded him. He maintains that the BIA erred by finding that he did not qualify for lawful permanent residence because he was eligible for INA \u00a7 245(i) relief as a religious worker. He asserts that he was not required to comply with <em>Matter of Lazada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to show ineffective assistance of counsel because he was not making a motion to reopen. Further, he argues that he suffered prejudice because he was seeking non-discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\u201cWe review the denial of a motion for continuance for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Chacku v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1281, 1285 (11th Cir.2008). Immigration regulations allow an immigration judge to grant a continuance for good cause. <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29). When \u201cthe only thing standing between [an alien] and permanent residence status [is] the agency\u2019s approval of his ... visa petition and adjustment of status application,\u201d denial of a continuance by the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals is an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1286. However, denial of a continuance when an alien is not \u201cstatutorily eligible for adjustment of status\u201d is not an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), certain categories of aliens not legally admitted may apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). To qualify, as further discussed, an alien must have been physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1255(i)(1)(C). Additionally, the alien must be a beneficiary of a petition for classification or an application for a labor certificate. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1255(i)(1)(B). An application for a labor certificate is unavailable unless the Secretary of Labor certifies that there are insufficient willing, able, and qualified workers for a job. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 1182(a)(5)(A). A petition for classification requires that an application be filed before April 30, 2001. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1255(i)(1)(B)(i). Further, such a petition must be submitted by an American citizen for the alien\u2019s benefit. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(A)(i). An alien entering the United States to act as a religious minister can be admitted as a \u2018special immigrant\u2019 if the alien meets certain qualifications, but the alien does not automatically become an American citizen. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Because the record shows that Giunco was not eligible for relief pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), we conclude that the IJ and BIA did not abuse their discretion by affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a continuance. Accordingly, we deny Giunco\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
