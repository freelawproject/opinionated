Tran appeals his convictions and 60-month concurrent sentences for one count of bankruptcy fraud and two counts of making a false declaration/certificate/verification/statement under penalty of perjury in relation to a bankruptcy proceeding, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 152 and 157. On appeal, Tran argues that the district court reversibly erred by denying Tran\u2019s motion to suppress his post-Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> statement when the court failed to address explicitly Tran\u2019s argument that, before receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he had invoked his post-indictment Sixth Amendment right to counsel when he allegedly requested his bankruptcy lawyer\u2019s business card. Second, he argues that the evidence presented at his suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>hearing concerning the request for his bankruptcy attorney\u2019s card and the court\u2019s finding that he testified falsely was insufficient to support the court\u2019s application of a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">\n<em>I. Invocation of the Right to Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 748-49 (11th Cir.2002). We are \u201crequired to accept the district court\u2019s factual findings as true unless they are clearly erroneous, but the district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts is reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 749 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d <em>Texas v. Cobb, </em>532 U.S. 162, 167, 121 S.Ct. 1335, 1340, 149 L.Ed.2d 321 (2001) (quotation and alteration omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-7\">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel ... is offense specific. It cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions, for it does not attach until a prosecution is commenced, that is, at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings \u2014 whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 121 S.Ct. 1335 (quotation and alterations omitted). The Sixth Amendment attaches at the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings. <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 631, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 1408, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986). \u201c[OJnce a criminal defendant invokes his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a subsequent waiver of that right \u2014 even if voluntary, knowing, and intelligent under traditional standards \u2014 is presumed invalid if secured pursuant to police-initiated conversation.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Harvey, </em>494 U.S. 344, 345,110 S.Ct. 1176, 1177, 108 L.Ed.2d 293 (1990) (citing <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 89 L.Ed.2d 631). The district court must determine if the accused actually invoked his right to counsel. <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 95,105 S.Ct. 490, 492, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984). Whether a defendant has invoked his right to counsel is an objective inquiry. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 458-59, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2355, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">In <em>Davis, </em>the petitioner was interviewed regarding his possible involvement in a homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 114 S.Ct. at 2353. Before being interviewed, Davis waived his rights to remain silent and to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 114 S.Ct. at 2353. A hour and a half into the interview Davis said, \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer.\u201d At that point in the interview, the agents inquired as to whether the petitioner was asking for a lawyer or was just making a comment about a lawyer. Davis replied that he was not asking for a lawyer and that he did not want a lawyer. The interview then continued for another hour until Davis said, \u201cI think I want a lawyer before I say anything else.\u201d The interview then ceased. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASj\">if the suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning. Rather, the suspect must unambiguously request counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court recognized that the requirement for a clear assertion of the right to counsel might disadvantage suspects who because of a lack of linguistic skills would not clearly articulate their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>right to counsel although they actually wanted to have a lawyer present. <em>Id. </em>at 460, 114 S.Ct. at 2356. Nonetheless, the Court believed requiring police officers to make difficult judgment calls about whether a suspect invoked his right to counsel was more problematic. <em>See id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">In the instant case, the district court did not make a specific finding as to whether Tran made his alleged request for his bankruptcy lawyer\u2019s card and, thus, did not explicitly address whether Tran invoked his right to counsel. Nevertheless, remand is unnecessary because, even if Tran had made the request to retrieve his bankruptcy lawyer\u2019s business card, this request was too ambiguous to have constituted an invocation of his right to counsel. <em>See Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355. As the Supreme Court has stated, a \u201csuspect must unambiguously request counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Tran did not make an unambiguous request. Therefore, the district court did not err when it refused to grant Tran\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">\n<em>II. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">\u201cAlthough Booker<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> established a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard for the sentence finally imposed on a defendant, the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Booker </em>that district courts must still consider the Guidelines in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). Moreover, \u201c[njothing in <em>Booker </em>suggests that a reasonableness standard should govern review of the interpretation and application as advisory of the Guidelines by a district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(reaffirming that the <em>pre-Booker </em>standard as to the Guidelines still applies). \u201cAlthough under <em>Booker, the </em>Sentencing Guidelines are an advisory rather than a mandatory regime, the district court remains obliged to <em>consult </em>and <em>take into account </em>the Guidelines in sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted)(emphasis in original). \u201cThis consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">Where the district court has to make a particularized assessment of the defendant\u2019s credibility or demeanor in determining whether U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 applies, such as when applying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement for perjury, we accord special deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations and review for clear error. <em>United States v. Banks, </em>347 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-12\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of the conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">The commentary to this section notes that \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\u201d is an example of conduct to which this enhancement applies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4(b). The commentary also notes that \u201cproviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate\u201d is an example of conduct to which this enhancement applies. <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 4(f). In addition, the commentary states that \u201c \u2018[mjaterial\u2019 evidence, fact, statement, or information, as used in this section, means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 6. We have held \u201cthat the threshold for materiality under the commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 is conspicuously low.\u201d <em>United States v. Odedina, </em>980 F.2d 705, 707 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation omitted). For this enhancement to apply on a finding of perjury, the four elements of perjury must be present. <em>See United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002). The four elements are \u201c(1) the testimony must be under oath or affirmation; (2) the testimony must be false; (3) the testimony must be material; and (4) the testimony must be given with the willful intent to provide false testimony and not as a result of a mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Furthermore, we have stated that \u201c[wjhen applying this enhancement, the district court should make specific findings as to each alleged instance of obstruction by identifying the materially false statements individually. However, a general finding that an enhancement is warranted suffices if it encompasses all of the factual predicates necessary for a perjury finding.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763 (quotations, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Also, we have established standards for whether a defendant has waived the argument that he is entitled to particularized findings that perjury justifies an obstruction enhancement. <em>See United States v. Hubert, </em>138 F.3d 912 (11th Cir.1998). In <em>Hubert, </em>the appellant\u2019s sentence was enhanced for obstruction of justice based upon his trial testimony and his prior testimony at two hearings. 138 F.3d at 914-15 (11th Cir.1998). Hubert argued that the district court failed to make a sufficiently detailed finding that he committed perjury and obstructed justice. <em>Id. </em>at 915. While noting the detailed findings were not necessary given the sufficiency of the record, we concluded that, in any event, because Hubert failed to request particularized findings regarding the perjurious statements at the sentencing hearing, he waived this argument. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">By failing to request that the court make particularized findings as to the perjurious testimony, Tran has waived this argument. <em>See Hubert, </em>138 F.3d at 915. Moreover, the court\u2019s general finding that Tran had committed perjury or made materially false statements is sufficient to support the application of the enhancement. <em>See Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763. First, Tran testified under oath. Second, the court concluded that Tran\u2019s testimony was false. Third, Tran\u2019s testimony was material because it \u201cwould tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 6. Because the standard for materiality under \u00a7 3C1.1 is \u201cconspicuously low,\u201d the fact that Tran\u2019s alleged request for his bankruptcy lawyer\u2019s card, if believed, was insufficient to invoke his right to counsel does not negate the materiality of his testimony because it would tend to influence the court. <em>See Odedina, </em>980 F.2d at 707. Finally, it is apparent from the record that Tran\u2019s testimony could not have been the result of mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">Because Tran\u2019s alleged request for his bankruptcy lawyer\u2019s business card was insufficient to invoke his right to counsel and because the court\u2019s general finding supports the application of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 obstruetion-of-justice enhancement, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Tran\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">. <em>Miranda v.
