After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">After trial, a jury convicted Olmedo of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 (Count I), possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count 2), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1952(a)(3) (Count 3). In 1990, the district court sentenced Olmedo to 272 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2 and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 3, all terms to run concurrently. Olmedo also received sentences of five years\u2019 supervised release on Counts 1 and 2 and two years\u2019 supervised release on Count 3, all terms to run concurrently. The terms of his supervised release prohibited him from committing any federal, state, or local crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In October 2007, after his release from prison, Olmedo\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court for revocation of Olmedo\u2019s supervised release. The probation officer alleged that Olmedo violated the terms of his supervised release when he was arrested in September 2007 for possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">After a hearing, the district court found that Olmedo had violated the terms of his supervised release and revoked Olmedo\u2019s supervised release. The district court sentenced Olmedo to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 30 months\u2019 supervised release. This sentence was to run consecutive to Olmedo\u2019s sentence for the September 2007 drug possession offense, to which Olmedo had pled guilty but had not yet been sentenced. Olmedo objected to the imposition of supervised release and to the court\u2019s decision to run the 24-month imprisonment sentence consecutive to a sentence he had not yet received.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Olmedo then filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), arguing that his sentence violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the U.S. Constitution by imposing a new term of supervised release following the original term of imprisonment. The government opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">The district court denied Olmedo\u2019s motion. Olmedo appeals his sentence and the denial of his Rule 35(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">To understand Olmedo\u2019s arguments, we first discuss 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583, entitled \u201cInclusion of a term of supervised release after imprisonment.\u201d At the time of Ol-medo\u2019s 1990 conviction, \u00a7 3583(e)(3) was the only subsection that detailed what a district court could do upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (1988). In 1990, \u00a7 3583(e)(3) authorized a district court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">revoke a term of supervised release, and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release without credit for the time previously served on postrelease supervision, if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person violated a condition of supervised release....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-16\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\">In 1994, Congress amended \u00a7 3583, adding subsection (h). Subsection (h) ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>plicitly provides a district court with the authority to order a term of supervised release after a revocation and reimpris-onment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (1994) (providing that \u201c[w]hen a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment that is less than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3), the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Olmedo first argues that \u201cwhere, as here, the defendant\u2019s original conviction occurred prior to the 1994 amendment, the district court\u2019s authority to impose post-revocation penalties is governed by the pre-amendment version of \u00a7 3583.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, Olmedo argues that subsection (h), added in 1994, does not apply to his case. Recognizing a potential <em>ex post facto </em>problem with applying a 1994 statute to Olmedo\u2019s 1990 conviction, the district court refused to apply subsection (h) to Olmedo. The government does not challenge this point on appeal. In fact, the government goes a step further, conceding that the relevant part of the pre-amendment version of \u00a7 3583 (subsection (e)(3)) governs Olmedo\u2019s case. Thus, the question is whether \u00a7 3583(e)(3), before \u00a7 3583(h) was added, authorized the district court to impose supervised release after a revocation and reimprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We answered this question \u201cno\u201d in <em>United States v. Tatum, </em>998 F.2d 893, 895-96 (11th Cir.1993). This Court reasoned in <em>Tatum </em>that \u00a7 3583(e)(3) permitted a district court to \u201crevoke\u201d a term of supervised release and \u201c \u2018require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3)). Once revoked, however, the term of supervised release no longer exists to be modified or extended, and nothing in \u00a7 3583(e) stated that the district court could impose a new term of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>We therefore joined the majority of our sister circuits in concluding that, pre-amendment, \u00a7 3583(e)(3) did not allow a district court to impose post-revocation supervised release. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Olmedo\u2019s problem is that the Supreme Court subsequently decided <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 703-13, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 1802-07, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000), which expressly disagreed with <em>Tatum </em>and held that the pre-amendment version of \u00a7 3583 (specifically subsection (e)(3)) authorized a new term of supervised release after revocation and reimpris-onment. The Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>noted that nine circuits, including this Court in <em>Tatum, </em>had held that pre-amendment \u00a7 3583(e)(3) did not empower a district court to impose supervised release after a revocation and reimprisonment, but that two circuits found that pre-amendment \u00a7 3583(e)(3) did grant the district courts that power. <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 698 n. 2,120 S.Ct. at 1799 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court agreed with the two circuits that held that the district court had that power. The Supreme Court first pointed out that, because Johnson\u2019s original offense occurred before the amendment\u2019s effective date in 1994, \u00a7 3583(h) did not apply to his case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 702, 120 S.Ct. at 1802. \u201cThe case turns, instead, simply on whether \u00a7 3583(e)(3) permitted imposition of supervised release following a recommitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702-03, 120 S.Ct. at 1802. The Supreme Court concluded that it did, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 713, 120 S.Ct. at 1807 (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Johnson </em>in effect overruled <em>Tatum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Accordingly, the district court here did not err in finding that <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 3583(e)(3) controlled Olmedo\u2019s case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor is there an <em>ex post facto </em>problem in applying <em>Johnson </em>because it applied \u00a7 3583 as it existed at the time of Olme-do\u2019s original 1990 conviction (containing subsection (e)(3) and not subsection (h)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">In sum, from a purely textual perspective, the more plausible reading of \u00a7 3583(e)(3) before its amendment and the addition of subsection (h) leaves open the possibility of supervised release after reincarceration. Pre-Guide-lines practice, linguistic continuity from the old scheme to the current one, and the obvious thrust of congressional sentencing policy confirm that, <em>in applying the law as before the enactment of subsection (h), </em>district courts have the authority to order terms of supervised release following reimprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Olmedo also argues that, pursuant to the language of \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and <em>United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987 (11th Cir.2005), his maximum allowable supervised release term should be reduced by the amount of time he already had spent under supervised release. Olmedo\u2019s reliance on <em>Williams </em>is misplaced. <em>Williams </em>requires the district court to give Olmedo credit for revocation time served in prison for previous violations of supervised release. <em>See </em>425 F.3d at 989. However, Olmedo does not assert, and the record does not reveal, that he had a previous violation of supervised release or had served any previous prison time for a violation of supervised release. Instead, given the plain language of \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the district court was not required to consider Olmedo\u2019s time served on \u201cpostrelease supervision.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1988); <em>Williams, </em>425 F.3d at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Olmedo has not shown that the district court erred in imposing his sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 30 months\u2019 supervised release. Therefore, we affirm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">. We review the legality of a sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of a term of supervised release <em>de novo. United States v.

Petitioner Johnson was convicted of a felony in 1993, a year before \u00a7 3583 was amended to include subsection (h). <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 697, 120 S.Ct. at 1799. When Johnson violated the terms of his supervised release, the district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 18 months' im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>prisonment and 12 months' supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 698, 120 S.Ct. at 1799.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">.We also note that, in <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that the combined length of the new imprisonment and supervised release terms could not exceed the original supervised release term that provided the foundation for the new terms. <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 705-06, 120 S.Ct. at 1803. However, this is not an issue in this case, as Olmedo's combined 54-month term on revocation was less than his original 60-month supervised release term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-16\">.

Olmedo also states that he wishes to preserve his argument that the district court improperly imposed a sentence to run consecutive to a sentence that was not yet imposed. However, as the district court found and Ol-medo correctly notes in his brief, this argument is foreclosed by this Court's precedent. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>330 F.3d 1305, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>district court has the authority to impose a federal sentence consecutive to an unim-posed, future sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
