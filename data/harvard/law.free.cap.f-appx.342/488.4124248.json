White argues that adverse testimony from co-conspirators at his trial provided in exchange for recommended sentence reductions through plea agreements violated the federal anti-bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(2), which forbids anyone from promising anything of value to any person to testify under oath in a judicial proceeding. Because White\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our precedent, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">In July of 2006, White was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than fifty grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A), and possession with intent to distribute approximately 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). <em>See </em>Doc. 49 at 420-21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court sentenced him to 400 months of imprisonment on both counts, to be served concurrently. <em>See </em>Doc. 62 at 2. We affirmed White\u2019s convictions and sentences in <em>United States v. White, </em>270 Fed. Appx. 824 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">During his trial, a number of co-conspirators testified against White pursuant to their plea agreements. <em>See </em>Doc. 47 at 52-71, 88-109, 143-53, 167-77, 199-204; Doc. 48 at 226-30, 252-60, 274-85, 299-310. On cross-examination, the coconspirators conceded that they had chosen to testify against White in order to receive recommendations for sentence reductions based on plea agreements. <em>See </em>Doc. 47 at 72-78, 117-22, 153-58, 178-87, 204-17; Doc. 48 at 231-39, 261-72, 286-94, 311-20. In his Rule 33 motion to the district court, White claimed that (1) the government violated the federal anti-bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(2), by offering recommendations for sentence reductions to his co-conspirators who testified against him at trial; and that (2) the record showed that the government failed to provide discovery materials to White. <em>See </em>Doc. 87 at 5-24. As White did not raise the alleged discovery abuse by the government in his appeal to us, he has abandoned that claim. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that an issue is abandoned if the defendant fails to proffer argument on its merits on appeal). Accordingly, the only issue before us is White\u2019s argument that the government violated the federal anti-bribery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for [a] new trial for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Sweat, </em>555 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Rule 33 allows a defendant to file a motion for a new trial within three years after the verdict if the motion is based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d or seven days after the verdict if based on \u201c[o]ther grounds.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b). The court may grant the motion <em>\u201cif </em>the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). In this case, White predicates his Rule 33 motion on newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>Doc. 87 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>we observed that the movant of a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence must establish the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">(1) the evidence was discovered after trial, (2) the failure of the defendant to discover the evidence was not due to a lack of due diligence, (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, (4) the evidence is material to issues before the court, and (5) the evidence is such that a new trial would probably produce a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">341 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We also conclusively have determined that cooperation provisions of plea agreements do not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Lowery, </em>166 F.3d 1119, 1124 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Given our decision in <em>Lowery, </em>we need not consider whether Wdiite has established each of the five requirements for obtaining a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. His argument that the cooperation provisions of his co-conspirators\u2019 plea agreements violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(2) is foreclosed by our circuit precedent. <em>See Lowery, </em>166 F.3d at 1124. Consequently, the district court did not err in denying WTiite\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">White appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial. His argument that adverse testimony from co-conspirators at his trial provided in exchange for recommended sentence reductions through plea agreements violated the federal anti-bribery statute is foreclosed by our circuit precedent. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-12\">. All record cites reflect a document cite from the electronic record on appeal.
