(\u201cWal-Mart\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-20\">Williams\u2019 amended complaint alleges that while shopping in Wal-Mart, she slipped on a puddle of water, which resulted in injury to her leg, hip, and shoulder. Williams seeks compensatory and punitive damages for negligence and wantonness, based on Wal-Mart\u2019s employees\u2019 alleged failure to detect and clean up the liquid.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">Wal-Mart moved for summary judgment, arguing that Williams had not met her burden, under Alabama negligence law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of establishing that Wal-Mart had: (1) actual notice of the puddle; (2) constructive notice; or (3) that the store was otherwise delinquent for failing to discover and remove the hazard. Williams replied that she had proffered sufficient evidence to demonstrate constructive notice and/or delinquency on the part of Wal-Mart, and, alternatively, an adverse inference should be drawn against Wal-Mart because it allegedly destroyed or withheld video sur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>veillanee tapes from Williams. The district court concluded that Williams had not met her burden of proving notice, rejected Williams\u2019 spoliation argument, and granted summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart on both the negligence and wantonness claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Williams now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">After a thorough review of the record and briefs, we are in accord with the district court that Williams failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Wal-Mart was negligent in failing to clean up the water that Williams allegedly slipped on and that Williams\u2019 spoliation of evidence argument is merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">For the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-13\">. Because jurisdiction in this case is based on diversity of citizenship, the forum slate\u2019s substantive law applies. <em>See McMahan v. Toto, </em>256 F.3d 1120, 1131-32 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-15\">. Williams does not challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the wantonness claim. This issue has been abandoned. <em>See Rioux v. City of Atlanta, </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
