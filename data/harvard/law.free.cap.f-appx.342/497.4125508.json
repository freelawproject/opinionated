On appeal, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 651 to the <em>United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d), which clarified the standard for imposing an upward departure based on the inadequacy of a defendant\u2019s criminal history category. Jones also argues the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a sentence reduction because his original sentence was arbitrary, the district court relied on prior convictions that may not have complied with <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), and Jones\u2019s sentence exceeded the guideline imprisonment range. Jones further argues that (1) his sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and gives rise to a presumption of vindictiveness; and (2) we have discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We review a district court\u2019s resolution of a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and review issues of legal interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003). We review the district court\u2019s determination of the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>de novo. United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The amendment to the Guidelines must be retroactively applicable, however, and only amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) qualify as retroactively applicable amendments warranting \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), (c); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907-08 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Amendment 651 elucidated, <em>inter alia, </em>the standard for imposing departures pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 based on the inadequacy of a defendant\u2019s criminal history category. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 651, Reason for Amendment. Amendment 651 is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), and, therefore, it is not a retroactively applicable amendment that may be the basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (listing the retroactively applicable amendments, which does not include Amendment 651).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201cdo not constitute a full re-sentencing of the defendant\u201d or a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resen-tencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence are the sort of \u201cextraneous\u201d issues that are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent basis for granting a sentence reduction in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings because <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Jones\u2019s arguments are unavailing because Amendment 651 cannot provide the basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, and the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
