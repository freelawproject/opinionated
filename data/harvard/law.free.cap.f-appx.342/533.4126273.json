Cardona Montoya (\u201cCardona\u201d) petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) denial of his motion to reconsider its prior order denying his motion to reopen his asylum proceedings based on changed country conditions. After review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C), INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)) (alteration in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Cardona\u2019s motion to reconsider because Cardona did not identify any errors of fact or law in the prior BIA decision denying his motion to reopen. The BIA concluded that Cardona\u2019s motion to reopen failed to present evidence that was both material and previously unavailable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (stating a motion to reopen shall not be granted unless the movant presents evidence that is \u201cmaterial and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing\u201d); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Cardona\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not point to any errors in the BIA\u2019s conclusion. Rather, Cardona repeated his fears about returning to Colombia and argued that the evidence he submitted with his motion to reopen was sufficient to show changed country conditions. In other words, Cardona reiterated arguments he had presented unsuccessfully in his motion to reopen. Cardona\u2019s argument that his motion to reconsider should have been granted because his motion to reopen established a prima facie case for asylum is without merit. The BIA has the discretion to deny either a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider \u201c \u2018even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.1999) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a) (1999) now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Because Cardona failed to identify errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-5\">.

Also, the affidavit Cardona submitted related to activities he undertook in Colombia between 1995 and 1998 and addressed events already described by Cardona at his asylum hearing. The email from Cardona's wife merely provided additional evidence of telephone threats that the IJ already had determined were inadequate grounds for relief. The news articles Cardona submitted documenting persecution of farmers and legislators in Colombia after his asylum hearing were not material to Car-dona's allegations, as he was neither a farmer nor a legislator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-14\">.Because we conclude that the BIA properly denied Cardona's motion to reconsider on the merits, we do not address the BIA's alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tive basis for denying the motion as numerically barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
