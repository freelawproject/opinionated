After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">On appeal, Monsalve challenges two of the district court\u2019s advisory guidelines calculations. Specifically, Monsalve appeals the district court\u2019s fact findings that (1) he caused two victims (&lt;rVictims 1 and 2\u201d) to engage in sexual acts by placing them \u201cin fear,\u201d which triggered a higher base offense level, and (2) Victims 1 and 2 were vulnerable victims, which increased his base offense level by two levels. We first review the procedural history and Mon-salve\u2019s offense conduct on which the district court based these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">A. Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">In 2007, Monsalve and four codefendants were indicted on 11 counts. Count 1 charged Monsalve with conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(I) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, with four objects of the conspiracy: (1) knowing that force, fraud, and coercion would be used to cause a person to engage in prostitution, transporting, recruiting, and harboring such a person to receive a benefit; (2) transporting illegal aliens for the purpose of commercial advantage and private financial gain; (3) knowingly importing female aliens and harboring them for purposes of prostitution; and (4) knowingly transporting, or attempting to transport, aliens with the intent that they engage in prostitution. The indictment also charged Monsalve with sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1591 and 2 (Counts 2, 3, and 4); transporting and harboring illegal aliens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iii), (B)(i) (Count 5); aiding and abetting the importation of aliens for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Counts 6, 7, and 8); and aiding and abetting the transportation of aliens for prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2421 and 2 (Counts 9,10, and 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">B. Plea and Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Monsalve pled guilty to Counts 1 and 5 to 11. Mon-salve admitted that he was guilty of Objects 2 through 4 of the Count 1 conspiracy charge. However, Monsalve specifically did not plead guilty to Object 1, which charged him with transporting, recruiting, and harboring a person while knowing that force, fraud, and coercion would be used to cause that person to engage in prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Monsalve\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) detailed his offense conduct. In 2005, Monsalve and others began smuggling women into the United States and making them work as prostitutes until they paid off their smuggling fees. Mon-salve paid someone in Guatemala to recruit women to the United States to work as prostitutes. Monsalve also used a contact in Costa Rica, who recruited Colombian women for Monsalve and provided fraudulent passports and identification cards. Most of the women knew they would work as prostitutes in the United States, but Victims 1 and 2 were promised legitimate work.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Monsalve charged the Guatemalan women a $15,000 to $16,000 smuggling fee and the Colombian women a $20,000 smuggling fee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The women were expected to work six to seven days a week and have sex with approximately 20 to 25 men a night. Mon-salve typically charged customers $30 for 15 minutes of sex. Monsalve and his group kept all of the proceeds and applied $15 of each transaction to that woman\u2019s smuggling debt. After a woman worked off her smuggling debt, which generally took three to four months, the woman could continue to work as a prostitute and keep $15 from each transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Monsalve ran the daily operation of the conspiracy, which operated out of Tampa, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, Florida. Each city had its own manager, each of whom was indicted as a codefendant. The women rotated among cities on a weekly basis. Monsalve and his codefendants provided residences for the women, delivered them to customers, and transported them from city to city.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">Victims 1 and 2 were recruited from Guatemala and, unlike most of the other women recruited, were promised high-paying, legitimate jobs in the United States and assistance in becoming United States citizens. After being smuggled into the United States and transported to Tallahassee, the women were picked up by Jorge Melchor, one of Monsalve\u2019s codefendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Melchor told Victims 1 and 2 that their job was to have sex with men in order to repay their debts and that they should have been told that in Guatemala. On the day they arrived in Tallahassee, Melchor drove Victims 1 and 2 to shop for clothes and then to various residences where they had sex with numerous men.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">The next day, Melchor received a call from Monsalve. Melchor told Monsalve that Victims 1 and 2 did not want to have sex with more men. Monsalve talked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Victims 1 and 2 and insisted that they had to go back to work. Melchor threatened the women that, if they attempted to flee, he would find them and bring them back and that, if they went to the police, they would be deported. Victim 2 had sex with more men later that day. The following day, Victims 1 and 2 fled from the Tallahassee house.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">C. PSI\u2019s Advisory Guidelines Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The PSI applied the multiple count aggregation rules under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 to determine Monsalve\u2019s offense level.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The PSI grouped Objects 2 and 3 of Count 1 and Counts 6 to 11 by victim for each of the 16 victims, providing 16 count groups, and calculated the offense levels for these 16 count groups under \u00a7 2G1.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Gl.l(d)(l), 3D1.2(b). The PSI also identified a 17th count group, which addressed the conduct reflected in Object 4 of the conspiracy, as well as Count 5, and calculated the offense level for this 17th count group under \u00a7 2L1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Monsalve\u2019s challenges on appeal focus on count groups 1 and 2, which addressed the conduct related to Victims 1 and 2. In calculating the offense level for count groups 1 and 2, the PSI noted that \u00a7 2G1.1 set Monsalve\u2019s base offense level at 14. The PSI applied several enhancements under \u00a7 2G1.1, including a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Gl.l(b)(l) because Monsalve coerced Victims 1 and 2 into engaging in prostitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The PSI initially determined that the adjusted offense level for count groups 1 and 2 of the 17 count groups was 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">The \u00a7 2G1.1 enhancements and this initial adjusted offense level of 26 became irrelevant, however, when the PSI next reported that Monsalve caused Victims 1 and 2 to engage in a sexual act by placing them in fear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based on this finding, the PSI stated that the cross-reference in \u00a7 2Gl.l(c)(l) applied and required that \u00a7 2A3.1 be used to calculate Monsalve\u2019s base offense level.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 2A3.1, Mon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>salve\u2019s base offense level for count groups 1 and 2 was 30. The PSI then recommended several enhancements, including a two-level, vulnerable-victim enhancement under \u00a7 3Al.l(b). Monsalve\u2019s final adjusted offense level for each of count groups 1 and 2 was 38. Ultimately, after a two-level increase under \u00a7 3D1.4, Monsalve\u2019s final, combined adjusted offense level was 40.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The PSI recommended a denial of any adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because \u201c[t]he defendant has failed to accept personal responsibility for his involvement in the offense as required by \u00a7 3E1.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">D. Objections to the PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Before sentencing, Monsalve objected to, <em>inter alia, </em>the preliminary four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Gl.l(b)(l) and the application of the cross-reference in \u00a7 2Gl.l(c)(l) on the grounds that there was no coercion or fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The government responded with excerpts from the testimony of Victims 1 and 2 at Melchor\u2019s trial, which the government claimed demonstrated that Monsalve placed Victims 1 and 2 in fear. At Mel-chor\u2019s trial, Victim 1 testified that she worked as a waitress in Guatemala and was led to believe that she could continue to work as a waitress if she used a smuggler to enter the United States. After smugglers helped Victim 1 enter the United States, her identity documents were taken from her. Upon arriving in Tallahassee, Melchor informed Victim 1 that she had to work as a prostitute. That same day, she was taken to approximately 10 residences and had sex with one to six men at each location.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">During that time, Victim 1 complained, and Melchor responded that she had to have sex with more men before he would take her back home. Victims 1 and 2 did not tell Melchor that they had been promised jobs as waitresses because they feared that Melchor would then watch them closely, making escape impossible. After having sex with several men, Victim l\u2019s genitals hurt and Victim 2 was bleeding. The next day, Victims 1 and 2 refused to go to work, and Melchor telephoned Monsalve. Monsalve told the women that they had to keep working to pay off their debts. Victim 2 went out and had sex with more men.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">E. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">At sentencing, the government called Melchor to testify. Melchor stated that he picked up Victims 1 and 2 when they arrived in Tallahassee and took them to have sex with men. Afterwards, Victims 1 and 2 complained about having to work as prostitutes. The two women told Melchor that they believed they were going to work as waitresses. After he explained the real nature of the work, both women agreed to do their best. Melchor remembered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>one of the victims complained and cried a lot about working as a prostitute and indicated that she did not want to work anymore, but on other occasions she stated that the work was tolerable because of the money. When asked if Victims 1 and 2 told him that they thought they would be working at a bar and not as prostitutes, Melchor stated that \u201cat the beginning, yeah, they all [come] in with that thought.\u201d At some point, Monsalve called Melchor, and Melchor informed Monsalve that Victims 1 and 2 were complaining and did not want to work. Monsalve spoke directly to Victims 1 and 2, and both women started crying as soon as they spoke to Monsalve. Melchor stated that he did not hear the conversation between Monsalve and Victims 1 and 2 because he left the room. The women fled after their conversation with Monsalve.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The district court sustained Monsalve\u2019s objections to the PSI\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility but overruled Monsalve\u2019s other objections and adopted the PSI\u2019s findings and calculations. Notably, the district court found that: (1) the cross-reference in \u00a7 2Gl.l(c)(l) applied because Monsalve\u2019s telephone conversation with Victims 1 and 2 was \u201can attempt, at least, to cause them to engage in sexual acts by placing them in fear\u201d; (2) Monsalve\u2019s telephone comments were an overt, coercive act to make the women have sex, against their wills, to pay off their debts; (3) Monsalve talked to the women because they had \u201cbalked at engaging in sexual acts\u201d; and (4) Victims 1 and 2 were crying after talking to Monsalve. The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s finding that the women initially were coerced into prostitution because they: (1) did not find out that they would be working as prostitutes until arriving in the United States illegally; (2) did not know anyone in the United States; (3) did not speak English; (4) had a $16,000 debt \u201changing over [their] head[s]\u201d; and (5) were threatened by Melchor, who was working under Mon-salve\u2019s direction, that he would find them if they fled and could have them deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">After granting a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the district court found that Monsalve\u2019s new adjusted offense level was 37. With Mon-salve\u2019s criminal history category of I, his advisory guidelines range was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Monsalve declined to present anything further regarding the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The district court imposed a sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. Monsalve appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Monsalve first argues that the district court erred in applying the cross-reference in \u00a7 2Gl.l(c)(l) based on its finding of fear.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Monsalve argues that any finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>by the district court regarding fear was based on equivocal and contradictory evidence because he specifically did not plead guilty or stipulate to Object 1 of Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Neither the guidelines nor the statutes referenced by the guidelines (namely, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242) define \u201cfear.\u201d However, our sister circuits have stated that \u201c[t]he definition of \u2018fear,\u2019 as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242(1), is very broad.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 885 (10th Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Gavin, </em>959 F.2d 788, 791 (9th Cir.1992)). \u201cThe element is satisfied when the defendant\u2019s actions implicitly place the victim in fear of some bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Gavin, </em>959 F.2d at 791 (stating that \u201cthe possible range of \u2018fear,\u2019 is very large\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Here, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in its fact finding that Monsalve placed Victims 1 and 2 in fear or in its application of the cross-reference in \u00a7 2Gl.l(c)(l). The fact finding is supported by the record. Victims 1 and 2 came to the United States thinking they would be waitresses. After arriving in the United States illegally, they were told they owed Monsalve a $16,000 smuggling fee and that they must repay him by working as prostitutes. They had them identification documents taken from them, spoke no English, and depended on Monsalve and his associates for food, water, shelter, and clothing. Melchor, one of Monsalve\u2019s managers, threatened Victims 1 and 2 that he could have them deported if they tried to escape. Moreover, Monsalve personally spoke to Victims 1 and 2 on the phone because they expressed to Melchor that they did not want to continue to prostitute themselves. This conversation left Victims 1 and 2 in tears, and Victim 2 slept with more men shortly thereafter. Because the district court\u2019s finding of fear satisfied the cross-reference requirement in \u00a7 2Gl.l(c)(l), the district court was required to apply \u00a7 2A3.1.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Pipkins, </em>378 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Monsalve also argues that the district court erred in applying the vulnerable-victim enhancement under \u00a7 3Al.l(b) to count groups 1 and 2. Monsalve claims that Victims 1 and 2 showed no susceptibility to criminal conduct and that he did not select the victims due to their vulnerability to the offense. Moreover, Monsalve asserts that it is error to rely solely on the victims\u2019 illegal status as a sign of their vulnerability because this status is a necessary element of the crime of alien smuggling.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Section 3Al.l(b) provides for a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(i). A \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is \u201ca person ... who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n. 2(B). The adjustment should be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>only when \u201cthe defendant selects his victim due to the defendant\u2019s perception of the victim\u2019s vulnerability to the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Day, </em>405 F.3d 1293, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted) (concluding that elderly victims were vulnerable not because of their age, <em>per se, </em>but because the defendants repeatedly targeted the elderly individuals, demonstrating that the defendants knew the victims were particularly vulnerable).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Victims 1 and 2 were vulnerable and therefore applying the vulnerable-victim enhancement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The victims were vulnerable not because of being illegal aliens <em>per se, </em>but because they had no identity papers, and thus would be unlikely to report criminal conduct to the police, had no jobs or income for even basic necessities, making them susceptible to criminal conduct for income, and spoke no English and had no family in the United States or place to live other than what Monsalve provided, making them vulnerable to pressure to engage in criminal conduct. And because Monsalve repeatedly targeted women in Victim 1 and 2\u2019s situation, the district court could infer that Monsalve knew such victims were particularly vulnerable to criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Monsalve\u2019s sentences of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">.

Because we affirm the district court's application of the cross-reference in \u00a7 2G1.1(c)(1) and use of the offense level in \u00a7 2A3.1, Monsalve\u2019s challenge to the coercion enhancement is academic, and we need not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\">. We generally review <em>de novo </em>the application of the vulnerable-victim enhancement, but the district court's determination of a victim's \u201cvulnerability\u201d is a factual finding given due deference. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1317 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Monsalve acknowledges that he did not object explicitly to the victim-related adjustments under \u00a7 3Al.l(b), but argues that he implicitly did so by objecting to the application of the \u00a7 2G1.1(c)(1) cross-reference, as the issue of coercion was common to both. Because we discern no error under any standard of review, we need not address whether Monsalve's objection preserved the issue for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
