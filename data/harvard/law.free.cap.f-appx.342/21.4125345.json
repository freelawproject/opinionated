Thomas appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2241 peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tion. He argues that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 2241 petition without first examining the factors given in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b). He also contends that officials ignored regulatory and statutory authority in connection with the denial of his request for transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">In considering the propriety of the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). One who seeks habeas relief must show that his claims involve either a violation of his constitutional rights or \u201ca narrow range of injuries that could not have been raised on direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213 (5th Cir.2000). Thomas has not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Thomas has no constitutional right to be incarcerated in the facility of his choice. <em>See Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 244-46, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983); <em>Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996). Thomas\u2019s assertion that officials failed to comply with regulations likewise does not raise a viable constitutional claim. <em>See Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1251-52 (5th Cir.1989). Thomas\u2019s claim that officials failed to comply with the pertinent statute when considering his request for transfer also does not involve an infringement of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
