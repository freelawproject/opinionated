For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">In August 2008, a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Florida returned an indictment against Hernandez-Zaldivar, charging him with, <em>inter alia, </em>being an alien found in the United States without permission after having been previously deported on five different occasions and having been previously convicted of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Hernandez-Zaldivar pled guilty to the above charge, pursuant to a written plea agreement. The factual basis contained in the agreement provided that Hernandez-Zaldivar was a native and citizen of Mexico who, after being found during a street gang suppression operation in the Middle District of Florida in August 2008, admitted that he was an illegal alien, had been previously deported from the United States at least five times, and had been previously convicted of possession of a firearm, which was an aggravated felony. As a part of the agreement, and in exchange for Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s participation in the Middle District\u2019s Fast Track Early Disposition Program, he \u201cagree[d] to waive the right to directly appeal [his] ... sentence. ...\u201d This waiver provision did not contain any exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">In advising Hernandez-Zaldivar of his rights at the plea hearing, the district court engaged in the following colloquy regarding the sentence appeal waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">COURT: And then you also agree not to appeal your sentence, that is, you waive your right to a direct appeal ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-15\">Under this waiver provision, you\u2019re giving up that right. Let me give you an example. Let\u2019s assume I made a mistake in calculating your guideline range, and you know I was wrong. Under this waiver provision, you can\u2019t ask the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to correct my mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-16\">You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-18\">COURT: .... Now, are you entering into this entire plea agreement, including the waiver of appeal provision, freely, voluntarily, knowingly and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>telligently because it\u2019s what you want to do and for no other reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">THE DEFENDANT: No, everything is fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">COURT: No, is that why you\u2019re doing it; freely, voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">After Hernandez-Zaldivar admitted to the factual basis contained in the plea agreement, the district court accepted his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Before sentencing, the probation officer filed a petition with the court, alleging that Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s unlawful re-entry offense constituted a violation of the terms of his supervised release imposed in connection with a prior conviction in the District of Arizona.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the probation officer alleged that, on September 27, 2005, Hernandez-Zaldivar was convicted in Arizona of unlawful re-entry after deportation, for which he was sentenced to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment and 24 months of supervised release. He began serving the period of supervised release on April 30, 2007, and the conditions of his supervision prohibited him from re-entering the country without authorization. Thus, because the instant offense violated that condition, the probation officer recommended that the district court revoke Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The court held a joint sentencing/revocation hearing, addressing both the sentence to be imposed for Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s unlawful re-entry offense and the alleged violation of his supervised release in the Arizona case. The court first found, and Hernandez-Zaldivar agreed, that because he had pled guilty to the instant offense, there was no dispute that he had violated the terms and conditions of his supervision. The court found that the Chapter 7 guideline range for this violation was 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and that it carried a statutory maximum penalty of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">With respect to the unlawful re-entry offense, the government moved for a four-level downward departure based on Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s participation in the fast-track program. The court granted the motion \u201cwith great reluctance,\u201d giving Hernandez-Zaldivar a guideline range of 21 to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment. After defense counsel acknowledged that the court correctly calculated the guideline range, he requested that the court impose a sentence at the high-end of the guideline range in light of the fact that Hernandez-Zaldivar had previously been deported on five different occasions. With respect to the sentence to be imposed upon revocation of supervised release, defense counsel similarly requested that the court impose a sentence at the high-end of the Chapter Seven guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">Hernandez-Zaldivar then personally apologized to the United States, but the court expressed doubts about his sincerity. The court explained: \u201cHe obviously hasn\u2019t learned his lesson. He\u2019s been deported several times, he\u2019s on supervised release for the same type of offense and he comes back.\u201d The government then reviewed Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s criminal record and requested that the court impose a sentence at the high end of the guideline range. With respect to the sentence to be imposed for violating his supervised release, the government requested that the court impose the statutory maximum sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">After confirming that the supervised release violation was not encompassed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>plea agreement, the court imposed its sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">All right. Well, he\u2019s already been given a benefit several times by other Federal Judges in other districts. He\u2019s been given another benefit by the Government in allowing him to participate in the fast track program. I\u2019ve honored the plea agreement, but as we all know, the guidelines are now advisory in nature. And in addition to consulting the advisory guidelines, it\u2019s also my obligation to consult and consider the statutory factors embraced in Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 3553(a)l through 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">I\u2019m now directed to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the Defendant. The nature and circumstances of this offense is almost identical to the nature and circumstance for which he\u2019s now on supervised release. And his history and characteristics reveal he\u2019s been deported several times, he keeps coming back to this country illegally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">I\u2019m also directed to insure that any sentence I impose addresses the issues of; it must reflect the seriousness of the offense, it must promote respect for the law, and it must provide just punishment for the offense. And I also must afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and also must protect the citizens of this community from further crimes of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">In my view, taking all those factors into consideration, especially his history and characteristics, and especially to deter him from further criminal conduct, a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is simply not appropriate, it would not be reasonable and would not be sufficient to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. He wants to stay in the United States, I\u2019m going to let him do that for an extended period of time, but in a Federal facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">In my view, with regard to the new substantive offense, a sentence of five years or 60 months is reasonable and that is to be followed by a two-year term with regard to this other [supervised release] case to run consecutive for a total term of incarceration of 84 months or seven years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">In subsequently addressing the supervised release violation in particular, the court revoked Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s supervised release, re-imposed the consecutive 24-month sentence, and reiterated that, in arriving at this sentence, it had \u201cconsidered the statutory factors ..., and the advisory guidelines and policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The district court memorialized its two sentences by entering a judgment of conviction for the substantive unlawful re-entry offense and a judgment of revocation for the supervised release violation. Hernandez-Zaldivar filed a notice of appeal from each judgment, and we consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">On appeal, the government correctly separates the court\u2019s overall 84-month sentence into its two components \u2014 the 60-month sentence for the substantive unlawful re-entiy offense and the consecutive 24-month sentence for the supervised release violation \u2014 and argues that, pursuant to the sentence appeal waiver, HernandezZaldivar has waived his right to challenge the 60-month sentence. It is true that the sentence appeal waiver in that case generally precluded Hernandez-Zaldivar, without exception, from challenging the court\u2019s sentence on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>However, in order for such a sentence appeal waiver to be effective, it must be knowingly and voluntarily entered. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351 (11th Cir.1993). \u201c[W]hether a defendant effectively \u2014 that is knowingly and voluntarily \u2014 waived his right to appeal his sentence is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 1352. In this respect, a sentence appeal waiver \u201cwill be enforced if the government demonstrates <em>either: </em>(1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the plea colloquy, or (2) the record clearly shows that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In this case, the district court specifically questioned and informed Hernandez-Zaldivar about the sentence appeal waiver at the plea .hearing, and the record reveals that he understood its significance. Thus, we will enforce the waiver. Moreover, the broad language of the sentence appeal waiver in this case admits of no exceptions and therefore encompasses Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s reasonableness challenge. <em>Cf. United States v. Rubbo, </em>396 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he right to appeal a sentence based on <em>Apprendi/Booker </em>grounds can be waived in a plea agreement. Broad waiver language covers those grounds of appeal.\u201d). Accordingly, we decline to review the district court\u2019s 60-month sentence for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On the other hand, because the sentence appeal waiver does not cover the supervised release violation, we do address Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s reasonableness ehal-lenge as it relates to the 24-month sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has clarified that this Court reviews a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 39-41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Similarly, we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the sentencing range in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Under \u00a7 3583(e), the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the court must consider are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to afford adequate deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (5) the Sentencing Guidelines range and pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u00a7 3583(e), <em>cross referencing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7). In Chapter Seven of the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission promulgated nonbinding policy statements governing the violation of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that the policy statements in Chapter Seven are non-binding).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In imposing the 24-month sentence, the district court expressly stated that it had considered the statutory factors, the advisory guidelines, and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. Furthermore, the court understandably emphasized the fact that Hernandez-Zaldivar had not \u201clearned his lesson,\u201d as he continued to reenter the country unlawfully, having been previously deported on five separate occasions since 2001. In this respect, the court explicitly tied this point to two of the statutory factors, namely, the \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d of Hernandez-Zaldivar, \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and the need to deter him from committing further criminal conduct, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The only argument advanced by Hernandez-Zaldivar on appeal to support his assertion that his sentence was unreasonable is that, despite his history of unlawfully re-entering the country, he has not committed any additional criminal conduct. This contention, however, significantly understates the severity of Hernandez-Zaldi-var\u2019s criminal history, as unlawfully reentering the country following deportation is itself a criminal offense, and, contrary to Hernandez-Zaldivar\u2019s assertion, repeatedly committing such an offense does support an upward variance. In addition, his argument is further undercut by the fact that, in June 2003, he was convicted of an aggravated felony, namely, possession of a firearm. As this is the only argument advanced by Hernandez-Zaldivar on appeal, we conclude that he has not met his burden of showing that the court\u2019s 24-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\">. The district judge who presided over the Arizona case transferred jurisdiction of the supervised release proceedings to the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">. Hernandez-Zaldivar does not dispute the court's authority to revoke his supervised release or its determination that his Chapter 7 guideline range was 12 to 18 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
