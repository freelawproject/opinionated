They seek review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or its reasoning. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See Chen v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under the substantial evidence test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The IJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). Additionally, when an applicant submits evidence in addition to his or her testimony, the IJ may not rely solely on an adverse credibility determination to deny relief. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., 418 F.3d </em>1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">St. Leger contends that she is entitled to asylum because she has been persecuted on account of her political opinion by the Haitian political group Lavalas. She testified that Lavalas members have harassed, beaten, and raped her and that her aunt died after being attacked by them. The IJ denied her claim after making an adverse credibility determination. St. Leger argues that we must reverse that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">We disagree. The IJ issued a detailed opinion laying out the basis for its adverse credibility finding. It highlighted inconsistencies between St. Leger\u2019s and Joassaint\u2019s recollection of key events, such as the date of an election and what time St. Leger left her home on a day that she allegedly was attacked. The IJ also found that the St. Leger\u2019s and Joassaint\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with documentary evidence they provided, most notably about the time of St. Leger\u2019s aunt\u2019s death. St. Leger and Joassaint testified that St. Leger\u2019s aunt died at ten o\u2019clock in the morning, but her death certificate states her time of death as ten o\u2019clock in the evening. The IJ also found several portions of St. Leger\u2019s testimony implausible, such as her testimony that she did not tell her husband about an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that she heard about on the radio, that she did not do so because she knew that the coup attempt was staged, and that she was afraid she contracted HIV from her rapist but did not get tested. The IJ was also troubled by the fact that St. Leger\u2019s aunt\u2019s death was not reported until two years after she had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">St. Leger argues that the inconsistencies are minor, innocent mistakes and that the discrepancy about her aunt\u2019s time of death is due to a clerical error on death certificate. The IJ was unconvinced and we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004). After the IJ has made an adverse credibility determination, \u201cthe burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">St. Leger has not done that. For example, St. Leger argues that the December 17 coup attempt was indeed staged, but she does not offer any support for that statement. She has not provided any additional evidence to support her statement that her aunt died at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, instead of in the evening. She did not offer any medical records to corroborate her story that her aunt died as a result of being attacked by Lavalas supporters. Her fear of contracting HIV from her rapist does not square with her testimony that she did not get tested for HIV and resumed sexual relations with her husband a month later. The IJ\u2019s detailed discussion of the numerous problems it had with St. Leger\u2019s story supports its adverse credibility determination. <em>See D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. The IJ considered all of the evidence submitted by St. Leger. Some of that evidence undermined her testimony, instead of supporting it. Based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of St. Leger\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Because the standard for withholding of removal is higher than the one for asylum, it necessarily follows that St. Leger\u2019s claim for withholding of removal also fails. <em>See Silva v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). Finally, she has not offered any argument on her CAT claim and therefore she has waived that claim. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-29\">. Because Joassaint's claims for relief are derivative of St. Leger's, we will refer to the petitioners collectively as \u201cSt. Leger\u201d unless context requires otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
