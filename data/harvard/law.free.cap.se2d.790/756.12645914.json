The bail proceedings schedule shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Order of the Chief Justice dated September 19, 2007, outlining certain bond procedures in those courts. The Chief Judge shall also inform the municipal courts of the details of the county magisterial court schedule, to insure the availability of a magistrate to issue warrants and conduct bail proceedings for the municipal courts when the municipal judge is unavailable.

Require that all summary court judges who have court bank accounts bring to the quarterly meetings documentary proof of all monthly reconciliations of those bank accounts since the previous quarterly meeting. A minimum of one municipal judge from each municipality within the county shall be required to attend these meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   6.

Attend schools and meetings for Chief Judges called to implement policies and procedures under this and other Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   8.

Designate the hours of operation of each magistrate's court office in the county, and designate the hours during which each magistrate shall be present in the office, based upon the number of hours fixed for each magistrate by the county governing body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   11. Collect from the other magistrates in the county on a quarterly basis and review information concerning the age of pending civil and criminal cases to insure that all civil cases are disposed of within ninety days of filing and that criminal cases are disposed of within sixty days of arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   12. When any summary court judge in the county dies, retires, is suspended, goes out of office, becomes incapacitated, is unable to perform the duties of their office, and when a successor has not been nominated or qualified, the Chief Judge shall immediately take custody, or provide for the orderly transfer, of all records, to include past and present, civil and criminal docket books, warrant books, receipt books, financial records including official checking account statements and stubs, bank accounts and any funds contained therein, Acts and Joint Resolutions, the Code of Laws, Bench Books, pending and disposed warrants, tickets, NRVC's, and other court records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   13. Insure that the Office of Court Administration is provided written notification of the appointment, retirement, resignation, suspension or death of any summary court judge, whether municipal or magistrate, within the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   14.
