We also consider whether\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204312\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 4313 apply to claims based on an employer's conduct after reemployment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pamela Ennis Huff (\"Huff\") was initially hired by the Roanoke County Sheriff's Office (the \"Sheriff\") in November 2001 as a Deputy Sheriff. At the time, she was also a member of the United States Army Reserve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2009, Huff was serving as a Deputy Sheriff Bailiff when she was called to active duty and deployed to Afghanistan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During her tour of duty, Huff suffered a broken nose, injuries to her hip and spine, and a concussion, which resulted in a traumatic brain injury. In April 2011, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") and major depressive disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Huff returned from Afghanistan in May 2011, and she was discharged from active duty shortly thereafter. Upon her return, she contacted the Sheriff regarding reemployment. In July 2011, the Sheriff rehired Huff as a Deputy Sheriff Bailiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite treatment at the Salem VA Medical Center, Huff continued to suffer from PTSD and depression-related symptoms during her employment. After certain incidents came to the Sheriff's attention, Huff was twice required to undergo \"Fitness for Duty Evaluations.\" The Sheriff deemed Huff fit for duty on both occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August 2011, Huff requested unpaid leave on Fridays due to ongoing counseling sessions that were scheduled for Thursday evenings. The Sheriff advised her that he could not provide leave on every Friday if she remained in the court services division. Instead, he offered to transfer her from court services to corrections to provide the office with greater scheduling flexibility. Huff considered the transfer a demotion, and declined to accept it. The Sheriff then indicated that she could take up to thirty days unpaid administrative leave to seek counseling and treatment. Beginning in late November 2011, Huff took thirty days leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon her return, Huff was authorized by her treating physician to work on a full-time, \"light duty\" basis through April 1, 2012. She began working in this capacity, and later submitted a request to remain on full-time, light duty through June 2012. However, in March 2012, Huff suffered a heart attack, which was deemed \"service related\" by her treating physician. After her heart attack, Huff went on disability leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Huff's physician subsequently cleared her to return to work on a part-time, \"full duty\" basis from October 22, 2012 to January 21, 2013. Three days later, the Sheriff terminated her employment due to her inability to return to work in a full-time capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Huff filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Roanoke County, asserting four counts against the Sheriff. In relevant part, the complaint alleged that (1) the Sheriff failed to properly reemploy Huff and failed to make reasonable efforts to accommodate her disability in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204313\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (2) the Sheriff was required to allow Huff a two-year convalescence period before terminating her employment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204312\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties submitted competing motions for summary judgment on the above counts. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Francis v. Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328708\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/299/\">\n    452 F.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2006), the circuit court ruled that Sections 4312 and 4313 apply only until the moment of reemployment. Because the Sheriff rehired Huff in the same position that she had left during her deployment, the circuit court found these provisions were inapplicable to her claims. Accordingly, the court granted the Sheriff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The case proceeded to trial on the two remaining counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Huff presented her evidence, the court granted the Sheriff's motion to strike the first count, while taking the Sheriff's motion to strike the remaining count under advisement. After the Sheriff presented his case, the jury returned a defense verdict on the remaining count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Huff appeals only the circuit court's decision to grant the Sheriff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.

Statutory Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Congress enacted USERRA \"to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service[;] to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services as well as to their employers, their fellow employees, and their communities, by providing for the prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such service[;] and to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204301\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(3). To achieve these purposes, the relevant provisions of USERRA provide complementary protections during distinct phases of employment. Accordingly, a brief recitation of the sequencing of these protections is useful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 4311 prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee who \"is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) &amp; (c)(1);\n   <em>\n    see Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328708\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/299/\">\n    452 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 4311 provides \"umbrella\" coverage: it prohibits discrimination on the basis of service at the \"initial employment\" and any subsequent \"reemployment,\" as well as during \"retention in employment\" and in the awarding of promotions or benefits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Moreover, Section 4311 prevents an employer from taking retaliatory action in the event that a covered employee exercises a right afforded by USERRA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) &amp; (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 4312 requires employers to rehire covered employees upon their return from deployment, if those employees have satisfied the prerequisites listed therein.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204312\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127174\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/431/#p440\">\n    538 F.3d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (6th Cir. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328708\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/299/\">\n    452 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If a service member satisfies the requirements of Section 4312, then Section 4313 \"sets forth the position of employment to which the returning veteran must be rehired and requires that the veteran be 'promptly reemployed' in that position.\"\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127174\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/431/#p440\">\n    538 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   440 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204313\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Section 4316 provides that a service member who has been reemployed under USERRA \"shall not be discharged from such employment, except for cause [,]\" for a period of up to one year.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204316\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). This section also ensures that reemployed service members receive certain employment rights and benefits associated with seniority\n   and continuous employment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204316\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) -(b). In short, Section 4316 \"prevents employers from summarily dismissing those employees for a limited period after they are rehired.\"\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328708\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/299/\">\n    452 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With this framework for USERRA in mind, we turn to the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1. The Two-Year Convalescence Period of Section 4312\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Huff contends Section 4312 provides a two-year period after the end of deployment during which a service member's job is protected if the service member is convalescing with service-related injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204312\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). Thus, she asserts that the Sheriff could not terminate her employment until May 13, 2013. We conclude that the language of Section 4312 does not support this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In relevant part, Section 4312 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (a) Subject to subsections (b), (c), and (d) and to section 4304, any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to the reemployment rights and benefits and other employment benefits of this chapter if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) the person (or an appropriate officer of the uniformed service in which such service is performed) has given advance written or verbal notice of such service to such person's employer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (2) the cumulative length of the absence and of all previous absences from a position of employment with that employer by reasons of service in the uniformed services does not exceed five years; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (3) except as provided in subsection (f), the person reports to, or submits an application for reemployment to, such employer in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (e)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a person referred to in subsection (a) shall, upon the completion of a period of service in the uniformed services, notify the employer referred to in such subsection of the person's intent to return to a position of employment with such employer as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2)(A) A person who is hospitalized for, or convalescing from, an illness or injury incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of service in the uniformed services\n   <em>\n    shall, at the end of the period that is necessary for the person to recover from such illness or injury, report to the person's employer ... or submit an application for reemployment with such employer\n   </em>\n   .... Except as provided in subparagraph (B), such period of recovery may not exceed two years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (B) Such two-year period shall be extended by the minimum time required to accommodate the circumstances beyond such person's control which make\n   <em>\n    reporting within the period specified in subparagraph (A)\n   </em>\n   impossible or unreasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (3) A person who fails to\n   <em>\n    report or apply for employment or reemployment within the appropriate period specified in this subsection\n   </em>\n   shall not automatically forfeit such person's entitlement to the rights and benefits referred to in subsection (a) but shall be subject to the conduct rules, established policy, and general practices of the employer....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (emphases added). The language and structure of Section 4312 reveal that subsection (e) governs the notice prerequisite of subsection (a)(3). In other words, to claim the reemployment rights afforded in subsection (a), a service member must provide notice of his intent to return to work \"upon the completion of a period of service in the uniformed services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204312\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). However, under subsection (e), a two-year extension is triggered when the service member \"\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   hospitalized for, or convalescing from, an illness or injury incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of service in the uniformed services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204312\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Read together, these provisions allow a service member who \"is\" convalescing from an illness or injury \"upon the completion of a period of service\" up to two years to report to his employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nothing in the text of subsection (e) affects the terms of employment once the service member has been rehired.

But that argument fails to account for the purpose and function of subsection (e)-to notify the employer of a service member's intent to claim his reemployment rights after completing a period of service. Nothing in subsection (e) restarts or tolls the notice period after the employer has reemployed the service member, and it would be unnecessary to provide such a mechanism. Plainly, once a service member has been rehired and begins work, there is no longer any need to notify the employer of his intent to claim the reemployment rights afforded by subsection (a). The only thing remaining is to find an appropriate position for the service member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204313\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"[A] person entitled to reemployment under section 4312, upon completion of a period of service in the uniformed services, shall be promptly reemployed in a position of employment, in accordance with the following order of priority....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Huff suffered her heart attack nearly a year after she had completed the relevant period of service.

Because the two-year convalescence period in subsection (e)-like the rest of Section 4312 -applies only in the interim between the completion of service and reemployment, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment on this count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328708\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/299/\">\n    452 F.3d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We therefore hold that [Section] 4312 applies to protect a covered individual only as to the act of rehiring.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   2. Reemployment Positions Under Section 4313\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Huff contends Section 4313 imposes a continuing duty to make reasonable efforts to accommodate her disabilities after reemployment.

Moreover, the close relationship between the right to reemployment under Section 4312 and the right to a specific position upon reemployment under Section 4313 supports the conclusion that the protections afforded by Section 4313 do not apply beyond the date of reemployment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328708\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/299/\">\n    452 F.3d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining whether an employer failed to provide the plaintiff with \"reemployment rights,\" and thereby violated Section 4312, by determining whether the employer complied with the requirements of Section 4313 ).

Thus, Huff was entitled to prompt reemployment pursuant to Section 4313. Because Huff was deployed for approximately one year, Section 4313(a)(2) sets forth the applicable default reemployment position and requirements. Under Section 4313(a)(2), the Sheriff was required to promptly reemploy Huff either as a Deputy Sheriff Bailiff with all of the benefits to which she would have been entitled but for the interruption caused by her service, or an equivalent position. There is no dispute that the Sheriff fulfilled this obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Subparagraph (a)(3) is triggered when the returning service member \"has a disability incurred in, or aggravated during, such service,\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the service member \"is not qualified due to such disability to be employed\" in the escalator position set forth in subparagraph (a)(2)(A) after reasonable efforts by the employer to accommodate the disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Huff did not come forward with any evidence that the Sheriff found her unqualified for the \"escalator position\"-Deputy Sheriff Bailiff-at the time of reemployment due to her disability. Therefore, she has failed to come forward with evidence that would trigger the Sheriff's duty to make reasonable efforts to accommodate her disability when placing her in the appropriate reemployment position under Section 4313. In other words, the duty to make reasonable efforts-like the other provisions of Section 4313 -only applies to the structuring of the appropriate reemployment position, which is selected during the decision to reemploy. Because a claim under Section 4313 challenges the initial structure or selection of the reemployment position, nothing that occurred subsequent to the initial reemployment decision is relevant to such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Further, this interpretation serves the stated purposes of USERRA. Section 4312 provides returning service members with a right to reemployment, which counteracts any disincentive to rehire returning service members who may be subject to irregular periods of unavailability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204301\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (stating that one purpose of USERRA is \"to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment\"). In turn, Section 4313 reduces the risk of losing a position, seniority, benefits, or an opportunity for promotion upon leaving for active service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204301\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (stating that another purpose of USERRA is \"to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services ... by providing for the prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such service\").

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that Sections 4312 and 4313 afford returning service members protection only during the act of rehiring. Because there is no dispute as to whether the Sheriff promptly rehired Huff as a Deputy Sheriff Bailiff upon her return from deployment, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to the Sheriff on Counts II and III of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Huff's sacrifice on behalf of our country and the respect due to her as a member of the uniformed services is noted and appreciated.
