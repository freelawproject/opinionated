LEMONS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the judgment of conviction upon consideration of the trial court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained when police conducted a warrantless search of a stolen motorcycle parked in the driveway of a home where Ryan Austin Collins (\"Collins\") resided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Collins was convicted in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County (\"trial court\") of receiving stolen property in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-108, and sentenced to three years' imprisonment with all but two months suspended. Prior to trial, Collins moved to suppress the Commonwealth's evidence linking him to a stolen motorcycle. The trial court denied Collins' motion to suppress and held that the police search, although conducted without a warrant, did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling and Collins now challenges that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. The Eluding Incidents\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 4, 2013, Officer Matthew McCall of the Albemarle County Police Department was patrolling on Route 29 near the border of Albemarle County and the City of Charlottesville when he observed a traffic infraction by the operator of an orange and black motorcycle with an extended frame. Officer McCall activated his emergency lights and attempted to stop the motorcycle, but the motorcycle eluded him at a high rate of speed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Several weeks later, on July 25, 2013, Officer David Rhodes, also of the Albemarle Police Department, was in his police car on\n   the Route 250 Bypass when he observed an orange and black motorcycle traveling at 100 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone. Officer Rhodes engaged his emergency equipment and pursued the motorcycle. Instead of stopping, the motorcyclist increased his speed to at least 140 mph and sped away from the police car. In the interest of safety, Officer Rhodes abandoned his pursuit. However, Officer Rhodes' police car video camera recorded the incident, and police were able to use this footage to obtain a still photograph of the motorcycle, including its license plates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The motorcycle was an orange and black Suzuki with chrome accents and a \"stretched out\" rear wheel, indicating that it had been modified for drag racing. Officer Rhodes could not identify the driver through the darkly tinted helmet, but he observed that the motorcyclist wore blue jeans and \"tan Timberland-type work boots.\" The motorcyclist who eluded Officer McCall two months earlier also wore jeans and \"Timberland-type-style boots.\" After comparing notes and identifying \"an awful lot of similarities\" between the two eluding incidents, Officers McCall and Rhodes concluded the same motorcyclist had eluded each of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Officer Rhodes entered the motorcycle's license plate number in a police database, he discovered that the tags were \"not on file\" and had been inactive for several years. The license plate was most recently registered to Eric Jones (\"Jones\"). In the course of his investigation, Officer Rhodes learned that Jones had sold the motorcycle to Collins before the eluding incidents. Later, at trial, Jones testified that he sold Collins the motorcycle in April 2013 with the caveat that the motorcycle lacked title and was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [COMMONWEALTH'S ATTORNEY]: And so do you know why [the motorcycle] didn't have a title?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [ERIC JONES]: Possibly stolen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q: Possibly stolen or you knew it was ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A: Yeah, yeah, it was stolen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q: It was stolen[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q: And did you at some point then sell it to someone?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: And who did you sell to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A: Sold it to Ryan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q: And who is Ryan?

The Search\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On September 10, 2013, Albemarle Police responded to the Department of Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\") to investigate an unrelated matter\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   involving Collins. Upon hearing Collins' name on the police radio, Officers Rhodes and McCall also responded to the DMV to question Collins since he was a suspect in the motorcycle eluding incidents. Officer McCall advised Collins of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and Collins agreed to speak to the officers. When questioned about the motorcycle, Collins denied knowing anything about it, and told the officers that he \"hadn't ridden a motorcycle in months.\" Meanwhile, Officer Rhodes searched a social media website (Facebook) and found two photographs posted on Collins' Facebook page depicting the motorcycle which appeared to have been involved in the eluding incidents. The photographs showed the orange and black motorcycle parked in a driveway next to the vehicle Collins was attempting to register at the DMV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Officer Rhodes later testified that upon seeing the photographs of the motorcycle on Collins' Facebook page, he \"knew 100% sure that ... was the same motorcycle that had\n   not stopped for me on the bypass based on looking at it. It was very distinct and I knew, absolutely no question in my mind that was the same motorcycle.\" However, when the officers showed Collins the Facebook photographs, Collins denied any knowledge of the motorcycle or the house depicted in the photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the questioning concluded, Collins left the DMV and the officers continued their investigation. Officer Rhodes learned from an informant that the house in the Facebook photograph was located on Dellmead Lane in the City of Charlottesville near the border of Albemarle County. Less than half an hour later, Officer Rhodes located the house and parked along the street. From his position on the street, Officer Rhodes could see what appeared to be a motorcycle covered with a white tarp. At trial, Officer Rhodes testified that \"a quarter of the wheel [was] sticking out from underneath the cover\" and that despite the tarp, he recognized the distinct chrome accents and \"stretched out\" shape of the motorcycle. Additionally, the location and angle of the partially covered motorcycle matched that of the motorcycle in Collins' Facebook photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Officer Rhodes then walked onto the property, \"a car length or two\" up the driveway, between the street and the front steps of the house. While standing on the driveway, Officer Rhodes uncovered the motorcycle and confirmed that it appeared to be the same orange and black Suzuki that had eluded him on July 25, 2013. He then recorded the motorcycle's vehicle identification number or \"VIN.\" A computer search of the VIN revealed the motorcycle had been \"stolen out of New York\" several years before. After gathering this information, Officer Rhodes re-covered the motorcycle, left the property, and returned to his police car to conduct surveillance and wait for Collins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Shortly thereafter, a vehicle dropped off Collins at the Dellmead Lane residence. Officer Rhodes returned to the house and knocked on the door, which Collins answered. Although it was \"over 90 [degrees] that day,\" Collins came to the door dressed in jeans, a sweatshirt, and Timberland-style boots. Officer Rhodes later testified that \"at the DMV 30 minutes prior\" Collins had been wearing \"shorts and flip flops and a t-shirt.\" When asked about the motorcycle, Collins initially said he \"didn't know anything about it.\" He then told Officer Rhodes it belonged to a friend. Eventually, Collins admitted that he purchased the motorcycle, without a title, from Eric Jones. At trial during direct examination by the Commonwealth's Attorney, Officer Rhodes recounted his conversation with Collins:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [COMMONWEALTH'S ATTORNEY]: [T]ell the judge, please, when [Collins] comes to the door what happened next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [OFFICER RHODES]: I asked him, I said do you mind if I speak with you, and he said sure. We came... outside, and I started inquiring about the motorcycle. I asked him [if] he knew about this motorcycle, [and] he told me he didn't know anything about it, it was a friend's. ... [Collins] then told me \"well I did ride it over, bring it over from my mom's, over in Northfield over to Dellmead Avenue, but that had been a while and I don't ever drive it, because I don't have a motorcycle license.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: Did he tell you then, ultimately, whose motorcycle it was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A: He told me it was ... it was his. He told me ultimately he had bought it, he had paid $3,500 to Eric Jones for the motorcycle, and that's where the tag comes back into play ... which corroborated that story that that tag had involvement with Eric Jones....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: [Collins] bought the motorcycle from Eric Jones?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A: [Yes, t]he motorcycle from Eric Jones, and [Collins] had paid $3,500 for it, and there was no title for the motorcycle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Officer Rhodes then arrested Collins for receiving stolen property. As he searched Collins incident to the arrest, Officer Rhodes discovered a key to the motorcycle in Collins' pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C. Collins' Motion to Suppress\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A grand jury indicted Collins for possession of stolen property, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-108. Collins moved to suppress the\n   evidence obtained by Officer Rhodes on Fourth Amendment grounds. Collins argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   What we're really talking about here is trespassing on real property. Trespassing on the curtilage of a home for the purposes of doing investigation. I would conclude that Officer Rhodes violated the law in trespassing on private property. It was for the purpose of the search. He has no probable cause to do so. He certainly had no exigent circumstances. And any information that he gained as a result of that illegal trespass including [the] VIN number [should be suppressed].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Commonwealth responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Your Honor, while there is a Constitutional Fourth Amendment action against a [un]reasonable search and seizure, Mr. Collins' arguments are misguided. The search that Officer Rhodes conducted of the orange motorcycle [on] September 10th, 2013 was reasonable and lawful. The Supreme Court has long recognized an automobile exception to the traditional requirement of probable cause in a warrant. In\n   <em>\n    Carroll v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that automobiles were readably mobile and therefore eas[ily] moved from a jurisdiction. Probable cause alone is enough to justify a search and a warrant is unnecessary. The Supreme Court confirmed this in\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. Dyson\n   </em>\n   ... where the [Court] explicitly ruled that warrantless search of a vehicle [was] lawful within the Fourth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Commonwealth's Attorney further argued that Officer Rhodes had probable cause because he had seen on Collins' Facebook page, a photograph of the uncovered motorcycle parked in the same spot in front of the house. Additionally, the motorcycle had chrome wheels and an extended sway arm\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which made it longer than a standard motorcycle. In response, Collins argued that the automobile exception was inapplicable since the motorcycle was parked and located on private property.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Your Honor, the automobile exception to my understanding is the search of the automobile not a search for an automobile... [The] [a]utomobile exception was created for officers on the street when they stop somebody and they know there is going to be maybe contraband in the vehicle and it's an exception to a warrant requirement. That exception does not apply in this case. That vehicle was parked in a private driveway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After hearing argument from both parties, the trial court ruled on Collins' motion. The trial court held that Officer Rhodes did not violate Collins' Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   So the Court finds that ... where this is in an area where it is exposed to the public where the officer asked Mr. Collins about the motorcycle and [Collins] indicated he didn't know anything about it, where it's in the exact same location [as the Facebook photograph], where it matches the officer's description ... and where it has the chrome wheels, the Court finds that there was probable cause for the search and therefore it was not an unreasonable governmental intrusion. The Court is going to deny the motion to suppress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A bench trial ensued, and the trial court convicted Collins of receiving stolen property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D. Court of Appeals Opinion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Collins appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals affirmed Collins' conviction in a published opinion.\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

The Court of Appeals declined to address the automobile\n   exception on the basis that other \"exigencies existed aside from the inherent mobility of the motorcycle.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3995373\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/65/37/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 48 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3995373\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/65/37/\">\n    773 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   624 n.4. Upon petition we granted Collins' appeal on the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The trial court erred in denying Collins' motion to suppress the evidence related to the motorcycle because the officer illegally trespassed onto private property for [the] purpose of conducting a search in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court of Appeals of Virginia erred in upholding the judgment of the trial court and finding that the officer acted lawfully under the Fourth Amendment in entering the property and searching the motorcycle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. A defendant's claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment presents mixed questions of law and fact that this Court reviews de novo on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Automobile Exception to the Fourth Amendment Warrant Requirement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Before the Court of Appeals and before this Court, Collins argued that Officer Rhodes trespassed when he walked up the driveway of Collins' residence without permission or a search warrant. Collins also argued that Officer Rhodes conducted a warrantless, unconstitutional search when he removed the motorcycle tarp to reveal its VIN-evidence which ultimately confirmed that the motorcycle was stolen. While the Court of Appeals analyzed the issue based upon probable cause and exigent circumstances, this case is more appropriately resolved under the automobile exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this case, Officer Rhodes lacked a search warrant when he walked up Collins' driveway and searched the motorcycle by removing the tarp and locating the VIN. \"Warrantless searches, of course, are per se unreasonable, subject to a few well-defined exceptions.\"\n   <em>\n    Abell v.

In this case, however, neither the Commonwealth nor the trial court invoked the exigent circumstances exception. Although the Court of Appeals based its decision on exigent circumstances, we do\n   not find it necessary to independently assess whether exigent circumstances existed here. Rather, the facts of this case are more properly addressed by a different exception to the warrant requirement: the automobile exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The origins of the automobile exception reflect the inherent exigency associated with the readily mobile nature of vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

Applying that test to this case, we hold that Officer Rhodes' warrantless search of the motorcycle was justified under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   1. Officer Rhodes Had Probable Cause to Believe the Motorcycle Was Contraband\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The facts of this case supported a finding of probable cause sufficient to allow Officer Rhodes to search the motorcycle under the automobile exception. As a result of his prior investigation, Officer Rhodes had several reasons to believe the motorcycle was contraband. Eric Jones had informed Officer Rhodes that he sold Collins the motorcycle with the warning that it was stolen. Therefore, when he arrived at the Dellmead Lane residence on September 25, 2013, Officer Rhodes already suspected that the motorcycle which had eluded him and Officer McCall was stolen property. The motorcycle was in plain view from the street and Officer Rhodes immediately recognized its distinct features. In denying Collins' motion to suppress, the trial court found that, despite the tarp, the motorcycle's unique \"stretched out\" frame and chrome wheels were visible to Officer Rhodes from his lawful position on the street. The location and angle of the partially covered motorcycle matched that of the uncovered motorcycle in Collins' Facebook photograph. Accordingly, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals properly held that Officer Rhodes had probable cause to search the motorcycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2. Automobile Exception Applies Even When Vehicle is Not \"Immediately Mobile\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On brief Collins argued that \"no reasonable law enforcement officer could claim that, under these facts, the motorcycle was in imminent danger of being destroyed.\" (Opening Br. at 30). He further argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Had Collins emerged from the residence, removed the tarp and attempted to drive the motorcycle away, Officer Rhodes would have had clear evidence linking Collins to the motorcycle and could have immediately approached him to further investigate the suspected incident of eluding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (Opening Br. at 28). Collins contends that because Officer Rhodes was conducting surveillance of the residence, Collins could not have removed the tarp, started the motorcycle, and fled the premises without first being apprehended. He suggests that Officer Rhodes could have stopped the motorcycle by blocking the driveway with his police car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   These arguments both defy common sense and misapply the automobile exception, which is a bright-line test. The suggestion that Officer Rhodes could have \"immediately approached [Collins] to further investigate\" conveniently ignores the fact that this motorcycle had twice eluded police at high speeds. And, since he had questioned Collins about the motorcycle earlier that same day, Officer Rhodes had good reason to suspect that Collins would return from the DMV and speed away on the motorcycle in order to hide it and potentially remove the VIN.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Moreover, \"[a] vehicle's inherent mobility-not the probability that it might actually be set in motion-is the foundation of the automobile exception's mobility rationale.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the suppression hearing, Officer Rhodes testified that \"to determine if this was the motorcycle that I was, in fact, looking for.... I removed the cover then I ran the tag on that motorcycle.... I got the VIN number off the motorcycle and then ran that as well.\" The dissent plainly acknowledges that \"the shape and contours of the object were visible through the tarp and suggested the object it covered was an extended motorcycle.... the lower half of the front wheel of the motorcycle was exposed to view outside the tarp.\" Consequently, Officer Rhodes knew that the object being searched was a motorcycle partially covered by a tarp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The dissent argues that the Commonwealth characterized the search as one of the tarp.
