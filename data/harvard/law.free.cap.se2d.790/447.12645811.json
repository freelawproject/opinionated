McCLANAHAN\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Holiday Motor Corporation, Mazda Motor Corporation, and Mazda Motor of America, Inc., (collectively \"Mazda\") appeal from a judgment entered on a $20 million jury verdict in favor of Shannon B. Walters, who sustained a serious cervical spine injury when her 1995 Mazda Miata convertible overturned while she was operating it with the soft top closed. Walters contends she was injured after the windshield header disconnected from the top and collapsed into the occupant compartment. She asserts that the design of the soft top's latching system was defective because the latches connecting the windshield header to the top were not designed to stay latched in a foreseeable rollover crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mazda argues it had no duty to design or supply a soft top that provided occupant protection in a rollover crash and that, in any event, the opinion offered by Walters' expert that the soft top's latching system was defectively designed lacked a sufficient foundation. We agree and will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and enter final judgment for Mazda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Facts Surrounding 2006 Rollover Crash\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2006, Walters was driving her 1995 Mazda Miata convertible along Virginia State Route 619, a two-lane highway in Bedford County. The Miata was equipped with a soft top that could be folded and stowed for open-air driving or unfolded and closed by connecting the top to the windshield header (the curved steel bar running across the top of the windshield) by latches located on each side of the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Walters was operating the Miata in the closed-top configuration with the latches engaged. Walters observed a large object that \"basically covered [her] whole lane of travel\" come toward her from the back of a pickup truck she was following. Seeing no traffic in the oncoming lane, Walters veered left across the road, off the highway, and up a slight grassy incline. The vehicle overturned and landed on its top with the driver's side pushed up against a tree. Walters testified that she did not lose consciousness during the accident and that her \"first memory\" of what happened was that her body was \"light as a feather.\" She recalled having pain in her head, neck and right arm but could not feel or move her legs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Michael Evans, who was also travelling on Route 619, came upon the same object in the road, hit his brakes, steered left, then pulled his vehicle onto the grass when he saw Walters' vehicle \"up on the bank.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Evans, Walters' vehicle was \"inverted, on its top, up against the tree,\" which \"was against the driver's side.\" Because the vehicle was \"resting on a slope,\" the driver's side \"was closer to the ground than the passenger side.\" Evans testified that the \"back of the convertible bows,\" or the beams across the top, \"appeared to be holding the vehicle up, but the front of the hood and windshield ... were flat on the ground.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because Evans could not enter the vehicle through the driver's side, he broke the glass out of the passenger's side window, reached through the window, and opened the passenger's side door. He then crawled into the vehicle and turned off the ignition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, he noticed that the windshield header was separated from the soft top such that the top \"was actually underneath of the windshield.\" Evans cut Walters' seat belt and lowered her to \"where she was flat on the top.\" He then cut out the vehicle's acrylic rear window and crawled into the vehicle. He observed that Walters \"had a head injury and was bleeding from like the top of her forehead.\" Because Walters told Evans she could not feel her legs, he was reluctant to move her. Evans held Walters' head stable and remained with her until emergency medical personnel arrived on scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B. Allegations Against Mazda\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Walters' second amended complaint, she contends that Mazda Motor Corporation and Mazda Motor of America, Inc. were negligent because they designed, manufactured, and placed into the stream of commerce the Mazda Miata convertible model, which was unreasonably dangerous for its ordinary and/or foreseeable use \"in that it would not provide reasonable occupant protection in a foreseeable rollover while being used in its closed top configuration\" due to defects in the \"design of the A-pillar, windshield header, and the roof latching system\" and in failing to warn of such danger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Walters also contends that all defendants breached their warranties \"that the subject vehicle was reasonably fit and safe for its ordinary and/or foreseeable purposes\" and \"was of merchantable quality throughout\" for the same reasons. Walters claims that her injuries were proximately caused by these asserted acts of negligence and breaches of warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C. Walters' Expert Testimony at Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   James Mundo, an automotive engineer, was qualified as an expert witness in \"automotive engineer crash management, safety management, including latches.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mundo testified that there are three primary \"load paths\" that make up the structure of a \"closed-top vehicle, a sedan kind of vehicle.\" The first load path is the frame of the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second load path is \"the side of the vehicle\" to \"carry the load for components that would be on the sides of things for the car.\" The third load path is the \"windshield area of the vehicle.\" These three load paths \"carry the loads in the vehicle\" and \"if any part of this structure is disconnected, then it doesn't work as a system anymore.\" Mundo stated that when the load paths don't work together anymore, the results are \"unpredictable\" from an engineering point of view \"if you get in a crash.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Mundo, a convertible vehicle (as distinguished from what Mundo described as a closed-top sedan type of vehicle) may be converted \"from a three-load structure to a two-load structure.\" When a convertible is in a closed-top configuration, the latches are \"the mechanism by which this roof is locked\" so that the third load path is \"continuous.\" When the \"latches are connected, the design\n   objective is [to] have a continuous load[,] three load path.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mundo explained that automotive design engineers use a \"right-hand rule\" to guide their design of all automobile components.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [E]ngineers have a coordinate system that's established in the design of an automobile, and it's called a right-hand rule. And what this is[,] it's the coordinates for the vehicle. And the thumb here is the up and down, the index is front to back, and the middle finger here is cross car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   And so whenever we are talking about vibration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   when we are talking about the vehicle moving around, we can go to any component, any part of the car, any beam, any latch, and we can put the right-hand rule, put that there and say, \"Is this thing moving in three cardinal directions, or is this thing not tied down in three cardinal directions?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mundo testified that a design engineer wants to have all three cardinal directions protected on latches because \"whatever you are latching, you want to keep it connected for all foreseeable crashes.\" Mundo cited as an example a door latch, which is \"connected in all three cardinal directions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mundo first examined Walters' vehicle in November 2012, over six years after the accident. He came to the conclusion that \"the connections failed\" in the load three path, which \"allowed the windshield to go do its own thing and the roof to go do its own thing.\" Mundo used a roof latch removed from another 1995 Mazda Miata to demonstrate to the jury how the latch operated and how it could come apart in his hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   By moving the latch parts in his hands, Mundo testified he could \"show that it's not locked in the vertical direction.\" Mundo explained that automotive design engineers use a design process called \"failure mode and effects analysis\" in which they \"have to think about how can [a component part] fail\" and \"if it does fail, what's the effect.\" In performing this analysis, \"an engineer sitting at a desk getting component parts is going to look at it with respect to how does it fail\" and \"he is going to work with it\" and \"check three cardinal directions.\" Mundo stated that \"if I could take it apart by hand, that is something that is troubling from a failure mode with respect to the real world vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to Mundo, it has been \"state of the art\" in the automotive industry since 1972 that \"[i]f it's going to be latched, it's latched in three cardinal directions.\" Mundo compared the Mazda Miata roof latch to a Ford Mustang roof latch in which there is a \"big, long, solid steel bar, and it's not chamfered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It's a steel bar that goes into a hole. And when it's in there, it's not coming out.\" Mundo testified that \"it is not reasonably prudent to not design into the latch mechanism all three cardinal directions with the top down just because it can be released and put back.\" \"[W]ith the top up,\" stated Mundo, \"we are trying to design a system that will\n   get everybody to share in the way the loads are distributed throughout the vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mundo testified that, in his opinion, the windshield header and soft top became disconnected in the crash because the latches came \"undone.\" He further testified that the latches came undone because \"the up and down is dependent on that tiny little nub that was in there, and it wasn't sufficient to hold it and it came apart.\" In Mundo's opinion, the latch was defectively designed because the pin and hole \"are chamfered\" so that \"it's easy for [the pin] to move and pop right out of [the hole].\" According to Mundo, if \"the connection had remained connected, then the front end of the roof structure would have performed just like the back end of the roof structure,\" which did not collapse. In order to reach his opinion, Mundo stated it was unnecessary for him to do testing\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [b]ecause the issue at hand is that the joints were not connected, and there was no damage to the devices that were doing the connecting.\n   <em>\n    And the crash spoke for itself. There it is. It's not connected\n   </em>\n   . And that's really ofttimes the way engineers like to look at it. That's a field crash test, if you will, a real world crash test out on the nation's highways. And that test speaks for itself. It came apart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Mundo also stated that based on a cost of 20 to 25 cents per pound of steel for components, it would have cost Mazda 10 cents per latch to manufacture a latch that would follow the \"right-hand rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mundo testified that he did not apply any safety standards other than the \"right-hand rule.\" Mundo confirmed that he did not rely on any automotive engineering papers, literature or written standards to support his opinion. He stated he did not perform a vibration analysis of the vehicle and did not attempt to calculate any of the vibrations that the vehicle underwent during the crash. Mundo also stated that he did not conduct any studies to determine under what circumstances vibration will cause the roof latches to part. He testified that he performed no testing of a Mazda Miata soft top or latch or testing of any kind in connection with this case except for his courtroom \"demonstration that [the latch] comes apart ... by disengaging the latching mechanism.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mundo acknowledged that he performed no testing or analysis of the Ford latching system that he compared to the latch on the Mazda Miata. He testified that he does not know how much weight the Ford latching system will support if the latches are connected. He also testified that he doesn't know how much weight the Mazda latching system will support when the latches are connected. Furthermore, he declined to say that the Ford Mustang latching system was a reasonably safe alternative, as indicated during the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q Have you performed any tests of the Ford system?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q Have you perform[ed] any analysis of the Ford system?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q Do you know how much weight the Ford system will support if the latches are connected?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A I don't know the answer to that. I didn't-I wasn't asked to calculate the weights and the forces for the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q Don't know. Do you know how much weight the Mazda system will support when the latches are connected?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A If we are just talking static and putting a weight on the roof?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q Have you done that calculation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q All right, thank you. Do you know how much-have you done any calculations to determine the weight bearing capacity of any aspect of the Mazda or the Ford?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q How would you show that a system is reasonably safe? Wouldn't you have to run tests?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A Tests and/or-you mean physical tests? There is also computer analyses that can be done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q And you haven't done any tests or computer analyses of the Ford system, have you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A No, I have not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q So you are not here to try to suggest to the jury that that system is reasonably safe, are you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A I am telling you that it has design features, not that it's the go-to design. It's just the features to point out the difference between the locking pins.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q And how strong the pins and the latches are in the Ford system is not something you have undertaken to analyze, true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A True. I wasn't asked to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mundo admitted that a roof system that remains connected, and even a roof system that has no latches, can be crushed. He agreed he had seen that many times with a variety of vehicles involved in rollover incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mazda moved to strike Mundo's testimony at trial, contending that \"the upshot of Mr. Mundo's testimony is simply this: That ... he thinks the latches came undone, and latches ought not come undone in foreseeable rollover crashes.\" During argument, the circuit court questioned Walters' counsel regarding the basis for Mundo's opinion that the latch design was defective:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q What is his testimony-the defect that he has established?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A The defect that he has established is that the knob that connected-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q Knob that goes into the hole in the latch was, quote, too short. In comparison to what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A In comparison to what is acceptable in the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q To the Ford latch, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A That's more an example.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q But he compared it to the Ford latch, and he doesn't even know if the Ford latch will hold, according to his own testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A No. What he said was that that was an example, an illustrative example of how-and I think he was pretty clear on this. They said, \"Is this it?\" He said, \"No, I am using this as an example to show the design feature, not the design.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q So what is the standard of the industry for the length of the insertion-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A The standard in the industry-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q-as testified to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A-for the length of insertion is sufficient so that when it is put in an ordinary-if it's put in the situation that it will stop the latch from coming apart in all three cardinal directions, and this will-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q Under all circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A Of the latch, yeah. You know, without breaking. I mean, the-he said there is no breaking of this thing. In other words, we don't have any broken parts with the latch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q No, it was structurally sound as far as what the evidence is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A Structurally sound. So I think the standard of the industry is that in the absence of-of being such a huge bad crash that would, you know, cause a structural problem, it just should not just come apart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Walters called an osteopathic physician specializing in sports medicine, Dr. Per Gunnar Brolinson, to provide an expert opinion regarding the cause of her injury. Over Mazda's objection, Brolinson, was qualified as a medical expert \"to provide medical and biomedical/biomechanical causation opinion testimony.\" Brolinson expressed an opinion that during the rollover crash, the windshield header \"came down, after pressure, on the top of [Walters'] head.\" According to Brolinson, Walters then \"went into extreme flexion\" resulting in a \"fracture-dislocation, tearing of the soft tissue, and movement of the cervical spine, C6 on C7, which put pressure on the spinal cord.\" As indicated by the following colloquy, Brolinson could not say at what point during the crash (whether before or after the latch disengagement) the injury occurred or how much intrusion into the occupant compartment needed to be avoided to prevent the injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q It's true, isn't it, that you don't know how much space was between Ms. Walters' buttocks and her seat when the injury occurred?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q And you don't know how many degrees of roll when the injury occurred?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q And by that, I am talking about degrees of roll of the vehicle, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q And it's true that you don't know how much movement of Ms. Walters' head was necessary to cause her injury even under your hyperflexion theory, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q You can't quantify the amount of flexion that Ms. Walters sustained, even if we were to accept your theory, true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q And it's true, isn't it, that you don't know how much head room compromise would need to have been avoided in order to prevent this injury, assuming we accept even your theory?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A That's correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A. Duty to Provide Occupant Rollover Protection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mazda argues that it owed no legal duty to design the soft top or the latches to provide occupant rollover protection because it is not the intended or foreseeable purpose of a convertible soft top, including the latching system, to provide such protection. Mazda points out that there was no evidence that Mazda or any car manufacturer designs soft tops or latches to provide occupant rollover protection, that consumers expect a soft top to provide occupant rollover protection, or that there exists any industry standard or custom to design soft tops or their latches to provide such protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Walters contends that Mazda sold a dual-purpose product. According to Walters, when the top was in use, it was a foreseeable purpose of the top and latching mechanism to provide the same occupant rollover protection as a sedan with a permanent roof structure. Walters specifically asserts that it was \"a fundamental and intended purpose\" of the latches to \"keep any part of the structure from intruding into the occupant compartment and creating a hazardous environment.\" Thus, she argues, \"the latches failed their intended safety purpose of keeping the structures connected and thus away from the occupant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The issue of whether a manufacturer of a soft top convertible owes a legally recognized duty to design or supply a soft top or its latching system to provide occupant rollover protection is a threshold question that we determine as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jeld-Wen, Inc. v.

Indeed, the NHTSA has expressly excepted convertibles from the roof crush\n   standard because it is unaware of any convertible top that could meet such a standard. There is certainly no evidence that Mazda or any other manufacturer of convertibles in fact designs or markets soft tops to provide occupant rollover protection or that consumers reasonably expect such protection. To the contrary, the marketable feature of the soft top convertible is the absence of a permanent roof structure. The absence of this structural component is not only obvious but chosen by consumers who desire the flexibility of a soft top that can be easily detached, folded, and stowed for an open-air driving experience or closed and latched to the windshield header for a quieter ride without exposure to the outside elements.

Although Mundo testified that the latches came \"undone\" because they were not sufficiently designed to hold in vertical movement, he was not able to say under what circumstances vibration would cause the latches to part, and indeed, did not even calculate the vibrations the vehicle underwent during the crash or the forces and weight to which the vehicle was subjected. While Mundo described a \"failure mode and effects analysis\" in which an engineer will examine component parts to consider how they might fail, he performed no testing or analysis of the Mazda latching\n   system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, though Mundo compared the design of the Mazda latching system to that of the Ford Mustang, he performed no testing or analysis of the Ford latching system and could not say that the Ford latches would have remained connected in this crash. His declaration that \"the crash spoke for itself\" did not supply the necessary foundation for his opinion.

He confirmed that he had done no calculations to determine the weight bearing capacity of any aspect of the Mazda Miata. Mundo agreed that while one would need to run physical tests or computer analyses to makes such determinations, he had not done so. Mundo conceded that the collapse of the roof system could occur in rollover crashes even when a convertible's latches stay connected. In fact, Mundo testified that permanent roof structure systems (those without latches) could be, and have been, crushed in rollover accidents.

Walters' argument is a non sequitur. It is the absence of a permanent roof structure that requires use of latches to connect the top to the windshield. And it is this inherent feature of a convertible-the absence of a fixed, rigid structural member to connect the A-pillars (which frame the vehicle's windshield) to the B-pillars (which frame the vehicle's rear window)-that makes roof crush requirements impractical for convertibles. Furthermore, Walters' effort to make a distinction between the roof and the latches is unavailing since the basis of her claims for negligence and breach of implied warranty of merchantability is that the Miata \"would not provide reasonable occupant protection in a foreseeable rollover while being used in its closed top configuration.\" Occupant protection in a rollover crash is the precise issue addressed by FMVSS No. 216.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The safety standard for roof crush resistance set forth in FMVSS No. 216 requires that when a large steel plate (or platen) is used to apply force to the leading edge of the roof in accordance with the stated procedures, the distance that the test plate has moved from the point of contact must not exceed 127 mm (5 inches).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20571.216\">\n     49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.216\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S5).

As noted previously, Mundo did not specify any particular standard or design to which soft top latches should conform. He discussed the Ford Mustang latch \"to point out the difference between the locking pins\" but testified he did not consider the Ford latching system as \"the go-to design.\" Rather, Mundo's opinion was that automobile latches in general should be designed according to the \"right-hand rule\" and should stay connected for all foreseeable crashes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The demonstration Mundo conducted with a Mazda latch removed from another 1995 Mazda Miata did not purport to show how any other design could have withstood the crash but merely displayed to the jury his ability to take apart the latch by manipulating it in his hand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    According to Mundo, if \"the connection had remained connected, then the front end of the roof structure would have performed just like the back end of the roof structure,\" which did not collapse.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Mazda also contends that, aside from the issues of duty and admissibility of the expert testimony, Walters failed to present evidence of an unreasonably dangerous condition or that any such condition proximately caused Walters' injury. As we have stated, a plaintiff must show that the manufacturer failed to meet objective safety standards prevailing at the time the product was made to sustain a claim for negligent design. In addition, a plaintiff must prove that the unreasonably dangerous condition actually caused the injury. \"The proximate cause of an event is that act or omission which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient intervening cause, produces that event, and without which that event would not have occurred.\"\n    <em>\n     Wells v.

Notably, neither of Walters' experts in this case could say at what point during the rollover crash the latches disconnected or whether the latches disconnected before Walters was injured. And there was no evidence that Walters' injury would not have occurred even if the latches had remained connected. Our holding, however, renders it unnecessary for us to address Mazda's arguments pertaining to proof of an unreasonably dangerous condition and causation of Walters' injury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
