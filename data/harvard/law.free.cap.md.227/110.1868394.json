The plaintiff was employed by the defendant under a written agreement. He based his suit for commissions on \u201ca certain basic plan.\u201d In his answer to a demand for a bill of particulars, he stated that the \u201cplan\u201d was in writing, and the documents containing it were in the possession of the defendant. He now seeks to assert an oral agreement and to recover upon a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis. The evidence was ample to sustain the findings that the contract was as the appellant said it was in his declaration and answer to the demand for particulars, and that appellant was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>charged for cause. He was bound by the written contract upon which he based his suit. The claim that the contract was illusory is not sustainable. See Restatement, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 79, Illustration 1, where it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201c1. A promises B to act as B\u2019s agent for three years on certain terms, and B agrees that A may so act, but reserves the power to cancel the agreement at any time. B\u2019s agreement is insufficient consideration, since it involves nothing that can properly be called a promise. Otherwise, if B reserves the power to cancel on thirty days\u2019 notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The appellant\u2019s further contention that the settlement between the parties provided for upon termination of the contract amounted to a forfeiture, and, therefore, was unenforceable can afford him no relief. If we assume as contended by the appellant, without deciding, that these provisions did call for a forfeiture, the appellant, as a terminated salesman, was only entitled to commissions on sales booked by him in those cases where \u201cshipment and billing [were] made not later than 90 days past actual date of termination,\u201d and the trial court found that, due to this provision, appellant had failed in his proof to show that commissions were due him, a finding that we cannot say was clearly erroneous.
