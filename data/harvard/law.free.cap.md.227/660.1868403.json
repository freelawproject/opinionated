He was convicted on the second count, sentenced to ten years, and appealed to this Court. <em>Proctor v. State, </em>223 Md. 394. The only questions raised were concerning an extra-judicial identification made by the victim. The judgment was affirmed. He now seeks to raise for the first time a contention that because the State accepted from Carle, one of his codefendants, a plea of guilty of simple assault, for which he received a sentence of five years, and because Carle testified for the State, the constitutional rights of the applicant were violated. He contends that it was discriminatory, in a constitutional sense, to give Carle an opportunity which was not extended to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">We think it is too late to raise the point in this proceeding. Failure to make the point at the trial or on appeal constitutes a waiver. <em>Jordan v. State, </em>221 Md. 134; <em>Lipscomb v. Warden, </em>225 Md. 634. In so holding, we do not suggest that leniency to a codefendant, or a disparity in sentences, would afford grounds for relief in any event. <em>Barker v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 662, 665. See also <em>Cothorn v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 581, 582, and <em>Ellinger v. Warden, </em>224 Md. 648, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
