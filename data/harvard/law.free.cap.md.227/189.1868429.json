Shrubs were planted along the outside of the porch, and between the shrubs and the parking lot ran a walkway or pavement. A curb several inches high ran along the walkway, dividing it from the parking area. About nine o\u2019clock in the evening in October, Mrs. Tyler\u2019s son and daughter-in-law drove her to the dairy, where she had not been before. Ordinarily there were flood lights which illuminated the parking area, but on this night the place was in the process of closing and all but one of the outside lights were off. There were patrons in the building and light shone through the windows. The son parked the car with the front almost at the curb, a few feet to the left of an opening in the curb through which ran a path or walk to the front porch, from which one entered the dairy. The son got out the driver\u2019s side, stepped over the curb and went on towards the entrance door. (He did not see the fall.) The daughter-in-law got out the other side of the car, walked a few feet straight away from the side of the car, then turned to her left onto the path that led through the opening in the curb and continued beyond the line of the curb a foot or so towards the front porch, where she paused.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Mrs. Tyler followed her daughter-in-law part way, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>went back to the car to make sure the doors were locked. She turned away from the rear door of the right side of the car and, in the words of the daughter-in-law, \u201crather than come the way she had the first time with me before she started back to lock the door Mom came diagonally across the hedge there and that is when she fell.\u201d Mrs. Tyler, explaining her contention that she tripped over the curb, said that the second time she walked diagonally from the car towards her waiting daughter-in-law \u201cand the glare from the inside of the building on my glasses and not being familiar with the place, I struck this object and fell.\u201d Again she said: \u201cI could see the great glare of light coming from the inside of the building and I could see the shrubbery and that is all I could see.\u201d (On cross-examination she said: \u201cI was blinded to the extent I couldn\u2019t see.\u201d) Then, she \u201cwalked diagonally from the car towards her\u2014my daughter-in-law stood about right here * * * instead of walking around this way to go in I walked diagonally right across this way.\u201d She did not see the curbing\u2014she did not look down.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The son testified there was enough light so that he did not feel it necessary to leave the car lights on and that you could see the curbing \u201cif you knew it was there.\u201d He would not say it was so dark you could not see the curb. The daughter-in-law said that she could see the curbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The trial court held that there was no evidence of primary negligence\u2014that, as this Court said was true as to the magazine rack over which the patron fell in <em>Evans v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., </em>223 Md. 235, 239, the dairy met its obligation to Mrs. Tyler as a business invitee, to use \u201cordinary care and caution * * * to see that that portion of its premises used by its patrons was in such condition as not to imperil her, so long as she, herself, exercised ordinary care.\u201d He found that the curb involved no unreasonable risk to patrons, and that the dairy had no reason to believe a patron would not see the curb and recognize the danger of falling over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">There is much force in the analogy drawn by the trial court but if we assume for the purpose of decision, without deciding, that the dairy was negligent in failing to keep the flood lights on while there was a likelihood that patrons would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>walking about the exterior of the store, the result is not changed, because we think Mrs. Tyler was contributorily negligent as a matter of law\u2014that reasonable minds could not differ as to her imprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">She was in an unfamiliar place. She had been shown a safe way to walk to the entrance to the dairy to which she wanted to go. Instead of following this route, she chose to walk a different way, either blinded by a glare of light from inside the building, according to her version, or in such darkness that she could have seen the curbing only with difficulty, if the version of the son and daughter-in-law is correct. She did not look aside and wait until she could recover from the glare and she never looked down to ascertain if there were obstructions in her path. To walk blindly or unlooking in a strange environment, when there is no need to do so, is to be negligent as a matter of law. <em>Hyde v. Blumenthal, </em>136 Md. 445; <em>Nocar v. Greenberg, </em>210 Md. 506, 516; <em>Sutton v. Mayor &amp; C. C. of Baltimore, </em>214 Md. 581; <em>cf. Pierce v. Mayor &amp; C. C. of Baltimore, </em>220 Md. 286.
