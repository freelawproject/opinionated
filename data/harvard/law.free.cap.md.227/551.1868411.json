He declared \u201che was going to hit her in the head with an axe,\u201d although he almost immediately thereafter claimed to have used the words in jest. She got up, saying, \u201c[I]t is no more sleep for tonight,\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were that type of man * * * I am going to get me a job sleeping in * * * I\u2019m going to have to * * * because I can\u2019t go on like this anymore.\u201d The woman went into the kitchen and began playing cards with a couple who also lived in the apartment. DeToro called to her to come in the bedroom after she had asked him to bring her a cigarette. They argued because he had no job and could not even buy cigarettes. After about five minutes, DeToro came back into the kitchen and picked up a twelve-inch knife or dagger having a rigid blade with a sharp point, and went back into the bedroom. After a few minutes the couple in the kitchen heard the outside door of the apartment close, and a little later heard a moaning sound from the bedroom. They rushed in and found Beatrice dying of a stab wound in the chest, the knife DeToro had taken from the kitchen a few minutes before evidently having been driven in up to the hilt. The woman died before the police arrived. There was testimony that the outside door of the apartment was locked both before and after De-Toro left.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">DeToro gave the policeman a statement in which he claimed he had gotten the knife to cut a cake. He said there was a violent argument and a struggle between him and Beatrice, during which she picked up a pair of scissors and it looked to him as if \u201cshe was trying to make a pass at me with the scissors\u201d and he \u201cstruck her with the paring knife.\u201d No evidence of cake was found in the apartment (there was testimony that there had been none there for several days), and the scissors were found later by the police in a closed cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The trier of fact said he had no doubt that DeToro was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>guilty of murder in the first degree. We find the testimony in the record sufficient to justify the conclusion the trial judge reached. The continuing quarrel between the couple, her suggestion that she would leave the apartment to live elsewhere, the time and effort required to walk to the kitchen to obtain the knife used minutes later to kill, and the location and depth of the stab wound, constitute evidence of premeditated design to kill at least as strong as that found sufficient in <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87; <em>Grammer v. State, </em>203 Md. 200; <em>Elliott v. State, </em>215 Md. 152; and <em>Brown v. State, </em>220 Md. 29, 39.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
