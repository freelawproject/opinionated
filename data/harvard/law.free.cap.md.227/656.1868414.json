Moreover, under Code (1961 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 645C, the applicant was required to include in his verified petition to be filed with the clerk of the circuit court, facts within his personal knowledge which must be sworn to affirmatively as true and correct, which he did not do with respect to his alleged conversation with the sheriff, so that this claim on his part was not properly presented to the judge below, nor is it entitled to consideration on his application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
