After the defendant had filed a general issue plea, the plaintiff propounded certain interrogatories to the corporate defendant, which answered all of them except four, and, to these four, it flatly refused to reply. The plaintiff excepted to the sufficiency of the answers (in reality the failure to answer) pursuant to Maryland Rule 417 c 1, and the trial court sustained the exceptions, and ordered the defendant to answer. Again the defendant refused to answer, and filed a notice to stay execution of the court\u2019s order requiring it to answer the interrogatories, under the purported authority of Maryland Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>819. The court refused to stay the operation of its order, and, instead of invoking the sanction of Maryland Rule 422 d (contempt), the court, upon motion of the plaintiff, entered a judgment by default against the defendant, pursuant to Maryland Rule 417 d. The appellant then moved to strike out the judgment by default. This motion was denied, as the defendant had not, and did not, answer the interrogatories. The appellant then took the deposition of the plaintiff, who refused, upon advice of counsel, to answer questions concerning the <em>happening </em>of the accident, since the default judgment had already been entered. Again, at the extension of the judgment by default, the appellant attempted to cross-examine the plaintiff upon the issue of liability, which the court declined to permit. It, thereupon, made a proffer of a \u201cfactual and meritorious defense,\u201d which was rejected by the court because of the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">After considering the above litigious and somewhat protracted maneuvering, including, as it does, an assumption by the defendant of the calculated risk of a default judgment against it, the rather innocuous nature of the interrogatories, to which answers were refused, will, doubtless, cause surprise to many. These interrogatories, which we designate as a, b, c and d, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">(a) State the names and addresses of all persons who investigated plaintiff\u2019s injuries and damages for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">(b) Give a concise statement of the facts as to how you contend the occurrence took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">(c) If you contend that the plaintiff acted in such a manner as to cause or contribute to the occurrence, give a concise statement of the facts upon which you rely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">(d) If you contend that a person not a party to this action acted in such a manner as to cause or contribute to the occurrence, give a concise statement of the facts upon which you rely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">They are, obviously, framed, in almost verbatim language, in accordance with suggested \u201cForm of Interrogatories\u201d 11, 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>18 and 19 on page 40 of Niles, <em>Discovery Digest for Maryland </em>(see also Code (1960 Cum. Supp.), Vol. 9, p. 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Interrogatories of the nature here involved are governed, largely, by Maryland Rule 417, (all future references to \u201cRules\u201d will relate to Maryland Rules, unless otherwise stated) which, in turn, refers back to Rule 410 for the scope of the interrogatories' permitted, so we shall set forth these rules in part.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>We do not deem it necessary nor desirable, at this time, to make an extended or elaborate statement concerning our discovery rules. It will suffice to say that it is clear they are broad and comprehensive in scope, and were deliberately designed so to be. One of their fundamental and principal objectives is to require the disclosure of <em>facts </em>by a party litigant to all of his adversaries, and thereby to eliminate, as far as possible, the necessity of any party to litigation going to trial in a confused or muddled state of mind, concerning the facts that gave rise to the litigation. If all of the parties have knowledge of all of the relevant, pertinent and non-privileged facts, or the knowledge of the existence or whereabouts of such facts, the parties should be able properly to prepare their claims and defenses, thereby advancing the sound and expeditious administration of justice. In order to accomplish the above purposes, the discovery rules are to be liberally construed. And the trial judges, who are primarily called upon to administer said rules, are vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>with a reasonable, sound discretion in applying them, which discretion will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of its abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We turn now to a consideration of the specific interrogatories propounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">(a).'</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">It is difficult to sift out and state the essence or heart of the appellant\u2019s argument under this heading (if there be either). The defendant deplores the dearth of appellate decisional law in the field of discovery;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and seems to pitch its claim that (a) is an improper interrogatory on the fact that Rule 410 c 2 only requires an opposing party to produce the reports, or names, of \u201cexperts\u201d whom the opposing party \u201cproposes to call\u201d as witnesses. From this premise, appellant contends that it cannot be compelled to disclose the names of its investigators, because the plaintiff is not required to disclose to it the names of <em>all </em>of the experts who have examined the plaintiff, but only those whom she intends to call as witnesses, which permits the plaintiff \u201cto shop around\u201d for the right doctor with no fear of subsequent discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The argument is, patently, untenable. If it be desirable to require parties to divulge the names of <em>all </em>experts consulted by them, and not merely those intended to be called as witnesses, this fact may be a legitimate argument to change the provisions of Rule 410 .c 2, but it constitutes no shield for the appellant to relieve it of its obligation to answer proper interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">We note the appellant cites no authority, in point, to support its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The interrogatory was, we think, proper. It will be noticed that the question specifically limits its inquiry to \u201cthe names and addresses of all persons who investigated the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and damages for you.\u201d We stated above that it conforms to number 11 of the suggested \u201cForms for Interrogatories,\u201d and the authority for its issuance is clearly encompassed within the terms of Rule 410 a (1) and a (3), supplemented by Rule 417. Courts, wherein the validity of this or similar questions have been contested, have sustained the same. <em>Buining v. The Transporter, </em>171 F. Supp. 127, 133 (except for \u201cwork product\u201d of attorneys), (D. C. D. Md. Thomsen, J.); <em>Brocata v. King, </em>Daily Record, June 29, 1956 (Niles, C. J.). Cf. <em>McCall v. Overseas Tankship Corp., </em>16 F. R. D. 467 (D. C. S. D. N. Y.); <em>Greeff v. A. H. Bull Steamship Co., </em>Daily Record March 1, 1956 (Niles, C. J.). We hold that the interrogatory was a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The appellant argues that this interrogatory is probably objectionable if addressed to an individual defendant, but is clearly so, when propounded to a corporation. It claims that the contention by a corporate defendant as to how an accident occurred and the facts which form the basis for its' contention are gathered from many sources, arguing that such a contention results from the statement of facts supplied by the corporate agent who was in control of the instrumentality alleged to have caused plaintiff\u2019s injury, the statements' of fact supplied by various witnesses, the statements of fact supplied by the corporation\u2019s investigators, and, ultimately, the review by corporate counsel of all these factors' and a final determination, by him, as fi&gt; how the accident occurred, based upon those facts which he accepts as true, thus, a forced disclosure of this contention would violate the rule relating to both \u201cwork-product and privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">With this argument, we are unable to agree. Rule 417 a provides that if interrogatories are served upon private corporations', the answers shall be made by an officer or agent of the corporation, \u201cwho shall furnish such information as is available to the party served.\u201d The question, we think, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>impinges upon the letter nor the spirit of Rule 417 or Rule 410 (a) (1) and a (3). In 2 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>(Rules Ed.) p. 437, n. 88, the authors state: \u201cOne of the principal purposes of interrogatories is to ascertain the contentions of the adverse party.\u201d It will be noted that the question does not ask for the statements of any witnesses, nor the production of any reports; it asks only for a concise statement of facts of the corporate version of how the accident did occur. A reading of the short, simple forms of answers to questions of this nature,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> proposed by the same author who composed the suggested \u201cForms of Interrogatories,\u201d should be convincing that the interrogatory is proper and an answer thereto is practical, without necessarily transgressing the rule relating to \u201cwork-product or privilege.\u201d Rule 410 a specifically excludes privileged matter from the scope of discovery; and Rule 410 d relates to writings that are ordinarily not discoverable. Hence, if by any chance, an answer to this question would have required a violation of work-product or privilege, the appellant, by showing such violation to the trial court, when the exceptions to the answers were heard, could have been fully protected by a proper order of that court under the provisions of Rule 410 a, c and d, and Rule 406. <em>Hazell v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>15 F. R. D. 282 (D. C. E. D. Pa.); <em>McNeice v. Oil Carriers Joint Venture, </em>22 F. R. D. 14. We shall say more concerning this when considering interrogatory d.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Again, the appellant cites us no authority, in point, to support its position, and, again, courts, wherein this and similar questions, have been contested, have sustained their propriety. <em>United States v. General Motors Corp., 2 </em>F. R. D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>528 (D. C. N. D. Ill.); <em>Bell v. Novick Transfer </em>Co., 17 F. R. D. 279 (D. C. D. Md.) ; <em>Wilhelm v. Serio, et al., </em>Daily-Record, December 28, 1956, (Niles, C. J.). We hold the interrogatory was a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The appellant contends that an answer to this interrogatory, also, would necessarily invade privileged information and work-product matter; because the \u201ccontention of whether or not the plaintiff acted in such a manner as to cause or contribute to the occurrence is not one of fact but rather one of law and its determination lies in the office of counsel for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The appellant cites us no authority, decisional or otherwise, and we have found none, which states that the interrogatory is an improper one. On the other hand, similar questions to the one being now considered, relating to contributory negligence or negligence, were held proper in <em>Buining v. The Transporter, supra, </em>(except for work-product of attorneys); <em>Forsythe v. B. &amp; O. R.R. Co., </em>15 F. R. D. 191 (W. D. Pa.); and <em>McNeice v. Oil Carriers Joint Venture, supra. </em>See also <em>May v. B. &amp; O. R.R. Co., </em>17 F. R. D. 288 (D. C., D. Md.), wherein Judge Thomsen aptly noted that; \u201c \u2018* * * A defendant is entitled to be informed as to what he will have to meet [at the trial].\u2019 So is a plaintiff.\u201d Of course, as indicated above, the trial court is in a position to protect the parties against requiring the divulgence of privileged information or work-product matter. The question was, we think, a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Appellant cites no authority in its argument objecting to this interrogatory. It claims the question is another attempt to \u201cinvade the privileged and work-product area,\u201d urging that the determination \u201cof the contributory negligence of a person not a party to the action \u201clies with counsel, and the conclusion of the existence of such negligence, based upon facts, some of which (the appellant claims) are privileged and some of which are not, involves a question of law, the result of which is not discoverable under any theory. This contention has been an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>swered, in substantial part, by what we have said above; however we shall add, briefly, 'to what has already been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">A very lucid expression concerning privileged communications between attorneys and clients is contained in the opinion of the early case of <em>Crosby v. Berger, </em>11 Paige (N. Y.) 377, wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cThe appellant is under a mistake in supposing that an attorney or counselor is privileged from answering as to every thing which comes' to his knowledge while he is acting as attorney or counsel. The privilege only extends to information derived from his client, as such; either by oral communications, or from books or papers shown to him by his client, or placed in his hands in his' character of attorney or counsel. Information derived from other persons, or other sources, although such information is derived or obtained while acting as attorney or counsel, is not privileged. * * *. But the principle of the rule does not apply to the discovery of facts within the knowledge of the attorney or counsel, which were not communicated or confided to him by his client; although he became acquainted with such facts while engaged in his professional duty as the attorney or counsel of his client. * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Cf. <em>Lanasa v. State, </em>109 Md. 602, 71 A. 1058; <em>Chase\u2019s Case, </em>1 Bl. 206; <em>Hickman v. Taylor, supra, </em>329 U. S. 495; <em>Cold Metal Process Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, </em>7 F. R. D. 425 (N. D. Ohio). Thus, it readily can be seen that the \u201cofficer or agent\u201d of the corporate defendant, by furnishing \u201csuch information as is available to the party served\u201d in giving \u201ca concise statement of the facts upon which [the defendant'relies],\u201d would not necessarily, as contended by the appellant, have been required to divulge privileged information or work-product matter. The \u201cofficer or agent\u201d could not be required to disclose any information that was, in fact, privileged, by the explicit' provisions of Rule 410 a. If \u00e1n answer would have required a disclosure of work-product matter, the subject was covered by Rule 410 c and d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Rule 406. Consequently, as we indicated under (b) above, if an answer would, in reality, have required a disclosure either of privileged information or nondiscoverable work-product matter, appellant could have been fully protected by proper objection made to the trial court. We hold that this, also, was a proper interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The above answers all of the appellant\u2019s complaints concerning the validity of the interrogatories, but it maintains the trial court erred in several other rulings. When the trial court ordered appellant to answer the interrogatories, the appellant attempted, under the purported authority of Rule 819, to stay the operation of the court\u2019s order by offering to furnish bond,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6which procedure the court refused to permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Rule 819 was formerly Code (1951), Article 5, Section 34, which applied to equity causes, alone. Only three prior cases relating to it have reached this Court, none of which is helpful to the decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We do not think the contention deserves lengthy discussion. It is true that the wording of Rule 819 is general in its terms and does not, itself, place any limitation on the terms \u201cany previous interlocutory order\u201d; but it is equally true that statutes relating to the same subject matter will be construed, when possible, so as to harmonize with each other,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and not produce unreasonable or foolish results,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the same rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>of construction, we think, apply to the Maryland. Rules. If the construction of Rule 819, attributed to it by the appellant, be the true one, it is difficult to discover the purpose and usefulness of Rule 422 (naming sanctions that the trial courts may direct in order to force recalcitrant parties and their officers and agents to answer designated questions, etc.), which, in effect, would be rendered nugatory, if a party can flout the order of court directing him to answer certain questions and await the outcome of the appeal on a final judgment, by simply posting a bond. Moreover, such a construction would take away from the trial courts their time-honored power and authority to control, and to direct, the course of the proceedings in their respective courts, and place the same in the hands' of the litigants. Such dire and drastic results were not contemplated in the adoption of Rule 819. We believe, as this Court stated in <em>Hallman v. Gross, </em>190 Md. 563, 59 A. 2d 304, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">\u201c* * * The purpose of the discovery was to find pertinent and material evidence, not privileged. No matter discovered in this process would be evidence unless it was pertinent and material and not privileged. If the chancellor in the trial of the case should rule on such matters, it is not conceivable that the party ruled against could stop the proceedings and take an appeal to this court. The matter would have to be raised on an appeal from the final decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is not necessary for the purposes of this decision to designate which interlocutory orders are embraced within the rule and which are not, and we shall not attempt to do so, but we have no hesitation in holding that an order requiring a party to answer specified interrogatories is not; consequently, the trial court properly refused to set bond and stay the operation of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Thereafter, the court entered a judgment by default against the defendant for its refusal to answer the interrogatories. This was done pursuant to Rule 422 c. When the judgment by default was extended by the court, without the aid of a jury (Rule 648), the defendant attempted to offer evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>relative to- its liability. This, of course, was improper, 2 Poe, <em>Pleading &amp; Practice </em>(Tiff. Ed.), \u00a7\u00a7 365, 367, 369, 372; however, the appellant contends' that such action by the court denied it procedural due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The claim is without merit. Rule 422 c, as does Rule 37 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, empowers the court, among other things, to enter a judgment by default against a party who refuses to answer interrogatories. Such authority, when properly exercised, has been held not to violate due process of law. <em>Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, </em>212 U. S. 322. If a party can refuse to answer and be defaulted, and still present a \u201cmeritorious\u201d defense when the default judgment is extended, the party has suffered nothing by its refusal to answer, and Rule 422 c is meaningless. The later case of <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers, </em>357 U. S. 197, is easily distinguishable. In the case at bar, the defendant showed no \u201cinability, despite good-faith efforts, to comply with a pretrial production order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\">. \u201cRULE 417.
