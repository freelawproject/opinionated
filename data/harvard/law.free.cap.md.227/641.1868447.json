In 1958 he was found by a jury to be a defective delinquent and was committed to Patuxent for an indeterminate period.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">As a result of a petition for redetermination of his status as a defective delinquent, a hearing was held on June 19, 1961, before Judge Manley in Baltimore City, at which Barnes was represented by court-appointed counsel. At the hearing Barnes elected to' have the Judge hear the case without a jury. There were only two witnesses\u2014-Dr. Harold M. Boslow, Director of the Patuxent Institution, and Barnes. The essence of Dr. Boslow\u2019s testimony was that Bar.nes has \u201cdemonstrated a persistent aggravated anti-social behavior,\u201d is \u201cintellectually deficient\u201d and \u201cemotionally unbalanced,\u201d and \u201chas clearly demonstrated himself to be an actual danger to society so as to require confinement and treatment.\u201d This testimony was amply supported by several exhibits of institutional reports concerning Barnes\u2019* behavior, clearly showing him to be mentally defective, emotionally unbalanced, and a threat to society. Barnes\u2019 testimony was mostly to the effect that he was getting along better at Patuxent with the staff than he previously had been doing, that he wanted to go home, and that he thought he could behave himself properly if allowed to do so. Judge Manley found as a matter' of fact that Barnes at present would be a threat to society if permitted his freedom and ordered his recommitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Subsequently, Barnes filed in this Court his application for leave to appeal, in which he raises six points. Five of these can be summarily disposed of. The first is an allegation that Dr. Boslow made conflicting statements and actually committed perjury-in stating that Barnes had once been involved in an armed robbery. The transcript reveals no conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>testimony and no such statement. The second and third averments are, in substance, that he was denied counsel of his own choice and denied a \u201cfair and speedy trial.\u201d Neither of these points was raised at the hearing below and therefore neither is subject to review by this Court. Md. Rule 885. The fifth point is that testimony from his previous trial was used as evidence against him. Again, the transcript fails to disclose this. The sixth point, that he has been denied proper medical treatment at Patuxent, is irrelevant to any cogent issue involved in a redetermination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The remaining contention, the applicant\u2019s fourth point, is that he was not a potential defective delinquent when he was first sent to Patuxent for examination, in that he was not \u201cconvicted of two or more convictions in a criminal court of the State of Maryland,\u201d as required by Code (1957), Art. 31B, Sec. 6 (a) (5). He was, however, convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, which, under Code (1957), Art. 31B, Sec. 6 (a) (2), is made an alternative basis for examination. In fact, this Court has recently held, in <em>State v. Roberson, </em>222 Md. 518, that a person convicted under Code (1957), Art. 27, Sec. 349, the statute under which Barnes was convicted, had been convicted of a misdemeanor \u201cpunishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary,\u201d as that phrase is used in Art. 31B, Sec. 6 (a) (2), even though such an offense was not punishable solely by imprisonment in the penitentiary and the applicant had not in fact been sentenced to the penitentiary. <em>Cf. Ambrose v. Director, </em>224 Md. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
