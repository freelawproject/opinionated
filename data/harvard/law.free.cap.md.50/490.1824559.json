Whatever may be the doctrines announced in other Courts, we are not aware that this Court has decided that such bonds as these are freed from all infirmities attending their original issue, and that the corporation is estopped by the recital on their face from denying their validity. If it be a mere question of power in the company to issue the bonds, it would seem to be conclusively settled by the case of <em>Steam Nav. Co. vs. Dandridge, </em>8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>248, 318, where it was held that a corporation might, in a suit at law, deny its liability under contract, because it was made <em>ultra vires, </em>even when it had been paid the consideration for the service agreed to be performed. This case has been recently recognized. <em>Boyce vs. M. E.

There are cases in which it has been held that when the issue of bonds by municipal corporations was made to depend on something to be done, as a condition precedent, <em>and the bonds recited that such requirements had been complied with, </em>a <em>bona fide </em>holder was not bound to look beyond the existence of power in the -corporation to create the debt. 96 <em>U.

As the conveyance made by the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad Company was a security for the payment of certain debts payable by that company, a proviso allowing redemption was not necessary; because the right to redeem existed if the conveyance was a security for particular debts, whether the conveyance contained such proviso or not. <em>Joynes vs. Statham, </em>3 <em>Ak., margin p. </em>389; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Bell vs. Carter, </em>17 <em>Beav., </em>11; <em>Dougherty vs. McColgan, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>283.

How, as the answer of the trustees did not deny that the records of the railroad company sustained the statement made in the petition as to the occurrences at the meeting of April 25th, 1872, <em>(Covington vs. Ludlow, </em>1 <em>Metc., </em>295; <em>Taylor vs. Henry, </em>2 <em>Pick., </em>297;) and did not deny that the extracts from those records, which were made, hy reference, parts of the petition, were true extracts, and made no objection to the admissibility, or form of the proof thus introduced, the averments in the petition in reference to the proceedings of the president and directors of the railroad company, on the day referred to, were supported hy &lt;c auxiliary proof,\u201d the existence of which was not disputed. The proof thus offered was <em>\u201c </em>a stringent corroborative circumstance,\u201d (Po<em>or vs. Carleton, </em>3 <em>Sumn., </em>77, Story, J.,) referred to in the petition and not denied in the answer. It ought, upon the motion to dissolve the injunction, to have been taken as true. <em>Briesch vs. McCauley, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>197, citing <em>Young vs. Grundy, </em>7 <em>Cranch S. C., </em>51. When such auxiliary evidence was shown to exist, the special injunction ought not to have been dissolved. <em>High on Injunctions, </em>529; 2 <em>Joyce on Injunctions, </em>1296; <em>Orr vs. Littlefield, </em>1 <em>Wood &amp; Minot, </em>19; <em>Poor vs. Carleton, </em>3 <em>Sumn., </em>77, 78; <em>Pyecroft vs. Pyecroft, </em>2 <em>Smale &amp; Gif., </em>326. The Court, observing that the case was one which required investigation, ought to have continued the special injunction until the hearing, <em>(High on Injunctions, </em>529;) because the law ought rather to interpose a guard against consequences, by previous restraint, than attempt to correct such consequences afterwards. <em>Universities of Oxford vs. Rich</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>ardson, </em>6 <em>Sumner\u2019s Vesey, Jr., </em>711. It was the duty of the Court to determine, in the exercise of a sound discretion, whether the injunction should he dissolved or not, <em>(Woodworth, et al. vs. Rogers, et al., </em>3 <em>Wood &amp; Minot, </em>145 ;) and as the existence of a record affecting the legal character of the organization of the hoard of directors hy which the mortgage in question had been authorized, was not denied, the injunction restraining tlm trustees from acting under that mortgage ought to have been continued until the hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-5\">If the mortgage of June 20th, 1812, alleged to have been made hy the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad Company to William Gr.

But mortgages made to secure such bonds enjoy no such immunity or privilege. Such mortgages are neither negotiable securities nor commercial paper. They are deeds, governed by the law pertaining to such instruments. I am not dealing with a case in which the railroad company is resisting a suit upon one or more of the bonds alleged to be secured by the mortgage of June 20th, 1872; but with a case in which the trustees are endeavoring to enforce the mortgage of that date. The causes of action in the two cases are essentially different. It would have been proper for the bondholders and trustees <em>both </em>to have pursued their separate remedies, if they had seen fit to do so. <em>Wilhelm vs. Lee, </em>2 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>323. As the proceedings are different, they admit of separate defences. And if it be true, as insisted by the trustees, that the bonds, being commercial paper, cannot be assailed because of an infirmity in their origin, it does not follow that the immunity which they possess extends to the mortgage executed to secure such bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-5\">It would certainly be competent for the railroad company to show, at some stage of the proceedings which are now pending, that the mortgage involved in this controversy was authorized by persons who were not directors, and executed by persons who had no right to execute it, in ignorance of any defect in their respective rights. <em>Gregory vs. Doidge, </em>3 <em>Bing., </em>474, (13 <em>E.

If the Court perceives from the petition and exhibits that there is undenied evidence tending to these conclusions, certainly the proceedings on such mortgage ought to be stayed. Such order ought to be made, even if the Court should be of the opinion that the railroad company can be compelled to execute a new mortgage to secure any portion of the bonds covered by the inoperative instrument, which can be shown to have been used by the railroad company for its proper corporate purposes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Arthur George Brown </em>and <em>A.

Court in the case of the <em>Bank of Commerce vs. Lanahan, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>396, seems to furnish an answer to this question. The deed in that case, <em>(q. v., </em>pages 398 to 401,) in most respects was like the one in this. Like this deed it contained (page 401) an affidavit to the consideration, hut it was held hy the Court of Appeals to he a deed of trust, and not a mortgage, for the following among other reasons: It did not conform to the formula given in the Code, Art. 24, sec. 60, (45 <em>Md., </em>407.) The deed was made for the benefit of creditors, and the grant was to one of them in trust, to secure his own debt and the debts of the other creditors in the manner and upon the terms specified in the deed. The grantee was \u201c the <em>trustee, and the creditors were cestuis que trust, not mortgagees strictly and technically such.\u201d </em>Upon default, those creditors could not take possession of the estate and apply the rents, etc.; nor had they any right of foreclosure, such as a mortgagee would have under a technical mortgage. Their only remedy was the enforcement of the trust; and to execute the trust required the property to he sold. (45 <em>Md., </em>408.) These remarks apply equally well to the deed of trust in question in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-7\">In deciding that case the Court remarked, (45 <em>Md., </em>407,) \u201cas to the question of the character of the deed, upon careful examination of its provisions, we are of the opinion that <em>it is not a technical mortgage within the contemplation of the fifth section of the sixty-fourth Article of the Code </em>referred to, but a deed of trust denominated such by the Code, Art. 24, sec. 55. It is a deed of trust to secure debts; and <em>while it has some of the attributes of a mortgage, yet it presents features which distinguish it from that class of securities, strictly considered.\u201d </em>(To the same effect see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>1 <em>Jones on Mortgages, sec. </em>60, and <em>Carson vs. Phelps, </em>40 <em>Md., </em>96, 97.) Obviously, therefore, in the view of this Court, only \u201c technical mortgages \u201d which belong to \u201c that class of security strictly considered,\u201d fall \u201c within the contemplation \u201d of the sixty-fourth Article of the Code, or are affected hy it or governed by its provisions. This construction is strengthened hy what .the Court said in the next sentence (page 407) about \u201cthe legal, formal mortgage, as distinguished from instruments held to be mortgages by construction of Courts of equity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-5\">That this is not a strained construction of the Court\u2019s language, nor a perversion of its meaning, is clearly shown by its decision on another section of the sixty-fourth Article of the Code, title, Mortgages. Section 2 of that Article provides that \u201c no mortgage or deed in the nature of a mortgage shall he a lien or charge on any estate or property, for any other or different principal sum or sums of money than the principal sum or sums that shall appear on the face of such mortgage,\u201d etc.; and yet, notwithstanding the sweeping and comprehensive language of this section, which, by its express terms, covers not only \u201cmortgages,\u201d but \u201cdeeds in the nature of a mortgage,\u201d this Court held in the same decision, <em>(Bank of Commerce vs. Lanahan, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>408,) that it did not apply to the deed in that case, simply and solely because that instrument was \u201cnot a technical mortgage.\u201d (Page 407.) The Court, in the same opinion, concluded its discussion thus, (page 409:) \u201c Being of the opinion that the deed before us is not a mortgage within the meaning of the Code, Art. 64,'sec. 5, it follows that the requirements of the 7th and 14th sections of the same Article of the Code have no application to the sale made and reported hy the trustee in this case.\u201d So too, and for precisely the same reasons, say the trustees, in these cases, concerning the sale which they have proposed to make in the City of Baltimore-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUq\">And in the same connection they rely, as did the Court in 45 <em>Md., </em>407, upon the fact that the instrument in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>record does not fit the form of a technical mortgage as contained in the Code, Art. 24, sec. 60, hut is, in form and substance, a deed of trust in accordance with section 55 of the same Article. The same construction was, in another decision, applied to section 29 of Article 24 of the Code, in a strictly analogous case. That section enacts that <em>\u201c no mortgage shall he valid </em>except as between the parties thereto, unless there he endorsed thereon an oath or affirmation,\u201d etc. Concerning that section, it was decided by this Court in the cases of <em>Stockett vs. Holliday, </em>9 <em>Md., </em>492, 499, and <em>Carson vs. Phelps, </em>40 <em>Md., </em>96, 97, <em>that it applies to \u201c deeds of mortgage technically such, </em>and not to deeds of trust.\u201d In the case last cited the remarks of the Court on page 97, in construing the deed, throw light upon the instrument now in question. <em>Charles vs. Clagett, </em>3 <em>Md., </em>83, 84, 93; 1 <em>Jones on Mortgages, sec. </em>62; 2 <em>Jones on Mortgages, sec. </em>1769; 13 <em>Md., </em>178.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">The Code and the Courts recognize a distinction between deeds of trust and mortgages. 1874, <em>ch. </em>483, <em>sec. </em>107; 1878, <em>ch. </em>136; 1 <em>Code, Art. </em>24, <em>sec. </em>55 ; 1 <em>Code, Art. </em>24, <em>sec. </em>60; 1 <em>Evans\u2019 Harris, </em>65.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-6\">A mortgage is a conveyance by the mortgagor, a debtor, to the mortgagee, his creditor, as a security for the payment of money or performance of a covenant, with remaining equity of redemption in the mortgagor. 1 <em>Bouvier,sec. </em>884; 2 <em>Bouvier, p. </em>280; 2 <em>Burrill\u2019s Law Dic., \u201cMortgage.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-7\">If, then, the instrument is a deed of trust it requires no argument to show that the sale advertised for July 2nd, 1878, was in strict accordance with the power, and that, therefore, the injunction prohibiting any sale in Baltimore should he dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-8\">The railroad, in its petition, <em>\u201c denies that the said po~etended mortgage, </em>under and by virtue of which the said William Gr.

It is further admitted that a very large number of the bonds which purported and were supposed to he secured hy the deed were sold hy the agents of the railroad, and now belong to <em>bona fide </em>holders, whose money the corporation received; and it is not denied that Boards of Directors subsequently elected, about whose power and the regularity of whose proceedings no question is made, ratified the deed and all the transactions connected therewith, and provided the money to pay six semi-annual coupons of the bonds secured thereby. But the simple, naked proposition is, that the Board which authorized the deed was irregularly elected, and therefore that instrument \u201cconstitutes no valid lien upon said property and franchises, or confers upon said persons any valid authority to sell the same.\u201d The petition in this case was entirely wanting in the essential elements of frankness and candor, in this: that it made no reference to the most material facts in the whole case, viz., that the petitioner has paid six semi-annual coupons on the bonds in question, and in several successive annual reports recognized them as valid obligations of the corporation; that it never disputed them before this controversy ; that it has repeatedly promised to pay the overdue coupons, and asked the trustees for delay; that the present Board admitted, before the property was advertised, that they had no defence to make; and that the present Board is in hy virtue or vice of this very tainted stock.

Some of these conditions and covenants, are those usually contained in mortgages, viz., that the grantors should remain in possession until default made; that they should manage, operate and enjoy the said railroad, and take and use all the rents, income, profits, tolls and issues, and dispose of the same in any manner not inconsistent with the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In case of default in the payment of interest on any of said bonds, for the period of six months, the principal of all the bonds should become immediately due and payable, and it should he lawful for the trustees, etc., to enter into and upon all and singular the railroads, etc., and exercise and enjoy the franchises and interests thereby conveyed, and after payment of expenses, apply the money arising as aforesaid, to the payment of the interest on the bonds outstanding, according to the tenor of the coupons, and in the order in which said coupons shall become due, and after paying all such past due coupons, to apply the same to the satisfaction of the principal of said outstanding bonds, ratably, and without discrimination, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">It was further provided by Article fourth of said deed, it should he lawful for said trustees <em>\u201c </em>to sell and dispose of all and singular the railroad and railroads, and all other the premises, and property, franchises and interests thereby conveyed, at public auction, in the City of New York, or in the City of Baltimore, should said trustees so elect, etc.\u201d The trustees, professing to act under the power contained in the above cited deed, filed their bond in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, sitting in equity, for the sum of $500,000, payable to the State on the 11th April, 1818, with a condition thereunder written as 'prescribed by Article 64, sec. 6, of the Code of Pub. Gen. Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">They advertised the property for sale, on the second of July, in the City of Baltimore, as required by the deed, when they were enjoined by a <em>nisi </em>order of said Court, passed <em>upon the petition of the Annapolis &amp; Elk Ridge Railroad </em>Company, the Attorney-General appearing in the case by order of the General Assembly, and the Board of Public Works.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">An answer having been filed upon motion to dissolve the interlocutory injunction, the Court below continued the same, so far as it restrained the respondents from selling the property described in the deed in the City of Baltimore, and dissolved it in all other respects, from which decretal order, both the petitioners and respondents appealed. The cross-appeals involve the validity of the deed, as a corporate act, binding the corporation, or the stockholders, and assuming its validity, the legality of the sale proposed to be made in the City of Baltimore by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The first question, (including the second, and being vital to all further proceedings in the case,) will properly take precedence in our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">It is alleged by the petitioners, that the board of directors, by which the resolution was adopted authorizing the loan, and the execution of the deed to secure the same, was not a legally constituted board.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">It is not necessary to critically examine the facts alleged in the petition, to sustain this conclusionbecause, the case being heard on bill and answer, and this allegation being denied, it is for the time being, out of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Some exception has been taken at the hearing of the cause in this Court, to the form of, and the sufficiency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the denial, hut we think the authorities sustain the respondents and the Court below on this point. <em>Vide </em>45 <em>Md., </em>453 ; <em>Drury vs. Conner, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>289; <em>Waters vs. Creagh, </em>4 <em>Stew. &amp; P., </em>411; <em>Hughes vs. Garner, Y. &amp; C., </em>127 ; <em>Knickerbocker vs. Harris, </em>1 <em>Paige, </em>209.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The application for the injunction is made by the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad Company by its solicitors, the Attorney-General appearing as one of them, by order of the General Assembly and the Board of Public Works.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The State does not appear as a stockholder, setting up equities independently of the corporation, and we must <em>\u201cpro hac vice \u201d </em>consider her as represented by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Whatever claims a corporation might have for interference by injunction to protect its rights against an abuse or exercise of corporate powers <em>ultra vires, </em>the corporation as such, when a party to a cause, is bound by the same rules of equity as an individual. The doctrine of estoppel applies to the one as well as to the other. This Court has enforced this principle in numerous instances. <em>State, ex rel. Mayor, &amp;c. of Baltimore vs. Kirkley, et al., </em>29 <em>Md., </em>85 ; 40 <em>Md., </em>395 ; 39 <em>Md, </em>36.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The deed, and the bonds which it was intended to issue and secure, have been executed with all the legal formalities required by the charter and its amendments; \u2014 purporting on their face to be made in pursuance of, and to effect the purposes authorized by the charter as amended; the bonds have been negotiated in open market, to a certain extent, and their proceeds paid to the corporation; \u25a0and for several successive years appropriations have been made by the company, to pay the accruing interest, from the current revenues of the company, or other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Unless, therefore, the corporation has been since the year 1872, in the hands of directors and officers who were only \u201cde <em>facto\u201d </em>directors and officers, and not <em>\u201cde jure,\u201d </em>the acts of the directors and managers of 1872, in author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>izing the loan, executing the deed, and issuing these-bonds, have been ratified and confirmed by the continuous recognition of, and provision made for them. The corporation as such, cannot be allowed to disavow and repudiate its own acts, to the injury of <em>bona fide </em>holders of these bonds, without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Stockholders are generally concluded by the action of the majority, represented by directors duly elected, acting within their chartered limits; we do not express any opinion upon the rights of the State as a stockholder; she-does not appear in that character before us. Nor -do we wish to be understood as laying any stress upon the effect of the Act of 1816, ch. 331, entitled \u201cAn Act to amend the charter of the Drum Point Railroad Company,\u201d etc., \u201cand to extend the time for the completion thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">There is nothing in that Act, as we construe it, which prevents the State from asserting all its rights as a stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The second point involves the right of the trustees, to-sell the property conveyed to them, under the power contained in the deed, in Baltimore, or elsewhere, than in the-county where the property lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">It is contended on the part of the petitioners, that the instrument conveying the property and conferring the power of sale, being a mortgage, the trustees could not-legally sell out of the county in which the mortgaged premises lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">In several of the more recent decisions of this Court, in which the construction of different sections of Art. 64, title Mortgage, of the Code of Public General Laws, was involved, it has been held that the mortgages therein referred to were \u201ctechnical mortgages,\u201d and the Court has distinguished other instruments, which in some respects were equitable mortgages, from technical mortgages, to avoid the embarrassments and inconveniences which would re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>suit from applying all the provisions annexed to technical mortgages to other deeds of a cognate character, deeds of trust, etc. <em>Vide Charles vs. Clagett, </em>3 <em>Md., </em>82; 45 <em>Md., </em>396.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Although the instrument now before us has many of the features of a technical mortgage, yet it contains others which are peculiarly embraced in the class of executory trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The debts to be secured in this case were prospective, and the amount uncertain, held by numerous obligees, whose right to the benefit of the deed, passed by endorsement or delivery of the bonds as negotiable instruments; the forfeiture of the deed depending upon the non-payment of the interest for six months, <em>subject to a right in a majority of the holders of said bonds to instruct the trustees to waive the right to consider the principal due, etc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">After investing the trustees with the power to enter and sell upon certain contingencies, it makes them subject to the order <em>in writing of a majority of the bondholders, </em>whether they shall exercise one or both of these powers, and when, and in the meantime they are to hold and use the property for the benefit of all the bondholders after paying current expenses. They are in terms trustees, acting upon the requisition in writing, of a majority of the bondholders in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">If this Court was warranted, in the case of <em>The Bank of Commerce vs. Lanahan, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>396, in deciding that the deed in that case was not a technical mortgage within the contemplation of the 5th section of Art. 64, we must by the same process of reasoning arrive at a similar conclusion in the construction of the 14th section, as regards the deed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">It results from these premises, that the order of the Circuit Court of the 23rd of August, 1878, in so far as it dissolved the injunction restraining the trustees from \u201centering upon or taking possession of any part or all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the real estate or personal property under the deed of trust mentioned in the proceedings, until the further order of the Court in the premises \u201d he affirmed, and that the said order of the Court below, of the 23rd of August, 1878, continuing the injunction heretofore issued in this cause, restraining the sale of the property in the City of Baltimore, should be reversed, and said injunction dissolved with costs to the respondents.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"At\">(Decided 7th February, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, injunction dissolved, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
