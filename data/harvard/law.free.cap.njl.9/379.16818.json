Hoisted,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A39\">resisted this motion by making an application to the court that proceedings in the suit be stayed until the costs of a former suit, commenced by the plaintiff against the same defendant, (in which the writ had been quashed for a defective service,) be paid; and cited 4 <em>Hals. Rep. </em>86; <em>Ibid. </em>96.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-8\">\n<em>Wall.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auc\">The writ in the former suit was quashed on the motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel, before appearance entered. The defendant therefore was not entitled to costs. The statute, <em>Rev. Laws </em>168, <em>see. </em>2, gives costs to the defendant only after appearance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b484-9\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASI\">As the statute gives no costs in this case, we cannot grant the rule to stay proceedings; the rule to plead must be ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
