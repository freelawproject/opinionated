The cause had been submitted to referees, and the objectionable items to which he took exception were the costs of the circuit at which the cause had, as he insisted, \u25a0 been noticed, before, issue joined; and also the costs of the referees; and he contended that it was incumbent on the party obtaining the taxation of the bill to support it, upon the retaxation, by proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-5\">*384] *The Chief Justice asked if the bill, as taxed by the clerk, was not to be considered as prima facie correct; and whether the onus of shewing it erroneous was not imposed upon the party excepting ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-6\">\n<em>Hoisted</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU-\">replied, that the uniform practice, as far as he was acquainted with it, was for the clerk of the Supreme Court to rely upon the representations of the attorney, as to the costs accruing at the circuit or b\u00e9fore referees, and to tax the bill in this respect as the attorney drew it. His taxation of items of this character ought not, therefore, to be entitled to the same respect as where the performance of the services, or items charged, appeared by the records of his court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-7\">Besides, it was in many cases impossible for the party objecting to the taxation, to prove that the service charged \u25a0was not performed, whereas the party making the charge ought always to be prepared with the vouchers to prove it. <em>Rev.
