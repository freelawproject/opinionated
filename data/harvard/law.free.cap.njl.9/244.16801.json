[*244</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b319-7\">When an indictment purports to be on the <em>affirmation </em>of some of die grand jurors, it must appear that they alleged themselves conscientiously scrupulous of taking ail oath.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-8\">\n<em>Dayton</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdQ9\">moved to quash the indictment in this case, (which had been brought into this court by certiorari) because it did not appear by the caption of the indictment, nor by the indictment itself, that the individual grand jurors who <em>affirmed, </em>alleged themselves to be conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath; and cited <em>Rev. Laws </em>429, <em>sea. </em>3; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>1 <em>Hals. Rep. </em>341; and <em>The State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>2 <em>Ibid </em>361.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-10\">\n<em>Jeffers,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlR\">contra, contended that the cases cited, being founded upon the statute of 1728, <em>ALlinson\u2019s edition of New Jersey Laws </em>74, the phraseology of which was different from the act of 1799, cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, ought not to govern the present case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Ewing, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">We are all satisfied that the indictment must be quashed. As the law stood, at the time of Sharp\u2019s case, all the jurors were required to be sworn, except such as were of the people called quakers, who by statute were entitled to take an affirmation; and the point decided in that case is that the grand juror who takes the affirmation must be shewn on the indictment or caption to be within the exception. The same principle was decided in <em>The State v. Harris, </em>and in the recent case of <em>The State </em>v. <em>Vanarsdalen. </em>The difference of phraseology between the statutes of 1728 and 1799 is that the former allows the affirmation to quakers only, the latter extends it to all persons who allege themselves to be conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath. This difference does not affect the principle ruled in these cases, all of which are direct authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Indictment quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
