Upon the return of the certiorari a rule was taken on behalf of the plaintiff in certiorari, upon the justice, to certify whether <em>\u201c </em>the words, executors of Samuel Tonkin, deceased, are on his record of proceedings, and if there, whether the same were not added to the record after the certiorari was presented to him.\u201d In obedience to this rule the justice certified that the entry of the above action was in the following words, viz: \u201c William C. Tonkin and Edward Tonkin, Executors of S\u2019l. T. dec\u2019d, *253] vs. Thomas *01ayton,\u201d and that no word had been added to the record after the certiorari was presented.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-7\"><em>W.
