J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsOH\">The doctrine of amendment is a very salutary one. When the amendment may be made without producing to the adverse party any injury whatever, it ought to be allowed; and we apprehend it may be done here. In New York the doctrine of amendment as to declarations in ejectment is very liberal. <em>Adams on Eject. </em>*255] 202, <em>note </em>6. In this court an amendment in *the demise was ordered to be made, after trial, in the case of <em>Den ex dem. Hoover </em>v. <em>Franklin and Sharp, 2 South. Rep. </em>850. The amendment now applied for is fully supported by the case of <em>Doe ex dem. Bass </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>7 <em>Term Rep. </em>469. In the present case the defendant will be precluded from no defence; he will not be compelled to go to trial one -moment sooner, by allowing the notice to be amended. Therefore, let the notice be amended by striking out the words <em>\u201c </em>ninth day,\u201d and inserting the words <em>second Tuesday.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
