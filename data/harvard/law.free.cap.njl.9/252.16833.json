From this judgment Weaver appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Bergen, and upon the trial of the *252] appeal, the Court of Common *Pleas affirmed the judgment of the justice. Weaver then brought this certiorari.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-6\"><em>Frelinghuysen, </em>for the plaintiff in certiorari,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ape\">moved to reverse the judgment of the Common Pleas\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-7\">Because the state of demand was uncertain and contained no legal cause of action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-8\"><em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">The state of demand sets forth no legal cause of action. The plaintiff does not shew that any injury was done to him. It may be, for aught that appears in the state of demand, that he has turned the wood into coal, and sold it, and put the money in his pocket. He cannot recover merely for a false affirmation. On a warranty of title, if there was none, the purchaser could not immediately turn round and sue the vendor, nor until some injury was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Let the judgment be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
