The court thereupon appointed commissioners, who made a division between the petitioners and the said Lewis Parker, which was confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court in the term of August, 1826.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-6\"><em>Wall, </em>for Lewis Parker, assigned for error\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">1.

Laws </em>779. And the remark js so obvious as to make the mention of it almost superfluous, that those courts have jurisdiction over this matter onty so far as it is expressly given to them. The thirteenth section relates to real estate held by devise undivided, and needs not here be further adverted to. The twelfth section gives jurisdiction, any one or more of the heirs being under the age of twenty-one years, to direct partition of real estate, held undivided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>reason of descent, among the heirs or persons claiming under them, in such shares and proportions as they may ho entitled to under the laws directing the descent of real estates; and extends only to authorize \u201c the metes and bounds of each child\u2019s or other heir\u2019s share \u201d to be ascertained by the commissioners whom the court are to appoint. The application in the present case was for partition betwpea heirs on the one part, and him on the other part who had been a tenant in common with their ancestor, and the division was accordingly made by the commissioners. The case presented by the application, was not within the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court. They had not authority by the statute to make an order for such partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Let the partition he set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
