C. P. A. (Patents) 1194, 111 F. (2d) 490, we held that canned milk and tea and coffee possessed the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In the case of <em>California Packing Corporation </em>v. <em>Tillman &amp; Bendel. Inc., </em>17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1048, 40 F. (2d) 108, we held that coffee and fruits and vegetables (canned, dried, and preserved), pork and beans, relishes, sauces, etc. possessed the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">If, as held in the case of <em>White House Milk Products Co., etc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number><em>Dwinell-Wright Co., supra, </em>tea and coffee possess the same descriptive properties as milk, it would be rather far-fetched to hold that ice cream, consisting mainly of milk and cream (flavored and frozen), does not possess the same descriptive properties as tea and coffee, particularly in view of the fact that it is frequently flavored with coffee and, when so flavored, is known as \u201ccoffee ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">If appellee is entitled to register the \u201cWHITE HOUSE\u201d mark for use on ice cream, it, of course, would have the right, so far as registration is concerned, to advertise \u201cWhite House Coffee Ice Cream,\u201d which advertisement obviously would indicate to the purchasing public that \u201cWhite House Coffee\u201d and \u201cWhite House Coffee Ice Cream\u201d originated in appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We have given careful consideration to the decisions of the Patent Office tribunals and to the arguments presented here by counsel for appellee, but are of opinion that tea and coffee on the one hand and ice cream on the other possess the same descriptive properties; that the marks of the respective parties are confusingly similar; that ap-pellee is not entitled to register its mark; and that appellant\u2019s notice of opposition should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
