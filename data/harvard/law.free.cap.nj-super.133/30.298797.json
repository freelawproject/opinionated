Hyland, </em>Attorney General, attorney for respondent .Board of Review <em>(Mr. Michael S.

J. S. A. </em>43:21 \u2014 5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The decision below was not based upon a showing that claimant actually left work of her own volition, but rather that she was discharged because her actions at work were such as to demonstrate an intent to quit and which left her employer no choice but to discharge her \u2014 what is sometimes called a \u201cprovoked discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Claimant worked as a salesgirl in respondent\u2019s store. She disliked the \u201crock\u201d music which was amplified throughout the store. Preferring gospel music, she carried a transistor radio in her pocket and used an earplug so that she could hear the music of her preference. Her department manager asked her to remove the earplug. She refused and was suspended until a conference could be scheduled with union representatives present. Apparently she was also accused of proselytizing during store hours. The union representatives who met with petitioner were unable to convince her to remove the plug. She was later permanently terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">At the hearing below the hearing officer asked claimant whether she had in fact attempted to proselytize customers. She replied that \u201cwhen people would take God\u2019s name in vain, I\u2019d say, \u2018Please don\u2019t do that, praise His name.\u2019 \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>shop steward testified that she and \u201cother girls\u201d had received complaints of claimant\u2019s proselytizing from a number of customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The Appeal Tribunal concluded that the employer\u2019s requests were reasonable, that claimant\u2019s refusal to comply forced the employer to the position where it had no choice but to separate her, and that she was disqualified for benefits for having \u2018left work without good cause attributable to [her] work,\u201d in accordance with <em>N. J. S. A. 43</em>:21-5 (a). The Board of Review affirmed and claimant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We conclude that the decision below erroneously applied paragraph (a) of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5 rather than paragraph (b) to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">So far as pertinent the statute in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s discharge read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5. <em>Disqualification for benefits</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">An individual shall be disqualified for benefits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">(a) For the week in which <em>he has left worh voluntarily </em>without good cause attributable to such work, and for each week thereafter until he has earned in employment (which may be with an employing unit having in employment one or more individuals) at least 4 times his weekly benefit rate, as determined in each case; provided, however, that no disqualification shall be applicable to a woman who left or was sepax-ated from her work solely by reason of her pregnancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">(b) For the week in which he <em>has been finally discharged for misconduct connected with his worh, </em>and for the 5 weeks which immediately follow such week (in addition to the waiting period), as determined in each case. In the event such discharge should be rescinded by the employer voluntarily or as a result of mediation or arbitration this subsection (b) shall not apply, provided, however, an individual who is restored to employment with back pay shall return any benefits received under this chapter for any week of unemployment for which he is subsequently compensated by his employer. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The distinction between (a) and (b) is significant in determining the period of disqualification. If subsection (a) applies, claimant is disqualified until such time as she has earned at least four times her weekly benefit rate. In contrast, under subsection (b) she is disqualified for the week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>in which she has been discharged, and for the five weeks immediately following such week (in addition to the waiting period).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Thus the question hero is whether, under the finding of fact below, claimant (a) \u201cleft work voluntarily without good cause attributable to such work\u201d or (b) was \u201cfinally discharged for misconduct connected with [her] work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Clearly, claimant did not voluntarily quit. It was the employer who terminated the employment. And it did so because of claimant\u2019s adamant refusal to comply with its reasonable requirements concerning the use of the ear plug and proselytizing during working hours. This was \u201cmisconduct connected with [her] work.\u201d Therefore subsection (b) applies and her disqualification extends only to the period provided therein. Any other construction of the statute would label as a \u201cvoluntary quit\u201d every discharge following an employee's refusal to comply with the employer\u2019s reasonable direction. We cannot accept such a construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The decision of the Board of Review is reversed and the matter is remanded for award of benefits subject only to the disqualification provided in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
