S. C.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amr\">Temporarily Assigned. Plaintiff appeals from the denial of her application for a change of name under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:52-1 from her married to her maiden name. She has been married more than five years. Her husband has consented to her name change. She completed her senior year at law school a few months after the institution of this proceeding. In her complaint she cites as reasons for a resumption of her maiden name that she wishes an identity separate from her husband and regards a change of name as having important professional as well as social implications for her. The couple is childless but of child-bearing age.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The trial judge, in an opinion published in 128 <em>N. J. Super. </em>312 (Law Div. 1974), concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">This court has great concern for the stability of the family and the marriage relationship * * *. The situation which would be created by the granting of plaintiff\u2019s application, <em>vis., </em>plaintiff and her husband each continuing to use the surnames with which they were born, would cause great confusion in the community in which they live and could well have a traumatic effect upon any children they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>might have. This is especially true in the light of plaintiff\u2019s use of her husband\u2019s surname subsequent to her marriage. The problem would also arise of what surname to give the children of their marriage and the confusion and bureaucratic nightmares the process of selecting a surname would create.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:52-1 is remedial legislation establishing a method of judicial recordation of changes of name. It has been construed consistently in the light of and not in derogation of the common law, which it does not supersede. <em>State v. Librizzi, </em>14 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>904, 188 <em>A. </em>511 (Sup. Ct. 1936); <em>In re Joseph M., </em>91 <em>N. J. Super. </em>296 (Cty. Ct. 1966); <em>In re Witsenhausen, </em>42 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>183 (C. P. 1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Other states have similarly construed their change of name statutes. <em>Marshall v. State, </em>301 <em>So. </em>2d 477 (Fla. D. Ct. App. 1974); <em>Petition of Hauptly, Ind., </em>312 <em>N. E. </em>2d 857 (Sup. Ct. 1974), rev'g Ind. App., 294 <em>N. E. </em>2d 833 (D. Ct. App. <em>1973); In re Marriage of Banks, </em>42 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 631, 117 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>37 (D. Ct. App. 1974); <em>Application of Halligan, </em>46 A. D. 2d 170, 361 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 458 (App. Div. 1974), rev'g 76 <em>Misc. </em>2d 190, 350 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 63 (Sup. Ct. 1973); <em>Kay v. Kay, </em>65 <em>Ohio Law Abst. </em>472, 112 <em>N. E. </em>2d 562 (C. P. 1953); <em>Brayton v. Beall, </em>73 <em>S. C. </em>308, 53 <em>S. E. </em>641 (Sup. Ct. 1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">At common law any adult or emancipated person was at liberty to adopt any name as his legal name except for fraudulent or criminal purpose, without resort to any court. <em>McGarvey v. Atlantic City &amp; S. R. Co., </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>281 (E. &amp; A. 1939); <em>State v. Librizzi, supra; Sobel v. Sobel, </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>284 (Ch.

United States Cas. Co., </em>197 <em>N. Y. </em>420, 90 <em>N. E. </em>947 (Ct. App. 1910); <em>Halligan, supra; Application of Shipley, </em>26 <em>Misc. </em>2d 204, 205 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 581 (Sup. Ct. 1960); <em>Pierce v. Brushart, </em>153 <em>Ohio St. </em>372, 92 <em>N. E. </em>2d 4 (Sup. Ct. 1950); <em>Brayton v. Beall, supra. </em>A third exception to this common law right has been alluded <em>to, </em>that the name itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to be adopted is obscene or otherwise offensive. <em>In re Joseph M., supra, </em>91 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Authorities in various common law jurisdictions have reached apparently conflicting conclusions whether a woman on marriage assumes her husband's surname by custom or by law. The authorities are nevertheless reconcilable. A woman may retain her maiden name by antenuptial agreement or by holding herself out consistently by that name after marriage. She is not compelled by law to assume her husband's surname as her legal name. <em>Stuart, supra; State v. Green, </em>114 <em>Ohio App. </em>497, 177 <em>N. E. </em>2d 616 (Ct. App. 1961); <em>Rice v. State, </em>37 <em>Tex. Cr. R. </em>36, 38 <em>S. W. </em>801 (Ct. Crim. App. 1897); <em>Halligan, supra; </em>19 <em>Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, Husband &amp; Wife </em>(3rd Ed. 1957), \u00a7 1350 at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Otherwise, if the woman on marriage does not retain her maiden name, she legally adopts her husband's surname by repute, consistent with the common law right to adopt any name as her legal name without a court proceeding. Judicial opinions dealing with inadequacy of notice to a married woman in her maiden name are based generally on her assumption of her husband\u2019s surname as her legal name. <em>Chapman v. Phoenix National Bank, </em>85 <em>N. Y. </em>437 (Ct. App. 1881); <em>Claxton v. Simons, </em>177 <em>N. E. </em>2d 511 (Ohio Ct. App. 1961), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 174 <em>Ohio St. </em>333, 189 <em>N. E. </em>2d 62 (Sup. Ct. 1963); <em>Kidd v. Rasmus, </em>285 <em>S. W. </em>2d 415 (Tex. Ct. Civ. App. 1955); <em>cf. Bacon v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co., </em>256 <em>Mass. </em>30, 152 <em>N. E. </em>35 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In a number of other opinions married women who have assumed their husbands\u2019 surnames have been denied voting or motor vehicle registration or other governmental permit in their maiden names, in view of the overriding concern for accurate identification of registrants or permit holders. <em>Forbush v. Wallace, </em>341 <em>F. Supp. </em>217 (M. D. Ala. 1971), aff'd 405 <em>U. S. </em>970, 92 S. Ct. 1197, 31 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1972); <em>In re Kayaloff, </em>9 <em>F. Supp. </em>176 (S. D. N. Y; 1934); <em>People v. Lipsky, </em>327 <em>Ill. App. </em>63, 63 <em>N. E. </em>2d 642 (D. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>1945). A recent Connecticut opinion, however, recognizes the right of married women who never assumed their husband\u2019s surnames to register to vote in their maiden names. <em>Custer v. Bonadies, </em>30 <em>Conn. Super. </em>385, 318 <em>A. </em>2d 639 (Super. Ct. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The circumstance that an overwhelming majority of married women by custom and tradition assume their husband\u2019s surname on marriage accounts for the various statutes in this State dealing with the wife\u2019s marital name as her legal name. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-2; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:52-4; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>19:31 \u2014 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\"><em>Succession of Kneipp, </em>172 <em>La. </em>411, 134 <em>So. </em>376 (Sup. Ct. 1931), decided under civil law, stands by itself in the United States in holding that a woman during marriage retains her maiden name as her legal name and uses her husband\u2019s surname only by custom. That decision was questioned in <em>Wilty v. Jefferson Parish Democratic Executive Com., </em>245 <em>La. </em>145, 157 <em>So. </em>2d 718 (Sup. Ct. 1963), and is without common law precedent in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The right of a married woman having adopted her husband\u2019s surname to resume her maiden name, absent fraudulent or criminal purpose, has been recognized in change-of-name proceedings in other jurisdictions, without exception in the reported opinions. <em>Marshall v. State, supra; Hauptly, supra; Halligan, supra; Kruzel v. Podell, Wis., </em>226 <em>N. W. </em>2d 458 (Sup. Ct. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Plaintiff adopted her husband\u2019s surname Lawrence during the approximate five years between the marriage and her application for a change of name. Thus, the issue on appeal is whether the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing her leave to resume her maiden name Daniels. <em>Halligan, supra, </em>and <em>Haupily, supra, </em>concluded an abuse of judicial discretion in denying a married woman leave to resume her maiden name, without objection from her husband, once a determination of no fraudulent or criminal intent was reached. <em>Halligan </em>noted that confusion was no impediment, rather a normal concomitant of a name change. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>to Hauptly, speculation that resumption of plaintiffs maiden name might cause embarrassment to her minor child was no basis for denying her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The trial judge\u2019s concern here for possible harmful effect on children to be born is in conflict with the established constitutional right of parents to raise children as they choose, except for the bounds of the criminal law. <em>Pierce v. Society of </em>Sisters, 268 <em>U. S. </em>510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1924); <em>In re </em>Goldfarb, 6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>543 (Ch. Div. 1949). If the courts intervene a myriad of detriments and embarrassments to minor children may be conjectured.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We conclude that, in circumstances such as here where the husband consents to his wife\u2019s resumption of her maiden name, the denial of plaintiffs application was without warrant under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:52-1 or common law and thus an abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion. Hence we need not resolve the constitutional arguments pressed by plaintiff: denial of freedom of speech, the expression of her separate identity; denial of the right of privacy to manifest that separate identity; denial of equal protection of the laws to married women, a sex classification, when all others can change their legal names, absent fraudulent or criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry' of judgment in accordance herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
