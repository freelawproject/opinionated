A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A19\">This is one of the three appeals presently before this court arising out of convictions of defendant on separate counts of Monmouth County Indictment No. 557-70. That indictment contained six counts. By agreement of the State, the counts were severed for trial or other disposition into three parts, each part referring to a seperate date and containing two counts wherein defendant was respectively charged with possession and sale of heroin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">This appeal relates to defendant\u2019s convictions after jury trial on the first and second counts of the indictment, respectively charging possession and sale of heroin on January 7, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">The essence of defendant\u2019s contention on this appeal is that prejudicial error resulted when defense counsel was limited in his cross-examination of the State\u2019s principal witness, Anthony Martinez, an undercover narcotics investigator for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>State Police. Martinez testified on direct that he had purchased the heroin from defendant on January 7, 1971. On cross-examination defense counsel brought out the fact that Martinez, at the time of his testimony, was under suspension from the State Police. The trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to any further inquiry into this matter, in spite of defense counsel\u2019s proffer that Martinez had in fact pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with misconduct in office, specifically, in the words of counsel to a charge that \u201che had agreed to obtain certain controlled dangerous substances for an Ida Merrino (phonetical) and that he became privy to the knowledge of the transactions involving a Michael Zervos, which knowledge he had not transmitted to his immediate superiors.\u201d Defense counsel argues that such cross-examination was proper, first, as evidencing a conviction of crime pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:81\u201412, and, second, as showing possible interest of the witness resting in the hope of favorable treatment in his sentencing in return for his testimony on behalf of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">'The State argues that since Martinez had not yet been sentenced pursuant to his guilty plea, there was no \u201cconviction\u201d which would be admissible to affect his credibility under the statute. As to defendant\u2019s contention that the cross-examination was proper to show Martinez\u2019 \u201cinterest\u201d and hope of favorable treatment, it is the State\u2019s contention that, since Martinez had been involved in many other similar transactions as an undercover man, and his report on this incident had been prepared long before he was indicted, there was \u201cno chance that his trial testimony was a fabrication invented to mollify the prosecutor.\u201d It is contended that in the absence of a showing that Martinez\u2019 testimony had deviated from his prior reports, there was no prejudice by reason of the restriction of cross-examination. Eurther the State argues, citing <em>Evid. R. </em>4, that the exclusion of the cross-examination was a' permissible exercise of discretion by the trial judge, particularly in view of the fact that the witness\u2019 criminal in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>volvement did not relate to the cause in which he was testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:81-12 provides that, for the purpose of affecting the credibility of a witness his \u201cconviction\u201d of crime or his \u201cinterest\u201d may be shown. The first question here is whether a plea of guilty <em>without sentence </em>constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d within the meaning of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">There is a split of authority as to whether a verdict of guilty without judgment of sentence may be shown to affect credibility. See Annotation, \u201cPermissibility of impeaching credibility of witness by showing verdict of guilty without judgment of sentence thereon,\u201d 14 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 1272 (1967). In our own State it was held in <em>State v. Henson, </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>601 (E. &amp; A. 1901), by a closely divided court, that a plea of guilty or of <em>nolo contendere </em>could be shown for the purpose of affecting credibility of a witness. There the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Lockwood, </em>109 <em>Mass. </em>323, Mr. Justice Gray correctly states the distinction between the terms \u201cconviction\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d in this language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201c \u2018The ordinarly legal meaning of conviction,\u2019 when used to designate a particular stage of a prosecution triable by a jury, <em>is the confession of the accused in open court, </em>or the verdict returned against him by the jury, which ascertains and publishes the fact of his guilt; while \u2018judgment\u2019 or \u2018sentence\u2019 is the appropriate word to denote the action of the court * * * declaring the consequences to the convict of the fact thus ascertained.\u201d [at 607; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The reasoning <em>Henson </em>was approved and followed in <em>Hill v. Maxwell, </em>77 <em>N. J. L. </em>766 (E. &amp; A. 1909), and <em>State v. Runyon, </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>16 (Sup. Ct. 1919); see <em>State v. Duelks, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>43, 48 (Sup. Ct. 1922); <em>cf. State v. McCall, </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>157, 171 (App. Div. 1953), rav\u2019d on other grounds 14 <em>N. J. </em>538 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">On an issue of credibility of a witness we believe the logic of the situation compels the conclusion that a plea of guilty is as relevant as a judgment after sentence. The witness\u2019 credibility is equally affected by both and the sentence adds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>no more taint to that factor than is implicit in a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">And, under <em>State v. </em>Hawthorne, 49 <em>N. J. </em>130 (1967), trial judges have no discretion under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:81-12 to disallow impeachment by use of previous convictions. \u201cOn the contrary, the parties are invested with the option and if it is exercised the examination must be allowed or the record of conviction received when offered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Furthermore, even in the absence of a conviction, evidence of Martinez\u2019 \u201cinterest in the result of the action, proceeding or matter\u201d is clearly admissible under the same statute. We think the rule is the same even where, as here, the potential interest or bias of the witness in favor of the State pertains to his criminal involvement in an unrelated cause. <em>See Alford v. United </em>States, 282 <em>U. S. </em>687, 693, 51 S. Ct. 218, 75 L. Ed. 624 (1931); <em>State v. </em>Curcio, 23 <em>N. J. </em>521, 526-527 (1957); <em>State v. </em>Zwillman, 112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>6, 18-19 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N. J. </em>603 (1971); Annotation, \u201cPreventing or limiting cross-examination of prosecutor\u2019s witness as to his motive for testifying,\u201d 62 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 610 (1958) \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5. The difference between the interest of a prosecution witness who is an accomplice and the interest of one who faces trial or sentencing on unrelated criminal charges is solely one of degree. <em>Cf. State v. Mangrella, </em>86 <em>N. J. Super. </em>404, 408 (App. Div. 1965). The distinction may affect the weight to be given the impeaching evidence, but not its admissibility. It was for the jury to consider Martinez\u2019 upcoming sentencing, and to evaluate any hopes of leniency, or any fears of stringent treatment, he may have had as a consequence of his testimony. The trial judge committed prejudicial error in limiting the cross-examination of this key prosecution witness. Since reversal follows we do not reach defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The convictions on the first and second counts are reversed and a new trial is ordered thereon.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-12\">The other appeals pending in this court are A-2195-72, 133 <em>N. J. Super. </em>394, stemming from convictions after trial on counts three and four of the indictment, and A-520-72 stemming from a conviction entered on count six pursuant to a plea bargain involving counts five and six. Opinions therein are being filed today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
