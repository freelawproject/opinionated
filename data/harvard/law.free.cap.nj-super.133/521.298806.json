J. S. A. </em>24:21-20 (a) (1) and (3). The tidal judge merged both counts and sentenced defendant to a 90-day county jail term, 70 days of which were suspended. Defendant was also placed on probation for a period of two years following his release from the county jail. On appeal defendant contends that (1) the court committed plain error when it failed to charge on \u201cfleeting and shadowy\u201d possession of the LSD, and (2) it was error to admit certain marijuana plants in evidence. Both contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Defendant and his 15-year-old brother testified regarding a quantity of LSD found in a locked metal box owned by defendant and kept in a storage room closet near his bedroom. Both defendant and his brother had access to the box. Defendant testified that they stored their \u201cstash\u201d in the box, including \u201cgrass,\u201d \u201chash\u201d and pipes. Defendant admitted that he owned some of the marijuana in the box, but he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>his brother both testified that the LSD belonged to the younger brother alone and that defendant had discovered its presence in the box only a few hours before it was seized by the police. Defendant testified that he told his brother to get rid of the LSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"> Defendant now contends that the trial judge committed error in failing to charge that defendant should be found not guilty if the jury found that his possession of the LSD was only \u201cshadowy and fleeting,\u201d a phrase found in <em>State v. Brown, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>450, 455 (App. Div. 1961). No such instruction was requested, and we would not <em>regard </em>its omission as plain error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. A charge phrased simply in terms of \u201cshadowy and fleeting possession\u201d is of doubtful utility and should not be employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"> The essential elements of actual possession are (1) knowledge of the existence and character of an object which is in one\u2019s hand or on one\u2019s person, and (2) intention to use or to exercise dominion and control over the object, to the temporary or permanent exclusion of others, either alone, or, in the case of joint possession, as here, in conjunction with others. See <em>State v. Humphreys, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>406, 417 (1969); <em>State v. Labato, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>137, 148-149 (1951). While the duration of the actual possession is unimportant if these elements are present (see <em>State v. Thomas, </em>105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>331 (App. Div. 1969), aff\u2019d o.b., 57 <em>N. J. </em>143 (1970)), the period of time in which a person holds an object may be relevant to the issue of his intention to exercise dominion and control over it. A person who holds an object belonging to another just long enough to discover its character and promptly divests himself of further control over it would not be guilty of possession, as that term is employed in the criminal law. A charge in these or appropriately similar terms would be proper in a case of \u201cfleeting\u201d possession of an object which is promptly rejected by a defendant. In any event, we cannot conclude that the charge given here should be regarded as erroneous on the facts in this case, much less as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number> We also find no error in the admission of six live marijuana plants found growing on the window sill of the storage room. The plants were relevant to the issue of defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent. <em>Evid. R. 55. </em>That defendant admitted possession of the marijuana in the \u201cstash\u201d box did not preclude admission of the plants in the circumstances of this case and obviates any claim of prejudice resulting from the introduction of the plants. The identification of the plants as marijuana by a police officer who was sufficiently qualified, although a layman, and by defendant\u2019s brother was sufficient basis for their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
