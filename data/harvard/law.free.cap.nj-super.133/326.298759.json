J. S. A. </em>2A:98-1) and maintaining premises used for gambling <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:112-3; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:121-3(c)). Both Travis and Nasisi were also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>vieted of working for a lottery <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:121-3(a)), and Travis was further convicted of possession of lottery slips (N. <em>J. S. A. </em>2A:121-3(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Defendant Travis was sentenced to three concurrent six-month terms in the Essex County Correction Center, a suspended two to three-year term at the State Correctional Institution for Women, and a $1,000 fine. Defendant Nasisi was sentenced to three concurrent terms of two to two and a half years in State Prison and a $1,000 fine. Defendant Juliano received two concurrent terms of two to two and a half years at State Prison and a $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The three defendants filed separate appeals which, on motion by the State, were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">A pretrial motion to suppress on the grounds the wiretap used in the case was illegal was denied by the trial judge in a written, reported decision, <em>State v. Travis, </em>125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 (Cty. Ct. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">All defendants contend the trial judge erred in his denial of the motion to suppress the wiretap evidence on the ground that there had not been a lawful application for the court-authorized tap. The authorization of the wiretap in question was signed by Leonard D. Eonco, an assistant prosecutor in the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, when the prosecutor was away on vacation during the month of August 1972 and had designated Eonco as the acting prosecutor. The order was signed by a Superior Court judge empowered to sign such orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">We are of the view the pretrial motions to suppress were properly denied, essentially for the reasons expressed by the trial judge in <em>State v. Travis, supra. </em>Subsequent to his decision on the motions, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Giordano, </em>416 <em>U. S. </em>505, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>1820, 40 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 341 (1974). In <em>Giordano </em>a wiretap application made before a federal judge stated that the specific Assistant Attorney General in charge of wiretap authorizations, and so specially designated by the Attorney General pursuant to 18 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 2516(1), had approved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>application. In actuality, the Attorney General\u2019s executive assistant had placed the Attorney General\u2019s initials on a memo instructing authorization of the application by the named \u25a0 Assistant Attorney General, who himself had not personally reviewed the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The Supreme Court found that the statute (after which the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:156A-1, is patterned) conferred upon the \u201cAttorney General, or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General\u201d the power to authorize an application for a wiretap order to a federal judge, but did not authorize wiretap applications to be made by any individuals other than the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General specifically designated by him; that Congress intended to narrowly limit the power for a few who were responsive to the political process, a category to which the executive assistant to the Attorney General obviously did not belong. 416 <em>U. S. </em>at 520, 94 S. Ct. at 1829, 40 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">However, although the court stated that \u201cit is apparent that Congress desired to centralize and limit this authority where it was feasible to do so,\u201d Id., 416 <em>U. S. </em>at 521, 94 S. Ct. at 1830, 40 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 357; it further noted that 18 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 2516(2) provided for a'wider dispersal of authority among state officers to approve wiretap applications and left the matter of delegation up to state' law. In a footnote the court referred to the comments in <em>S. Rep. </em>No. 1097 that the delegation of authority in the states could proceed down to the district attorney (county prosecutor) level, but \u201c[t]he proposed provision does not envision a further\u2019 breakdown. Although city attorneys may have in 1 some places limited criminal prosecuting jurisdiction,\u2019 the proposed provision is not intended to\u2019 include them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\"> Here,\u2019 the prosecutor was unavailable since he was out of the county for the entire'month of August.\u2019 An acting prosecutor was appointed by him to exercise all of the duties of the office of prosecutor during -the prosecutor\u2019s absence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>We agree with the trial judge\u2019s determination that the prosecutor had the inherent power to designate an acting prosecutor to assume the duties of his office during such absence, and as acting prosecutor Eonco properly initiated this wiretap application within the scope of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Under the circumstances of this case his exercise of the power was within the comprehension of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 156A-8 of the New Jersey Wiretapping Act which empowers a person designated to act for a county prosecutor and to perform his duties in and during his actual absence or disability to authorize a wiretap application. There is no merit to defendants\u2019 contentions that the statute does not contemplate delegation to a subordinate during a prosecutor\u2019s vacation. <em>Cf. State v. Cocuzza, </em>123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>14, 22 (Cty. Ct. 1973), and see <em>State v. Travis, supra, </em>125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 6, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">During the course of his opening to the jury the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">Again, you might ask, well, what led to this information that was the basis of this search warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">Well, on or about August 1, 1972, information was received by certain law enforcement officers relative to the criminal activities of some of these defendants * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Motions for a mistrial were denied. Immediately thereafter the remarks were ordered stricken by the trial judge and the jury instructed to disregard the comment. All defendants urge prejudicial error. However, we are satisfied that in the context of this case and in light of the curative instruction, the remarks complained of were not sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the jury was led thereby to a result it otherwise might not have reached. <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>325, 335-336 (1971). <em>Cf. State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>263 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Defendant Nasisi\u2019s contention that the competency of the wiretap evidence was not demonstrated because the evidence of the installation of the wiretap was insufficient is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>meritless. He argues that since the exact location of the terminal box, appearances, access points, tap station and site of the interception were not revealed, there was no showing the taps were in fact on defendant\u2019s line and hence there was an insufficient foundation laid for the admission of the taped conversations. The trial judge ruled this information was privileged under regulations of the Public Utilities Commission and to reveal the monitoring location would endanger future surveillances. Be that as it may, we are of the view defendant did not make a satisfactory showing of why this information was needed to show a possible inaccurate hookup. <em>Evict. R. </em>34.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">We find no merit in defendant Nasisi\u2019s further contention the trial judge erred in permitting two of perhaps 80 or 90 taped calls to be played during the prosecutor\u2019s summation since this is no different from any attorney utilizing demonstrable evidence before the jury in the course of summation. <em>People v. Coontz, </em>119 Cal. App. 2d 276, 259 <em>P. </em>2d 694 (Cal. D. Ct. App. 1953). Similarly, there is no substance to the argument that the expert\u2019s opinion, embracing as it did the hypothetical question posed, was improper, or that incorporated therein were many assumptions of fact not within the testimony. See <em>State v. Boiardo, 111 N. J. Super. </em>219, 237-238 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N. J. </em>130 (1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 401 <em>U. S. </em>948, 91 S. Ct. 931, 28 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Defendant Juliano asserts there was insufficient evidence to connect him with the conspiracy and to justify his conviction for maintaining a place for gambling. Our review of the record satisfies us there was sufficient credible evidence to sustain defendant Juliano\u2019s conviction. While circumstantial, it was nevertheless persuasive and such that the jury could properly find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant Juliano was guilty of the crimes charged. <em>State v. Moffa, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>258, 263 (1964); <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>454, 458-459 (1971); <em>State v. Seaman, </em>114 <em>N. J. Super. </em>19, 29-30 (App. Div. 1971); <em>R. </em>3:18-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number> Lastly, defendants Travis and ISTasisi contend their sentences are manifestly excessive, basically because they are custodial and they are first offenders with no previous records. Additionally, Nasisi asserts his poor health and left arm amputation mandate a suspended sentence and probation. Travis claims her participation was at the lowest level and of a minimal nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Eeview of the record together with the presentence reports reveals no abuse of discretion in the sentences imposed. <em>State v. Tyson, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>411 (1964), <em>cert. </em>den. 380 <em>U. S. </em>987, 85 S. Ct. 1359, 14 L. Ed. 2d 279 (1965); <em>State v. Souss, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>453 (1974); <em>State v. Leverette, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>569, 571 (1974); <em>State v. De Stasio, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>247 (1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 389 <em>U. S. </em>830, 88 S. Ct. 96, 19 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1967); <em>State v. Ivan, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>197 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
