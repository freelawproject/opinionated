The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the evidence, based upon the failure of the Commonwealth to present evidence corroborating his confession. For the reasons that follow, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">N.J., age thirteen, left her mother\u2019s home around midnight on October 31, 2000. Her mother subsequently filed a \u201crunaway report\u201d with the Newport News Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">On November 1, 2000, police officers were dispatched to appellant\u2019s residence, at 163-B Delmar Lane in Newport News, in reference to \u201ca runaway that would be at that location.\u201d The residence was owned by appellant\u2019s grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Upon arrival, the officers explained to appellant and his grandmother that the police had received information N.J. was at the residence. Appellant told the officers he had not seen N.J., and his grandmother responded there was no one in her home \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d Appellant\u2019s grandmother gave the officers permission to search the home. However, appellant objected, stating that \u201c[h]e had not seen [N.J.] and nobody was there.\u201d The officers responded that the police had \u201cgood information\u201d that N.J. was there and that she was \u201ca minor.\u201d Appellant reiterated that N.J. was not at the home and stated once again that he had not seen her. Nevertheless, based upon the consent of appellant\u2019s grandmother, the officers searched the residence. They located N.J. in the closet of appellant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Later that day, Detective T.D. Steverson of the Newport News Police Department advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant waived his rights and gave Steverson a statement. In his statement, appellant admitted he was twenty years old and said he had known N.J. for about one month. He stated that on October 31, he was picked up by an individual and that N.J. was already in the car. Appellant told Steverson they went to a movie \u2014 \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d\u2014 in Hampton and that he and N.J. \u201cengaged in kissing while watching the movie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Appellant told Steverson that after the movie the driver picked them up and drove N.J. home, before dropping him off at a store. A short time later, the driver picked appellant up once again, and the two returned to N.J.\u2019s home to pick her up. Appellant told Steverson that the driver then took him and N.J to a Motel 6 in Newport News, where he and N.J. spent the night together. Appellant stated that during their stay in the motel room, he and N.J. engaged in both oral sex and intercourse. Appellant claimed he thought N.J was seventeen years old. Appellant was ultimately charged with two counts of carnal knowledge of a minor, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">At trial, N.J. confirmed nearly every point of appellant\u2019s confession, including the fact that she and appellant had slept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>in the same bed at the Motel 6. However, when the prosecutor asked N.J. if \u201csomething happened between the two of [them] while [they] were in the same bed,\u201d N.J. responded that she \u201cdid not want to talk about it.\u201d When reminded by the prosecutor that she was under oath, N.J. testified that they just \u201ctalked and watched [television].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Upon further questioning, N.J. testified that the defendant \u201cnever asked [her] to have sex with him.\u201d Instead, she testified that she asked to have sex with him, but stated that he refused because \u201csometimes [her] best friend was around and his cousins and friends were around.\u201d When N.J. was reminded that there was no one else in the motel room, N.J. insisted that \u201cnothing happened\u201d and that appellant had tried to convince her to return to her mother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant moved the trial court to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the ground that the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cevidence cannot rise any higher than their witness.\u201d The Commonwealth responded that \u201ca confession requires only a slight corroboration,\u201d and argued it had met this burden. The trial court then denied the motion to strike, finding the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was \u201csufficient,\u201d based upon N.J.\u2019s corroboration of the events that had taken place, as well as her demeanor on the witness stand. At that point, the appellant rested without presenting evidence and renewed his motion to strike, arguing that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt because \u201c[the] evidence [could not] rise higher than their own witness who [said] nothing happened.\u201d The trial court again denied the motion to strike and convicted appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">II. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">On appeal, appellant argues the Commonwealth failed to prove the <em>corpus delicti </em>by its failure to corroborate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>his confession. We disagree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">It is well settled that in order to obtain a conviction, in every criminal prosecution, the Commonwealth must prove the element of <em>corpus delicti </em>\u2014 that is, the fact that the crime charged has been actually perpetrated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, \u201c[a] conviction cannot be based solely on the uncorroborated statement of a person that a crime has occurred and that he committed it. The <em>corpus delicti </em>cannot be established by a confession of the accused uncorroborated by any other evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201c \u2018[w]here \u201cthe commission of the crime has been fully confessed by the accused, only slight corroborative evidence is necessary to establish the <em>corpus delicti.\u201d \u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe corroborative evidence is sufficient if, when taken with the evidence of the confession, it proves the commission of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>N.J.\u2019s testimony corroborated Morning\u2019s confession on nearly every point, with the exception of the sexual activity. When asked about the sexual activity, N.J. became visibly upset and refused at first to answer the question. When pressed, she ultimately gave an explanation that the trial judge as fact finder disbelieved as to why the two had not engaged in the alleged sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We have long held that where a trial court sitting without a jury hears witnesses testify and observes their demeanor on the stand, it has the right to believe or disbelieve their statements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the finding of the judge on the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their evidence, unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, cannot be disturbed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, although N.J. denied the sexual activity, her testimony corroborated the remaining details of appellant\u2019s confession. This fact, taken with the evidence of appellant\u2019s confession, was sufficient evidence upon which the trier of fact could reasonably find that N.J. lied about the sexual activity and, therefore, could reasonably find that the crime occurred beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, here, the \u201cslight corroborative evidence\u201d was sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u201cwhen taken with the evidence of the confession.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In addition to the above, other evidence demonstrated that Morning attempted to conceal his relationship with N.J. by lying to the police about his knowledge of N.J.\u2019s whereabouts. We have held that \u201c[i]n all cases of circumstantial evidence the conduct of the accused is always an important factor in the estimate of the weight of circumstances which point to his guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s words and deeds following the incident were factors equally as important as his earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>conduct in establishing the commission of a crime in this case. The testimony of Officer Smith established that appellant deliberately lied to the police in order to conceal what had happened. Significantly, he persisted in that falsehood until the police found N. J. hiding in his bedroom closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The inferences to be drawn from proven facts are within the province of the trier of fact so long as the inferences are reasonable and justified.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> From this evidence, the trial judge could have reasonably concluded that appellant\u2019s conduct was not that of a man innocently involved with a teenager who had run away from home. Thus, we find the evidence sufficient as a matter of law to substantiate the truth of Morning\u2019s confession. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">.

The Commonwealth argues that Morning\u2019s appeal on this issue is barred pursuant to Rule 5A:18. It contends that because Morning argued only that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence could not rise \"any higher than their witness,\u201d any argument concerning corroboration was waived for purposes of appeal. We disagree. \" 'The goal of the contemporaneous objection rule is to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials by allowing the trial judge to intelligently consider an issue and, if necessary, to take corrective action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zook v.

Here, the Commonwealth raised the corroboration issue in its response to Morning\u2019s motion to strike, and the trial court considered the issue in making its ruling. Thus, we find that the issue was properly preserved and consider it on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">. <em>See Maughs v.
