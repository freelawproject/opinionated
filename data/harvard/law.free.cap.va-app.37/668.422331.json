With appellant\u2019s consent, the Commonwealth terminated that prosecution by <em>nolle prosequi. </em>The Commonwealth subsequently obtained a new warrant charging appellant with DUI based on the same act of driving, and appellant again was convicted in the district court. On <em>de novo </em>appeal to the circuit court, appellant again was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">On appeal to this Court, appellant contends the circuit court (trial court) erred in denying his motion to dismiss the DUI charge on double jeopardy grounds. He argues that the circuit court conviction was invalid because the district court lacked jurisdiction to re-try him following the dismissal of the prior charges by <em>nolle prosequi </em>and that the only way in which the circuit court could have obtained jurisdiction the second time would have been by direct indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We hold that when appellant appealed the original district court conviction, that conviction ceased to exist. Because the charge was disposed of by <em>nolle prosequi </em>in the circuit court before the court heard evidence, jeopardy did not attach in that court and the underlying charge also ceased to exist. Thus, for purposes of double jeopardy, the first round of proceedings never occurred, and the second warrant provided the district court with the jurisdiction necessary for the conviction upon which the circuit court conviction was based. Thus, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">In the early morning hours of June 20, 1999, appellant was arrested on a warrant for driving under the influence on June 19, 1999. On November 19, 1999, appellant was tried in the district court and convicted for that offense. He noted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>appeal to the circuit court, and a trial <em>de novo </em>was scheduled for January 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">On January 24, 2000, the Commonwealth moved the circuit court to dispose of the DUI charge by <em>nolle prosequi. </em>With appellant\u2019s consent, the circuit court granted the motion. Appellant was represented by counsel in both the district and circuit court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On February 2, 2000, the Commonwealth obtained a new DUI warrant against appellant for the same act of driving. On May 19, 2000, appellant appeared <em>pro se </em>in district court and again was convicted for DUI. The record on appeal contains no transcript or statement of facts from that proceeding. Appellant again noted an appeal from that .conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">On November 28, 2000, appellant appeared with counsel for trial in circuit court and moved to dismiss. Counsel argued that the second district court DUI conviction violated double jeopardy principles and that the only proper way for the Commonwealth to have proceeded would have been to institute the second set of charges by direct indictment. Counsel acknowledged \u201cthere is a way to [reinstitute the charge],\u201d but he argued that \u201cthis is not the way to have done it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The trial court denied the motion, explaining that \u201cwhen the case was appealed to the circuit court [the first time], it was a trial de novo that wiped out the conviction, essentially wiped out the case in lower court ... like it never happened in [district court].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The court received evidence and found appellant guilty of the DUI offense. Appellant then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Under double jeopardy prohibitions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">no person \u201cshall ... for the same offense ... be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d This ... provision [of the United States and Virginia Constitutions] guarantees pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tection against (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 216, 227, 509 S.E.2d 293, 300 (1999) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. V); <em>see Bennefield v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 729, 739, 467 S.E.2d 306, 311 (1996) (noting that double jeopardy provisions of state and federal constitutions are coextensive). Here, we consider the first and second protections in the context of Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme, which permits <em>de novo </em>appeals from district court misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In Virginia, when misdemeanor charges are initiated by warrant and a defendant is convicted of those charges in district court, he may appeal to the circuit court for a trial <em>de novo. See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-136; <em>Ledbetter v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 805, 810-11, 447 S.E.2d 250, 253-54 (1994). A <em>de novo </em>hearing means a trial anew, and perfection of an appeal to the circuit court for trial <em>de novo </em>\u201cannuls the former [district court] judgment <em>as completely as if no trial had ever occurred.\u201d Ledbetter, </em>18 Va.App. at 810-11, 447 S.E.2d at 253-54 (emphasis added); <em>see Malouf v. City of Roanoke, </em>177 Va. 846, 855-56, 13 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1941) (holding that in a <em>de novo </em>appeal, \u201c \u2018the judgment appealed from is completely annulled, and <em>is not thereafter available for any purpose </em>\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bullard v. McCardle, </em>98 Cal. 355, 33 P. 193, 194 (Cal.1893)) (emphasis added)). <em>But see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-133 (providing that where misdemeanant withdraws appeal before it is heard in circuit court, conviction and sentence of district court are affirmed, either by operation of law if appeal is withdrawn within ten days after conviction or by order of circuit court if appeal is withdrawn more than ten days after conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Thus, trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, <em>see Ledbetter, </em>18 Va.App. at 810-11, 447 S.E.2d at 253-54, subject only to the limitation that conviction in district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>greater offense, permitting trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense, <em>see, e.g., Buck v. City of Danville, </em>213 Va. 387, 388-89, 192 S.E.2d 758, 759-60 (1972). Even after an appeal to the circuit court is perfected, annulling the conviction in the district court, jeopardy does not attach in a bench trial in circuit court until the court begins to hear evidence. <em>See, e.g., Courtney v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 561, 567, 478 S.E.2d 336, 338 (1996); <em>see also Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 269, 280, 373 S.E.2d 328, 333 (1988) (holding that where <em>nolle prosequi </em>motion is granted <em>after </em>jeopardy has attached and accused does not consent to same, Commonwealth must show \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d to avoid double jeopardy bar to further prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Here, although appellant was convicted for DUI in the district court, he noted an appeal of that conviction to the circuit court for trial <em>de novo, </em>thereby \u201cannul[ling] the former [district court] judgment as completely as if no trial had ever occurred.\u201d <em>Ledbetter, </em>18 Va.App. at 810-11, 447 S.E.2d at 253-54. Thus, appellant\u2019s district court conviction ceased to exist at that time, and jeopardy never attached in the circuit court because that court never heard evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Because the district court conviction was annulled and because the DUI charge was disposed of by <em>nolle prosequi </em>in the circuit court before jeopardy had attached, the trial in the district court on May 19, 2000 did not violate double jeopardy principles and was sufficient to provide the district court with jurisdiction to try appellant. At common law, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was \u201c \u2018a formal entry on the record by the prosecuting officer by which he declare[d] that he [would] not prosecute the case further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1070 (7th ed.1999) (quoting 22A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 419, at 1 (1989)). Under Virginia law, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>\u201cshall be entered only in the discretion of the court, upon motion of the Commonwealth with good cause therefor shown.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-265.3. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>is \u201ca discontinuance which discharges the accused from liability on the [charging document] to which the <em>nolle prosequi </em>is entered. For the prosecution to proceed thereaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ter for the same offense, a new [charging document] is required.\u201d <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 929, 935, 234 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1977) (applying principle in context of felony indictments).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">When the offense is a felony and \u201cthe trial court enters a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of [the felony] indictment, it lays \u2018to rest that indictment and the underlying warrant without disposition, <em>as though they had never </em>existed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burfoot v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 38, 44, 473 S.E.2d 724, 727 (1996) (quoting <em>Arnold v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 218, 222, 443 S.E.2d 183, 185 (applying principles in speedy trial context), <em>affd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>19 Va.App. 143, 450 S.E.2d 161 (1994)) (emphasis added). \u201cAfter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of an indictment, the slate is wiped clean, and the situation is the same as if \u2018the Commonwealth [had] chosen to make no charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Arnold, </em>18 Va.App. at 222, 443 S.E.2d at 185); <em>see Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 473, 474-75, 499 S.E.2d 589, 590 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (applying principles to hold that termination of original charges by <em>nolle prosequi </em>nullified Commonwealth\u2019s acceptance of plea agreement relating to original charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We hold likewise that when the offense is a misdemeanor and the charging document is a warrant, \u201ca <em>nolle prosequi ... </em>wipe[s] [the slate] clean, and the situation is the same as if \u2018the Commonwealth [had] chosen to make no charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 44, 473 S.E.2d at 727 (quoting <em>Arnold, </em>18 Va.App. at 222, 443 S.E.2d at 185). Thus, both because appellant noted an appeal of the original district court conviction and because the circuit court, with appellant\u2019s consent, granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dispose of that charge by <em>nolle prosequi </em>before jeopardy had attached in the circuit court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the original charge and district court conviction ceased to exist. As a result, appellant\u2019s second trial in the district court for misdemeanor DUI did not violate double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>jeopardy principles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the district court thus had jurisdiction to try appellant on the second warrant, the district court conviction was sufficient to provide the circuit court with jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s <em>de novo </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-15\">. Appellant also was convicted for possession of marijuana. Although he initially contested the marijuana possession conviction on appeal, his brief indicates that he \"voluntarily withdraws his challenge to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>marijuana conviction\u201d and contests \"only ... the DUI conviction in this appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. Appellant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s authority to grant the <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-12\">. Appellant also contends that the second round of proceedings violated due process. However, appellant does not challenge the adequacy of notice or the hearing he received, and his arguments amount to little more than a restatement of his double jeopardy claim. Therefore, we do not consider them separately. We also reject appellant\u2019s claim that allowing the Commonwealth \"to refile a misdemeanor charge in the general district court after a nolle prosequi in the circuit court ... would allow the Commonwealth to engage in impermissible forum shopping.\u201d As in the case of any <em>nolle prosequi </em>motion, the court must find good cause in order to grant such a motion, and the legislature apparently has concluded that such a requirement is sufficient to prevent abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
