Additionally, employer appeals the penalty assessed by the commission on such suspended compensation. Finding no error, we affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">The substantive facts and procedural history are uncontroverted. On August 13, 1993 claimant sustained a work-related injury, which entitled her to benefits pursuant to both the LHWCA and the Act. Initially, she pursued and received a LHWCA disability award but, \u201cto protect her right to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>benefits ... under the ... Act,\u201d also lodged a related claim with the commission, then advising the commission, \u201c[n]o hearing is requested at this time.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">After claimant had received LHWCA benefits totaling $68,942.78, employer terminated payments on August 30,1998. Thereafter, by letter to the commission dated September 21, claimant \u201crequested] that this matter be moved to the hearing docket on an expedited basis to request ... benefits [under the Act] beginning August 31, 1998, and continuing.\u201d The parties subsequently agreed to a schedule of compensation to claimant for various periods of disability, including a lump sum of $21,831.22 for \u201ca 50% permanent partial disability to the left leg\u201d and \u201c[temporary partial disability ... of $104.87 per week from 1/19/99 to the present and continuing,\u201d and the commission so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">On May 8, 2000, claimant notified the commission that employer had unilaterally ceased payment of the $104.87 weekly benefit on July 4, 1999, and, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-254, sought assessment of a twenty percent penalty on \u201call payments in arrears more than two weeks.\u201d The commission immediately granted claimant\u2019s motion. However, within several days, employer objected, advising the commission that, after realizing \u201cthat payments had also been made under the [LHWCA],\u201d employer was \u201cnow taking a dollar for dollar credit\u201d against the award. The dispute was promptly designated \u201cfor determination on the record,\u201d and each party was directed to submit written \u201cstatements of position\u201d and related documentary proofs for further consideration by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Guided by <em>Moore v. Va. Int\u2019l Terminals, Inc., </em>254 Va. 46, 486 S.E.2d 528 (1997) <em>(Moore II), </em>and an unpublished opinion of this Court, <em>Dodson v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>Record No. 0278-99-1, 1999 WL 1133301 (Va.Ct.App., Aug. 10, 1999), the deputy commissioner decided that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>while employer was entitled to a credit for LHWCA benefits previously paid to claimant, \u201cthe method by which overpayments are to be recognized\u201d was governed by the \u201crequirements of [Code] \u00a7 65.2-520.\u201d Thus, employer\u2019s recoupment was limited \u201cto ... a reduction of one-fourth of the amount of weekly payments\u201d due claimant \u201cthrough the present and continuing,\u201d not a suspension of benefits. Additionally, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-524, the deputy assessed a statutory penalty against employer upon those payments wrongfully withheld from claimant\u2019s award under the Act. The commission affirmed the decision following appeal by employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Employer now appeals to this Court, disputing the application of Code \u00a7 65.2-520 to limit recoupment of payments made pursuant the LHWCA, and the related penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-520 provides, in pertinent part, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9X\">[a]ny payments made by the employer to the injured employee during the period of his disability ..., which by the terms of this title were not due and payable when made, may, subject to the approval of the Commission, be deducted from the amount to be paid as compensation provided that, in the case of disability, such deductions shall be made by reducing the amount of the weekly payment in an amount not to exceed one-fourth of the amount of the weekly payment for as long as is necessary for the employer to recover his voluntary payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Employer correctly concedes \u201cthat numerous appellate decisions have considered payments under the [LHWCA] in the context of Voluntary payments\u2019 as defined by \u00a7 65.2-520.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Va. Int\u2019l Terminals, Inc. v. Moore, </em>22 Va.App. 396, 405, 470 S.E.2d 574, 578 (1996) <em>(Moore I) </em>(\u201c[Disability payments employer paid claimant under the LHWCA were Voluntary\u2019 because ... they were not \u2018due and payable\u2019 under \u2018the terms of the Virginia Act.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>254 Va. 46, 486 S.E.2d 528 (1997). However, employer posits that application of the statute to the instant facts would confer benefits upon claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ant violative of Code \u00a7 65.2-518 and inconsistent with the rationale of <em>Moore II </em>and, further, encourage delay in the prosecution of like claims under the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-518 limits \u201ctotal compensation under this title\u201d to \u201c500 weeks\u201d or \u201cthe average weekly wage of the Commonwealth ... for the applicable year [multiplied] by 500.\u201d <em>Moore II </em>instructs that \u201c[w]here, as here, a worker is covered by both the [LHWCA] and the state [Act], ... the injured worker may proceed under either or both statutes\u201d but \u201cis entitled to only a single recovery for his injuries.\u201d <em>Moore II, </em>254 Va. at 49, 486 S.E.2d at 529 (citations omitted). Thus, the Court in <em>Moore II </em>construed Code \u00a7 65.2-520 to assure an employer a \u201cdollar for dollar\u201d credit for LHWCA compensation benefits paid an injured employee against like benefits due under the Act, thereby avoiding an impermissible \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 486 S.E.2d at 530. Employer, therefore, reasons the commission may not restrict recovery of LHWCA credits under Code \u00a7 65.2-520 with the result that claimant receives both a \u201ctotal recovery\u201d violative of Code \u00a7 65.2-518 and a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d contrary to <em>Moore II. </em>Employer\u2019s argument misconstrues both Code \u00a7 65.2-518 and <em>Moore II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The benefit limitations prescribed by Code \u00a7 65.2-518 are restricted to \u201ctotal compensation payable under\u201d the Act. Therefore, recoupment of credits resulting from voluntary payments by an employer to an injured employee of monies, <em>\u201cnot due and payable </em>[under the Act] <em>when made,\u201d </em>is a circumstance clearly not contemplated by Code \u00a7 65.2-518 but, rather, specifically embraced by Code \u00a7 65.2-520.Code \u00a7 65.2-520 (emphasis added). Code \u00a7 65.2-520 facilitates an employer\u2019s right to collect LHWCA credits by \u201cdeductions\u201d from compensation due an employee under the Act but expressly restricts such offsets to one-fourth of the \u201cweekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>payment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-520 creates no alternative or exception to the collection mechanism to redress circumstances that may result in a diminished recovery by an employer. \u201cIf a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Loudoun Co. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 84, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Similarly, a proper reading of <em>Moore II </em>offers no support for employer\u2019s argument. <em>Moore II </em>simply affirms the well established principle disfavoring double recovery by an employee of benefits arising from the same industrial accident and construes Code \u00a7 65.2-520 to allow a \u201cdollar for dollar\u201d recoupment by an employer of overpayment credits. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 486 S.E.2d at 530. <em>Moore II </em>neither disapproves the method of recovery specified by Code \u00a7 65.2-520 nor suggests exceptions to preclude shortfalls to employer or windfalls to employee. To the contrary, the court defers to the \u201cclear intent of the General Assembly\u201d in construing Code \u00a7 65.2-520, thereby countenancing the explicit statutory limitations upon recovery of overpayment credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Lastly, employer maintains that the promise of undeserved benefits resulting from statutory limitations upon an employer\u2019s recoupment of overpayments would encourage claimants receiving benefits pursuant to the LHWCA to delay a proceeding under the Act and urges this Court to fashion a remedy to this perceived deficiency in the statutory scheme. However, such public policy determinations are within the province of the legislature, not the judiciary. Thus, absent evidence that the instant claim was time-barred by the Act or attendant Rules of the Commission, we decline employer\u2019s invitation to impose a judicial limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Claimant\u2019s brief includes a conclusionary prayer for \u201cinterest due under [Code] \u00a7 65.2-707[and] attorney\u2019s fees and costs due under [Code \u00a7 ] 65.2-713.\u201d A review of the record discloses claimant requested \u201can award of attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>fees\u201d in correspondence to the commission dated May 25, 2000. In subsequently deciding the instant cause, the deputy expressly did \u201cnot find\u201d claimant entitled to \u201cany attorney\u2019s fees under [Code] \u00a7 65.2-513[sic],\u201d a decision claimant did not submit for review by the commission. Accordingly, the commission did not address the issue and we decline to entertain it on appeal. With respect to an award of fees and costs incident to the proceedings before this Court, we find \u201creasonable grounds\u201d supported employer\u2019s defense and deny claimant such relief. Code \u00a7 65.2-713(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Accordingly, the commission properly limited employer\u2019s right of recoupment to the method prescribed by Code \u00a7 65.2-520 and correctly assessed a penalty on those benefit payments withheld contrary to statute. We, therefore, affirm the decision and remand the proceedings to the commission solely for entry of an appropriate order directing the immediate payment of those benefits improperly withheld by employer, together with the attendant penalty and interest, and the restoration of benefits to claimant, subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-520.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">. In response, the commission acknowledged the claim and notified both employer and claimant, without objection, \"[n]o further action will be taken ... until requested by the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. Employer\u2019s uncontroverted calculations reflect that recoupment at the statutory rate, $26.21 per week (25% of $104.87), would permit \"recapture\u201d of only $42,944.04 from claimant over the benefit period under the Act, resulting in a \"windfall\u201d to claimant of $25,998.74 and a \"pennies-for-dollar\u201d credit recovery for employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
