On appeal, he contends this conviction violated the principles of double jeopardy because he also was convicted of driving while under the influence (DUI), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, based on the same evidence. After consideration of the legislative scheme and implicit intentions of the General Assembly, we affirm the involuntary manslaughter conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The facts are not in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">On the evening of October 5, 1999, appellant was driving on Shore Drive in the City of Virginia Beach when he struck James Cone and Kathy Phelan, who were walking beside the road. Cone was injured, but not fatally. Phelan was alive at the scene, but later died from her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">When Virginia Beach Police Officer Scott Bishop arrived at the scene, he found appellant\u2019s speech was slurred, his eyes were glassy, and he swayed as he stood. Appellant also smelled of alcohol and could not pass a number of field sobriety tests. Appellant admitted he had consumed alcohol that evening. A breath test revealed his blood alcohol level was .11.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Appellant was charged with involuntary manslaughter under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and with DUI. The preliminary hearing and trial for these charges were held together in general district court on December 9,1999. The DUI warrant originally recited a violation of the Virginia Beach City Code. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The prosecutor amended the warrant to reflect a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266(ii), (iii), or (iv). The language on the DUI warrant that referred to Code \u00a7 18.2-266\u00ae, allowing convictions based on a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or more, was struck by the prosecutor. The district court convicted appellant of the amended DUI charge and certified the manslaughter charge to the grand jury. The grand jury returned a true bill of indictment on January 4, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In the circuit court, appellant moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. After both parties briefed the issue, the trial court heard argument on March 14, 2000. During the hearing, the Commonwealth \u201cstipulated\u201d that \u201cthese two offenses don\u2019t pass [the <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932),] test.\u201d On May 2, 2000, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In ruling that double jeopardy principles did not bar prosecution of the involuntary manslaughter charge under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, the trial court found the General Assembly intended to impose multiple punishments \u201cfor the unlawful killing of another in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 and for the crime of driving while intoxicated in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266(h), (hi) and (iv).\u201d The trial court further found that the reference in Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 to Code \u00a7 18.2-266(ii), (hi) and (iv) served only to \u201cgrade this offense of manslaughter, distinguishing it from the offense of common law involuntary manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Appellant contends he was twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense when he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter following his DUI conviction. Essentially, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>argues that his DUI conviction, which the Commonwealth at trial conceded is a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, precludes prosecution of the greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy includes \u201cthree separate guarantees: (1) \u2018It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. [(2) I]t protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [(3)] And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019\u201d <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980) (quoting <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969)). This appeal involves only the question of whether appellant received multiple punishments for the same offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Generally, to determine whether charges are for the \u201csame offense,\u201d courts turn to the test established in <em>Block-burger. </em>For example, the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">In <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977), we stated the principal test for determining whether two offenses are the same for purposes of barring successive prosecutions. Quoting from <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), which in turn relied on <em>Gavieres v. United States, </em>220 U.S. 338, 342-343, 31 S.Ct. 421, 422, 55 L.Ed. 489 (1911), we held that \u201c \u2018[t]he applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u2019 \u201d 432 U.S., at 166, 97 S.Ct., at 2225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\"><em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. at 416, 100 S.Ct. 2260.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">However, in this case, the Commonwealth conceded \u201cthese two offenses don\u2019t pass that test.\u201d Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Commonwealth is barred from arguing <em>Blockburger </em>on appeal, and this Court will not apply that test here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 674, 683, 496 S.E.2d 143, 147 (1998) (finding the Commonwealth conceded at trial that an exception to the warrant requirement for searches did not apply and, therefore, the exception could not form the \u201cbasis for affirmance on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">This concession does not mandate the outcome of this appeal, however, because <em>Blockburger </em>is not controlling. \u201c[S]imply because two criminal statutes may be construed to proscribe the same conduct under the <em>Blockburger </em>test does not mean that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the imposition, in a single trial, of cumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes.\u201d <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). As the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">The rule stated in <em>Blockburger </em>was applied as a rule of statutory construction to help determine legislative intent. Significantly, after setting out the rule, the Court cited a paragraph in <em>Albrecht [v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 1, 11, 47 S.Ct. 250, 71 L.Ed. 505 (1927)], which included the following statement: \u201cThere is nothing in the Constitution which prevents Congress from punishing separately each step leading to the consummation of a transaction which it has power to prohibit and <em>punishing also the completed transaction\u201d </em>(emphasis added). We have recently indicated that the <em>Blockburger </em>rule is not controlling when the legislative intent is clear from the face of the statute or the legislative history. <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368, 103 S.Ct. 673, 679, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983); <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 340, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1143, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981); <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 691-92, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1437-38, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). Indeed, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>would be difficult to contend otherwise without converting what is essentially a factual inquiry as to legislative intent into a conclusive presumption of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>Garrett v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 778-79, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 313-14, 337 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1985). A <em>Blockburger </em>analysis is preferred by courts generally as it maximizes judicial economy, providing an answer without resorting to a more detailed examination of legislative intent. However, the Commonwealth here agreed with appellant that the <em>Blockburger </em>test did not allow multiple punishments here.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"> In this case, therefore, the issue is whether \u201cthe General Assembly has \u2018clearly indicated its intent to impose multiple punishments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 635, 292 S.E.2d 798, 810 (1982) (quoting <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 513, 530, 273 S.E.2d 36, 47 (1980)). The structure of the Code, the language of the statutes, legislative history, and the logical implications of each interpretation assist in making this determination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Garrett, </em>471 U.S. at 779 &amp; 785, 105 S.Ct. 2407; <em>Fitzgerald, </em>223 Va. at 636-37, 292 S.E.2d at 810-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Although determining legislative intent is \u201ca factual inquiry,\u201d <em>Garrett, </em>471 U.S. at 779, 105 S.Ct. 2407, this analysis involves an examination of the offenses \u201cin the abstract, rather than with reference to the facts of the particular case under review,\u201d <em>Blythe v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 726, 284 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1981). Therefore, <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s ruling is appropriate. <em>Contrast Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 551, 555, 439 S.E.2d 622, 624-25, <em>aff'd en </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>banc, </em>18 Va.App. 814, 447 S.E.2d 542 (1994) (deferring to a trial court\u2019s factual finding of no prosecutorial misconduct in deciding whether double jeopardy principles prevented retrial of a defendant) <em>with Stephens v.

Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(A), initially enacted in 1989, reads: \u201cAny person who, as a result of driving under the influence <em>in violation of </em>clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 or any local ordinance substantially similar thereto unintentionally causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We presume the legislature was aware of similar language within the Code and the courts\u2019 interpretations of that language when drafting this statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">Legislative intent may also be gleaned by consulting other statutes \u201cusing the same phraseology,\u201d <em>[Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 523, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996)], and \u201cstatutes which relate to the same subject matter should be read, construed and applied together----\u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 256, 450 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-9\"><em>Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999). <em>See also United States v. Johnson, </em>32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>F.3d 82, 86 (4th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe may \u2018assume that our elected representatives ... know the law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 696-97, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979))).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">A comparison of the language in Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 and the language of several Virginia murder statutes indicates the General Assembly intended to allow multiple punishments for violations of this manslaughter section and the DUI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The language in Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 is similar to the language used in several murder statutes that reference other crimes as an element of the murder offense. For example, the first degree murder statute requires, in similar language, proof that the killing was committed <em>\u201cin the commission of, </em>or attempt to commit, arson, rape, forcible sodomy, inanimate or animate object sexual penetration, robbery, burglary or abduction.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-32 (emphasis added). The felony murder statute also uses similar language, requiring that the killing occur <em>\u201cwhile in the prosecution of some felonious act </em>other than those specified in \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31 and 18.2-32.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-33 (emphasis added.) Clearly, the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 is similar to the language of these murder statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">None of these statutes expressly allows multiple punishments for the underlying offenses. However, Virginia case law has interpreted this type of language to allow the simultaneous prosecution and conviction of felony murder as well as the underlying felony upon which the murder charge is based. In <em>Fitzgerald, </em>for example, the Supreme Court, without relying on <em>Blockburger, </em>found the General Assembly did not intend to eliminate punishment of the underlying offenses when it enacted the capital murder statute. 223 Va. at 635-37, 292 S.E.2d at 810-11. This Court then applied the analysis in <em>Fitzgerald </em>to \u201cconclude that double jeopardy was not violated when [a defendant] was convicted, in a single trial, of both felony murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32 and the underlying felony.\u201d <em>Spain, </em>7 Va.App. at 391-92, 373 S.E.2d at 731-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Additionally, the purpose behind this language is the same in the felony murder statutes and in Code \u00a7 18.2-86.1. For a conviction under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-32 and -33, the Commonwealth is not required to prove malice, a traditional element of murder, but need only prove the commission of the underlying felony to supply this criminal intent element. As the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">While \u00a7 18.2-32 contemplates a \u201clolling with malice\u201d, the malice intrinsic in the commission of one of the predicate felonies \u201cprovides the malice prerequisite to a finding that the homicide was murder.\u201d <em>Wooden v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 758, 762, 284 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1981). The same imputation of malice is implicit in \u00a7 18.2-33 which contemplates an accidental killing----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Heacock v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 397, 403, 323 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1984). <em>See also Commonwelth v. Montague, </em>260 Va. 697, 700, 536 S.E.2d 910, 912 (2000) (discussing Code \u00a7 18.2-33).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Likewise, while the Commonwealth is required to prove criminal negligence for a common law involuntary manslaughter conviction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 491, 370 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1988) (holding \u201cthat criminal negligence is an essential element of involuntary manslaughter\u201d), under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(A), no proof of criminal negligence is required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly, the purpose of both the felony murder statute and Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 is to allow the Commonwealth to prove a traditional element of the offenses, the mindset or intent of the accused, by substituting the violation of a different statute for direct proof of the element. Given the similar purpose and the similar language in these statutes, we must conclude the General Assembly similarly intended to allow multiple punishments for violations of both Code \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>36.1 and the underlying DUI, just as it did for felony murder and the underlying felony. <em>See Spain, </em>7 Va.App. at 391-92, 373 S.E.2d at 731-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Additionally, the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 indicates the legislature did not intend to preclude prosecution of drunk driving charges. This section refers only to subsections (ii), (iii), and (iv) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; subsection (i), which establishes a .08 percent blood alcohol concentration as a per se violation of the DUI statute, is not mentioned. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, therefore, the Commonwealth cannot rely on the presumption in Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 266(i) to convict a defendant, but instead must prove he was under the influence as proscribed in subsections (ii), (iii), (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Accordingly, as appellant concedes, a defendant who was convicted of DUI under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) clearly can be convicted of involuntary manslaughter in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 without violating double jeopardy principles. We find no indication that the legislature intended to allow multiple punishments when subsection (i) is violated, but not when subsections (ii), (iii), or (iv) are violated. Such disparate results are not warranted, especially given the legislative purpose of these statutes is to provide the maximum deterrent to drunk drivers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See State v. McCovey, </em>803 P.2d 1234, 1239 (Utah 1990) (explaining that to apply double jeopardy princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>pies to felony murder and aggravated robbery convictions allows a \u201cwindfall\u201d to a defendant who is charged with felony murder as opposed to another type of killing). We do not believe the General Assembly intended to give appellant such a \u201cwindfall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The General Assembly clearly intended to allow multiple punishments in this case.
