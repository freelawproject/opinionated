The evidence disclosed defendant had been previously convicted of burglary, a \u201cviolent felony\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-805,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the trial court sentenced him to the \u201cminimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of five years\u201d in accordance with Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). On appeal, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the indictment to support the mandatory sentence, complaining the predicate \u201cviolent felon/\u2019 was \u201can essential element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>offense\u201d not specifically charged in the indictment. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The relevant procedural history is uncontroverted. On November 20, 2000, defendant entered a plea of guilty to an indictment alleging, in pertinent part, that he, \u201c[o]n or about the 1st day of March, 2000, feloniously did knowingly and intentionally possess a firearm, having been previously convicted of a felony, in violation of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\u201d By agreement, the Commonwealth proceeded by a \u201csynopsis\u201d of the evidence, which included, without objection, introduction of an order memorializing a prior conviction of defendant for burglary, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-92. At the conclusion of the summary, the court inquired if defendant had \u201cany questions or comments on the statement of facts\u201d and, hearing no response, \u201caccepted] [defendant\u2019s] plea of guilty\u201d and found him guilty \u201cas charged in the indictment.\u201d Sentencing was delayed pending the preparation of a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The \u201cPresentence Investigative Report\u201d and related \u201cSentencing Guidelines\u201d reflected the prior burglary conviction, a \u201cviolent felony\u201d that triggered a \u201cSentencing Guidelines Recommendation ]\u201d of incarceration for five years, the \u201cMANDATORY MINIMUM\u201d prescribed by Code 18.2-308.2(A). Defendant objected to the recommendation, complaining the indictment did not specifically allege the existence of a previous \u201cviolent felony\u201d conviction as an element of the offense necessary to trigger the \u201cminimum, mandatory\u201d sentence. The trial court concluded the indictment was sufficient and sentenced defendant to five years imprisonment, the statutorily mandated minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">A. It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly and intentionally possess ... any (a) firearm.... Any person who violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, any person who violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was <em>previously convicted of a violent felony as defined in \u00a7 17.1-805 shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of five </em>years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>... </em>The minimum, mandatory terms of imprisonment prescribed for violations of this section shall not be suspended in whole or in part and shall be served consecutively with any other sentence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">(Emphasis added). Defendant contends the \u201cviolent felony\u201d sentencing component to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) creates a \u201cgrade of the offense,\u201d thereby adding an \u201cessential element\u201d to the crime that must be charged in the indictment. Otherwise, he reasons, an accused is subjected to a mandated \u201cenhanced punishment\u201d without proper notice of the necessary predicate. In response, the Commonwealth characterizes the obligatory punishment as a sentencing issue, distinct from the underlying offense and its elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\u201c[T]he function of an indictment ... is to give an accused notice of the nature and character of the accusations against him in order that he can adequately prepare to defend against his accuser.\u201d <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 664, 668, 536 S.E.2d 458, 460 (2000). <em>See </em>U.S. Const. amend. VI; Va. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 8; <em>Wilder v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 147, 225 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1976). Accordingly, Code \u00a7 19.2-220 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>[t]he indictment or information shall be a plain, <em>concise and definite written statement ... </em>describing the offense charged.... In describing the offense, ... the indictment or information may state so much of the common law or statutory definition of the offense as is <em>sufficient to advise what offense is charged.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">(Emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Complementing Code \u00a7 19.2-220, Rule 3A:6(a) directs \u201c[t]he indictment ... cite the statute or ordinance that defines the offense or, if there is no defining statute or ordinance, prescribes the punishment for the offense.\u201d Considered together, \u201c[t]he inference to be drawn from the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and Rule 3A:6(a) is clearly that incorporation by ... reference\u201d of the statute cited in the indictment \u201cis contemplated by the Rule.\u201d <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 665, 667, 353 S.E.2d 166, 167 (1987) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Accordingly, although an indictment need not recite the penalty for the alleged offense, \u201cwhen a statute contains more than one grade of offense carrying different punishments, \u2018the indictment must contain <em>an assertion of the facts essential to the punishment sought to be </em>imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sloan v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 240, 246-47, 544 S.E.2d 375, 378 (2001) (quoting <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 192, 198, 497 S.E.2d 908, 910 (1998)) (emphasis added); <em>see also McKinley v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 1, 4, 225 S.E.2d 352, 353-54 (1976). Hence, \u201cgrade[s]\u201d of offenses \u201cdescribed in the same Code section,\u201d \u201ceach carr[ying] a. different punishment,\u201d are not properly charged by an indictment that only generally references conduct criminalized by specific gradation. <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 350, 352, 381 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">\u201cWhen considering on appeal whether an indictment charged a particular offense, we limit our scrutiny to the face of the document.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>27 Va.App. at 198, 497 S.E.2d at 910. Viewed accordingly, the indictment in issue clearly and succinctly charged defendant with \u201cknowingly and intentionally possessing] a firearm, having been previously convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>a felony in violation of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\u201d Such language substantially mirrored Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and included an express reference to the statute, thereby comporting with both Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and Rule 3A:6(a). While Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is comprised of three subsections, enumerated \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d and \u201cC,\u201d only subsection \u201cA\u201d outlaws conduct and prescribes related penalties. Defendant, nevertheless, insists the mandatory minimum penalty provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) create gradations of the primary offense, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, which necessitates allegations in the indictment specific to the crime charged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument, however, is belied by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), a statute intended to \u201cprevent[] a person, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed, regardless of whether that person uses, displays, or conceals the firearm.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 358, 429 S.E.2d 615, 617, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993). <em>See also Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 312, 318, 549 S.E.2d 641, 644 (2001) <em>(en banc). </em>The proscribed conduct, together with the attendant elements, is clearly defined in the initial sentence of the statute and punishable as \u201ca Class 6 felony.\u201d Consistent with the intendment of the enactment, an accused having been previously convicted of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is subject to a period of mandatory incarceration, a sentence within the range of a Class 6 felony but beyond trial court discretion. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, such disparate penalties do not spawn gradations of the offense. The crime is not defined by the penalty. <em>Cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>McMil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>lan v. Pennsylvania, 477 </em>U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The punishment/gradation dichotomy is made more apparent when the unitary prohibition of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) is contrasted with gradation statutes examined in <em>McKinley, Hall, </em>and <em>Moore. </em>In <em>McKinley, </em>the accused was before the court on an indictment alleging abduction in violation of a specified statute, an offense punishable in accordance with a companion provision. <em>McKinley, </em>217 Va. at 2, 225 S.E.2d at 353-54. However, he was wrongfully convicted and sentenced for \u201cabduction with intent to defile,\u201d misconduct embraced by a statute distinct from the offense at indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4, 225 S.E.2d at 353-54. The defendant in <em>Hall </em>was indicted for \u201cthe use of a sawed-off shotgun in the commission of a \u2018crime,\u2019 \u201d a Class 4 felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-300(6), but improperly convicted of using such weapon \u201cin the commission of a crime of violence,\u201d a Class 2 felony proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-300(A). <em>Hall, </em>8 Va.App. at 351, 381 S.E.2d at 512-13. The appellant in <em>Moore </em>was erroneously sentenced for possession of \u201ca firearm while simultaneously possessing <em>with intent to distribute </em>\u201d certain controlled substances in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(6), a \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d felony from possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine, conduct alleged in the indictment and proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(4). <em>Moore, </em>27 Va.App. at 195-97, 497 S.E.2d at 909-10. In each instance, unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the legislature criminalized discrete <em>conduct, </em>oftentimes aggravated by a \u201c \u2018gradation or nexus crime,\u2019 \u201d but always differentiated both by elements and penalty. <em>See Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>263 Va. 13, 18, 557 S.E.2d 223, 225 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Thus, defendant, before the trial court on an indictment that alleged conduct in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and in compliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and Rule 3A:6(a), entered a plea of guilty to the specified offense. Inarguably aware of the previous felony that inculpated him and the attendant mandatory, minimum penalty implicated upon proof of such conviction, he subjected himself to punishment within the prescribed penalty range. Under such circumstances, the court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>found defendant violated Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and imposed the minimum punishment mandated by statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Accordingly, we affirm both the conviction and related sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-14\">. The record also discloses a prior conviction for robbery, and defendant challenges the designation of \u201ccommon law robbery\u201d as a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d However, because he does not dispute such classification of burglary, we decline to address the robbery issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 further provides, \"[a]ny person who violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was previously convicted of <em>any other felony </em>shall not be eligible for probation, and shall be sentenced to a minimum, mandatory term of imprisonment of two years.\u201d (Emphasis added). Defendant does not dispute the sufficiency of the indictment to support this lesser mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Felons in possession of other weapons also proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 are not subject to the minimum, mandatory terms of imprisonment applicable to firearms but, rather, the sentencing range of a Class 6 felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">. At trial, defendant concurred in the trial court\u2019s reasoning that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 was not a \"recidivist\u201d statute but, rather, \"a statute defining a new offense based on the fact ... somebody was previously convicted of a felony.\u201d Thus, those principles peculiar to recidivist offenses are not in issue. See, e.g., <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 250 S.E.2d 760 (1979); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 644, 440 S.E.2d 412 (1994); <em>Stubblefield v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 343, 392 S.E.2d 197 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b798-16\">.
