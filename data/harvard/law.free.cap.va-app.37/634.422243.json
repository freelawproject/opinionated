Johnson (appellant) was convicted in a bench trial of interfering with the operation of an aircraft, a misdemean- or, in violation of Code \u00a7 5.1-22. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in: (1) finding Code \u00a7 5.1-22 does not require a specific intent to interfere; (2) finding the evidence was sufficient to convict; (3) not finding Code \u00a7 5.1-22 is unconstitutionally vague. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">On November 1, 2000, police pilot H.J. Alverez was operating a helicopter in the Magic Hollow area of the City of Virginia Beach, searching for a convenience store robber. The helicopter flew at an altitude of 800 feet. Military aircraft constantly fly in this same area.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Alverez testified that, as he was searching for the robber, suddenly \u201cthe whole cockpit got illuminated; and I thought it might have been an aircraft coming at us so I veered away from it. It turned out to be somebody on the ground was shining a hght \u2014 a spotlight on the helicopter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">Alverez changed his flight path because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get blinded by the fight.\u201d At trial, Alverez stated he initially was in a \u201cleft orbit,\u201d travelling in a left hand circle so his flight officer could view the ground and spot the robber. The fight came from the left side of the helicopter and from the \u201cchin bubble,\u201d a clear plexiglass area below the pilot\u2019s feet. Alverez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>admitted the light from the ground did not cause him to crash or to have a \u201cnear crash.\u201d He never lost control of the helicopter.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Alverez instructed his flight officer to find the source of the light. Officer R.S. Renner, in a ground unit, was sent to investigate. The officer approached appellant\u2019s house and saw appellant with a spotlight in his hand, which was aimed at the helicopter. A cigarette lighter in appellant\u2019s vehicle was the power source for the light.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Appellant complied with Officer Renner\u2019s request to turn off the light. The officer described the light as a \u201cmillion candlelight spotlight.\u201d When asked why he was shining the light, appellant responded the noise of the helicopter kept him awake and \u201che was trying to get the number off the aircraft.\u201d Renner indicated the helicopter had been overhead \u201cabout 15 minutes,\u201d moving in a circular path.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Appellant testified that, on the night in question, he and his wife were awakened at approximately 11:40 p.m. by loud, \u201cincessant\u201d aircraft noise that caused the whole house \u201cto shake.\u201d For several weeks prior to this incident, appellant and his wife had been suffering from sleep deprivation due to aircraft and helicopter noise. Upon complaining to the Federal Aviation Administration and the United States Navy, appellant was advised that neither governmental body could investigate the complaints without obtaining certain information about the aircraft, such as identifying call letters, or, in the case of helicopters, the number of propeller blades.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Mrs. Johnson testified that, after hearing the noise for a period of twenty minutes on the evening of November 1, appellant went outside to investigate and identify the offending aircraft, so he could lodge a complaint with the proper authorities. Appellant pointed a marine navigational light, used in sighting water obstructions, at the helicopter in an attempt to identify the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Appellant testified the light did not improve his view. He could not see any \u201cidentificational [sic] marks, any numbers.\u201d He could not determine the number of rotor blades or deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>mine its color. He could not determine that it was a police helicopter. Appellant denied any intention to interfere with the operation of the helicopter.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Appellant said when the helicopter disappeared behind the trees, he would turn off the light. When it re-appeared, he would again turn the light on. This on-and-off process lasted approximately one and a half minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Dr. David Shaw Wright, an expert in measuring the physical qualities of light, testified that the intensity of the light used by appellant would diminish with distance. According to Wright\u2019s measurements, at 800 feet from the source, the light would have an intensity of 3.3 lux,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approximately the same illumination as the low-beam headlight of an automobile at 129 feet or the illumination at three feet away from a computer screen. Dr. Wright also gave other comparisons to illustrate the measurement of illumination: full moonlight, .4 lux; a streetlight, 20 lux; light in the particular courtroom, 1000 lux. He indicated one needs at least 500 lux to be able to read.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Dr. Wright had attempted to replicate the November 1 incident by flying in a helicopter at 800 feet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He testified the highest reading he took during this simulation was 3.3 lux. When the ground light shone in his face, Dr. Wright said the light had no impact on him. According to Dr. Wright, the light \u201cdid not seem\u201d to have an effect on the helicopter pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Rick Smith, a helicopter pilot, testified that he was a passenger in the helicopter during Dr. Wright\u2019s recreation. He indicated that, although he looked directly at the ground, the light had no effect on him. The pilot also had no reaction to the light. Smith opined that such light could not have interfered with the police mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">At the beginning of the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel presented a memorandum<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the trial court, which, according to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>transcript, argued that Code \u00a7 5.1-22 is a specific intent offense. The trial court ruled this code section creates a general intent crime. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant moved to strike the evidence. At the conclusion of all the evidence, appellant renewed his motion to strike and, for the first time, argued Code \u00a7 5.1-22 was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">II. Specific Intent</p>\n<p id=\"AhP\">Code \u00a7 5.1-22 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Any person who interferes with or threatens to interfere with the operation of any aircraft on or over the territory of this Commonwealth shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemean- or. Where the act or acts of interference or threatened interference are of such a nature as to endanger the life of the aircraft\u2019s operator or the life of any other person, the person interfering or threatening to interfere shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. Venue for the issuance of a warrant for the arrest and trial of any such person is hereby conferred upon any court having criminal jurisdiction in the political subdivision in this Commonwealth where the aircraft either took off prior to such offense, or where it lands or comes to rest subsequent to such offense, or in or over which the offense occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Appellant argues this statute requires the Commonwealth prove, as an element of the offense, that a defendant had the specific intent to interfere with operation of an aircraft. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\u201cWhile we construe penal statutes strictly against the Commonwealth, \u2018a statute should be read to give reasonable effect to the words used \u201cand to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Dillard v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 340, 344, 504 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1998) (quoting <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995) (quoting <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984))). In determining the elements established by such statutes, \u201c[w]e may not add ... language which the legislature has chosen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>not to include.\u201d <em>County of Amherst v. Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982). <em>See also Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 321, 326, 523 S.E.2d 509, 511 (2000); <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 166, 170, 497 S.E.2d 896, 897 (1998). <em>See, e.g., Stuart v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 216, 217-18, 397 S.E.2d 533, 533-34 (1990) (refusing to find a specific intent element \u201cbecause the unambiguous language\u201d of the statute did \u201cnot require proof of a specific intent\u201d to commit bigamy); <em>Polk v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 590, 594, 358 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1987) (\u201cThe resulting effect of the offender\u2019s threats ... is not an element of the crime defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-460. By the express terms of the statute, it is immaterial whether the officer is placed in fear or apprehension.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Specific intent is not an implicit element of every statutory crime, but instead must be explicitly found in the statute\u2019s language in order to establish such intent as an element of an offense. <em>See Dixon v. Commonwealth, </em>197 Va. 380, 382, 89 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1955) (\u201c[WJhere a statute makes an offense consist of an act combined with a particular intent, such intent is as necessary to be proved as the act itself, and it is necessary for the intent to be established as a matter of fact before a conviction can be had.\u201d); <em>Hucks v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 168, 175, 531 S.E.2d 658, 661 (2000) (explaining that the language of a statute determines what proof of intent is necessary for a conviction). <em>See, e.g., Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 619, 630-31, 535 S.E.2d 706, 712 (2000) (explaining that the felony-murder statute does not require the Commonwealth prove the accused had the specific intent to kill); <em>Fleming v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 349, 354, 412 S.E.2d 180, 183 (1991) (finding Code \u00a7 18.2-279, discharging a firearm at an occupied dwelling, is a general intent, rather than specific intent, crime). Interpretations that \u201crewrite statutes\u201d are not permitted. <em>Frias v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 193, 199, 538 S.E.2d 374, 376 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">When asked to interpret various code sections, this Court often examines other related statutes that contain similar or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>contrasting language to help determine legislative intent. <em>See Pannell v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 287, 294, 540 S.E.2d 527, 531, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>35 Va.App. 643, 547 S.E.2d 529 (2001); <em>Barnes, </em>33 Va.App. at 628, 535 S.E.2d at 710-11; <em>Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999). Here, an examination of other specific intent crimes found in the Code is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">This Court has found the \u201cwith intent to\u201d language creates a specific intent crime.. <em>See Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 988, 990-91, 421 S.E.2d 652, 653-54 (1992) <em>(en banc), aff'd on proced. gds., </em>246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648 (1993) (finding Code \u00a7 18.2-195(1), credit card fraud, creates a specific intent crime); <em>Stuart, </em>11 Va.App. at 217-18, 397 S.E.2d at 533-34 (finding disorderly conduct is a specific intent crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The General Assembly has used this \u201cwith intent to\u201d language in numerous places throughout the Code. In the sections criminalizing burglary, for example, the legislature explicitly included a requirement that the Commonwealth prove a specific \u201cintent to\u201d commit particular crimes before a defendant can be found guilty. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-89; <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 144, 495 S.E.2d 489, 495 (1998) (discussing burglary with the intent to commit rape under Code \u00a7 18.2-90). Former Code \u00a7 54-524.101:1<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> also required proof of a specific intent to distribute the marijuana found in a defendant\u2019s possession in order to convict him under that section. <em>See Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 437, 440, 229 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1976). Other sections that have this specific intent language include Code \u00a7 3.1-884.25 (bribery or gifts to state employees \u201cwith intent to influence said officer or employee in the discharge of any such duty\u201d), Code \u00a7 18.2-32.1 (murder of a pregnant woman requires \u201cthe intent to cause the involuntary termination of the woman\u2019s pregnancy\u201d), Code \u00a7 18.2-54.1 (poisoning food or water supplies \u201cwith intent to kill or injure another person\u201d), Code \u00a7 18.2-152.6 (theft of computer services \u201cwith intent to obtain computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>services without authority\u201d), Code \u00a7 29.1-525.1(A) (erecting a fence \u201cwith the intent to confine deer\u201d), Code \u00a7 58.1^4017 (forging a lottery ticket \u201cwith intent to present for payment\u201d), Code \u00a7 60.1-632 (making a false statement \u201cwith intent to obtain or increase any [unemployment] benefit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Code \u00a7 5.1-22, however, does not contain this language. The section creates a Class 1 misdemeanor for interfering with the operation of any aircraft. We hold that no specific intent requirement is included as an element of this offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Stuart, </em>11 Va.App. at 217-18, 397 S.E.2d at 533-34 (refusing to read a specific intent requirement into a statute unless the language unequivocally requires such an element). <em>See also Fleming, </em>13 Va.App. at 354, 412 S.E.2d at 183 (finding discharge of a firearm at an occupied dwelling is not a specific intent crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Appellant argues that the language, \u201cor threatens to interfere with the operation of any aircraft,\u201d indicates the legislature intended Code \u00a7 5.1-22 to be a specific intent crime. This argument, however, is not relevant to the trial court\u2019s findings. Appellant was not convicted of making a threat, which is also criminalized in Code \u00a7 5.1-22. He was charged with and found guilty of actual interference with the helicopter, as defined by the language prior to the disjunctive \u201cor threatens\u201d found in this statute. Any intent requirement created by the \u201cthreatens\u201d term applies only if actual interference is not charged. <em>See, e.g., Campbell, </em>14 Va.App. at 990, 421 S.E.2d at 653 (discussing the effect of a disjunctive term in a statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"Avb\">Appellant argues the evidence was insufficient to prove he actually interfered with the operation of the helicopter. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after conviction, it is our duty to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. We should affirm the judgment unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anq\"><em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). Moreover, \u201c[i]f there is evidence to support the conviction, an appellate court is not permitted to substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact, even if the appellate court might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Presley, </em>256 Va. 465, 466, 507 S.E.2d 72, 72 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Appellant was convicted of the misdemeanor offense defined by Code \u00a7 5.1-22, not the felony offense also found in that statute. The Commonwealth must prove the interference \u201cendanger[ed] the life of the aircraft\u2019s operator or the life of any other person\u201d only if a defendant is charged with the felony. Code \u00a7 5.1-22. Therefore, in this case the evidence must support the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant interfered with the operation of the aircraft, not that the interference endangered someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The evidence does support the conviction. The trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">[I]t would seem to me that if you\u2019re 800 feet above the ground and all of a sudden a bright light comes at you, you don\u2019t know what it is. You\u2019re in almost an inherently unstable aircraft because you don\u2019t know what it is. So he performs a sudden maneuver to veer to the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u00ed-\u00ed ^ H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">You cannot expect a helicopter pilot 800 feet above the ground ... to expect that all of a sudden he\u2019s going to see a spotlight shining directly at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">To him, it was a bright light. To him, he didn\u2019t know what it was. He was operating the aircraft. All the tests in the world are not going to recreate what happened at that exact moment when he saw that light and he didn\u2019t know what it was; and if it caused him to make a sudden evasive maneu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ver that he hadn\u2019t counted on, then that is interference with the operation of his aircraft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">A finding of interference for purposes of a misdemeanor conviction under Code \u00a7 5.1-22 does not also require a finding that someone was placed in danger.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>814 (6th ed.1990), \u201cinterfere\u201d means to \u201ccheck; hamper; hinder; infringe;, encroach; trespass; disturb; intervene; intermeddle; interpose.\u201d Another dictionary defines \u201cinterfere\u201d as \u201cto come into opposition or collision so as to hamper, hinder, or obstruct someone or something: Constant distractions interfere with work.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>680 (1997) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Additionally, because the factor differentiating the misdemeanor and felony offenses in Code \u00a7 5.1-22 is endangerment, clearly the legislature did not intend to include endangerment as an element of the misdemeanor offense. <em>See Adkins, </em>27 Va.App. at 169-70, 497 S.E.2d at 897 (courts should interpret statutes by using the plain meaning of the words and examining the statutory scheme).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Appellant did disturb, intervene, hamper, hinder, and obstruct the pilot who was operating the helicopter. The light shone into the cockpit of the aircraft and caused the' pilot to veer from his intended course. Clearly, appellant interfered with the operation of the helicopter.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">IV. Vagueness</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Appellant argues on appeal that Code \u00a7 5.1-22 is unconstitutionally vague because it does not include examples of the types of prohibited behavior. This argument was not preserved for consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Motions for dismissal of a warrant or indictment on the ground that a criminal statute is unconstitutional must be made in writing and filed seven days prior to the trial. Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2. Generally, if the argument is not presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the trial court in this manner, then appellant has not preserved it for appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Upchurch v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 48, 51-53, 521 S.E.2d 290, 291-92 (1999) (discussing Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Here, appellant did not present his argument to the trial court until, at the earliest, moments before the beginning of the trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commonwealth pointed out that appellant had not complied with Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2. The trial court never explicitly ruled Code \u00a7 5.1-22 was constitutional. Therefore, as the argument was not properly presented to the trial court, appellant did not preserve this argument for appeal. <em>See Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 461, 464-65, 524 S.E.2d 162, 164 (2000) (holding \u201cclaims of constitutional deprivation\u201d must be properly preserved at the trial level before the appellate courts can consider them).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\">.

He does not ask that we consider the nature of the general intent required here. At minimum, in this case, the Commonwealth had to and did prove appellant intended to shine the light at the helicopter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b686-12\">. For a felony conviction, the Commonwealth must prove interference <em>and </em>endangerment of the pilot or another person by that interference, but appellant was not found guilty of a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b687-15\">.
