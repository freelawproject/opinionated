Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. &amp; Reliance Nat\u2019l Indem. Co., </em>35 Va.App. 689, 547 S.E.2d 551 (2001), a divided panel of this Court affirmed the judgment of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. We stayed the mandate of that decision and granted rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the stay of this Court\u2019s June 26, 2001 mandate is lifted and we affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for the reasons set forth in the majority panel decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">with whom FITZPATRICK, C.J., BENTON, ANNUNZIATA and FRANK, JJ., join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">I would hold this case is controlled by rather than distinguishable from <em>Wood v. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc., </em>18 Va.App. 391, 444 S.E.2d 3 (1994). Here, the claimants notified Hertz of the proposed settlement and the date on which they hoped to obtain court approval. The settlement did not impair Hertz\u2019s rights until a valid release was executed, which could not have occurred until the claimants obtained court approval for the settlement. Hertz had over four weeks before the court approved the settlement in which to act, but it failed to voice any objections during that time. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><em>Wood </em>involved a claimant with asbestosis who filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits against his employer, Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 444 S.E.2d at 5. Wood simultaneously pursued common law tort actions against various asbestos manufacturers and negotiated settlement offers for the tort claims. <em>Id. </em>Wood notified Caudle-Hyatt in writing by certified mail of the terms of the settlement offers and said he intended to accept them unless Caudle-Hyatt objected within ten days. <em>Id. </em>Caudle-Hyatt responded that it was not liable for Wood\u2019s asbestosis claim; it did not agree or object to the proposed tort settlement or mention any subrogation rights. <em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 444 S.E.2d at 5. Wood then settled the tort claims for an amount that exceeded the sum he might have received for his ailment under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, exclusive of medical expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 444 S.E.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On appeal, we held, <em>inter alia, </em>that Wood\u2019s claim for compensation and a <em>pro rata </em>share of attorney\u2019s fees from Caudle-Hyatt was not barred because Wood informed Caudle-Hyatt of the terms of the settlement and gave it an opportunity to object or to participate in order to protect its subrogation rights. <em>Id. </em>at 398-99, 444 S.E.2d at 7-8. In essence, we held that Caudle-Hyatt consented to the settlement through its inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Similarly, here, Hertz consented through inaction to the settlement of the third-party -wrongful death claim on behalf of the claimants. Under general principles of insurance law, an insurer\u2019s subrogation rights are not impaired by a settlement until a valid release has been executed by one with authority to do so. <em>See </em>16 Lee R. Russ <em>&amp; </em>Thomas F. Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance 3d </em>\u00a7 224:100 (1999); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 224:104 (\u201cAs with any contract provision, there must be a meeting of the minds concerning the terms and conditions of the applicable provision as well as meeting all other requirements of an enforceable contract (i.e., authority and consideration).\u201d). Virginia\u2019s wrongful death statutes provide that a decedent\u2019s personal representative may compromise a wrongful death claim only with court approval. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-55. Here, it is undisputed that the claimants\u2019 attorney kept Hertz\u2019s attorneys apprised of the settlement negotiations in the wrongful death suit as they progressed. Although the commission found that the claimants\u2019 counsel verbally accepted a settlement offer of $725,000 on April 22, 1997, without first obtaining Hertz\u2019s approval for that exact figure, claimants\u2019 counsel informed Hertz\u2019s attorneys of the verbal acceptance that same day. The hearing required under Code \u00a7 8.01-55 for formal approval of that settlement did not occur until at least May 21, 1997, more than four weeks later. The claimants could not execute a valid release until after they obtained judicial approval and, thus, their actions could not have impaired Hertz\u2019s subrogation rights prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">During the four-week period preceding judicial approval of the settlement, claimants\u2019 counsel provided Hertz\u2019s counsel with a copy of the letter confirming settlement of the third-party claim. Claimants\u2019 counsel also wrote a separate letter, dated May 9, 1997, directly to Hertz\u2019s counsel. That letter notified Hertz of the May 21, 1997 hearing at which the claimants intended to seek approval of the third-party settlement. The letter also indicated the claimants\u2019 intent thereafter to \u201cturn [their] attention to the subrogation interest of Hertz,\u201d indicating clearly that they did not intend to abandon their claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Despite this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>notice, Hertz did not appear at the May 21, 1997 hearing and did not object to the settlement prior to the court\u2019s entry of an order approving the settlement on May 27, 1997. Although Hertz lacked standing to oppose the court\u2019s entry of an order approving the third-party settlement, the claimants\u2019 or personal representative\u2019s consent remained a prerequisite to judicial approval of the settlement. If Hertz had communicated its objections to the claimants prior to the hearing, entry of the court\u2019s order of approval, or the claimants\u2019 execution of a release, the claimants could have withdrawn their consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Thus, I would hold that here, as in <em>Wood, </em>Hertz consented to the settlement by its inaction, and I would reverse and remand to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this approach, including the mandate that the commission address the issue raised by Hertz regarding apportionment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred by Hertz in protecting its interests in the third-party action. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">This order shall be published and certified to the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
