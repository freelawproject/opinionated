On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in considering sentencing guidelines that used his juvenile robbery conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues the juvenile conviction is void and, therefore, the court should not have considered it. For the reasons stated, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>On October 30, 2000, appellant pled guilty to carjacking and use of a firearm in the commission of carjacking. There was no plea agreement. During the plea colloquy, appellant acknowledged he understood the maximum possible sentence for these offenses was life in prison plus three years. At the conclusion of the plea proceeding, the circuit court accepted the pleas and continued the matter for the preparation of a pre-sentencing report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">On January 31, 2001, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>asserting the sentencing range recommended by the Commonwealth was improper because the range was calculated using sentencing guidelines that considered a 1996 adjudication of delinquency for a robbery offense, entered by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of the City of Norfolk. In his motion, appellant argued that since his father was not notified of the juvenile proceeding, the judgment was void under <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, 258 </em>Va. 1, 516 S.E.2d 219 (1999).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The circuit court heard and denied the motion <em>in limine </em>on February 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">At sentencing, the court considered sentencing guidelines prepared by defense counsel, which did not include the juvenile robbery adjudication. These guidelines gave a range of seven years and seven months to eleven years and ten months, with a midpoint of ten years and three months. The Commonwealth\u2019s guidelines gave a range of seventeen years and eight months to twenty-seven years and nine months, with a midpoint of twenty-three years and eleven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the victim testified that the carjacking took place in front of his home, requiring that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>re-live the incident daily. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m not sure you can live there every day and be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Before announcing the sentence, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">I\u2019ve looked at the guidelines that have been prepared both by the Commonwealth and the probation department, and I\u2019ve also reviewed the guidelines prepared by [the defense] attorney. I considered all of them. The trial court feels that, based on the totality of the evidence and your record and what actually occurred, this is not a guidelines case. I\u2019ve reviewed them and considered both of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The court sentenced appellant to fifty years in prison, with twenty-five years suspended, for the carjacking conviction and three years in prison for the firearm conviction. In setting this sentence, the court took into account appellant\u2019s \u201csenseless\u201d and \u201cextreme criminal behavior\u201d and the trauma to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Appellant argues the juvenile robbery conviction is void and, therefore, any sentencing that considered that conviction is tainted. However, his underlying premise is wrong, given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Nelson v. Warden of the Keen Mountain Corr. Ctr., </em>262 Va. 276, 552 S.E.2d 73 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Prior to <em>Nelson, </em>the Supreme Court had provided support for appellant\u2019s argument in <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 431, 437-40, 527 S.E.2d 406, 409-11 (2000). <em>Moore </em>held that a juvenile court did not have authority to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a child faced with criminal charges if that court failed to notify the parents of the juvenile\u2019s charges, thus making any judgment of that court void. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Moore, like appellant here, had not preserved this argument for direct appeal of the challenged conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 527 S.E.2d at 408. The Supreme Court, however, found Moore\u2019s conviction was void, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Subject matter jurisdiction is granted by constitution or statute. <em>Humphreys v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 765, 772, 43 S.E.2d 890, 894 (1947). It cannot be waived and any judgment rendered without it is void <em>ab initio. </em>Moreover, lack of subject matter jurisdiction \u201cmay be raised at any time, in any manner, before any court, or by the court itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>43 S.E.2d at 893. In contrast, \u201c[a] court\u2019s authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over a case may be restricted by a failure to comply with statutory requirements that are mandatory in nature and, thus, are prerequisite to a court\u2019s lawful exercise of that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>[Dennis] Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 405, 409, 527 S.E.2d 415, 417 (2000) (decided today) (holding that the failure to give statutorily required notice of initiation of juvenile court proceeding to juvenile\u2019s parent is a defect in those proceedings cured by Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(E)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">sfc # :\u25a0\u00ab \u2756 \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">[W]e have held that the statutory requirement of parental notice of the initiation of proceedings in the juvenile court, under various former versions of what is now Code \u00a7 16.1-263, are mandatory in nature and limit a court\u2019s rightful exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">Based on this Court\u2019s unswerving adherence to the nature of this notice requirement to parents, this requirement as applied to Moore\u2019s case was \u201cmandatory.\u201d Thus, because it failed to comply with this mandatory requirement, the juvenile court lacked authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over the offenses charged against Moore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 437-39, 527 S.E.2d at 409-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\"><em>Nelson </em>effectively overruled this analysis in <em>Moore. </em>The Supreme Court stated in <em>Nelson, </em>\u201cWe are of [the] opinion <em>David Moore </em>is flawed by our failure to recognize that, in the legal and factual framework in which the decision was made, a different outcome should have resulted from the distinction we drew between subject matter jurisdiction and the authority to exercise that jurisdiction.\u201d 262 Va. at 282, 552 S.E.2d at 76. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The Court explained that the parental notification requirement is not jurisdictional, but procedural, and \u201ca failure to notify parents [can] be waived by a failure to object,\u201d meaning \u201ca failure to comply with the requirement [would render] subsequent convictions voidable and not void. To the extent <em>David Moore </em>conflicts with these views, it is overruled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 552 S.E.2d at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">As in <em>Nelson, </em>appellant herein did not preserve his argument that the juvenile court failed to give his father notice of the robbery charge. Instead, he raised this issue collaterally by filing a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude consideration of that juvenile conviction, after he pled guilty to the two separate offenses appealed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">A voidable judgment is subject to direct attack at any time before the judgment becomes final, but is not subject to collateral attack.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Jones v. Willard, </em>224 Va. 602, 607, 299 S.E.2d 504, 508 (1983); <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>28 Va.App. 781, 790, 508 S.E.2d 916, 921 (1999); <em>Commonwealth v. Holtz, </em>12 Va.App. 1151, 1154, 408 S.E.2d 561, 563-64 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Appellant said during the proceedings on the carjacking and firearm charges that he was not asking the court to \u201cwipe out\u201d the juvenile conviction. However, he argued that the previously final judgment of delinquency was invalid based on <em>Baker </em>and its progeny and, therefore, should not be considered for sentencing purposes. This attack on the robbery conviction, made during an unrelated case, is clearly collateral. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>255 (7th ed.1999) (defining \u201ccollateral attack\u201d as \u201c[a]n attack on a judgment entered in a different proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Appellant also cites <em>Duong v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 424, 542 S.E.2d 47 (2001), to support his position that the juvenile robbery conviction should not have been used in the sentencing guidelines to calculate a sentencing range. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Duong </em>panel found, since Duong\u2019s juvenile convictions were void for failure to notify his father, that those convictions could not be used to calculate a sentencing recommendation under the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 542 S.E.2d at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">However, <em>Duong </em>is not controlling here. Inasmuch as <em>Duong </em>stands for the proposition that a prior juvenile conviction can be collaterally attacked as void based on the failure to notify a parent, <em>Nelson </em>effectively overrules that proposition. <em>Compare id. </em>at 428, 542 S.E.2d at 48-49, <em>with Nelson, </em>262 Va. at 281-82, 552 S.E.2d at 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nelson, </em>we find appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-15\">. For this case, we use the term \"conviction\u201d to refer to both circuit court final determinations of guilt and findings of delinquency by a juvenile and domestic relations district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">. Appellant does not contest the voluntariness of his guilty plea nor did he at any time move to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\">. Prior to sentencing, appellant apparently filed a <em>Baker </em>motion with the Norfolk Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, but that motion was not heard prior to sentencing on the caijacking and firearm offenses. Nothing in the record suggests the juvenile adjudication was ever found void by any court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">. Limited exceptions to this rule do exist, such as petitions for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-654 <em>et seq. </em>However, those exceptions are not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
