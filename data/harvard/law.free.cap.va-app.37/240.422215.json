The panel affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that a provision of the parties\u2019 child support agreement, which had been incorporated into the final decree of divorce, was void and unenforceable. The provision that the trial court declined to enforce provided for modification of child support upon emancipation of each of the parties\u2019 children, according to a standard set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>forth in the agreement. The panel also reversed the trial court\u2019s enforcement of a provision permitting modification upon changes in child care expenses, and found Francis E. Shoup (\u201cfather\u201d) in contempt and liable to Heidi S. Shoup (\u201cmother\u201d) for arrearages of $33,888.20 plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees. We granted father\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>stayed the mandate of that decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we find the decree\u2019s provisions for future modification by agreement of the parties valid and enforceable and hold that the trial court erred in its calculation of arrearages and in finding the father in contempt of its support order. We also hold that the trial court properly enforced the provision for modification upon a change in child-care costs. Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The parties were divorced by a final decree of divorce entered by the Fairfax County Circuit Court on September 1, 1994. At the time of the divorce, the parties had three minor children: Allison Elliot Shoup, born November 30, 1977; Francis Elliot Shoup, IV, born June 8, 1979; and Kyle A.M. Shoup, born June 20, 1985. The final divorce decree incorporated the parties\u2019 June 27, 1994 Custody, Support and Property Settlement Agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In accordance with the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>agreement, the final decree ordered the father to pay $2,177 per month in child support to the mother. The decree also provided for a proportionate division of certain medical expenses and for reimbursement of child-care costs based on the parties\u2019 relative annual gross incomes as calculated in the support guideline worksheet, Attachment A to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The oldest child, Allison, graduated from high school in June, 1995 and turned eighteen years of age on November 30, 1995. Beginning in October, 1995, the father unilaterally reduced the amount of support by approximately one-third to $1,452 per month. He continued making payments for childcare costs, although the mother, beginning in October, 1995 incurred none. In May, 1997, the parties\u2019 second child, Elliot, graduated from high school and turned eighteen one month later. The father again unilaterally reduced the amount of support by another one-third to $764 per month. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the father unilaterally reduced the amount of support paid on each of these two occasions, the record shows that the mother did not object until she filed the present suit to collect the arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On April 13, 1999 the mother filed a petition for a rule to show cause against the father for failing to pay $2,177 per month in child support. The matter was heard on June 24, 1999. In its letter opinion dated October 30, 1999, the trial court found the father to be in contempt of court and found that he was in arrears in his support payments from October, 1995 through May, 1999 because a support order may not be retroactively modified by the parties or without court approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on the parties\u2019 agreement as incorporated into the final decree, the trial court also awarded father a credit for his payments of child-care expenses that had not been incurred by the mother. The trial court entered an order dated December 7, 1999 finding the father in contempt and entered judgment against the father in the principal sum of $33,838.20, with interest at the judgment rate. It also awarded mother her attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Father raised the following issues for determination <em>en banc: </em>(1) whether the final decree which incorporated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>parties\u2019 agreement pursuant to statute should have been upheld, including the provisions for future modification of child support; (2) whether the court erred by ignoring the statutory guidelines in determining child support arrearages where the incorporated agreement provided for the application of guidelines in computing child support in the event of a change of circumstances; (8) whether the panel\u2019s holding that the Shoup divorce decree was a nullity and void destroyed its vitality as an enforceable order and thereby relieved father from any alleged arrearages and from a charge of contempt; and (4) whether the trial court erred in ordering an award of attorney\u2019s fees to appellee. Mother argues that the child support modification provisions did not, in fact, authorize modification of child support payments without court approval and that a provision purporting to do so would improperly undermine the authority of the court to set child support awards. The issues raised by the parties in this case bring into sharp relief the foundational principles of Virginia divorce law regarding the divorce court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine child support and the rights of the parties to resolve those issues by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Divorce and its incidents are matters rooted in and reflective of a state\u2019s public policy. The state is \u201cdirectly interested in determining the status of its own citizens, and to this end can and does establish and enforce its own policy in relation to marriage and divorce.... \u201d <em>Heflinger v. Heflinger, </em>136 Va. 289, 308, 118 S.E. 316, 322 (1923). Consistent with this interest, the General Assembly enacted a statutory basis for the grant of divorce in the Commonwealth. <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>211 Va. 718, 719, 180 S.E.2d 500, 500 (1971); Code \u00a7 20-107.2. The judicial authority granted in divorce matters encompasses the authority to determine child support.Code \u00a7 20-79.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Under Virginia law, the grant of a divorce petition is a purely judicial function grounded in statute. <em>Jackson, </em>211 Va. at 719, 180 S.E.2d at 500. Accordingly, the parties cannot, by agreement, effectuate a divorce. <em>Foster v. Foster, </em>195 Va. 102, 104, 77 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1953). However, the parties can reach agreement on all other issues. Divorcing parents may and, indeed, are encouraged under Virginia public policy, to reach agreement respecting the care and support of their minor children. <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>216 Va. 457, 459, 219 S.E.2d 864, 867 (1975) (\u201c[PJublic policy favors prompt resolution of disputes concerning the maintenance and care of minor children.... Voluntary, court-approved agreements promote that policy and should be encouraged.\u201d); <em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>10 Va.App. 391, 399, 392 S.E.2d 688, 692 (1990) (\u201cSettlement agreements between parties to [divorce] lawsuits are designed to put an end to litigation and are favored by the law.)\u201d (citing <em>Stamie E. Lyttle Co. v. County of Hanover, </em>231 Va. 21, 26, 341 S.E.2d 174, 178 (1986)); Code \u00a7 20-109.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">A substantial body of law has been developed explicating the principles that govern the court\u2019s jurisdiction to enter child support awards, as well as those that govern the parties\u2019 right to reach agreement on the issue. In resolving the issues in the case before us, it is important to understand how the principles that govern the court\u2019s jurisdiction to enter child support awards impact the parties\u2019 right to reach agreement on the issue. While the two sets of principles often intersect, on certain questions, the principles of one are independent from and unrelated to the function and dictate of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Where the court\u2019s jurisdiction to set support has been invoked, either in the absence of an agreement or where the parties seek to have their agreement of child support reviewed and considered by the court in the course of its determination of a proper award, the court has been granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>broad discretion to make an award. <em>Franklin v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Social Servs., </em>27 Va.App. 136, 143, 497 S.E.2d 881, 885 (1998). However, its exercise of discretion is not unfettered, as numerous decisions of the Virginia appellate courts make manifest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">The best interest of the child or children is the paramount and guiding principle in setting child support, whether it be adopting the presumptive amount, calculating an alternate sum after the presumptive amount has been rebutted, ordering the amount agreed upon between the parents, or approving, ratifying and incorporating, in whole or in part, the child support provisions of a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\"><em>Watkinson v. Henley, </em>13 Va.App. 151, 158-59, 409 S.E.2d 470, 474 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In addition, the trial court must base an award for child support on contemporaneous events. <em>Keyser v. Keyser, </em>2 Va.App. 459, 345 S.E.2d 12 (1986). It may not award support prospectively, <em>Solomond v. Ball, </em>22 Va.App. 385, 470 S.E.2d 157 (1996), including upon the emancipation of one of many children. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>1 Va.App. 330, 333, 338 S.E.2d 353, 355 (1986) (where trial court awarded unitary support to children, in order to reduce payments to the remaining children upon the emancipation of the oldest child, the husband must \u201capply to the court for a modification of the decree upon a change of condition\u201d). It may not modify an award retroactively. Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 684, 696, 472 S.E.2d 668, 674 (1996) (citing <em>Cofer v. Cofer, </em>205 Va. 834, 838-39, 140 S.E.2d 663, 666-67 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">A review of the relevant cases makes clear that these legal principles define the court\u2019s jurisdiction and power, and circumscribe the court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in setting child support. They do not necessarily govern the effect, scope, or validity of an agreement that the court has incorporated into its decree and upon which it has based its child support award. Indeed, the parties\u2019 well-established and broad right to reach legally binding and enforceable agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>mente concerning the support of their children is firmly rooted in Virginia law. A trial court may not disregard an agreement regarding child support in setting an award. <em>Watkinson, </em>13 Va.App. at 158, 409 S.E.2d at 474 (holding that the trial court must consider agreed provisions in determining amount of child support). Where an agreement has been reached and either party requests incorporation, the agreement may be affirmed and incorporated into the court\u2019s final decree and \u201cdeemed for all purposes to be a term of the decree, and enforceable in the same manner as any provision of such decree.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109.1; <em>see also Morris, </em>216 Va. at 459, 219 S.E.2d at 866-67 (\u201cThe purpose of [Code \u00a7 20-109.1] is to facilitate enforcement of the terms of an incorporated agreement by the contempt power of the court.\u201d). Where the court adopts the parties\u2019 agreement by incorporating it into its decree, it is enforceable, to the word, as any other term of the decree. <em>Fry v. Schwarting, </em>4 Va.App. 173, 179, 355 S.E.2d 342, 345 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Our cases applying Code \u00a7 20-109.1 place only three limitations upon the parties\u2019 right to contract regarding child support. First, the court must review the provisions of the agreement for their consistency with the best interests of the child or children whose welfare the agreement addresses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id.; Watkinson, </em>13 Va.App. at 157, 409 S.E.2d at 474. Second, the parties may not, by agreement, prevent the court from exercising its power to change, modify, or enforce its decree concerning the custody and maintenance of minor children. Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 298, 449 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1994); <em>Featherstone v. Brooks, </em>220 Va. 443, 446, 258 S.E.2d 513, 515 (1979); <em>Morris, </em>216 Va. at 461, 219 S.E.2d at 867; <em>Watkinson, </em>13 Va.App. at 157, 409 S.E.2d at 473. The third limitation, emanating from the first two, prohibits the parties from terminating by contract a parent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>duty to support a child. <em>See Kelley, </em>248 Va. at 298, 449 S.E.2d at 56 (\u201cparents cannot contract away their children\u2019s rights to support\u201d); <em>Church v. Church, </em>24 Va.App. 502, 508, 483 S.E.2d 498, 501 (1997) (finding decree void because it was based on agreement to terminate father\u2019s obligation to pay child support).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Neither the Virginia Code nor our case law imposes any additional restrictions on the parents\u2019 ability, in the context of divorce, to mutually determine the support of their children. Indeed, under certain circumstances, the right to reach agreement regarding support is more extensive than the court\u2019s power to decree support absent an agreement. <em>See, e.g., Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 227, 232, 481 S.E.2d 482, 485 (1997) (holding that where a trial court bases its child support order on the parties\u2019 agreement, it need not \u201cdeter-min[e] the precise presumptive amount of support,\u201d although such a determination is required absent an agreement); <em>Spagnolo v. Spagnolo, </em>20 Va.App. 736, 743, 460 S.E.2d 616, 619 (1995) (noting that contracts between parents to continue support for children past the age of majority will be enforced), although the court lacks jurisdiction to order such support in the absence of such an agreement (citing <em>Eaton v. Eaton, </em>215 Va. 824, 827, 213 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1975)) No case law exists which precludes the court from incorporating within its decree any provision from the parties\u2019 agreement found to be consistent with the best interest of the child, and not void as against the public policy as enunciated in <em>Kelley </em>and its progeny. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20 109.1 (providing trial court with discretion to incorporate all or some of the parties\u2019 valid agreement without enunciating any limits). It follows that, where the court affirms, ratifies, approves and incorporates such an agreement into its divorce decree, in whole or in part, it has necessarily exercised the discretion granted to it under Code \u00a7 20-108.1 and determined that the agreement is consistent with the best interests of the child. <em>Blackburn v. Michael, </em>30 Va.App. 95, 101, 515 S.E.2d 780, 783 (1999) (trial court must determine that parties\u2019 agreement setting child support serves the best interest of the child before approving and incorporating agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ment (citing <em>Scott, </em>12 Va.App. 1245, 1248, 408 S.E.2d 579, 582 (1991)))</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In this case, the agreement as incorporated into the divorce decree does not purport to circumvent the court\u2019s jurisdiction to enforce support, modify support, or intervene upon petition of either party. <em>Cf. Kelley, </em>248 Va. at 298, 449 S.E.2d at 56 (finding agreement void because it attempted to preclude the trial court from exercising its power to decree child support where wife agreed \u201cnever to file a petition in any court\u201d requesting child support and stipulated that she would reimburse husband for all sums paid to him if a court ordered him to pay such support). Rather, either party may at any time invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine child support consistent with the best interests of that child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does the agreement purport to \u201ccontract away\u201d the children\u2019s right to support from either parent. <em>Id. </em>(finding contract void because \u201cthe children\u2019s rights to receive support from both parents were substantially abridged\u201d). Under the agreement, the minor children\u2019s rights to support remain intact and fully viable. Furthermore, while a court may not make an award prospectively, nothing in our case law invalidates a decretal provision reflecting the parties\u2019 agreement to address and make future modifications of support as circumstances change. <em>See, e.g., Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>6 Va.App. 501, 502, 370 S.E.2d 311, 312 (1988) (enforcing a provision of separation agreement under which child support payments decreased by $100 per month when custodial parent sold the marital residence and further decreased by $100 per month when each child graduated from high school); <em>Tiffany v. Tiffany, </em>1 Va.App. 11, 332 S.E.2d 796 (1985) (upholding property settlement agreement entitling husband to reduce support payments the month preceding the date that each child turned eighteen).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>We, therefore, conclude that neither the provisions of the agreement addressing child support, nor the decretal terms that reflect them, contravene the public policy of Virginia. <em>See Blackburn, </em>30 Va.App. at 101, 515 S.E.2d at 783. Rather, the agreement in this case fosters the Commonwealth\u2019s public policy favoring the amicable resolution of child support issues. <em>Morris, </em>216 Va. at 459, 219 S.E.2d at 867; <em>Schmidt, </em>6 Va.App. at 503, 370 S.E.2d at 312. In such circumstances, a rule requiring parents to return to court for approval of a renegotiated amount of child support, as provided in an agreement that has been affirmed, ratified, and incorporated into an earlier decree, would undermine the Commonwealth\u2019s policy in favor of prompt resolution of disputes concerning the maintenance and care of children upon divorce. As we stated in <em>Moreno:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">[W]e are aware of neither holding nor statute that requires a trial court to hear evidence on the matter of child support where the parties have agreed to the amount of support and do not seek the court\u2019s determination of the matter.... [T]he resources of both the court and the parties would be wasted by requiring a trial judge to <em>sua sponte </em>require parties to litigate a settled matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">24 Va.App. at 233, 481 S.E.2d at 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In sum, we find that the parties\u2019 agreement is fully consistent with Virginia law governing the scope, effect, and validity of such agreements. Its incorporation into the final decree of divorce necessarily rested on a finding that the provisions were consistent with the best interest of the child. <em>See Watkinson, </em>13 Va.App. at 158, 409 S.E.2d at 474; <em>Scott, </em>12 Va.App. at 1248, 408 S.E.2d at 582.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Paragraph 5(d) of the incorporated agreement provides for a reduction in support upon the emancipation of each of the parties\u2019 minor children. Paragraph 5(e) provides that, upon a change in circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>such as the emancipation of a child, the parties will follow the child support guidelines and other relevant law when determining the child support then due and owing. Because the trial court failed to enforce this provision of the decree, its finding of contempt and award of arrearages constitute reversible error. <em>See Commonwealth v. Skeens, </em>18 Va.App. 154, 158, 442 S.E.2d 432, 434 (1994) (\u201c[T]he terms of a support decree must be strictly complied with and payments made when due to the designated payee in accordance -with the terms of the decree.\u201d (citations omitted)). We, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt and its decision regarding arrearages and remand this matter to the trial court for: (1) reconsideration of whether father, in fact, followed the provisions of the incorporated agreement when reducing the amount of support; (2) recalculation of arrearages, if any; and (3) reconsideration of its contempt finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We turn finally to mother\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in giving father a credit for child-care costs because he did not request such a credit at trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">A trial court is authorized to consider child-care expenses and include in a child support award an appropriate amount reflecting those costs. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-108.1(B)(8), 20-108.2(F), 20-108.2(G)(3)(b). Here, the incorporated agreement required the mother to notify the father of any change in the child-care expenses incurred and permitted the father to reduce his support payment accordingly. Mother did not notify father of a decrease in child-care costs beginning in October, 1995, and father continued to pay child-care expenses. For the same reasons that we upheld the provision of the agreement of the parties for modification of support upon the emancipation of each child, we find the provision authorizing adjustments in support corresponding with changes in child-care costs valid and enforceable. Therefore, the trial court properly awarded father a credit representing father\u2019s overpayment for child-care costs not incurred by mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Finally, the incorporated agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>[A]ny costs, including but not limited to counsel fees, court costs, investigation fees and travel expenses, incurred by a party in the successful enforcement of any of the ... provisions of this Agreement ... shall be borne by the defaulting party. Any such costs incurred by a party in the successful defense to any action for enforcement of any of the ... provisions of this Agreement shall be borne by the party seeking to enforce compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Because the trial court has yet to determine whether father has defaulted in his child support obligation or has successfully defended this enforcement action, we remand to the trial court for reconsideration of its award of attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with its decision and the terms of the agreement. We also remand for consideration of an award of court costs and attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, consistent with its decision and the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">. The incorporated agreement provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">5. SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CHILDREN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0W\">a.

This type of provision has been termed \u201cself-executing\u201d although that is not a term used in the Code or referenced widely in case law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Father apparently deemed the agreement at bar to be \u201cself-executing\u201d and unilaterally reduced his child support payments as each child reached the age of eighteen. Both the trial court and a panel majority of this Court found these actions violative of public policy, holding that the child support payments could only be changed by court order. <em>See Shoup v. Shoup, </em>34 Va.App. 347, 542 S.E.2d 9 (2001). On that basis, the panel majority also found the incorporated self-adjustment provision for periodic fluctuations in child-care expense payments to be invalid, although the trial court did not. However, upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the members of this Court, with whom I join, give effect to \u201cself-executing\u201d child support agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Clearly, Code \u00a7 20-109.1 provides that parties can agree to the terms of child support within a custody and property settlement agreement and submit that agreement to the court. <em>See Richardson v. Richardson, </em>10 Va.App. 391, 392 S.E.2d 688 (1990). The child support terms become the terms of the court\u2019s decree if the court affirms, ratifies and incorporates those into its decree. \u201cCode \u00a7 20-109.1 provides that a court may affirm, ratify and incorporate by reference in its decree any valid agreement between the parties, or provisions thereof, concerning the conditions of the maintenance of the parties ... and the care, custody and maintenance of their minor children.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Rodriguez, </em>1 Va.App. 87, 90, 334 S.E.2d 595, 596 (1985). \u201cWhere the court does ... incorporate the agreement or provisions thereof, it shall be deemed for all purposes to be a term of the decree and enforceable as such ... by the contempt power of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 334 S.E.2d at 597 (citation omitted). The plain meaning of Code \u00a7 20-109.1 is, therefore, the basis upon which the validity of self-executing child support agreements rests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cWhen the legislature has spoken plainly courts may not change or amend legislative enactments under the guise of construing them. The province of construction lies wholly within the domain of <em>ambiguity. ... </em>That which is plain needs no interpretation. <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 407-08, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 312, 320, 549 S.E.2d 641, 645 (2001) (quoting <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 358, 429 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">A child support agreement presented to a court under Code \u00a7 20-109.1 is not, however, entitled to the same mandatory-recognition by the court as is an agreement for spousal support under Code \u00a7 20-109(C). The court must make a determination that the terms of a child support agreement (which become terms of the decree) are in the best interests of the child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B); <em>see also Blackburn v. Michael, </em>30 Va.App. 95, 515 S.E.2d 780 (1999); <em>Watkinson v. Henley, </em>13 Va.App. 151, 409 S.E.2d 470 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Thus, a court may incorporate the parties\u2019 agreement as to child support into its decree, and the terms will be enforceable upon an initial finding that the agreement is in the child\u2019s best interest. This is true even when the terms provide for future changes in child support, without further court action, provided (1) the court approves of the future changes when it incorporates the terms into its decree and (2) the court\u2019s continuing authority under Code \u00a7 20-108 to revise and alter child support in the future is not limited. <em>See generally Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 449 S.E.2d 55 (1994); <em>Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>6 Va.App. 501, 370 S.E.2d 311 (1988); <em>Tiffany v. Tiffany, </em>1 Va.App. 11, 332 S.E.2d 796 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">A court\u2019s ratification of an incorporated agreement\u2019s child support terms carries the express or implied imprimatur that the court has found those terms in the best interest of the children. <em>See generally Scott v. Scott, </em>12 Va.App. 1245, 408 S.E.2d 579 (1991). As the <em>en banc </em>majority correctly concludes, such a finding that the agreed child support is in the children\u2019s best interests can be made under a \u201cself-executing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>agreement, one which modifies the amount of child support at a future date upon the occurrence of a modification event. Such an adjustment may occur without additional court approval of the modification at the time the modification is implemented. <em>See Schmidt, </em>6 Va.App. 501, 370 S.E.2d 311; <em>Tiffany, </em>1 Va.App. 11, 332 S.E.2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In the context of a \u201cself-executing\u201d child support award, like any other award of child support, a court must first determine that the future adjustments are in the child(ren)\u2019s best interests. Such a determination requires that both the event(s) triggering adjustment, and the terms of adjustment, are clear and definitive. <em>See id. </em>It should be self-evident that a court <em>cannot </em>determine that a future self-executing adjustment to child support is in a child\u2019s best interests if the triggering events or the terms of adjustment cannot be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Accordingly, I concur with the majority, in reasoning and result, to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to credit father for the adjustments in child-care expense payments. No further court intervention is required for the parties to adjust the child-care expense reimbursement, which is based on clear and definitive modification terms (actual expenditures divided on a <em>pro rata </em>share of verified annual incomes). While this adjustment provision is plainly self-executing, the salient reason it meets muster is that a court does not employ guesswork to decide if this method of future adjustment is in the best interests of the children when entering the decree, which incorporates the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The same judgment, however, cannot be given on future changes in\u2018child support payments under the Shoup decree and incorporated agreement. Although the majority reads the decree to provide \u201cfor a reduction in support upon the emancipation of the parties\u2019 minor children,\u201d I do not find definitive direction in the decree and its incorporated agreement as to how a revised amount is to be calculated \u201cimmediately without the need of any implementing action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">While the decree provides \u201c[father] is ordered to pay [mother] child support in accordance with all the terms, provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>and requirements of their June 27,1994 Custody, Support and Property Settlement Agreement,\u201d it then specifically fixes child support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">[Father] shall pay the amount of $2,177.00 per month, as and for child support, to [mother]. Child support shall continue <em>until </em>a minor child dies, marries, becomes emancipated, or reaches the age of eighteen years, whichever occurs first, or <em>until </em>further order of the court[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">(Emphasis added.) Neither the decree nor the incorporated agreement definitively establishes the adjustment to the initial child support amount as each child turns eighteen years of age. However, the decree is clear that the initial set amount of $2,177 is in effect only <em>until </em>the first child reaches the age of eighteen unless there is a prior order changing it. There was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">There are no specific adjustment terms in the decree and its incorporated agreement directing a self-executing adjustment to the child support amount. Instead, one must intuit that the reference in the decree to pay child support \u201cin accordance with all the terms ... of their ... property settlement agreement\u201d is an enforceable link to some part of that agreement. Father posits that link to this portion of the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">[5]e. If there is any change in circumstances, the parties shall follow the child support guidelines contained in \u00a7 20-108.2 of the Code of Virginia or its successor statute <em>and any other relevant Virginia statutes and case law for determination of child support.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The agreement does not provide that the child support guidelines then in effect fix the terms of modification, but instead requires the parties to follow the guidelines plus \u201cother relevant Virginia statutes and case law for determination of child support.\u201d Under the language of the incorporated agreement, further judicial intervention would be required to definitely determine how other \u201crelevant Virginia statutes and case law\u201d would alter the guideline amount. Clearly, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>a provision is not \u201cself-executing,\u201d as it is not \u201ceffective immediately without the need of implementing action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">More importantly, a court asked to incorporate such a provision could not determine, on the date it entered its decree incorporating the agreement, what the future child support terms would be upon one of the Shoup children attaining age eighteen. Thus, no finding could be made that such unknown terms were in the best interests of the remaining unemancipated children.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the child(ren)\u2019s best interests cannot be ascertained, then the portion of the decree setting out an unknown future child support adjustment would not be susceptible to self-adjustment by the parties without further action of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The plain terms of the decree required the monthly payment of $2,177 <em>until </em>a child attained the age of eighteen. The decree is silent as to what amount then would be due. It is clear, though, that the decree does not set $2,177 as the amount of continuing monthly child support due from father for the remaining unemancipated children.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Upon a Shoup child reaching age eighteen, the decree and incorporated agreement are manifestly <em>not </em>self-executing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In plain terms, neither party knew what the appropriate amount of child support for the remaining unemancipated child(ren) was to be under \u00a7 5(e) of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">However, the trial court determined an arrearage, and found father in contempt, based on the $2,177 monthly amount, but without any finding as to what child support amount was in the best interests of the remaining unemancipated children and required by the decree and incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>agreement. Clearly, that decision of the trial court was erroneous. Father\u2019s duties as to child support were then not definite and he could not, therefore, be found in contempt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">As a general rule, \u201cbefore a person may be held in contempt for violating a court order, the order must be in definite terms as to the duties thereby imposed upon him and the command must be expressed rather than implied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\"><em>Winn v. Winn, </em>218 Va. 8, 10, 235 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1977) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the majority to reverse the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt as to father and to remand the issue of any child support arrearage to the trial court for a determination of the appropriate child support amount. To do so, the trial court needs to determine the child support guidelines in effect as each child attained age eighteen and how \u201cother relevant Virginia statutes and case law\u201d affects, if at all, the appropriate child support amount for the remaining unemancipated children). Only after such a determination is made can it be further determined if an arrearage or overage exists as finally adjusted for the child-care expenses. In view of the necessity to remand to the trial court, I would also reverse the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand to the trial court for reconsideration on that issue as well. Whether any attorney\u2019s fees are due, and to and from whom under the terms of the agreement, is dependent on the ultimate determination as to the child support payment arrearage or overage, if any.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\">. For current purposes, I will assume a self-executing child support agreement is one in which terms \"effective immediately without the need of any type of implementing action\u201d are used. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1364 (7th ed.1999); <em>see also Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>6 Va.App. 501, 506, 370 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">. The best interest of the child or children is the paramount and guiding principle in setting child support, whether it be adopting the presumptive amount, calculating an alternative sum after the presumptive amount has been rebutted, ordering the amount agreed upon between the parents, or approving, ratifying and incorporating, in whole or in part, the child support provisions of a contract. <em>See Watkinson </em>v. <em>Henley, </em>13 Va.App. 151, 153, 409 S.E.2d 470, 471 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">. Had the agreement referenced a definitive standard, such as a specific monetary amount or simply the guidelines in effect at the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, the court would have definitive terms upon which to make a finding of the best interests of the remaining unemancipated children as to the future adjustment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\">.
