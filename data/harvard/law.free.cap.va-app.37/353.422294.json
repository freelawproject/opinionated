Gray (defendant) was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a child, a violation of former Code \u00a7 18.1-215.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing the prosecution violated the double jeopardy prohibitions of the United States and Virginia Constitutions and, further, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">On January 8, 1998, defendant was indicted for \u201caggravated sexual battery ... [i]n violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and an attendant jury trial commenced on October 19,1999. At trial, the victim, Frances Maggard, recounted events in proof of the indictment, the Commonwealth rested, and defendant offered no evidence. Immediately before the jury was instructed, defendant moved the court to dismiss the indictment because Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 \u201cwas not in existence\u201d in 1972, the time of the alleged offense. In response, the Commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to charge \u201ctaking indecent liberties with children,\u201d a violation of former Code \u00a7 18.1-215, which pertained in 1972. Defendant, however, objected, contending the amendment would allege \u201ca different crime\u201d with additional elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The trial court declined to amend the indictment \u201cbecause it would ... actually charge a different crime.\u201d Turning to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court acknowledged the offense alleged in the indictment, aggravated sexual battery, \u201cdidn\u2019t exist in ... '72,\u201d \u201cthere was [then] no such thing,\u201d and concluded that defendant \u201ccan\u2019t be found guilty of [the offense] today.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion, \u201cas [he] was charged under Section 18.2-67.3 ..., which was not in existence at the time of the offense in 1972.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Within one month thereafter, the Commonwealth indicted defendant for \u201ctaking indecent liberties with children\u201d in violation of former Code \u00a7 18.1-215,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the instant offense. Defendant promptly moved to dismiss the indictment, maintaining he had been \u201cput in trial and put in jeopardy\u201d on the aggravated sexual battery indictment and, therefore, the instant prosecution \u201cconstitute[d] double jeopardy.\u201d The court denied the motion, and proceeded with trial, resulting in the subject conviction and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In prosecuting the offense, the Commonwealth relied solely upon the evidence of the alleged victim, Frances Maggard. Maggard testified that, when thirteen years of age, she had resided with defendant and his wife during November and December 1972, while her mother recovered from an illness. \u201cOne afternoon\u201d Maggard was asleep on a couch, and defendant \u201clifted [her] up,\u201d \u201csat down\u201d and \u201claid [her] ... over his lap.\u201d She soon \u201cfell back to sleep\u201d but was \u201cabruptly awakened\u201d by defendant \u201crubbing [her] shoulder and neck\u201d with one hand and her breast with the other. \u201c[S]hoeked,\u201d Maggard \u201csat there for a minute,\u201d then \u201cjumped up\u201d and \u201cgot away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Later that evening, Maggard was \u201c[o]n the floor,\u201d \u201cafraid\u201d of defendant and \u201cpretend[ing] to be asleep,\u201d when he \u201claid down\u201d beside her and \u201cstarted rubbing [her] back, ... buttocks and legs.\u201d \u201cAt <em>some </em>point, [Maggard] was turned over\u201d and defendant placed his \u201chands ... between [her] legs, ... rubbing [her] crotch, and ... [her] breasts.\u201d Maggard unsuccessfully \u201ctried to wiggle up\u201d and \u201ckept turning away and trying to push him off.\u201d Finally, the \u201cphone rang\u201d and \u201cas soon as [defendant] answered the phone, [she] jumped up,\u201d \u201cran back to the bathroom\u201d and \u201clocked both the doors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-j\">Maggard told no one of defendant\u2019s misconduct until she related the incidents to her sister approximately four years later. A \u201clong time\u201d thereafter, in \u201c'88 or '89,\u201d she reported the offenses to police. Explaining the delay, Maggard recalled a feeling of shame for \u201cbe[ing] pawed over\u201d and fear \u201cof what [her father] would do if he found out what had happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Relying upon principles of double jeopardy, defendant first maintains that dismissal of the original aggravated sexual battery indictment barred the subject prosecution on an indictment charging indecent liberties with children, the \u201csame offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Double Jeopardy Clauses of both the United States and Virginia Constitutions ensure an accused is not \u201csubject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V; <em>see </em>Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. The safeguard \u201cguarantees protection against (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 216, 227, 509 S.E.2d 293, 300 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">In order to make such a defense with success, the party relying upon it must show that he has been put upon his trial before a court which has jurisdiction, <em>upon indictment </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>or information which is sufficient inform and substance to sustain a conviction, </em>and that a jury has been impaneled and sworn, and thus charged with his deliverance. Anything short of this, is insufficient to raise a bar against a new indictment or prosecution for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><em>Dulin v. Lillard, </em>91 Va. 718, 722, 20 S.E. 821, 822 (1895) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, \u201c[i]t is settled law, everywhere, that jeopardy means the danger of conviction.\u201d <em>Rosser v. Commonwealth, </em>159 Va. 1028, 1036, 167 S.E. 257, 259 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Here, the original indictment, which alleged aggravated sexual battery, charged defendant with an offense that did not exist at the time of the misconduct. Accordingly, no valid conviction could have resulted from the instrument. <em>See Wilder v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 148, 225 S.E.2d 411, 414 (1976) (\u201c[Bjecause the indictment found by the grand jury stated no offense and was invalid, it necessarily follows the trial court had no power to amend the indictment. The conviction on the amended indictment was therefore void.\u201d). Thus, free from the spectre of conviction, defendant was not in jeopardy at the first trial, and the instant prosecution did not offend principles of double jeopardy. 1 Charles E. Torc\u00eda, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 58 (15th ed.1993) (\u201c[a] former prosecution is ... not a bar where ... the indictment was void\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Moreover, in <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 736, 273 S.E.2d 784 (1981), the Supreme Court of Virginia, noting \u201c[djismissals of indictments are granted for a number of reasons,\u201d recognized the distinction \u201cbetween a dismissal granted pursuant to a legal defense and a dismissal granted pursuant to a factual defense,\u201d determining \u201c[t]he latter would qualify as an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes,\u201d while \u201c[a] legal dismissal might not____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743-44, 273 S.E .2d at 789-90 (citing <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978)). Revisiting the issue in <em>Greenwalt v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 498, 297 S.E.2d 709 (1982), the Court again instructed, \u201c[a] dismissal qualifies as an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when it is granted pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>factual, as opposed to a legal, defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 297 S.E.2d at 710; <em>Dodson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 286, 303, 476 S.E.2d 512, 520 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The instant record clearly demonstrates that the court dismissed the earlier indictment, on defendant\u2019s motion, solely because the offense allegedly committed in 1972 did not constitute a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3, a penal statute not enacted by the General Assembly until 1981. <em>See </em>1981 Va. Acts, ch. 397. Inarguably, such dismissal was, therefore, grounded upon a legal infirmity in the charging instrument, in contrast to an adjudication of factual issues, a circumstance that excludes the subsequent prosecution from the constraints of the double jeopardy prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Lastly, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. In considering his argument, we view the record, \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (citation omitted). The credibility of the witnesses, the weight accorded testimony, and the inferences drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). The judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">At trial, Frances Maggard detailed a visit in defendant\u2019s home during the latter months of 1972, when she was thirteen years of age. She testified defendant placed her on his lap and \u201crubb[ed] (her] shoulder[,] ... neck\u201d and breast with his hands. Later the same day, when Maggard, frightened, was feigning sleep on the floor of the home, defendant \u201claid down\u201d beside her, \u201cstarted rubbing [her] back, ... buttocks and ... legs,\u201d \u201cturned [her] over,\u201d placed his \u201chands ... between [her] legs,\u201d and \u201crubb[ed] [her] crotch\u201d and breasts. Such testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ny, if believed by the fact finder, clearly provided sufficient support for the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Accordingly, finding no constitutional bar to the subject prosecution and sufficient evidence in the record to prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">. Former Code \u00a7 18.1-215, in effect at the time of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct, was repealed in 1975. <em>See </em>1975 Va. Acts, chs. 14 and 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\">.
