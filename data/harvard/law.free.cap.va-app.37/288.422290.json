Summerlin was convicted in a bench trial of threatening to bomb a building, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-83. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred (1) in admitting evidence regarding a voice-mail message left by him three days before the purported threat was made and (2) in finding the evidence sufficient to convict him of the charged crime although the purported threat communicated neither malice nor an intent to make a threat. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Under well-settled principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below. <em>Burlile v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 796, 798, 531 S.E.2d 26, 27 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>261 Va. 501, 544 S.E.2d 360 (2001). So viewed, the evidence established that, on April 10, 2000, Clarissa McAdoo, the executive director of the Suffolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (SRHA), received a voice-mail message from Summerlin, for whom the authority was attempting to obtain housing. According to McAdoo, Summerlin indicated in the message that he was \u201csick and tired of all the lies [SRHA was] telling,\u201d that SRHA was \u201cnot providing for [him] and [his] wife,\u201d and that \u201csomething [was] going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">On April 13, 2000, at approximately 1:30 p.m., Summerlin called SRHA, asking to speak to Ms. Williams, an SRHA employee. When told by the receptionist, Patricia Riddick, that Williams was in a meeting, Summerlin became angry. In a tone of voice that Riddick described as \u201cyelling,\u201d Summerlin accused Riddick of being a racist. He added that, based on his previous experience with Riddick\u2019s coworkers, all of the people at SRHA were racists and that SRHA had given his home to an African-American couple. When told again that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Williams was in a meeting, Summerlin said \u201che would hate to have to blow the building up to get [SRHA\u2019s] attention.\u201d Scared by Summerlin\u2019s remark, Riddick attempted to get the attention of her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">At that point, Mary Fortner, another receptionist, noting from Riddick\u2019s facial expression that she was scared, told her to put the caller on hold. After Riddick told her about the caller, Fortner picked up the phone and spoke with Summerlin. He asked for Williams and then told Fortner he had received a card in the mail regarding a meeting SRHA was having. Fortner informed him that the meeting was for \u201cpeople in Section 8 ... to get together and have a discussion\u201d and was not mandatory. Summerlin said he would not be attending the meeting and \u201cwas going to be discriminated against.\u201d He added that, if he came to the meeting, \u201cthings [would] be popping and a-rocking.\u201d When informed by Fortner that she would need to put him on hold to answer another call, Summerlin replied that would not be necessary and slammed down the phone. Fortner described Summerlin\u2019s tone of voice as being \u201c[v]ery loud and angry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Based on Summerlin\u2019s threatening phone call, the SRHA building was evacuated at approximately 1:40 p.m. and the fire department was called to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">At trial, Summerlin objected to the admission of McAdoo\u2019s testimony concerning his April 10, 2000 voice-mail message, arguing that it was \u201cnot relevant to a charge that happened on the 18th of April.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection, finding that the evidence went to Summerlin\u2019s \u201cstate of mind.\u201d The trial court subsequently found that Summerlin, on April 13, 2000, threatened to bomb a building, as proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-83, and convicted Summerlin under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">II. RELEVANCE OF TESTIMONY REGARDING VOICE-MAIL MESSAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">On appeal, Summerlin contends the trial court erred in allowing McAdoo to testify regarding the voice-mail message he left for her on April 10, 2000. That message, Summerlin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>argues, having been received three days before the purported bomb threat was made, was not relevant to the charged offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). \u201cEvidence which \u2018tends to cast any light upon the subject of the inquiry\u2019 is relevant.\u201d <em>Cash v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 506, 510, 364 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1988) (quoting <em>McNeir v. Greer-Hale Chinchilla Ranch, </em>194 Va. 623, 629, 74 S.E.2d 165, 169 (1953) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In this case, Summerlin\u2019s intent at the time he made the alleged threat was clearly in dispute. The Commonwealth claimed that Summerlin\u2019s statement to Riddick that he \u201cwould hate to have to blow the building up to get [SRHA\u2019s] attention\u201d constituted a threat to bomb a building, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-83. Summerlin argued that, in making that statement, he was merely expressing an opinion and had no intent to make a threat to bomb the SRHA building. Therefore, any evidence of Summerlin\u2019s state of mind at the time he made the alleged threat would be relevant to a subject of inquiry before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">As the trial judge correctly determined, Summerlin\u2019s statements in his April 10, 2000 message to McAdoo that he was \u201csick and tired of all the lies [SRHA was] telling,\u201d that SRHA was \u201cnot providing for [him] and [his] wife,\u201d and that \u201csomething [was] going to happen\u201d reflected Summerlin\u2019s state of mind as to SRHA. Plainly, the challenged evidence demonstrated Summerlin\u2019s discontent with and animosity toward SRHA and his related intention to take some future action against SRHA. Furthermore, the evidence concerned a message that was left a mere three days before the subject bomb threat was made and was not, therefore, so far removed in time from the charged offense as to render it irrelevant. <em>See Lafon v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 411, 419, 438 S.E.2d 279, 284 (1993) (noting that, while remoteness is a factor that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>be considered in determining the relevance of evidence of defendant\u2019s prior acts, such evidence should not be withheld \u201csolely on the basis of remoteness unless the expanse of time has truly obliterated all probative value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We find, therefore, that McAdoo\u2019s testimony concerning Summerlin\u2019s April 10, 2000 voice-mail message was relevant to the resolution of the issue of Summerlin\u2019s state of mind at the time of the charged offense. <em>See Parnell v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 342, 348, 423 S.E.2d 834, 838 (1992) (holding that defendant\u2019s statement to police after his arrest, in which he again threatened victim, was admissible to prove his state of mind and corroborated evidence of his hostility toward victim). Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the challenged testimony. Hence, the trial court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Summerlin further contends the evidence admitted at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to convict him of the charged offense. The Commonwealth, he argues, failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his statement to Riddick that \u201che would hate to have to blow the building up to get [SRHA\u2019s] attention\u201d was made maliciously or communicated an intent to make a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">As noted, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Bright v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>wealth, </em>4 Va.App. 248, 250, 356 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1987). \u201cIn so doing, we must \u2018. regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Norman v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 518, 520, 346 S.E.2d 44, 45 (1986) (quoting <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (internal quotations omitted)). We will not disturb the conviction unless it is plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Sutphin v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 241, 243, 337 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1985). We are further mindful that the \u201ccredibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the factfinder\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Keyes v. City of Virginia Beach, </em>16 Va.App. 198, 199, 428 S.E.2d 766, 767 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">A. MALICE</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Summerlin argues the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the Commonwealth did not prove malice. This argument presumes, in reliance on <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 402 S.E.2d 229 (1991), that malice is a required element of Code \u00a7 18.2-83. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In <em>Perkins, </em>we addressed, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant\u2019s claim that Code \u00a7 18.2-83 was unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not \u201crequire any criminal <em>mens rea, </em>thus punishing one who \u2018jokingly\u2019 threaten[ed] such behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 402 S.E.2d at 234. In finding the statute constitutional, we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">In <em>Maye v. Commonwealth, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">A claim that a statute on its face contains no requirement of <em>mens rea </em>or <em>scienter </em>is no ground for holding the statute unconstitutional since such requirement will be read into the statute by the court when it appears the legislature implicitly intended that it must be proved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlQ\">213 Va. 48, 49, 189 S.E.2d 350, 351 (1972). Therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-83 can be read as requiring a criminal <em>mens rea. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Such a narrowing construction of this statute prevents overbreadth. Only an individual who <em>maliciously </em>\u201cmakes and communicates ... any threat\u201d prohibited by the statute will be punished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><em>Perkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 15, 402 S.E.2d at 234 (emphasis added) (additional citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">However, in <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 321, 325-26, 523 S.E.2d 509, 511 (2000), we found that our statement in <em>Perkins </em>that \u201c[o]nly an individual who maliciously \u2018makes and communicates ... any threat\u2019 prohibited by the statute will be punished\u201d was dicta and, thus, not binding. In that case, Saunders was charged with writing and sending to another a letter that contained a threat to kill or do bodily injury to that person, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A). Relying analogously on our use of the word \u201cmaliciously\u201d in <em>Perkins, </em>Saunders contended malice was an element of Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A), a statute similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-83. Thus, he concluded, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We disagreed, noting that the language in <em>Perkins </em>relied on by Saunders was dicta and that Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A) made no mention of malice. <em>Id. </em>We were \u201cnot persuaded that this Court in <em>Perkins </em>intended to equate <em>mens rea </em>with malice, a concept clearly at odds with well-established jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 523 S.E.2d at 511. Thus, we declined the \u201cdefendant\u2019s invitation to imply both <em>mens rea and </em>malice as elements of Code \u00a7 18.2-60(A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c We may not,\u2019 \u201d we noted, \u201c \u2018add to a statute language which the legislature has chosen not to include.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>County of Amherst Bd. of Supervisors v. Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Similarly, Code \u00a7 18.2-83 makes no mention of malice. Thus, adopting the rationale we applied in <em>Saunders, </em>we conclude that malice is not an element of Code \u00a7 18.2-83. Accordingly, proof only of Summerlin\u2019s <em>mens rea, </em>or unlawful intent, was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>B. INTENT TO MAKE A THREAT</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Summerlin also argues the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the Commonwealth did not prove that he intended to make a threat. The language he used did not, he argues, constitute a true threat. His statement to Riddick that \u201che would hate to have to blow the building up to get [SRHA\u2019s] attention\u201d was nothing more, he asserts, than an expression of frustration. It did not, he claims, communicate a present intent to harm SRHA\u2019s property and no reasonable person could have believed it was an actual threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">To establish a threat to bomb under Code \u00a7 18.2-83, the Commonwealth was required to prove Summerlin made and communicated to SRHA a \u201cthreat to bomb, burn, destroy or in any manner damage any place of assembly, building or other structure.\u201d As we stated in analyzing this statute in <em>Perkins:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">A threat, in the criminal context, is recognized to be a communication avowing an intent to injure another\u2019s person or property. The communication, taken in its particular context, must reasonably cause the receiver to believe that the speaker will act according to his expression of intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABn\">12 Va.App. at 16, 402 S.E.2d at 234. We further noted in <em>Parnell </em>that a threat is \u201can avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future.\u201d 15 Va.App. at 345-46, 423 S.E.2d at 836-37. Code \u00a7 18.2-83, however, does not require the Commonwealth to prove that Summerlin intended to carry out his threat to bomb the SRHA building. Proof that he intended to make and communicate the threat and that the threat was made and communicated satisfies the statutory requirement. <em>See Parnell, </em>15 Va.App. at 346-47, 423 S.E.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u201cIntent may, and most often must, be proven by circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from proven facts are within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Fleming v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 349, 353, 412 S.E.2d 180, 183 (1991). \u201cIntent may be shown by a person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>conduct and by Ms statements.\u201d <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 198, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). Moreover, \u201c[i]n determining whether words were uttered as a threat[,] the context in which they were spoken must be considered.\u201d <em>Parnell, </em>15 Va.App. at 345, 347, 423 S.E.2d at 836-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Here, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence established that, three days after leaving a message expressing his dissatisfaction with the way he was being treated by SRHA and announcing that \u201csomething was going to happen,\u201d Summerlin called SRHA, wanting to speak with Williams. When told by Riddick that Williams was unavailable to take his call, he became angry. Yelling, Summerlin accused Riddick and all of the people at SRHA of being racists and said \u201che would hate to have to blow the building up to get [SRHA\u2019s] attention.\u201d Summerlin\u2019s comment scared Riddick. Summerlin then told Fortner in a \u201cloud and angry\u201d tone of voice that he would not be attending a particular meeting at SRHA, but, if he did, \u201cthings [would] be popping and a-rocking.\u201d Following Summerlin\u2019s call, SRHA called the fire department and evacuated the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In light of the manifest anger and hostility expressed by Summerlin toward SRHA during his exchange with Riddick and in his commumcations with McAdoo and Fortner, we conclude that the trial court, as the finder of fact, was entitled to infer from this evidence (1) that, based on the context in which it was spoken, Summerlin\u2019s remark about bombing the SRHA building constituted a communication avowing a present intent on Summerlin\u2019s part to do harm to SRHA\u2019s property, (2) that Summerlin intended to make that communication, and (3) that the staff of SRHA reasonably believed that Summerlin intended to bomb their building. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence presented was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Summerlin made and communicated to SRHA a threat to bomb a bmlding with the requisite unlawful intent to make and commumcate such a threat, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Summerlin\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\"><em>. </em>Summerlin also argues, on appeal, that McAdoo\u2019s testimony regarding the April 13, 2000 message was not relevant to his state of mind because there was no testimony regarding his tone of voice or any reference by him to contemplated illegal action. Thus, he concludes, the trial court could only improperly speculate as to what he was referring to in that message. However, because Summerlin did not raise these arguments at trial, he is barred by Rule 5A: 18 from raising them for the first time on appeal. <em>See Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998). Moreover, the record does not reflect any reason to invoke the \"good cause\u201d or \"ends of justice\u201d exceptions to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
