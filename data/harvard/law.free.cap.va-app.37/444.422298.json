Dossola violated the terms and conditions of his probation, which was granted under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">On June 10, 1999, Dossola pled guilty in the circuit court to possession of marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1. The trial judge found that the facts were sufficient to prove Dossola\u2019s guilt, granted Dossola\u2019s motion to defer further proceedings without entering a judgment, and placed him on probation pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-251. The terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>probation included a condition that Dossola be of \u201cgood behavior for a period of one ... year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On July 7, 2000, at a hearing to consider Dossola\u2019s compliance with the terms and conditions of his probation, the trial judge denied Dossola\u2019s motion to dismiss the proceedings and continued the matter for a hearing upon the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation that Dossola had violated the terms and conditions of his probation. After a hearing at which Dossola was directed to \u201cshow cause why he should not be convicted and sentenced on the original charge,\u201d the trial judge \u201cfound [Dossola] guilty of violating the conditions of his probation,\u201d entered a judgment of conviction, and sentenced him to a term in jail and to pay a f\u00edne and costs. The trial judge suspended the jail sentence upon the condition of Dossola\u2019s good behavior for a year. The record contains no transcript of that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Upon Dossola\u2019s motion, a judge suspended the judgment within twenty-one days of its entry and scheduled a hearing on Dossola\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment. At the hearing on the motion to set aside the judgment, Dossola\u2019s attorney conceded that during the period of probation Dossola had been charged with criminal trespass in Maryland. He argued, however, that Dossola had pled not guilty, that an order entered by the Maryland court granted Dossola \u201cprobation before judgment,\u201d and that these circumstances failed to prove Dossola had violated the condition of good behavior imposed by the circuit court\u2019s June 10, 1999 order. The prosecutor agreed that the sole question in the proceeding was \u201cwhether or not [Dossola\u2019s] probation [before] judgment in Maryland violates the [Code \u00a7 18.2-251] disposition\u201d of the June 10, 1999 order. The trial judge ruled that the Maryland order supported an inference that, when the Maryland judge found Dossola eligible for probation, the judge necessarily found that Dossola\u2019s conduct was sufficient to prove he committed the offense. The trial judge found that Dossola had violated the condition of good behavior and denied the motion to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Dossola contends the trial judge misread the import of the Maryland proceeding and, thus, erred in finding that he violated the condition of good behavior during the period of probation. The Commonwealth argues that the evidence supports the trial judge\u2019s conviction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The initial order granting Dossola probation in Virginia was entered pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-251. In pertinent part, that statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any offense ... relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana, or stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs ... pleads guilty to ... possession of marijuana under \u00a7 18.2-250.1, the court, upon such plea if the facts found by the court would justify a finding of guilt, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon terms and conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">&amp; <em>% </em>H\u00ed * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">Upon violation of a term or condition [of probation], the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">\u201cProbation is a disposition intended to \u2018reform\u2019 the offender, appropriate in \u2018mitigating circumstances\u2019 or to promote the \u2018public interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connelly v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 888, 890, 420 S.E.2d 244, 245 (1992) (citation omitted). The purpose of probation is to \u201crestor[e] to a useful place in society an offender who is a good social risk.\u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 357, 366, 38 S.E.2d 479, 483 (1946). In view of these principles, we have held that the probation condition of \u201c[g]ood behavior is not limited to an avoidance of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Holden v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 403, 409, 494 S.E.2d 892, 895 (1998). Thus, a conviction of a criminal offense is a sufficient but not a necessary circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>stance to prove a violation of probation. <em>See Slayton, </em>185 Va. at 366, 38 S.E.2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">At the hearing on the motion to set aside the judgment, the evidence established that a criminal complaint in Maryland alleged that Dossola committed a trespass offense on a date that occurred during the one-year probation period of the circuit court\u2019s June 10, 1999 order. Although Dossola pled not guilty to that charge, the order of the Maryland court recites that a judge heard the case and entered a verdict of \u201cprobation before judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">At the request of Dossola\u2019s attorney, the trial judge considered the effect of Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a), of the Maryland Code. In pertinent part, the statute that was in effect when the Maryland judge entered his order provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">(l)(i) 1. Whenever a person accused of a crime <em>pleads guilty </em>or <em>nolo contendere </em>or <em>is found guilty of an offense, </em>a court exercising criminal jurisdiction, if satisfied that the best interests of the person and the welfare of the people of the State would be served thereby, and with the written consent of the person <em>after determination of guilt </em>or acceptance of a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea, may stay the entering of judgment, defer further proceedings, and place the person on probation subject to reasonable terms and conditions as appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">^5 s|c sjs s|c :j:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">(5) By consenting to and receiving a stay of entering of the judgment as provided by this subsection, the person waives the right to appeal from the judgment of guilt by the court at any time. Prior to the person consenting to the stay of entering of the judgment, the court shall notify the person that by consenting to and receiving a stay of entry of judgment, the person waives the right to appeal from the judgment of guilt by the court at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a) (emphasis added) (amended 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Pursuant to the statute, when a person pleads not guilty, as Dossola did, a Maryland judge may impose the remedy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>probation before judgment only if the judge finds that person \u201cis ... guilty of an offense\u201d and the judge makes a \u201cdetermination of guilt.\u201d Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(l)(i)l. Upon her review of the statute, the trial judge determined that the Maryland judge was required to find that Dossola had committed acts sufficient to justify a conviction of criminal trespass before the judge could order probation. In the absence of contrary evidence, the trial judge did not err in concluding that the Maryland judge obeyed the law in his disposition of the case. <em>See Hinderliter v. Humphries, </em>224 Va. 439, 448, 297 S.E.2d 684, 689 (1982) (noting \u201ca presumption that public officials will obey the law\u201d in the performance of their official duties). Thus, we hold that the evidence provided an adequate basis for the trial judge to infer that the Maryland judge found Dossola had committed acts sufficient to constitute criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Dossola additionally contends that because he fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him by the Maryland judge, the Maryland statute prevents consideration of any results of proceeding under the statute. We do not read the statute so broadly. Although the statute expressly provides that \u201c[discharge of a person under this section shall be without judgment of conviction and is not a conviction for purposes of any disqualification or disability imposed by law because of conviction of crime,\u201d Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(5)(c), that limitation does not void, <em>ab initio, </em>every incidence of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The trial judge did not consider the Maryland order to be a criminal conviction or evidence of a conviction. Instead, she found that the statutory remedy of probation before judgment was only available by operation of Maryland law upon a finding by a Maryland judge that the defendant engaged in conduct that would be sufficient to support a conviction. This finding, she concluded, was sufficient to support a finding of a lack of \u201cgood behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Under Virginia law, a probation revocation for a failure of good behavior may be supported by \u201csubstantial misconduct not involving violation of law.\u201d <em>Holden, 27 </em>Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>App. at 44, 497 S.E.2d at 495. <em>See also Marshall v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 217, 221-22, 116 S.E.2d 270, 274 (1960) (noting that a defendant\u2019s conduct, as proved in the trial in which a jury acquitted the defendant, may be used to support a revocation for failure to be of good behavior). The trial judge\u2019s finding of a probation violation is \u201creversible only upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>185 Va. at 367, 38 S.E.2d at 484. We hold the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s finding that during the period of probation Dossola engaged in conduct which violated the condition of good behavior. Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in entering the judgment. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
