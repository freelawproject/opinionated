On appeal, Ange contends the trial court abused its discretion by summarily disposing of her appeals from the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of York County (juvenile court) without a hearing on the merits for failure to comply with the trial court\u2019s pretrial orders. For the reasons that follow, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The record before us includes, in lieu of a transcript, a written statement of facts, made a part of the record pursuant to Rule 5A:8(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The procedural posture of this case is not in dispute. On September 12, 2000, the juvenile court approved DSS\u2019s foster care service plan identifying a goal of permanent foster care for Ange\u2019s daughter M.R. and ordered that M.R. be placed in permanent foster care. On September 25, 2000, the juvenile court ordered that Ange\u2019s residual parental rights to three of her other minor children, G.K., S.R., and L.R. (the children), be terminated. Ange timely noted her appeal of those orders to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">On appeal to the trial court, a pretrial conference for the four cases was set for November 14, 2000, to allow the trial judge to \u201cget a feel of [the] time and direction needed for trial.\u201d At the pretrial conference, acting in its own discretion, the trial court ordered, pursuant to Rule 1:18, DSS to conduct a \u201cHome Study\u201d of Ange\u2019s home and a \u201cParental Evaluation\u201d of Ange and DSS and Ange to \u201ccomplete the \u2018Best Interest of the Child\u2019 Proffers pursuant to [Code \u00a7 20-124.3].\u201d The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>further ordered that the proffers were to be filed with the court by 8:00 a.m. on December 15, 2000, or \u201cthe presence of the parties [would] be required\u201d on that date. These directives were memorialized in a pretrial scheduling order entered by the trial court, without objection, on December 13, 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">DSS filed its \u201cBest Interest of the Child Proffers\u201d on December 14, 2000. Ange did not file her proffers by December 15, 2000, or appear in court on that date. However, a hearing attended by Ange\u2019s counsel and counsel for DSS was held on that date, and the trial court extended the deadline for filing the proffers to January 5, 2001. No order regarding the January 5, 2001 deadline was entered, but the trial court subsequently entered an order extending the deadline for filing the proffers to January 16, 2001. That order, entered on January 3, 2001, read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">On the 15th day of December, 2000, came the York/Poquoson Department of Social Services by counsel and ... counsel for Ms. Ange, to provide cause to the court as to why the \u201cBest Interest of the Child Proffers\u201d previously ordered to have been completed by Ms. Penny Ange had not yet been filed with the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">Having reviewed the issues involved in the matter, the court does Order as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">1. That the Court Order from the Pretrial Conference on November 14, 2000, be served on Ms. Penny Ange.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">2. That this Court Order be served on Ms. Penny Ange....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">3. That if Ms. Penny Ange does not comply with the provisions of the November 14, 2000, Court Order by January 16, 2001, at 8:00 a.m., this Court will dismiss Ms. Ange\u2019s Appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The orders of December 13, 2000, and January 3, 2001, were personally served on Ange on January 6, 2001. Ange appeared in court with her counsel at 8:00 a.m. on January 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>2001, and submitted her \u201cBest Interest of the Child Proffers\u201d to the trial court. Because the proffers for the four children were only \u201cpartially completed,\u201d the trial court granted a two-hour extension for filing Ange\u2019s \u201csigned, notarized and com.pleted\u201d proffers. Ange filed her completed and notarized proffers within the required time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">At the January 16, 2001 hearing, the trial court also ordered Ange to \u201creport to [DSS\u2019s] offices by noon on January 16, 2001, to begin the home study process, or her appeal [would] be dismissed.\u201d The trial court further ordered Ange to \u201ccooperate with [DSS] in completing the home study.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These directives were memorialized in an order entered January 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">By letter dated January 16, 2001, DSS informed the trial court that Ange had reported that day to its offices and had been given a \u201cHome Study packet which [was] to be completed by January 30, 2001.\u201d Ange had also been asked, according to DSS\u2019s letter, to inform DSS if her address changed and to make an appointment with DSS to discuss information pertaining to the \u201cHome Study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">By letter dated February 12, 2001, DSS advised the trial court that Ange returned the \u201cHome Study packet\u201d on January 30, 2001, noting, however, that \u201cit was only partially completed, as [Ange] did not complete the Autobiography or the authorization to release school information form.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> DSS also indicated in the letter that the information provided by Ange on the \u201cQuestionnaire\u201d form in the packet was \u201cso vague\u201d it did not, in the opinion of the DSS social worker assigned to the case, \u201caddress[ ] the matter ... before [the] Court.\u201d DSS further reported that Ange failed to respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>two letters sent by DSS on February 1, 2001, and February 5, 2001, respectively, to Ange\u2019s last known address informing her of two appointments that had been made for her to meet with the social worker assigned to her case \u201cto discuss the Home Study and schedule a home visit.\u201d According to DSS\u2019s letter to the trial court, Ange did not attend either meeting. DSS also set forth in the February 12, 2001 letter \u201cAnge\u2019s Child Protective Services history,\u201d consisting of six \u201cFounded dispositions\u201d entered against Ange between 1993 and 2001 and the removal of her children from the home in February 1999. In concluding the letter, DSS wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">At this time, it does not appear as though this agency would be able to complete a Home Study on Ms. Ange, as she is not willing to meet with [the assigned social] worker. However, this agency has not been informed of a specific date in which this Home Study is to be completed. Currently, we are under the perception that Ms. Ange has an open time frame in which to comply. Please advise us in regards to your Honor\u2019s intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Upon receipt of DSS\u2019s letter of February 12, 2001, the trial court set a \u201cfurther pretrial hearing\u201d on the \u201cmatters raised in [DSS\u2019s] letter\u201d for March 8, 2001. At that hearing, the trial court, referencing DSS\u2019s letter of February 12, 2001, found that Ange had \u201cnot substantially complied with any of\u2019 its pretrial orders concerning the preparation of the case for trial, in that she had not \u201cproperty] completed] ... the Best Interests of the Child Proffers\u201d or \u201cfull[y] cooperated] in the performance of a Home Study and a Parental Evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Based on its determination that Ange had not complied with its pretrial orders, the trial court then proceeded, at the March 8, 2001 hearing, to sanction Ange for her noncompliance by summarily resolving the four cases involving Ange\u2019s children without benefit of a hearing on the merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>court summarily found, \u201cupon the evidence,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the children and M.R. were younger than fourteen years of age and not \u201cotherwise of an age of discretion,\u201d that reasonable efforts had been made \u201cto prevent removal from the home and to reunite the children and [M.R.] with Ange,\u201d that termination of Ange\u2019s residual parental rights was \u201cin the children\u2019s best interests,\u201d and that placement in permanent foster care was in M.R.\u2019s best interests. The court further summarily found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">6. According to \u00a7 16.1-282(B) of the Virginia Code, based upon clear and convincing evidence, the neglect and/or abuse suffered by the children presents a serious and substantial threat to their life, health and/or development, and it is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the children\u2019s safe return to Ange within a reasonable period of time; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">7. According to \u00a7 16.1-283(0) of the Virginia Code, based upon clear and convincing evidence, Ange has without good cause been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months from the date the children were placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the children\u2019s foster care placements not withstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health and/or other rehabilitative agencies to such end; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Based on its factual findings, the trial court, with the concurrence of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Ange\u2019s children,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ordered that Ange\u2019s residual parental rights to the children be terminated and that DSS\u2019s foster care service plan with the goal of permanent foster care for M.R. be approved. On April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>6, 2001, the trial court entered a \u201cFinal Decree\u201d memorializing its findings and orders from the March 8, 2001 hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Ange contends the trial court erred in sanctioning her for noncompliance with its pretrial orders by summarily terminating her residual parental rights to three of her children and approving the placement in permanent foster care of another of her children without a hearing on the merits. The imposition of such a severe sanction, Ange argues, was unwarranted under the circumstances of this case and, thus, constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">DSS contends the trial court did not abuse its discretion. A trial court, DSS argues, has broad discretion in enforcing its orders and determining the appropriate sanctions for noncom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>pliance with its orders. In this case, DSS continues, the trial court, \u201c[ajfter five months of patient attempts to obtain ... Ange\u2019s compliance with its orders,\u201d acted within its discretion in punishing Ange for her noncompliance with its pretrial orders. According to DSS, \u201cAnge was not entitled to disregard the orders of the [tjrial [cjourt in preparing the case for trial and still have a full hearing on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">There is no question the trial court had the authority to sanction Ange for noncompliance with its pretrial orders. \u201cAll litigants ... are required to comply with court orders and their failure to do so subjects them to the sanction powers of the court.\u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em>257 Va. 357, 363, 513 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1999). A court\u2019s ability to punish a litigant for noncompliance with its orders is \u201cessential to the proper administration of the law, to enable courts to enforce their orders, judgments and decrees.\u201d <em>Steinberg v. Steinberg, </em>21 Va.App. 42, 46, 461 S.E.2d 421, 423 (1995). \u201cCourts often impose sanctions when a litigant ... has acted in bad faith.\u201d <em>Gentry v. Toyota Motor Corp., 252 </em>Va. 30, 34, 471 S.E.2d 485, 488 (1996). Sanctions are also \u201cused to protect courts against those who would abuse the judicial process.\u201d <em>Oxenham v. Johnson, </em>241 Va. 281, 286, 402 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1991). \u201cThe purpose of such ... sanctions] is to punish the offending party and deter others from acting similarly.\u201d <em>Gentry, 252 </em>Va. at 34, 471 S.E.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\u201c[A] court\u2019s decision of whether and how to enforce an order is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em>26 Va.App. 566, 576, 496 S.E.2d 91, 96 (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>257 Va. 357, 513 S.E.2d 391 (1999). Consequently, we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision in this case \u201cunless the court abused its discretion\u201d in summarily adjudicating Ange\u2019s appeals from the juvenile court without a hearing on the merits. <em>Gentry, 252 </em>Va. at 34, 471 S.E.2d at 488. We must be mindful, however, that, although we \u201caccord deference to the decision of the trial court,\u201d we \u201cshould not simply rubber stamp every discretionary decision of a trial court. To the contrary, we have an obligation to review the record and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>upon doing so, to reverse the judgment of the trial court if we find a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Walsh v. Bennett, </em>260 Va. 171, 175, 530 S.E.2d 904, 907 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Generally, \u201c[t]he determination whether a trial court has abused its discretion is fact-specific.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in assessing the propriety of the imposition of a particular sanction, we may also take into account the context in which the sanction was imposed and any policy considerations that might be pertinent to the imposition of that sanction. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 176, 530 S.E.2d at 907 (holding that, in addition to constituting an abuse of discretion on the facts of the case, the pretrial sanction imposed by the trial court was also inappropriate because it deprived plaintiff \u201cof his day in court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In support of its claim that the trial court based the sanction it imposed on \u201cfive months of noncompliant behavior by Ange,\u201d DSS asserts that Ange failed (1) to file her \u201cBest Interest of the Child Proffers,\u201d or, alternatively, appear in court, by 8:00 a.m. on December 15, 2000, as directed by the trial court in its order entered December 13, 2000, (2) to file her notarized and completed proffers by 8:00 a.m. on January 16, 2001, as directed by the trial court in its order entered January 3, 2001, (3) to cooperate with DSS in completing the home study, as directed by the trial court in its order entered January 22, 2001, and (4) to cooperate with DSS in completing the parental evaluation, \u201cafter repeated orders of the [tjrial [cjourt to do so.\u201d While these acts are each referenced in the record and are clearly not to be condoned if proved, we cannot say, upon a careful examination of the record, even considering the record in the light most favorable to DSS, that Ange acted in bad faith or abused the judicial process to the extent that DSS would have us believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The trial court issued its pretrial order of December 13, 2000, pursuant to Rule 1:18. It directed Ange and DSS to file \u201cBest Interests of the Child Proffers\u201d and DSS to conduct a home study and parental evaluation. The order\u2019s clear purpose was, in the language of Rule 1:18, to promote the \u201cefficient and orderly administration of justice,\u201d or, in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>words, to prepare the case in a timely fashion for trial. However, no trial date was set in that order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Likewise, no deadline was established for the home study or parental evaluation. The only time-related directive in the court\u2019s initial pretrial order required Ange and DSS to file their proffers by 8:00 a.m. on December 15, 2000. DSS met the designated deadline, but Ange did not. Nor did Ange appear in court at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">However, following a hearing attended by Ange\u2019s counsel, the trial court extended the deadline for Ange to file her proffers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court ordered Ange to file her proffers by 8:00 a.m. on January 16, 2001, and to report to DSS by noon on January 16, 2001, or her appeals from the juvenile court would be dismissed. Ange submitted her proffers to the trial court at 8:00 a.m. on January 16, 2001. Finding the proffers incomplete, the trial court gave Ange a short time extension within which to complete them. Ange completed the proffers within the designated time limit, and the trial court accepted them as complete. Ange then reported that day to DSS, where she received a home study packet. According to DSS, Ange was to complete and return the packet by January 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In its order entered January 22, 2001, the trial court also directed Ange to \u201ccooperate with [DSS] in completing the home study.\u201d That order, however, did not establish a deadline for the home study or a consequence should Ange not comply. Nor did it address the parental evaluation at all. In a letter dated February 12, 2001, DSS informed the trial court that Ange had returned only a \u201cpartially completed\u201d home study <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>packet on January 30, 2001, had provided \u201cvague\u201d information on a questionnaire in the packet, and had not responded to two letters sent by DSS telling her about appointments that had been made for her to meet with DSS personnel. As noted in DSS\u2019s letter, however, DSS was \u201cunder the perception that ... Ange ha[d] an open time frame in which to comply with the court\u2019s and DSS\u2019s directives because no deadline had been established for the home study and no trial date had been set.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">It appears, from our review of the record, that Ange made some efforts to comply with the trial court\u2019s orders and that, when given an ultimate deadline and faced with a manifest consequence for noncompliance, she complied with the trial court\u2019s orders, or at least attempted to do so. We further observe, for purposes of our present analysis, that the trial court\u2019s order requiring Ange \u201cto cooperate with [DSS] in completing the home study,\u201d without setting a deadline or establishing the extent of cooperation required to constitute compliance, put Ange, as well as DSS, in a position of not knowing what was expressly required of her and not knowing when it was required. Ange\u2019s return to DSS of even a partially completed home study packet on January 30, 2001, could reasonably be construed, on some level, as constituting \u201ccooperation\u201d in \u201ccompleting the home study.\u201d \u201cAs a general rule, \u2018before a person may be held in contempt for violating a court order, the order must be in definite terms as to the duties thereby imposed upon him and the command must be expressed rather than implied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winn v. Winn, </em>218 Va. 8, 10, 235 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1977) (quoting <em>Wood v. Goodson, </em>253 Ark. 196, 485 S.W.2d 213, 217 (1972)); <em>see also Mardula v. Mendelson, </em>34 Va.App. 120, 128, 538 S.E.2d 338, 342 (2000) (noting that, \u201cin instances where the order does not explicitly direct, mandate or prohibit specific conduct, it is insufficient to sustain a finding of contempt\u201d). Furthermore, we find no order in the record directing Ange to cooperate with DSS in the completion of the parental evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We raise these matters not to absolve Ange of her improprieties, or to suggest that courts give defiant or reluctant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>parties the benefit of the doubt before sanctioning their noncompliance or lead them by the hand through pretrial proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We intend merely to distinguish this case from those cases in which a party\u2019s noncompliance and disobedience manifest a clear and total disregard for the court\u2019s authority. Plainly, that is not the case here. Ange\u2019s noncompliance was not absolute. Her lack of compliance was not a complete failure to comply with the trial court\u2019s pretrial orders. This is not to say, however, that Ange\u2019s actions constitute \u201ccompliance\u201d or that, under these circumstances, the trial court should not have imposed any sanctions on her.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, it is to say that some of the findings by the trial court upon which the imposition of the sanction in question was based-namely, that Ange had \u201cnot substantially complied with <em>any of </em>its pretrial orders, in that she had not <em>\u201cproper[ly] completed] </em>... the Best Interests of the Child Proffers\u201d or <em>\u201cfull[y] cooperated] </em>in the performance of a Home Study <em>and a Parental Evaluation\u201d </em>(emphasis added) \u2014 are not fully supported by the record, in that they are overstated or include requirements that were not part of the court\u2019s directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Moreover, given the context in which this issue arises, we find the extreme nature of the sanction imposed on Ange especially troublesome. This case was before the trial court on Ange\u2019s appeal of the orders of the juvenile court terminating her residual parental rights to the children and ordering the placement of M.R. in permanent foster care. Finding that Ange had not complied with its pretrial orders concerning the preparation of the case for trial, the trial court sanctioned her for her noncompliance by summarily adjudicating her appeals from the juvenile court without a hearing on the merits. Thus, the court terminated Ange\u2019s residual parental rights to the children and approved the placement of M.R. in perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>nent foster care without allowing Ange to put on evidence at trial, rebut DSS\u2019s evidence, confront adverse witnesses, or present any argument in defense of DSS\u2019s foster care service plan and petition for the termination of her residual parental rights. In other words, the court\u2019s sanction did not let Ange\u2019s appeals go forward and, thus, deprived her of her day in court on the merits of the case. Such drastic measures that summarily terminate the legal process are generally not favored and are to be avoided when possible. <em>See Walsh, </em>260 Va. at 176, 530 S.E.2d at 907 (noting that the Supreme Court has \u201coften warned of the dangers of \u2018short circuiting litigation because in doing so, a trial court \u2018deprives a litigant of his day in court and deprives [the appellate courts] of an opportunity to review a [more] thoroughly developed record on appeal.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &amp; Geraldson v. Lake Fairfax Seven Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>253 Va. 93, 95, 480 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1997))); <em>see also Brown v. Black, </em>260 Va. 305, 316, 534 S.E.2d 727, 732 (2000) (Kinser, J., concurring) (noting that imposition of the \u201cmost severe sanction\u201d requires inquiry as to whether the \u201ctrial court could have furthered the [applicable] goals ... through less drastic measures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Furthermore, while it was Ange\u2019s appeals that brought this case before the trial court, it was DSS\u2019s case to prove. As we stated in <em>Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Family Servs. v. D.N., </em>29 Va.App. 400, 406, 512 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1999) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">[A]n appeal from the juvenile court must be heard <em>de novo </em>by the circuit court. Code \u00a7 16.1-136. \u201c \u2018A <em>de novo </em>hearing means a <em>trial anew, </em>with the burden of proof remaining upon the party with whom it rested in the juvenile court.\u2019 \u201d A trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court \u201cannuls the judgment of the [juvenile court] as completely as if there had been no previous trial ... and ... grants to a litigant every advantage which would have been [available to the litigant] had the case been tried originally in [the circuit] court.\u201d \u201c\u2018A court which hears a case <em>de novo, </em>which disregards the judgment of the court below, which hears evidence anew and new evidence, and which makes final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>disposition of the case, acts not as a court of appeals but as one exercising original jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Thus, the burden in this case was on DSS to prove by clear and convincing evidence that termination of Ange\u2019s residual parental rights was in the best interests of the children and that the other requisite provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) or 16.1-288(0 had been met. With regards to M.R., DSS had the burden of proving that the requisite provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-282.1 had been satisfied and that placement in permanent foster care was in her best interests. In preventing this case from going to trial, the trial court precluded DSS from presenting the full extent of its evidence in support of its petition for termination of Ange\u2019s residual parental rights to the children and its foster care service plan for M.R. The legal process, as well as the trial court\u2019s important appellate role in that process, was thus short-circuited. While the question of whether DSS ultimately met its burden of proof is not before us, we note with some skepticism that the trial court, relying, apparently, exclusively on the parties\u2019 \u201cBest Interest of the Child\u201d proffers,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> found that DSS had proved its case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We are also mindful, in a case of this type, that, \u201c[w]hen addressing matters concerning a child, including the termination of a parent\u2019s residual parental rights, the para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>mount consideration of a trial court is the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Development, </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991). \u201cIn matters of a child\u2019s welfare, trial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990). \u201cIt is clearly not in the best interests of a child to spend a lengthy period of time waiting to find out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming his [or her] responsibilities.\u201d <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 540, 394 S.E.2d 492, 495 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">On the other hand, \u201c \u2018the rights of parents may not be lightly severed but are to be respected if at all consonant with the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward v. Faw, </em>219 Va. 1120, 1124, 253 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1979) (quoting <em>Malpass v. Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 400, 192 S.E.2d 794, 799 (1972)). \u201cThe termination of parental rights is a grave, drastic, and irreversible action. When a court orders termination of parental rights, the ties between the parent and child are severed forever, and the parent becomes \u2018a legal stranger to the child.\u2019\u201d <em>Lowe v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare of City of Richmond, </em>231 Va. 277, 280, 343 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1986) (quoting <em>Shank v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>217 Va. 506, 509, 230 S.E.2d 454, 457 (1976)). Therefore, in reviewing such cases, we must have a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATqm\">respect for the natural bond between children and their natural parents. The preservation of the family, and in particular the parent-child relationship between parent and child, is an important goal for not only the parents but also government itself.... Statutes terminating the legal relationship between parent and child should be interpreted consistently with the governmental objective of preserving, when possible, the parent-child relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><em>Weaver v. Roanoke Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>220 Va. 921, 926, 265 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Thus, while the paramount concern is the best interests of Ange\u2019s children, Ange\u2019s rights must also be protected. Cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>tainly, the efficient resolution of this case is in the children\u2019s best interest, but so, too, is the preservation of the children\u2019s relationship with their mother, if that is found to be warranted. As plainly shown in the record, the trial court did not base the imposition of its sanction in this case on the best interests of Ange\u2019s children. Rather, it was imposed strictly to punish Ange for failing to comply with the court\u2019s pretrial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Thus, given the nature of this case, the severity of the sanction imposed, Ange\u2019s partial compliance with the trial court\u2019s orders, and the need to protect Ange\u2019s rights, we conclude that, in summarily disposing of Ange\u2019s appeals from the juvenile court without a hearing on the merits based on Ange\u2019s noncompliance with the trial court\u2019s pretrial orders, the trial court clearly abused its discretion. Less drastic sanctions would have served the same purpose of punishing Ange for her noncompliance, without short-circuiting these significant legal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-12\">. This order did not establish a trial date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\">. In making this directive, unlike the one requiring Ange to \u201creport to [DSS\u2019s] offices by noon on January 16, 2001, to begin the home study process,\u201d the trial court did not designate a deadline or a sanction for noncompliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">. The record fails to reveal whether the trial court had the referenced \"Home Study packet\u201d before it during these proceedings. Regardless, it was not made a part of the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. The record does not disclose whether the trial court imposed this sanction <em>sua sponte </em>or on DSS\u2019s motion. Nor does the record identify the source of the court\u2019s authority to impose the sanction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">. Neither the written statement of facts nor the trial court\u2019s \"Final Decree\u201d identifies the evidence upon which the trial court relied to make its findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\">. On appeal, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>did not file a brief or appear for argument on behalf of the children and M.R. in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\">. The written statement of facts in the record indicates that the trial court \"dismissed\u201d Ange's appeals from the juvenile court and \"affirmed\u201d the juvenile court\u2019s orders at the March 8, 2001 hearing. However, in light of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and orders set forth in the \"Final Decree\u201d \u2014 as recited hereinabove-and the absence of any language in that decree regarding dismissal of the subject cases or affirmance of the juvenile court\u2019s orders, we conclude that Ange\u2019s appeals were summarily adjudicated by the trial court without a hearing on the merits, rather than dismissed. <em>See Waterfront Marine Constr., Inc. v. North End 49ers Sandbridge Bulkhead Groups A, B and C, </em>251 Va. 417, 427 n. 2, 468 S.E.2d 894, 900 n. 2 (1996) (holding that \"a court speaks through its orders\u201d and that, when a court's orders conflict with its statements made at a hearing or its letter opinions, \"we presume that the orders accurately reflect what transpired\u201d) (citing <em>Stamper v.

Because Ange raises, on appeal, only the issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion, \"we limit our review to that issue, and we do not express any opinion on other potential issues.\u201d <em>Dammerau v.

Indeed, no trial date was ever set in this case, despite Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 296(E), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">Where an appeal is taken in a case involving termination of parental rights brought under \u00a7 16.1-283, the circuit court shall hold a hearing on the merits of the case within ninety days of the perfecting of the appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\">. Although the record does not disclose the court\u2019s reason for granting Ange that extension, we presume the court had a valid reason for doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\">. To rule thus would not only condone the type of behavior sanctions are intended to deter, it would also greatly dishonor those who properly and respectably comply with the orders of courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">. Indeed, Ange herself concedes, on appeal, that some less severe sanction might have been appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">. DSS argues that the trial court also had the recommendations of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>and Ange\u2019s Child Protective Services history before it for consideration in making its findings. Notwithstanding the fact that neither of those items was ever received into evidence by the trial court, the record is devoid of any indication that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>presented testimony, a report, or recommendations to the trial court, other than that he concurred in the court\u2019s ultimate rulings in the case. Likewise, the record does not show that Ange's Child Protective Services history, which was related to the trial court in DSS\u2019s letter of February 12, 2001, was presented to the court under oath.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. Because Ange did not challenge the propriety of this finding or the trial court\u2019s apparent reliance solely on the parties\u2019 written proffers in terminating Ange's residual parental rights, we do not address the issue further, except to note that the \u201cBest Interest of the Child\u201d proffers <em>submitted by the </em>parties were clearly intended to assist the trial court and parties prepare for a trial <em>de novo </em>on the merits, not to serve as the entire evidentiary basis for the court\u2019s findings and orders in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b674-8\">AGEE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADx\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">I agree with the majority that the decision of the trial court to summarily terminate Ange\u2019s residual parental rights to three of her four children and to place the fourth child in permanent foster care was erroneous and requires reversal. While I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to reverse and remand, I do not agree with describing the trial court\u2019s decision to proceed summarily as \u201ca sanction\u201d imposed against Ange for an alleged failure to comply with its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">A sanction is a discretionary measure employed by a trial court to coerce a party to comply with a discovery order or to punish a party for abusing the judicial system. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 (trial court shall impose an appropriate sanction against a party and/or counsel whose pleading, motion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>other paper is signed or made without being \u201cwell grounded in fact\u201d and \u201cwarranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law\u201d); Rule 4:12 (trial court has broad discretion to sanction a party for failing to comply with discovery orders). Ange never argued that the trial court proceeded summarily as a sanction. The record before us does not indicate that the decision to proceed summarily was rendered as a form of sanction in the ordinary sense of our jurisprudence, a measure used \u201cto protect [the trial court] against those who would abuse the judicial process.\u201d <em>Oxenham v. Johnson, </em>241 Va. 281, 286, 402 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">I do not conclude from the facts before us in the record that the trial court elected to proceed summarily to either punish Ange or to coerce her into complying with its orders. The facts reflect the trial court simply erred procedurally, believing it could rule on the DSS petitions summarily, and not as a sanction against Ange.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
