Lanning (claimant) filed a claim for benefits with the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) alleging an injury by accident and development of the occupational disease of carpal tunnel syndrome while working for the Virginia Department of Transportation (employer). The deputy commissioner found a compensable ordinary disease of life, but did not award any lost time or benefits. The full commission reversed the deputy commissioner, finding claimant failed to meet her burden to prove that her carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by her work. For the reasons stated, we reverse the commission and remand for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AyIR\">The evidence is not controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Claimant alleges both an injury by accident on February 25, 2000, and the occupational disease of carpal tunnel syndrome. Claimant began working for employer in 1982 as a toll collector. In 1994, she was transferred to a clerical position, which involved data entry, purchase orders, inventory, and requisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>tions. She testified that on February 25, 2000, she was using her right hand to make her daily time entries when her hand \u201cwouldn\u2019t work.\u201d She could not move her fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Claimant testified she began to feel \u201ctwinging and tingling\u201d in her right wrist six months prior to the February 25, 2000 incident, but did not seek medical attention until after that incident. While claimant has a home computer, she \u201cvery seldom\u201d used it. She further testified her only activity at home involving repetitive movement was light housework. She did not knit, garden, or work with hand tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">On March 3, 2000, claimant saw Dr. Frank G. Burns, Jr., her primary treating physician. Dr. Donald E. LaMarche, Jr., performed an eleetrodiagnostic study on March 17, 2000, and diagnosed right-side carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Burns performed a carpal tunnel release on the right arm on April 11, 2000. Due to complications, claimant underwent another carpal tunnel release on August 25, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Dr. Burns first saw claimant in 1993, after she sustained a severe injury to her left arm and hand while working at the toll booth. Dr. Burns performed surgery on her left shoulder. However, for a while after the surgery, claimant was unable to use her left arm at all, and she began having symptoms of right hand carpal tunnel syndrome. She had several \u201cflareups\u201d during subsequent years. In 1999 and 2000, her right hand symptoms became much more severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In his letter dated January 18, 2001, Dr. Burns indicated claimant\u2019s \u201cpain is related to her on the job injury and the recurrences that she has had is related [sic] back to her original injuries and having to use the right arm more.\u201d Other than this letter, no evidence directly addressed causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The deputy commissioner found claimant had met her burden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">All of the claimant\u2019s doctors agree that the claimant suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome and Dr. Burns causally related it to her work. It is clear to the Commission that the claimant had no significant exposure to the hazards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>carpal tunnel syndrome outside of the work place and that her job entailed numerous repetitive activities exposing her to the danger. Outside the workplace, she performs no unusual activities and is not involved in extensive sports or recreational activities that could cause the problem. Based upon the persuasive and uncontradicted evidence, we find that she has met her burden of proving that her carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by her employment, and she has established all elements required by [Code] \u00a7 65.2-401 by clear and convincing evidence, not a mere probability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEP\">The deputy commissioner further found, however, that claimant\u2019s medical records did \u201cnot support any period of disability.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">The full commission reversed the deputy\u2019s award, finding: although Dr. Bums has stated that her carpal tunnel syndrome is <em>related </em>to her work, this is insufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that her work <em>caused </em>her carpal tunnel syndrome. In prior cases, we have held that a medical opinion that a condition is \u201ccompatible\u201d or \u201crelated\u201d to work is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">(Emphasis in original.) The commission did not determine if any period of disability existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">I. Evidence of Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">On appeal, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). The commission\u2019s finding of fact on the issue of causation will be upheld if supported by credible evidence. <em>See James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989); <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Musick, </em>7 Va.App. 684, 688, 376 S.E.2d 814, 817 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2^00(C) provides \u201cthe condition^] of carpal tunnel syndrome are not occupational diseases but are ordinary diseases of life as defined in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-401.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-401 provides that the elements required to prove a compensable ordinary disease of life must be \u201cestablished by clear and convincing evidence, (not a mere probability).\u201d The narrow issue before this Court, therefore, is whether claimant proved by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that her carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by her employment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">For an ordinary disease of life to be compensable, a claimant must prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence, (not mere probability)\u201d that the disease (1) arose out of and in the course of his employment, (2) did not result from causes outside of the employment, and (3) follows as an incident of an occupational disease, is an infectious or contagious disease contracted in the course of the employment listed in Code \u00a7 65.2-401(2)(b), or is characteristic of the employment and was caused by conditions peculiar to the employment. Code \u00a7 65.2-401; <em>see also Lindenfeld v. City of Richmond Sheriff\u2019s Office, 25 </em>Va.App. 775, 784, 492 S.E.2d 506, 510 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"><em>Great E. Resort Corp. v. Gordon, </em>31 Va.App. 608, 612, 525 S.E.2d 55, 57 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We have defined \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u201cthat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and <em>unequivocal.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><em>National Fruit Prod. Co. v. Staton, </em>28 Va.App. 650, 654, 507 S.E.2d 667, 669 (1998) (quoting Fred <em>C. Walker Agency, Inc. v. Lucas, </em>215 Va. 535, 540-41, 211 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1975)) (emphasis in original), <em>aff'd, </em>259 Va. 271, 526 S.E.2d 266 (2000) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Claimant contends the treating physician\u2019s opinion that her pain is \u201crelated\u201d to her work was sufficient to prove causation between the disease and the workplace. Employer contends the word, \u201crelated,\u201d is not proof of causation by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d The commission agreed with employer, finding that simply \u201crelating\u201d carpal tunnel syndrome to work conditions was insufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that claimant\u2019s work caused her disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Dr. Bums traced his treatment of claimant to March 31, 1993, for an injury to her left arm and shoulder \u201cwhen somebody at the toll booth grabbed her arm and about pulled her out of the toll booth.\u201d Because of the injury and resulting surgery to her left shoulder, Dr. Burns indicated claimant \u201cstarted having symptoms of right carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d This condition began in May 1994, when claimant had to use her right arm more frequently. Dr. Burns related that claimant had \u201cflare ups of this off and on over the years and it became much more severe in 1999, and in 2000.\u201d He opined that this injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">goes all the way back to her original injury[. W]e have put a lot of stress and strain on her right arm and over the years she has developed carpal tunnel syndrome, which has become worse with the type of computer work she is now doing. I think her pain is related to her on the job injury and the recurrences that she had is related [sic] back to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>original injuries and having to use the right arm more, and also the work she is doing now, using the computer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The commission focused solely on Dr. Burns\u2019 use of the word, \u201crelated,\u201d without considering the totality of his medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We agree with the commission that a bare assertion that a condition is \u201cwork-related\u201d does not meet the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. The fact that a condition is \u201crelated to\u201d the workplace is not proof by itself of causation. However, the evidence here includes more than a bald assertion of a relationship between claimant\u2019s work and carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">While he employed the words, \u201crelated\u201d and \u201crelated back,\u201d Dr. Burns explained he believed claimant\u2019s present problem with carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by her original injury at the toll booth. The \u201cinjury\u201d became worse due to her constant use of the computer in her new position. He did not merely assert that the injury was related to her job; he explained how her prior and present work conditions resulted in the injury. Additionally, no evidence proved claimant had carpal tunnel syndrome or experienced symptoms related to that condition prior to her work for employer, and the evidence proved no causes outside her employment contributed to that condition. In this context, Dr. Burns\u2019 opinion could be considered clear and convincing evidence that claimant\u2019s condition was caused by her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">\u201cWe will not substitute form over substance by requiring a physician to use magic words ... when the record is void of any evidence of non-employment factors responsible for [the condition].\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 11-12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988). As Commissioner Diamond said in the dissent, \u201c[t]he Commission should not require the use of talismanic words to find causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">We are cognizant of the standard of review. However, the commission did not properly evaluate the evidence in this case. Bather than viewing Dr. Burns\u2019 medical opinion in its entirety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the commission addressed only his use of the word, \u201crelated,\u201d in its decision. We cannot affirm a decision that emphasizes the use of one word to the exclusion of considerations of the context within which the word is used and other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">II. Period of Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We now turn to the question of whether claimant is entitled to disability from April 11, 2000, the date of surgery, until October 2, 2000, the date when claimant returned to work. The\u2019deputy commissioner found the medical records do not support any period of disability. The commission did not consider disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In order for us to review a decision of the commission, the commission must make a finding, even if the deputy commissioner previously made a factual ruling. <em>See Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>5 Va.App. 374, 377, 363 S.E.2d 433, 434 (1987). As the commission did not address claimant\u2019s appeal of the deputy\u2019s finding that the evidence showed no period of disability, we must remand this issue for further findings by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the commission\u2019s opinion and remand for the commission to determine if the entirety of the medical evidence is sufficient to show causation. The commission also must make a finding regarding the period of disability, if causation is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-10\">.
