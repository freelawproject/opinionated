Morgan Cherry <em>&amp; </em>Associates, Ltd. (MMCA), appeals the award of a judgment against it in the amount of $9,900. The judgment stemmed from an alleged violation of a court order, issued pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.1, directing MMCA to withhold and pay out of the disposable income of M. Morgan Cherry, an employee and shareholder of MMCA, a deducted amount for spousal support due the appellee, Natalie W. Cherry. The trial court found that MMCA had violated the income deduction order and entered judgment against it. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Under familiar principles, we state the evidence in the light most favorable to Ms. Cherry, the party prevailing below. <em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>80 Va.App. 341, 349, 516 S.E.2d 726, 730 (1999). MMCA is a Virginia corporation that provides private investigation services. Mr. Cherry owns 60% of the outstanding stock of MMCA. MMCA\u2019s other two shareholders, Robert M. Puglisi and Thomas G. Byrne, each own 20% of the stock. Puglisi and Byrne are not related to Mr. Cherry.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Ms. Cherry filed her bill of complaint for divorce against Mr. Cherry on January 31, 2000. The parties entered into a Consent <em>Pendente Lite </em>Support Order on May 8, 2000, which provided that Mr. Cherry would pay Ms. Cherry $3,300 per month in spousal support. Mr. Cherry ceased making spousal support payments in July 2000. On July 17, 2000, Mr. Cherry instructed MMCA to stop paying him a salary and they complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>On August 28, 2000, at Ms. Cherry\u2019s request, the court issued an income deduction order pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.1. The income deduction order identified MMCA as the \u201cemployer\u201d and required MMCA to withhold and pay out of the disposable income of Mr. Cherry a deducted amount for spousal support for Ms. Cherry. It also provided that MMCA \u201cshall be liable for payments which [it] fails to withhold or mail as specified in the Order.\u201d The amount of the deduction was set at $3,300 per month, subject to a limitation based on Mr. Cherry\u2019s disposable income. Thus, depending upon the amount of disposable income it paid to Mr. Cherry, MMCA would be obligated to make payments of up to $3,300 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On September 22, 2000, Ms. Cherry filed a motion for satisfaction of judgment by defendant\u2019s interest in his corporate entities. By that motion, Ms. Cherry asked the court to require MMCA to directly satisfy, in whole or in part, judgments and other obligations of Mr. Cherry in the case. The court denied the motion without prejudice, holding that it could not be heard on an abbreviated motions day.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Ms. Cherry proceeded to an equitable distribution hearing before the trial court on October 31, 2000. MMCA filed a motion to intervene to protect itself against discovery requests served by Ms. Cherry. It claimed that Ms. Cherry sought privileged and confidential information relating to the company. The trial court denied the motion, and MMCA did not participate in the hearing. As part of the equitable distribution hearing, Ms. Cherry again asked that the court require MMCA to pay judgments entered against Mr. Cherry. The court again denied the request without prejudice, holding that Ms. Cherry had to file a separate lawsuit to pursue the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">At the hearing, the trial court also <em>sua sponte </em>issued a rule to show cause why MMCA should not be held in contempt for its failure to comply with the income deduction order. The trial court set a return date of November 3, 2000 for the rule to show cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The trial court conducted the show cause hearing on November 3 and November 17. The evidence proved that Mr. Cherry had instructed MMCA to stop paying a salary to him on July 17, 2000 and that MMCA complied, but that Mr. Cherry continued as an employee of MMCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Ms. Cherry contended that MMCA had a continuing liability to Mr. Cherry. She relied, in part, on the testimony of Puglisi, MMCA\u2019s sole witness. Puglisi acknowledged that MMCA had approved the response to the income deduction order filed on September 1, 2000, which stated that \u201cMr. Cherry instructed [MMCA] not to make any further payments of salary or any other amounts to him. Mr. Cherry is still an employee of [MMCA].\u201d Further, Puglisi testified that Mr. Cherry is co-founder and majority shareholder of the company, that some clients choose MMCA based on Mr. Cherry\u2019s reputation, that Mr. Cherry may have clients that he solicits, and that he has marketing responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Counsel for Ms. Cherry indicated three times throughout the show cause proceeding that she was basing her argument, in part, on the testimony of Ms. Cherry from the equitable distribution hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No transcript of evidence from the equitable distribution hearing was introduced, however. MMCA did not object to the references by counsel and did not produce the evidence referred to by Ms. Cherry\u2019s counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Ostensibly treating the referenced evidence from the prior hearing as before her, the trial court judge specifically stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>that, in entering judgment against MMCA, she was relying upon it, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the evidence regarding \u201cthe nature of [MMCA\u2019s] business, the kind of work that it does, its ownership, its structure, and ... the way Mr. Cherry operates with respect to his multiple identities, passports, et. cetera.\u201d MMCA failed to object, on due process or other grounds, to the court\u2019s consideration of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The trial judge concluded that \u201cMMCA continues to be liable to Max Cherry for his salary whether MMCA is paying it or not ... and inasmuch as it\u2019s an obligation that MMCA owes to Mr. Cherry, it\u2019s an obligation that MMCA under this Court\u2019s income deduction order owes to Ms. Cherry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The trial judge did not find MMCA in contempt, but entered judgment against MMCA for $9,900, representing the amount the court deemed due from MMCA to Ms. Cherry under the income deduction order for the months of September, October, and November 2000. MMCA objected to the amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Thereafter, the trial court refused to allow MMCA to post a supersedeas bond. We reversed that ruling on December 22, 2000, and an appropriate supersedeas bond was set and posted by MMCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">MMCA now appeals the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\n<em>Threshold Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Although Ms. Cherry presented three threshold issues for our consideration, one of them is moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We address the remaining issues. First, Ms. Cherry maintains that we lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction to hear MMCA\u2019s claims. We disagree. We find that we have jurisdiction pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-405, which states, \u201cAny aggrieved party may appeal to the Court of Appeals from ... [a]ny ... domestic relations matter arising under Title 16.1 or Title 20.\u201d The court issued the income deduction order pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.1. Therefore, this appeal involves a domestic relations matter arising under Title 20 and comes within our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Second, Ms. Cherry contends that, to the extent MMCA attempts to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to intervene in the divorce case, the appeal is untimely. We need not address this issue because we find MMCA did not appeal the denial of its motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">MMCA couches the question as one involving a violation of its due process rights, stating, \u201cMMCA\u2019s rights were violated in that it was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the evidence received against it [in the equitable distribution hearing].\u201d However, MMCA moved to intervene for the limited purpose of defending itself against certain discovery requests by Ms. Cherry in the divorce proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It did not seek to intervene in the evidentiary hearing on equitable distribution. Thus, had the court granted MMCA\u2019s motion to intervene in the divorce proceeding, its participation would have been limited to discovery issues, i.e. the relief requested in its motion. <em>See Johnson v. Buzzard Island Shooting Club, Inc., </em>232 Va. 32, 37, 348 S.E.2d 220, 223 (1986) (holding that trial court may not grant relief to a party inconsistent with the case alleged in the party\u2019s pleading); <em>cf. </em>Rule 2:15 (referring to one who intervenes as a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceeding and motions to intervene as a \u201cpleading\u201d to intervene and providing that motions to intervene are governed by the Rules applicable to all pleadings); <em>see also United States v. AT &amp; T, </em>642 F.2d 1285, 1295 (D.C.Cir.1980) (permitting MCI to intervene for the limited purpose of appealing discovery order, as requested in motion to intervene); <em>Sackman v. Liggett Group, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>167 F.R.D. 6, 23 (E.D.N.Y.1996) (limiting intervention to issue of whether certain documents are discoverable, as requested in motion to intervene); <em>Rosado v. Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>60 Conn.App. 134, 758 A.2d 916, 927 (2000) (granting \u201cintervention for the unique purpose of contesting the disclosure of private, confidential files and issues relating to this interest,\u201d as requested in motion to intervene). It would not have had the opportunity to cross-examine evidence tending to prove that it owed a debt to Mr. Cherry. Thus, MMCA waived any due process right to cross-examine the evidence at the equitable distribution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In short, because MMCA never sought to intervene in the evidentiary hearing, its due process argument that it was deprived of its right to cross-examine evidence does not raise the denial of its motion to intervene on appeal and the issue is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>MMCA\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">MMCA contends on appeal that: (1) the trial court improperly considered evidence from an earlier proceeding; (2) the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the trial court\u2019s finding that MMCA owed a debt to Mr. Cherry; (3) the trial court violated MMCA\u2019s right to due process of law; and (4) the trial court lacked authority to enter judgment on a rule to show cause. We consider appellant\u2019s allegations <em>seriatim </em>and find each to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\n<em>A. Consideration of Evidence from Previous Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">MMCA alleges for the first time on appeal that the trial court improperly relied on evidence from the equitable distribution hearing in reaching its decision to enter judgment against MMCA. We find this claim procedurally barred. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18 (\u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>to attain the ends of justice\u201d); <em>see also Hansel v. Commonwealth, </em>118 Va. 803, 808, 88 S.E. 166, 167 (1916) (declining to reach the merits of defendant\u2019s objection, not preserved below, to the reading into evidence of the stenographer\u2019s report from defendant\u2019s civil case at his criminal trial); <em>cf. Hess v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 738, 739-44, 441 S.E.2d 29, 30-33 (1994) (considering the merits of appellant\u2019s assignment of error that trial judge based his finding on evidence from an earlier proceeding, where defense counsel specifically objected to the consideration of the evidence before the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">MMCA did not object on due process or other grounds to the trial judge\u2019s consideration of the evidence when Ms. Cherry directed the judge to testimony from the earlier hearing or when the trial judge stated she took it into account. Nor did MMCA properly raise the objection in closing by stating that \u201con the evidence that\u2019s before Your Honor here today, the rule to show cause should be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">While a closing argument may satisfy the contemporaneous objection rule, not all references are sufficient.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">If a closing argument adequately advises the trial court of the defendant\u2019s position and if it is clear that the trial court considered the issue and had an opportunity to take corrective action, the contemporaneous objection rule is satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\"><em>Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 225, 228, 416 S.E.2d 25, 27 (1992) (citing <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 478, 405 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1991) <em>(en banc)). </em>In the present case, MMCA\u2019s closing statement failed to alert the judge to its claim that she erroneously considered evidence from an earlier proceeding. Indeed, its reference to the evidence \u201cbefore [her] Honor\u201d necessarily encompassed the evidence from the earlier hearing, as no objection to its consideration had been raised. Therefore, the court never \u201cconsidered the issue\u201d or \u201chad an opportunity to take corrective action,\u201d as required by our decision in <em>Fortune. </em>14 Va.App. at 228, 416 S.E.2d at 27. As such, counsel\u2019s closing argument failed to satisfy the contemporaneous objection rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Finally, we find that MMCA\u2019s failure to object does not fit within either the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions to the rule. The \u201cgood cause\u201d exception relates to the reasons an objection was not stated at the time of the ruling, <em>F.E. v. G.F.M., </em>35 Va.App. 648, 659, 547 S.E.2d 531, 536 (2001) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted), and is thereby analogous to the grounds underlying the absence of an \u201copportunity to object\u201d exception to the contemporaneous objection requirement. <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 988, 996, 421 S.E.2d 652, 656 (1992) <em>(en banc) </em>(Barrow, J., concurring); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A) (\u201c[I]f a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection shall not thereafter prejudice him on motion for a new trial or appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Our reasoning in <em>Luck v. Commonwealth </em>guides our determination of the absence of \u201cgood cause\u201d in the present case. 32 Va.App. 827, 531 S.E.2d 41 (2000). In sentencing the defendant, the trial judge considered a letter written to the court from the defendant\u2019s aunt. <em>Id. </em>at 834, 531 S.E.2d at 44. Although defense counsel was unaware of the letter until the trial judge noted that he had already considered it, we held that the claim was not preserved because he did not request an opportunity to review the letter or make any response to its contents upon learning of the letter. We concluded that despite this late knowledge, \u201cthe defendant had the opportunity to object but elected not to do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">MMCA had greater opportunity than Luck to make its objection. As in <em>Luck, </em>the trial judge in this case made it clear she had considered evidence from the equitable distribution hearing before she finalized her ruling. She described the evidence from the equitable distribution hearing she considered, then asked the plaintiffs counsel to prepare a judgment order in her favor. Defense counsel asked to address the court before the order was entered, and the court permitted him the opportunity. MMCA took that opportunity to object only to the amount of the judgment and declined to mention its claim that the judge improperly considered certain evidence. Hence, \u201cthe defendant had the opportunity to ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ject [to the court\u2019s consideration of the evidence from the earlier proceeding,] but elected not to do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Furthermore, before the trial judge notified MMCA\u2019s counsel that she had considered the evidence, opposing counsel made three references to it in support of her argument. At the first session of the show cause hearing, Ms. Cherry\u2019s counsel made two references to testimony from the equitable distribution proceeding. Two weeks later, at the second session, counsel again referred to the evidence developed at the equitable distribution hearing. MMCA, therefore, had several opportunities to object to consideration of and reliance upon the evidence both by counsel and the court. Accordingly, we find no \u201cgood cause\u201d for MMCA\u2019s failure to raise the issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We also find that the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception does not require us to consider MMCA\u2019s claim that the trial judge improperly considered evidence from the equitable distribution proceeding. The \u201cends of justice\u201d exception \u201cis narrow and is to be used sparingly.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 11 (1989). Indeed, \u201cit is a rare case in which, rather than invoke Rule [5A:18], we rely upon the exception and consider an assignment of error not preserved at trial.\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 249, 402 S.E.2d 678, 680 (1991). \u201cIn order to avail oneself of the exception, a defendant must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u201d <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (citing <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987)); <em>see Herring v. Herring, </em>33 Va.App. 281, 287, 532 S.E.2d 923, 926 (2000) (noting that only \u201cclear, substantial and material\u201d errors require the application of the ends of justice exception (citations omitted)); <em>Brown, </em>8 Va.App. at 131, 380 S.E.2d at 10 (finding that the exception generally requires a determination that \u201cthe error clearly had an effect upon the outcome of the case\u201d). These principles govern our application of the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception in all claims on appeal, including those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>based on due process grounds. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 503, 520-21, 513 S.E.2d 431, 440 (1999) (declining to invoke the exception where appellant did not present his claim that due process required the withdrawal of his guilty pleas to the trial court); <em>Tickel v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 558, 563, 400 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1991) (finding that the ends of justice did not require consideration of whether prosecutor\u2019s conduct violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights); <em>see also Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 405, 411 n. 4, 527 S.E.2d 415, 419 n. 4 (2000) (finding defendant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to notify juvenile\u2019s biological father of initiation of juvenile court proceedings denied him due process barred by Rule 5:25); <em>Overhead Door Co. of Norfolk and Hartford Ins. Co. v. Lewis, </em>29 Va.App. 52, 61-62, 509 S.E.2d 535, 539-40 (1999) (finding employer\u2019s due process objection to inclusion of a commissioner in the resolution of workers\u2019 compensation matter who did not hear oral argument barred by Rule 5A:18).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">MMCA has not affirmatively demonstrated that the trial judge\u2019s consideration of the evidence from the equitable distribution hearing \u201cclearly had an effect upon the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>8 Va.App. at 131, 380 S.E.2d at 10. Because it failed to produce on appeal the evidence it claimed the judge erroneously considered, we cannot perform the necessary calculus to determine whether the error was clear, substantial and material. <em>See Jenkins v. Winchester Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>12 Va.App. 1178, 1185, 409 S.E.2d 16, 20 (1991) (holding that appellant\u2019s burden includes providing \u201ca record which [sic] substantiates the claim of error\u201d). While MMCA makes general reference to the type of evidence it contends the trial court improperly considered,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> without the specific testimony before us, we can only speculate as to whether, and to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>extent, the trial judge\u2019s consideration of the evidence from the equitable distribution hearing, viewed together with the evidence presented at the show cause hearing, affected her ruling. The inadequacy of MMCA\u2019s reliance on general references is underscored by the fact that the unchallenged evidence from the show cause hearing tends to support the court\u2019s ruling, suggesting that the challenged evidence was not material.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, given the record before us, we presume the trial court to be correct. <em>See Lawrence v. Nelson, </em>200 Va. 597, 599, 106 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1959) (holding that where appellant has not made the evidence on which a decree is based part of the record on appeal, it is impossible to pass on certain issues and the decision of the trial court is presumed to be correct).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Because MMCA failed, without good cause, to object to the court\u2019s use of evidence from the prior proceeding and has not proven that a manifest injustice resulted, we will not consider the merits of this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\n<em>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">MMCA also contends that the trial court erred in its finding that MMCA owed a debt to Mr. Cherry. Our standard of review requires that we presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct, <em>Broom v. Broom, </em>15 Va.App. 497, 504, 425 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1992), and that we sustain its finding unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Dodge v. Dodge, </em>2 Va.App. 238, 242, 343 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1986). MMCA bears the burden of proving that the evidence did not justify the conclusion that MMCA owed a debt to Mr. Cherry. <em>See Carter v. Thornhill, </em>19 Va.App. 501, 509, 453 S.E.2d 295, 300 (1995). MMCA\u2019s burden includes presentation of a record that demonstrates that the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous or unsupported by the record. <em>Justis v. Young, </em>202 Va. 631, 632, 119 S.E.2d 255, 256-57 (1961); <em>Jenkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 1185, 409 S.E.2d at 20; <em>Steinberg v. Steinberg, </em>11 Va.App. 323, 326, 398 S.E.2d 507, 508 (1990); <em>Kaufman v. Kaufman, </em>7 Va.App. 488, 499, 375 S.E.2d 374, 380 (1988). \u201cIf the appellant fails to do this, the judgment will be affirmed.\u201d <em>Justis, </em>202 Va. at 632, 119 S.E.2d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The appellant must present to the appellate court <em>all </em>the evidence considered by the trial judge, including evidence that may have been considered improperly but without objection. The Supreme Court has mandated that we consider such evidence, regardless of our opinion of its trustworthiness, as properly before the trial court in our review of the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 522, 499 S.E.2d 263, 266 (1998) (\u201cSince the handwritten notation on the discharge summary was received without objection as evidence in the case, the Court of Appeals erred in disregarding that portion of the exhibit in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d). Therefore, in reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>sufficiency of the evidence in this case, we must take into account the evidence from the equitable distribution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">As noted earlier, MMCA has not met its burden of producing the challenged evidence for our review on appeal. Without reviewing that evidence, we cannot say that the evidence before the trial judge\" was insufficient as a matter of law to support her finding. Therefore, we affirm her decision on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>C. Due </em>Process<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">MMCA\u2019s claim that the trial court violated its due process rights because it lacked reasonable notice that its financial interests were at stake at the show cause hearing is without merit. The trial court notified MMCA that it could issue a money judgment against it twice. First, the trial court issued an income deduction order, which, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79.3(A)(ll), specifically provided that MMCA \u201cshall be liable for payments which [it] fails to withhold or mail.\u201d Second, we have previously held that a trial court may issue a money judgment on a rule to show cause. <em>See Shoup v. Shoup, </em>31 Va.App. 621, 627-28, 525 S.E.2d 61, 64-65 (2000) (rejecting wife\u2019s contention that trial court lacked authority to order wife to pay husband $46,154 plus interest, at a hearing on a rule to show case why she should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the parties\u2019 agreement, where she was not found in contempt). MMCA was properly served with the rule to show cause and was chargeable with the knowledge that under Virginia law its financial interests were at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Likewise, we find no merit in its contention that the trial court, at the show cause hearing, improperly denied its right to a jury trial and its right to cross-examine evidence against it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is uncontested that MMCA participated as a party in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the show cause hearing. At no time during the hearing did MMCA request, or make an effort to implement its rights to cross-examination or demand a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\n<em>D. Entry of Judgment on Rule to Show Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">MMCA also argues, for the first time in its reply brief, that the trial court had no legal basis to enter judgment against it to enforce the terms of the income deduction order in the context of a contempt hearing on the rule to show cause. Because this issue was not presented below,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we do not consider it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">. First, on November 3, she noted Ms. Cherry\u2019s testimony that she had not received support from either Mr. Cherry or MMCA since June 2000. Again on that date, counsel referred to Ms. Cherry's testimony regarding the methods by which Mr. Cherry generates profits for MMCA: \"[Mr. Cherry] goes around the United States and the world and he gets business and then he has his network of subcontractors do the business. They don\u2019t need billing from Mr. Cherry.\u201d She also stated that MMCA did not controvert Ms. Cherry\u2019s testimony. Finally, at the second session of the hearing on November 17, Ms. Cherry's counsel reminded the court that Ms. Cherry had testified at the equitable distribution hearing that Mr. Cherry controlled MMCA. Ms. Cherry did not testify at the show cause hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\">. Our order dated December 22, 2000 mooted MMCA\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s December 1, 2000 order denying a supersedeas bond. We suspended execution of the judgment, and a bond was issued pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\">. In its discretion, the trial court denied MMCA\u2019s motion to intervene because, <em>inter alia, </em>none of the discovery was directed to MMCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">. MMCA included opposing counsel\u2019s references to Ms. Cherry\u2019s testimony from the previous hearing that she had not received support from either Mr. Cherry or MMCA since June 2000, that Mr. Cherry solicits business for MMCA around the world, and that he controls MMCA, as well as the court\u2019s statement that, in making her ruling, she \"also considered the evidence received during the equitable distribution case about MMCA\u201d and \"also rel[ied] upon the evidence that [she] heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>during the equitable distribution case regarding ... Mr. Cherry.\u201d We find that \"also considering and relying\u201d upon evidence falls short of proving that the improper admission of evidence, in fact, resulted in a different outcome or that a \"miscarriage of justice has occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b384-5\">. At the show cause hearing, Robert Puglisi, MMCA\u2019s sole witness and an MMCA shareholder, acknowledged that MMCA had approved the response to the income deduction order filed on September 1, 2000, which stated that \"Mr. Cherry instructed [MMCA] not to make any further payments of salary or any other amounts to him. Mr. Cherry is still an employee of [MMCA].\u201d The trial judge could reasonably infer that MMCA complied with this instruction to avoid the income deduction order and not, as Mr. Puglisi testified, because Mr. Cherry\u2019s contributions to the company became insignificant. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989) (holding that the credibility of a witness and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination). Additionally, Puglisi testified that Mr. Cherry is co-founder and majority shareholder of MMCA, that some clients choose MMCA based on Mr. Cherry\u2019s reputation, that Mr. Cherry may have clients that he solicits, that he has marketing responsibilities, and that the decision to stop paying salary to Mr. Cherry was made on July 17, 2000, just before the income deduction order became effective. Based on the foregoing evidence, the trial judge could reasonably infer that Mr. Cherry performed work for MMCA and that MMCA continued to be liable to Mr. Cherry at the time of the income deduction order. <em>Cf. Po River Water and Sewer Co. v. Indian Acres Club of Thornburg, </em>255 Va. 108, 114, 495 S.E.2d 478, 482 (1998) (\"equity will effect a 'contract implied in law,\u2019 requiring one who accepts and receives the services of another to make reasonable compensation for those services\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">. As discussed in Section I of this opinion, we do not find that MMCA\u2019s due process rights were affected by the denial of its motion to intervene. Therefore, we do not address that claim here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">. MMCA\u2019s argument that it could not cross-examine the evidence from the equitable distribution hearing is discussed in Section 11(A) of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b387-13\">. At oral argument, MMCA maintained that it had preserved this objection in its Memorandum of Law dated November 13, 2000. However, that Memorandum argued only that \"there is no legal basis for holding MMCA in contempt,\u201d because \"the specific elements and level of proof required for MMCA to be held in contempt have not been shown.\u201d This claim is manifestly different from the one presented on appeal that the trial court lacked authority to enter a money judgment against MMCA on the basis of a rule to show cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b387-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">M. Morgan Cherry <em>&amp; </em>Associates, Ltd., a Virginia corporation, was not a party to the divorce proceedings between Natalie W. Cherry and her husband, Max Morgan Cherry, III. Yet, in a hearing to determine whether the corporation violated an income deduction order, which was entered in the divorce proceeding, the trial judge judicially recognized facts that apparently were proved in the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding. Based substantially on those facts, the judge entered a money judgment against the corporation for violating the income deduction order. I would hold that the judge committed reversible error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">\u201cThe general rule is that the court will not travel outside the record of the case before it in order to take notice of the proceedings in another case, even between the same parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and in the same court, unless the proceedings are put in evidence. The reason for the rule is that the decision of a cause must depend upon the evidence introduced. If the courts should recognize judicially facts adjudicated in another case, it makes those facts, though unsupported by evidence in the case at hand, conclusive against the opposing party; while if they had been properly introduced they might have been met and overcome by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><em>Bernau v. Nealon, </em>219 Va. 1039, 1043, 254 S.E.2d 82, 85 (1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The record establishes that the managing principal officer, who is one of the three shareholders of the corporation, was the sole witness at the hearing from which this appeal arises. He testified that in February 2000, he had a discussion with the husband about his decreased participation in the corporation\u2019s business. He told the husband \u201cthat the drop in his hourly contribution was significantly impacting the company and ... that it wasn\u2019t quite fair that the compensation he was receiving was based on ... 1997, 1998 involvement.\u201d In July 2000, he again discussed with the husband the lack of justification for paying the husband when \u201cno income [was] coming from [the husband].\u201d At that time, the husband had only 100 billable hours for all of the year 2000. Based on those discussions, the husband agreed in July 2000 that the corporation should stop paying his salary. The corporation did so on July 17. The managing principal officer testified that the husband continues to be one of the three shareholders of the corporation and is an inactive, unpaid employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In September 2000, which was seven months after the managing principal officer had a confrontation with the husband about his unproductivity, the corporation first received notice of the income deduction order. The corporation promptly filed in the circuit court its response that it \u201chas made no payments of salary or any other amounts to [husband] since July 17, 2000.\u201d In response to questions from the wife\u2019s attorney, the managing principal officer was clear that the husband was not participating in the affairs of the corporation. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Q And sometimes [the husband] is a director of operations and does marketing and business management and so forth, too, doesn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">A He has, yes, in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">Q And the operations that are the source of revenue for [the corporation] are investigations, are they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">Q And [the husband] conducts those investigations, doesn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">A He has in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">Q And in fact [the husband] is [the corporation\u2019s] primary investigator, isn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">A No, that\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">Hi H* * H* Hs H\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">Q But nobody has ever compelled him to go out and work, have they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">A We have in the past tried to get him to \u2014 as a matter of fact, this summer, get him to work cases for us and he just hasn\u2019t been able to do it. I don\u2019t know the reasons why. I\u2019ve retained the responsibilities for those matters and Mr. Bum has also for those matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-14\">It would be difficult to say we could force him to do work when he\u2019s not physically here. I believe I haven\u2019t seen him for five months or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-15\">H; H* ^ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-16\">Q So he\u2019s in charge of marketing and representing the corporation at trade shows and soliciting clients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-17\">A He\u2019s not in charge of soliciting clients. He may have clients that he solicits. He has marketing responsibilities as we all do. This is a small company; I don\u2019t know if you understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-18\">The only way that it functions is the output of all of its parties and when one party doesn\u2019t function, it puts more burden on the other parties and that\u2019s what the situation is here and that\u2019s what led us, you know, to the conclusion that paying him a salary was not justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The managing principal officer further testified that the corporation owed no accrued salary to the husband, held no money that was his, and provided to him no other benefits. He testified that the minority owners had no power \u201cto fire\u201d the husband, who owned a majority of the corporation\u2019s stock. Their only \u201coptions or alternatives were to ... dissolve or separate [themselves] from the company.\u201d He testified that the coming December would be the end of the fiscal year and that decisions would then be made about bonuses. He also testified that the corporation has \u201cnever had a dividend.\u201d No other witness testified, and no other documentary evidence was presented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In argument to the trial judge at the conclusion of that testimony, the corporation\u2019s attorney asserted that \u201con the evidence that\u2019s before your Honor here today, the rule to show cause should be dismissed.\u201d The judge took the matter under advisement for two weeks. At a later hearing, which consisted only of further argument by the attorneys, the judge ruled from the bench. In pertinent part, she stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahq\">Well, I recall all the evidence that was adduced at the hearing last time, primarily through [the managing principal officer], but <em>I have also considered the evidence that was received during the equitable distribution case about [the corporation], the nature of the business, the kind of work that it does, its ownership, its structure, and I also rely upon the evidence that I heard during the equitable distribution case regarding the way [the husband] operates with respect to his multiple identities, passports, et. cetera.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\"><em>\u00a1fr </em>\u00ed\u00a1&lt; sfc ;$c \u00ed\u00a1\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">So today, pursuant to the income deduction order that was entered by this Court on August 28th of 2000,1 am entering a judgment against [the corporation] in the amount of $9,900 for its failure to make payments for September 1, October 1, and November 1 of the year 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">(Emphasis added.) Immediately at the conclusion of the hearing, the judge entered an \u201cOrder Pertaining to Rule Against MMCA,\u201d which incorporated the judge\u2019s \u201cbench rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ing\u201d and \u201cawarded a judgment against [the corporation] in the ... amount of $9,900,\u201d plus interest, in satisfaction of the income deduction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u201c[I]t was plain error for [the trial judge] to go outside the record to find another reason to support [her] decision.\u201d <em>Russell County School Bd. v. Anderson, </em>238 Va. 372, 385, 384 S.E.2d 598, 605 (1989). Moreover, this is not a case such as <em>Hansel v. Commonwealth, </em>118 Va. 803, 808, 88 S.E. 166, 167 (1916), where the trial judge \u201cpermit[ted] the evidence ... given in the [other] case ... to be read in evidence\u201d in this case. <em>See also Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 834, 531 S.E.2d 41, 44 (2000) (noting that the trial judge \u201cmade the letter part of the file and the record\u201d). Neither party offered as evidence any matters proved on the record in the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">I agree with the majority that the corporation\u2019s attorney might have better stated his objection at trial or in response to the order. I believe, however, that the attorney\u2019s closing argument, which informed the judge that \u201con the evidence before\u201d her the evidence was insufficient to prove the corporation owed income to the husband, adequately preserved for review both the objection to the judge\u2019s reliance on evidence not in the record and the objection to insufficiency of the evidence. \u201cThe primary function of Rule 5A:18 is to alert the trial judge to possible error so that the judge may consider the issue intelligently and take any corrective actions necessary to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 530, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1992). The contemporaneous objection requirement may be satisfied by an attorney\u2019s closing argument that touches upon the matter at issue. <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 498, 504, 507 S.E.2d 89, 91 (1998); <em>Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 225, 228, 416 S.E.2d 25, 27 (1992); <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 593, 596, 413 S.E.2d 354, 355-56 (1992). That was done in this case. Moreover, the judge, who had tried the divorce case and had denied the corporation\u2019s motion to intervene in the divorce case, knew the corporation was not a party to the divorce proceeding. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>attorney\u2019s argument, which directed the judge\u2019s attention to \u201cthe evidence that\u2019s before Your Honor here today,\u201d clearly put the judge on notice that she was limited to considering \u201cthe evidence ... before\u201d her at the contempt proceeding. I would hold, therefore, that the attorney preserved for appeal both the issues of insufficiency of the evidence and the limitation of evidence to that which was contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In any event, I would hold that to attain the ends of justice we should consider this issue of the judge\u2019s reliance on facts not in evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. \u201c \u2018An appellate court may ... take cognizance of errors though not assigned when they ... are fundamental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 883, 889, 140 S.E.2d 688, 693 (1965) (citation omitted). The judge\u2019s \u201cplain error\u201d deprived the corporation of a fundamental right because the only evidence before the trial judge in this limited proceeding was the uncontradicted testimony of the managing principal officer that the corporation did not owe to the husband income, as defined in the income deduction order and by Code \u00a7 63.1-250. The evidence before the judge did not contain a scintilla of proof concerning the evidence previously given in the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding. Cf<em>. Hansel, </em>118 Va. at 808, 88 S.E. at 167 (noting that the trial judge permitted the evidence from the other case \u201cto be read in evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Moreover, the corporation had no opportunity to know, challenge, or rebut evidence from the prior hearings that the wife or the judge considered significant. The corporation, therefore, was denied the essence of due process. <em>See Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 267-71, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1020-22, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) (holding that notice and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting and cross-examining adverse witnesses are components of the right to due process); <em>Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, </em>492 U.S. 257, 285, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 2925, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989) (holding that \u201ca corporation is entitled to due process ... of law\u201d). \u201cThe denial of due process involves the denial of a fundamental constitutional right and falls within the ambit of Rule 5A:18 to attain the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Va.App. 384, 338-39, 549 S.E.2d 652, 654 (2001). Applying these principles, we may invoke the ends of justice exception in a case such as here, where the due process violation results in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See id. </em>at 339, 549 S.E.2d at 654. A miscarriage of justice is apparent in this case because the evidence before the judge affirmatively proved that the corporation owed no income to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">I would hold further that the judge\u2019s \u201cplain error\u201d in considering evidence outside the record was not harmless. The trial judge generally stated that she also was relying on evidence she heard \u201cduring the equitable distribution case, about [the corporation], the nature of the business, the kind of work ... it does, its ownership, its structure, and ... [about] the way [the husband] operates with respect to his multiple identities, passports, et. cetera.\u201d This error was significant because it impacted upon the lack of credit the judge gave to the unimpeached testimony of the corporation\u2019s managing officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">While a jury, or a judge trying a case without a jury, are the judges of the weight of the testimony and the credibility of witnesses, they may not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with the facts appearing in the record, even though such witnesses are interested in the outcome of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">Here [the] evidence was uncontradicted; it was not inherently incredible; and it constituted the only facts appearing in the record. Even ... [if] the trial judge did not believe [the] testimony, [her] mere belief or speculation is not sufficient to disregard the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\"><em>Hodge v. American Family Life, </em>213 Va. 30, 31-32, 189 S.E.2d 351, 353 (1972). <em>See also Cheatham v. Gregory, </em>227 Va. 1, 4-5, 313 S.E.2d 368, 370 (1984). The judgment was substantially swayed by the judge\u2019s erroneous consideration of facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">In its sufficiency analysis, the majority opinion operates upon the faulty premises that an argument by an attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the judge concerning the incidents of the case is evidence and that the judge\u2019s notice of facts adjudicated in another proceeding constitutes evidence. Those premises are contrary to well established principles. <em>See Bernau, </em>219 Va. at 1041, 254 S.E.2d at 84 (holding that \u201c[individual and extrajudicial knowledge on the part of a judge will not dispense with proof of facts not judicially cognizable, and cannot be resorted to for the purpose of supplementing the record\u201d); <em>Waye v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 691, 251 S.E.2d 202, 206 (1979) (approving the judge\u2019s instruction to \u201cthe jury that the [attorney\u2019s] statement was not evidence\u201d); <em>Cook v. Hayden, </em>183 Va. 203, 226, 31 S.E.2d 625, 634 (1944) (holding \u201cthat the statements [of the attorney concerning facts to be proved] were not evidence\u201d); <em>Cummings v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 248, 251-52, 481 S.E.2d 493, 494 (1997) (holding that the attorney\u2019s discussion with the judge about facts to be proved is not evidence). Relying upon these faulty premises, the majority misapplies <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 499 S.E.2d 263 (1998). In <em>Jenkins, </em>the Supreme Court held that in reviewing an appeal for sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthe reviewing court must consider all <em>evidence properly admitted </em>at trial.\u201d 255 Va. at 522, 499 S.E.2d at 266 (1998) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The facts of this case reveal that the judge and the wife\u2019s attorney referred to testimony apparently made at the earlier equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding to which the corporation was not a party. Neither the judge\u2019s nor the attorney\u2019s statements are evidence. The wife\u2019s attorney neither proffered as evidence nor read into evidence the record from the equitable distribution phase of the divorce proceeding. Although it is the responsibility of the corporation, as appellant, to present this Court with a full record, that responsibility does not include presenting documents not in evidence. <em>See Bernau, </em>219 Va. at 1043, 254 S.E.2d at 85. The record before us clearly establishes that evidence from the equitable distribution proceeding in the divorce case was not admitted into the record of this hearing. Accordingly, on review for sufficiency of the evidence the majority improperly considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>as evidence statements made by the wife\u2019s attorney and the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in judicially noticing facts from a proceeding in which the corporation was not a party. This error substantially affected the ruling. I would, therefore, reverse the judgment and remand for rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
