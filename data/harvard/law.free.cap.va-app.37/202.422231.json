He contends the trial court erred in finding him guilty, since the evidence did not establish that the credit union was a \u201cbanking house\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-93. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">The facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">On August 26, 1999, appellant, carrying a firearm, entered and robbed the Navy Yard Credit Union. The robbery took place in the credit union\u2019s loan department. A surveillance tape showed appellant committing the robbery. Appellant, after being <em>Mimndized, </em>identified himself on the surveillance tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>In order to have an account at the Navy Yard Credit Union, a person must be a member. Only a person who is \u201cconnected \u2022with the Navy Yard or something like that\u201d can become a member and thus open a share account.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">At the conclusion of the case, appellant moved to strike the evidence, contending a credit union is not a \u201cbanking house\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-93. More specifically, he argued Code \u00a7 18.2-93 does not prohibit entry into a credit union while armed. The trial court overruled those motions and convicted appellant of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The sole issue before this Court is whether a credit union is a \u201cbanking house\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-93.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute does not define \u201cbanking house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">While the statute is penal and, therefore, \u201cmust be strictly construed,\u201d appellant is not \u201centitled to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 260, 262, 430 S.E.2d 543, 543-44 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">In interpreting statutory language, we have held: \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction; a statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201c[A] fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that courts view the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the \u2018true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1989) (quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>Allard v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 57, 67, 480 S.E.2d 139, 144 (1997). We, therefore, look to other sections of the Code to determine the legislative intent when using the term, \u201cbanking house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The Virginia Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) includes \u201ccredit union\u201d within the definition of a \u201cbank.\u201d Under Code \u00a7 8.4-105, which defines terms for the Bank Deposits and Collections title of the UCC, \u201c \u2018Bank\u2019 means a person engaged in the business of banking, including a savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union or trust company.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.4-105(1). The Funds Transfers title of the UCC states, \u201c \u2018Bank\u2019 means a person engaged in the business of banking and includes a savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, and trust company.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.4A-105(2). Code \u00a7 8.9A-1Q2(8) in the Secured Transactions title, defines \u201cbank\u201d as \u201can organization that is engaged in the business of banking. The term includes savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and trust companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Virginia Credit Union Act defines \u201ccredit union\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">a cooperative, nonprofit corporation, organized under the laws of this Commonwealth and authorized to do business under this chapter for the purposes of encouraging thrift among its members, creating a source of credit at fair and reasonable rates of interest, providing an opportunity for its members to use and control their own money on a democratic basis in order to improve their economic and social condition, and conducting any other business, engaging in any other activity, and providing any other service that may be of benefit to its members, consistent with the provisions of this chapter and any regulations adopted by the Commission under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Code \u00a7 6.1-225.2. The powers of a credit union include receiving savings, making loans, borrowing, investing its funds, and offering financial services such as fund transfers, share draft accounts, and safe deposit boxes. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 6.1-225.21; 6.1-225.41; 6.1-225.51; 6.1-225.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>This Court has never addressed the particular issue of whether a \u201cbanking house\u201d includes a credit union; however, we have considered what constitutes a \u201cbanking house.\u201d In <em>Black v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 186, 190, 455 S.E.2d 755, 757 (1995), which involved a robbery at the Providence Savings and Loan Association, an employee testified that his association offered \u201cservices such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and loans,\u201d performing banking services for its customers. Black contended the savings and loan was not a bank and, therefore, not a \u201cbanking house\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-93. We held, based on the employee\u2019s testimony, the savings and loan association was a \u201cbanking house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 455 S.E.2d at 758. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">To construe the statute as appellant suggests would require us to conclude that the intent of the legislature was to punish armed entry into a \u201cbank,\u201d but not to punish armed entry into a \u201csavings and loan association.\u201d Such an interpretation is contrary to the legislative intent and requires \u201can unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2h\"><em>Id. </em>at 191, 455 S.E.2d at 757 (citation unattributed). Given the statutory definitions of \u201ccredit union,\u201d this analysis applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Here, appellant robbed the Navy Yard Credit Union. This credit union had a loan department and tellers to wait on customers. No other evidence was adduced to explain in detail the functions of the credit union. Nevertheless, the trial court could conclude from the evidence before it that the Navy Yard Credit Union satisfied the definition of \u201ccredit union\u201d under Code \u00a7 6.1-225.2. Appellant has never contested that the Navy Yard Credit Union was, in fact, a credit union. This organization, given its legal duties and responsibilities, clearly performed the functions of a bank, although its customer base was restricted to people \u201cconnected with the Navy Yard.\u201d Therefore, the credit union was a \u201cbanking house\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Appellant maintains we should distinguish <em>Black </em>because a credit union differs from a bank or a savings and loan associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tion in that a credit union is for members only. This is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Whether or not an institution is open to the public or restricts its customers to members is the type of technical distinction rejected in <em>Black. See Black, </em>20 Va.App. at 191, 455 S.E.2d at 757. Clearly, a credit union conducts banking business. As in <em>Black, </em>it would be senseless to punish armed entry into a bank but not into a credit union. We, therefore, affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-10\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-93 states, in part, \u201cIf any person, armed with a deadly weapon, shall enter any banking house, in the daytime or in the nighttime, with intent to commit larceny of money, bonds, notes, or other evidence of debt therein, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
