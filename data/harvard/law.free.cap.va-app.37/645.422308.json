Holz &amp; Son, Inc., and United Contractors of Virginia Group Self-Insurance Association (hereinafter collectively \u201cemployer\u201d) appeal from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission requiring employer to pay for chiropractic treatment rendered to former employee Mathilda Karren Dumas-Thayer (claimant) and to provide her with a panel from which to choose a new treating physician. We hold the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that good reason existed under Code \u00a7 65.2-603(C) to hold employer financially responsible for claimant\u2019s chiropractic treatment because claimant acted in good faith, the treatment provided by employer was inadequate, and the alternative treatment was medically reasonable and necessary. We also hold the evidence that the treatment provided by employer was inadequate in terms of pain relief and joint function supported the commission\u2019s conclusion that employer must provide claimant with a panel from which to choose a new treating physician. Thus, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">On February 2, 2000, claimant sustained a compensable injury to her lower back and left hip while working as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>painter for employer. Following the injury, she received temporary total and temporary partial disability compensation pursuant to awards entered by the commission. She was released to full duty on October 4, 2000, and her compensation award was terminated as of October 6, 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Claimant initially received treatment from Patient First of Chester and was referred to Dr. William D. Henceroth, an orthopedic surgeon at the West End Orthopedic Clinic. At the direction of Dr. Henceroth, claimant also was treated by his associates, Drs. Charles W. Vokac and E. Claiborne Irby, Jr. While under the care of these doctors, claimant underwent various diagnostic testing and treatment, including injections, physical therapy and work hardening, but she continued to complain of left hip pain, low back pain and left leg weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">On October 4, 2000, Dr. Vokac observed that all claimant\u2019s tests were negative but that a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) was \u201cinconclusive\u201d and claimant could not tolerate work hardening. He then wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">At this point I don\u2019t think there is anything else that I have to offer her and based on the fact that testing was within normal limits and the FCE was inconclusive, I will release her to full duty without restrictions. She is concerned that she cannot perform this and I asked her to discuss with her case manager her options under work comp, guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Claimant apparently sought a referral to Elliot Eisenberg, a chiropractor, but that request was denied. Despite that denial, claimant began treating with Eisenberg on October 10, 2000. On October 16, 2000, after claimant had undergone three visits to Eisenberg, he reported that claimant had begun to experience significant relief. Eisenberg wrote to Drs. Vokac and Henceroth to request a workers\u2019 compensation referral, but no such referral was made at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>On November 27, 2000, following additional chiropractic treatment for a total of twenty-two visits, Eisenberg again wrote to Dr. Vokac, noting that claimant had experienced \u201csome improvement\u201d with chiropractic treatment but had \u201creached a plateau.\u201d Eisenberg indicated he suspected claimant might be suffering from \u201ca trochanteric bursal tear, a tear of the restraining ligaments of the hip, or the tensor fascia lata,\u201d or a hip dislocation. Eisenberg noted his inability to perform the \u201cmore involved diagnostics\u201d necessary to confirm or dispel these suspicions, and he asked that claimant be allowed to return to Dr. Vokac for additional evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">On December 1, 2000, claimant returned to Dr. Vokac. He noted claimant\u2019s report that chiropractic treatment had \u201chelped her significantly,\u201d and he documented a range of motion greater than on previous examination. Dr. Vokac also wrote, \u201cnow that we know that chiropractic treatment has helped[,] ... so [claimant] can be reimbursed for the treatments, I will just state in my note that chiropractic treatment does appear to be helpful and appropriate in this situation.\u201d Dr. Vokac apparently also considered additional diagnostic testing, based on Eisenberg\u2019s suspicions. However, in a letter to employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case manager dated December 18, 2000, Dr. Vokac indicated he had consulted with Drs. Henceroth, Irby and others and concluded that additional testing was not supported by the objective findings on examination of claimant. Dr. Vokac then noted, \u201c[w]ith regards to the chiropractic treatments], as I told you, they seem to have helped per the patient\u2019s report. I don\u2019t think it is unreasonable that some chiropractic visits were performed. It does not seem unreasonable for me to have [claimant] undergo 5 to 10 chiropractic visits.\u201d A copy of this letter was sent to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">From November 30, 2000 through January 16, 2001, claimant underwent eleven additional chiropractic treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Following a hearing on claimant\u2019s application for a change in treating physicians and payment for chiropractic treatment already rendered, the deputy commissioner ordered employer to provide claimant with a new panel from which to choose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>new treating physician. The deputy commissioner also held employer responsible for the chiropractic treatment previously provided by Chiropractor Eisenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The commission, with one dissent, affirmed the deputy\u2019s award. It noted Dr. Vokac\u2019s opinion that \u201cchiropractic treatment was not unreasonable.\u201d It held that Drs. Vokac and Irby provided \u201cmore than adequate treatment relative to pharmacological treatment and evaluation based on objective diagnostic studies\u201d but that the treatment nevertheless was inadequate because it \u201cwas not alleviating [claimant\u2019s] complaints\u201d of pain. Thus, based on evidence that the chiropractic treatment was reasonable and necessary and that the treatment claimant had been receiving was inadequate in terms of pain relief, it concluded employer should be responsible for the chiropractic treatment. Although Dr. Vokac had opined such treatment should be limited to five or ten occasions, the commission accorded less weight to this part of his opinion because Dr. Vokac did not see claimant after she had received ten treatments from Eisenberg and saw her only after she had treated with him \u201con more than twenty occasions.\u201d Thus, the commission held employer responsible for all of the chiropractic treatments rendered by Eisenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The commission also held that claimant was entitled to select a new treating physician from a panel provided by employer based on its finding that \u201cclaimant was not receiving effective treatment on the basis of palliative pain relief and joint function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">On appeal of a decision of the commission, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, and we must uphold the commission\u2019s findings of fact if the record contains credible evidence to support them. <em>See, e.g., Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. Goad, </em>15 Va.App. 710, 712, 427 S.E.2d 215, 217 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">PAYMENT FOR CHIROPRACTIC TREATMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act contains the following provisions regarding medical treatment for injured employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">A. 1. As long as necessary after an accident, the employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the injured employee, a physician chosen [in accordance with the Act] and such other necessary medical attention. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">$ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">C. <em>If </em>in an emergency or on account of the employer\u2019s failure to provide the medical care during the period herein specified, or <em>for other good reasons, </em>a physician other than provided by the employer is called to treat the injured employee, during such period, the reasonable cost of such service shall be paid by the employer if [the employer is] ordered to [make such payment] by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">D. As used in this section ..., the terms \u201cmedical attention,\u201d \u201cmedical service,\u201d \u201cmedical care,\u201d and \u201cmedical report\u201d shall be deemed to include chiropractic service or treatment ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Code \u00a7 65.2-603 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">We have held, under the \u201cother good reasons\u201d test of Code \u00a7 65.2-603(0, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">if the employee, without authorization but in good faith, obtains medical treatment different from that provided by the employer, and it is determined that the treatment provided by the employer was inadequate treatment for the employee\u2019s condition and the unauthorized treatment received by the claimant was medically reasonable and necessary treatment, the employer should be responsible, notwithstanding the lack of prior approval by the employer. <em>See </em>2 A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 61.12(e) (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-13\"><em>Shenandoah Prods., Inc. v. Whitlock, </em>15 Va.App. 207, 212, 421 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1992). We emphasized that \u201c[r]eimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ment for unauthorized medical treatment should be the rare exception\u201d and that \u201c[w]hen an employee seeks treatment other than that provided by the employer or ordered by the commission, he or she does so at his or her own peril and risks not being reimbursed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, 421 S.E.2d at 486. However, where the record supports a conclusion by the commission that the employee acted in good faith, that the treatment provided by the employer was inadequate, and that the alternative treatment was medically reasonable and necessary, the employee is entitled to payment for that alternative treatment. <em>See id. </em>at 212-13, 421 S.E.2d at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Whether the employee acted in good faith is a credibility determination. <em>See Christiansen v. Metro Bldg. Supply, </em>18 Va.App. 721, 724, 447 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1994), <em>modified on reh\u2019g on other grounds, </em>19 Va.App. 513, 453 S.E.2d 302 (1995). Thus, we will uphold a finding of good faith made by the commission if the record contains credible evidence to support that finding. <em>Id. </em>An employee\u2019s effort to obtain the approval of the treating physician or the employer before obtaining alternative treatment is evidence of good faith. <em>See Whitlock, </em>15 Va.App. at 213, 421 S.E.2d at 486. Here, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, indicates that claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Vokac, released her to full duty after opining that he did not \u201cthink [he had] anything else ... to offer her.\u201d Claimant then \u201crequested referral\u201d to Chiropractor Eisenberg for treatment, but her request was denied. Only after Dr. Vokac opined that he had nothing else to offer her did she obtain alternative treatment. Thus, the record contains credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that claimant acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We hold the evidence also supports the commission\u2019s determination that the treatment provided by Dr. Vokac and his associates was inadequate and that the alternative treatment provided by Chiropractor Eisenberg was reasonable and necessary. \u201c[T]he question of whether the disputed medical treatment was necessary within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>603 is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Goad, </em>15 Va.App. at 712-13, 427 S.E.2d at 217. Similarly, we hold that the question of whether the treatment provided by the employer was inadequate is also a mixed question of law and fact. Thus, the commission\u2019s conclusions regarding the necessity of the alternative treatment and inadequacy of the treatment actually provided are not binding on appeal. <em>See id. </em>In reviewing these issues, we are guided by the principle that the opinion of the treating physician is entitled to great weight. <em>See, e.g., Fingles Co. v. Tatterson, </em>22 Va.App. 638, 641, 472 S.E.2d 646, 647 (1996). However, \u201c[m]edical evidence is not necessarily conclusive[; it] is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d <em>Hungerford Mech. Corp. v. Hobson, </em>11 Va.App. 675, 677, 401 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Here, the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that the treatment claimant was receiving was inadequate and that the chiropractic treatment she obtained was reasonable and necessary. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act requires that an \u201cemployer shall furnish or cause to be furnished ... <em>necessary medical attention.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1) (emphasis added). We hold, in keeping with prior decisions of the commission, <em>see, e.g., Davis v. Old Oak Mining, </em>No. 132-47-97, 1997 WL 1081372 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n May 19, 1997), that \u201cnecessary medical attention\u201d as that phrase is used in Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l) includes palliative treatment. 5 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Worker\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 94.04, 94.04(D) (2001) (noting that majority of jurisdictions provide coverage for palliative treatment); <em>see Grand Lodge Free &amp; Accepted Masons v. Jones, </em>590 N.E.2d 653, 655 (Ind.Ct.App.1992) (noting that palliative treatment methods are allowed \u201ceven under Indiana\u2019s restrictive [workers\u2019 compensation] statute,\u201d Ind. Code \u00a7 22-3-3-4); <em>Harris v. Diamond Constr. Co., </em>184 Va. 711, 718 n. 2, 36 S.E.2d 573, 576 n. 2 (1946) (\u201c \u2018The holding of the Indiana court is peculiarly persuasive with us because the Virginia act is based upon that of Indiana.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Basham v. R.H. Lowe, Inc., </em>176 Va. 485, 494, 11 S.E.2d 638, 642 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>(1940))); <em>see also Barry v. Western Elec. Co., </em>485 So.2d 88, 92 (La.Ct.App.1986); <em>In re Levesque, </em>136 N.H. 211, 612 A.2d 1333, 1334 (1992); <em>Hanrahan v. Township of Sparta, </em>284 N.J.Super. 327, 665 A.2d 389, 394 (App.Div.1995); <em>Trafalgar House v. Green, </em>784 A.2d 232, 234-36 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2001). Further, we agree with the commission\u2019s holding \u201c \u2018that when a claimant changes physicians without authorization and realizes appreciable benefit and relief from said change, that treatment is considered necessary.\u2019\u201d <em>See Dell\u2019Orco v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., </em>No. 180-19-28, 1999 WL 1092293 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Oct. 29, 1999) (quoting <em>Wiggins v. Planters Peanuts, </em>62 O.I.C. 510, 512 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Here, credible evidence in the record established that claimant continued to experience pain while under the care of Dr. Vokac, and Dr. Vokac indicated on October 4, 2000, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything else that I have to offer her.\u201d Thereafter, claimant obtained chiropractic treatment, which she reported \u201chelped her significantly,\u201d and Dr. Vokac documented an improvement in her range of motion after twenty-two chiropractic visits. Dr. Vokac discussed the impact of the chiropractic treatment with claimant and opined that it appeared to be both \u201chelpful and appropriate\u201d and that claimant\u2019s obtaining such treatment was \u201cnot unreasonable.\u201d Thus, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that the treatment claimant had received was inadequate because it did not relieve her pain and that the chiropractic treatment she obtained on her own was reasonable and necessary because it provided her with significant pain relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Finally, the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that employer should be responsible for all of claimant\u2019s chiropractic visits. Although Dr. Vokac opined that five to ten visits would have been reasonable, he did so only after claimant had undergone over twenty visits. The commission was entitled to weigh his opinion in light of the treatment claimant actually received and to conclude that the greater number of visits was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">AUTHORITY TO SELECT NEW TREATING PHYSICIAN</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We previously have acknowledged that the commission may order a change in a claimant\u2019s treating physician if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c \u2018inadequate treatment is being rendered; it appears that treatment is needed by a specialist in a particular field and is not being provided; [or] no progress [is] being made in improvement of the employee\u2019s health condition without any adequate explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. v. Briggs, </em>28 Va.App. 662, 675, 508 S.E.2d 335, 341 (1998) (quoting <em>Powers, </em>68 O.I.C. at 211).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Here, the commission found that Dr. Vokac\u2019s treatment was \u201cmore than adequate ... relative to pharmacological treatment and evaluation based on objective diagnostic studies\u201d but that it was inadequate in terms of \u201cpalliative pain relief and joint function.\u201d After Dr. Vokac opined on October 4, 2000 that he did not have \u201canything else ... to offer [claimant]\u201d from an orthopedic standpoint, claimant obtained additional medical treatment on her own. The record supports a finding that the additional treatment both improved claimant\u2019s range of motion and alleviated some of her pain. As previously discussed, treatment for palliative care qualifies as \u201cnecessary medical treatment\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-603 where, as here, the commission finds credible a claimant\u2019s complaints of continuing pain. Thus, the record supports the commission\u2019s finding that Dr. Vokac\u2019s treatment was inadequate in terms of \u201cpalliative pain relief and joint function.\u201d The record further supports the commission\u2019s decision requiring employer to furnish claimant with a panel of \u201cphysiatrists and/or pain management specialists\u201d from which to choose a new treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">For these reasons, we hold the evidence supports the commission\u2019s decision ordering employer (1) to pay for chiropractic treatment rendered to claimant by Elliot Eisenberg and (2) to provide claimant with a panel of \u201cphysiatrists and/or pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>management specialists\u201d from which to choose a new treating physician. Therefore, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\">. Claimant sought ongoing disability compensation, but the deputy commissioner found she was able to return to her pre-injury employment, and the commission concluded she failed to file a timely request for review of that finding. She did not appeal the commission\u2019s ruling to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
