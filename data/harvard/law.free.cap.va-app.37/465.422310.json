On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in ruling (1) appellant was properly informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; (2) the search warrant was issued based on probable cause; (3) appellant\u2019s vehicle was properly searched; and (4) the evidence seized in the vehicle was admissible. For the reasons stated, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">On February 25, 1999, Detective Frank Chappell of the Portsmouth Police Department was working with an informant who previously had provided information resulting in at least one arrest. The informant reported that for some time he had been buying quantities of narcotics from appellant and Calvin West. He explained that appellant delivered the drugs to West\u2019s home on Brookwood Drive in Suffolk, where the drugs then were sold. The informant described appellant\u2019s vehicle as a blue van \u201cwith a wood grain.\u201d As the informant and Chappell were driving to appellant\u2019s home, Chappell saw the blue van. They changed direction and followed the van to West\u2019s residence, where informant made a controlled purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">According to the informant, appellant and West sold drugs at West\u2019s home from early morning to early afternoon. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>pellant would deliver the drugs to West in the morning and come back later in the afternoon to pick up the proceeds. If the porch light was on at West\u2019s residence, then no drugs were for sale; if the light was off, then drags could be purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On June 16, 1999, the police began surveillance of West\u2019s and appellant\u2019s homes. Early that morning, appellant was observed driving from his residence on Water View Drive to West\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">That same day, a different informant made a controlled buy at West\u2019s residence. He was unable to buy the drugs before appellant arrived. After appellant arrived, however, the porch light was switched off, and the informant then purchased narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">On June 17, the confidential informant again went to West\u2019s home before appellant arrived and was told no narcotics were available. The porch light was on, and West told the informant that he was waiting for appellant to arrive with the cocaine. On that day, appellant left his home and stopped at 3943 Bridge Road, his mother\u2019s home, where he got out of his car and walked to the side of the house behind a large tree. \u201cAll [the police] could see was that he went to the side of the house or towards the side of the garage area,\u201d where he remained out of view for a few minutes. He then returned to his van and drove directly to West\u2019s residence. The confidential informant then made a purchase from appellant at West\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">On June 18 at 9:00 a.m., the informant again attempted to make a purchase while the light was on, but West told him that appellant would be \u201cen route shortly with some [cocaine].\u201d At about the same time, appellant was observed driving into a Farm Fresh parking lot. Appellant met with an individual and then proceeded to Bridge Road. At Bridge Road, appellant again got out of the van and went to the side of the house for a short time. He then drove back to his residence, left again at 9:35 a.m., and drove to West\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Search warrants were obtained for both appellant\u2019s and West\u2019s residences. Appellant was stopped at approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>9:45 a.m. \u201cwithin a block or two from West\u2019s house,\u201d and the police searched his van. They found cocaine in sweatpants that were lying in the van between the driver and passenger seats. The police did not find any drugs on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Both the Brookwood and Waterview houses were searched. No drugs were found at either address. The arresting officers brought appellant back to the Waterview house, but appellant made no statement to Chappell or to any other officer while Chappell was there. Chappell then left to obtain a search warrant for the Bridge Road property. Chappell testified, \u201c[B]ased on what the surveillance was and the observation was, then I felt there was a reason to go to Bridge Road.\u201d Chappell went to the magistrate and obtained a search warrant for that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In the affidavit presented to the magistrate to obtain the search warrant for the Bridge Road residence, Chappell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">On 6-17-99, Cl #2 was sent to 6117 Brookwood Dr. to purchase cocaine. Cl # 2 was told by \u201cC.W.\u201d that he didn\u2019t have anymore cocaine and that he was waiting for \u201cGene\u201d who was still at home to bring over the cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">Surveillance was again established at 100 Waterview Rd. The home of Wilkins. Wilkins van was parked in the driveway of said address. Wilkins was observed coming out of the house carr[y]ing a white bag, he got into the van and drove to 6117 Brookwood Dr. Prior to stopping at 6117 Brookwood Dr., Wilkins stopped at 3943 Bridge Rd.[,] exited the van and was observed going towards the side door. Cl # 2 was given money and sent to 6117 Brookwood Dr. to purchase cocaine. Prior to leaving the Cl # 2 was searched and found to have no controlled substances. Cl #2 was observed going to and inside 6117 Brookwood Dr. Cl # 2 purchased cocaine from \u201cGene.\u201d Cl # 2 advised that \u201cGene\u201d and \u201cC.W.\u201d had just got through cutting up a quantity of cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">H\u00ed 5^ H\u00ed H\u00ed H<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> H?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">On 6-18-99, surveillance was established at 100 Waterview Rd. by Det. DeFreitas. Wilkins was observed coming out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the house and getting into his van, Virginia tag HP/56-561. Wilkins was then followed to a shopping center in the City of Chesapeake, Va. where he met up with a black male. After a brief conversation both Wilkins and the unknown left in different direction[s]. Wilkins was followed where he stopped at 3943 Bridge Rd. Got out of the vehicle and went up to the side of the house. Wilkins th[e]n returned a short time later and drove back directly back to his home at 100 Waterview Rd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">During the time Wilkins was driven back to his home, Cl # <em>2 </em>was at the home of \u201cC.W.\u201d as directed by this [affiant] in attempts to purchase cocaine. \u201cC.W.\u201d told Cl # <em>2 </em>that he didn\u2019t have any cocaine and that he was on the phone with \u201cGene\u201d. \u201cC.W.\u201d added that \u201cGene\u201d would be at the house shortly with cocaine. As this phone conversation was occurring between \u201cGene\u201d and \u201cC.W.\u201d Det. Karpowski observed \u201cGene\u201d talking on a cellular phone while riding down the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">At approximately 9:45 A.M., Eugene Wilkins was arrested with a quantity of cocaine on his person. When asked about where he had been earlier that morning Wilkins stated that he had only went to the Food Lion and got some bananas and went back home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">Parked in the driveway of 3943 Bridge is a 1978 red &amp; white Chevy El Camaro with Virginia tag PTQ-920. The registered owner is Eugene Wilkins. It was further learned that Wilkins 89 year old mother lives at the address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Chappell, on cross-examination, conceded the police never saw appellant enter the El Camino or the Bridge Road house on either visit. The affidavit did not mention that appellant was briefly hidden from view by a \u201cbig tree\u201d at the side of the house while at Bridge Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The search warrant was signed at 1:30 p.m. Chappell then called Detective M.K. Wright, who was already at the Bridge Road house. When Chappell told him that he had obtained the warrant, Wright entered the El Camino, which was parked behind the big tree on the side of the house, and recovered a brown paper bag containing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>While Chappell went to get the search warrant, Detective L.L. DeFreitas remained with appellant at the Waterview Road house. DeFreitas testified he <em>Mirandized </em>appellant from memory, and appellant said he understood those rights. The detective then asked whether appellant wished to speak with him without an attorney present, and appellant replied that he would. Around noon, appellant said he wanted to speak to a lawyer, and DeFreitas stopped his conversation with appellant. Appellant\u2019s wife, who was also present, \u201cconstantly\u201d urged appellant to speak with the police and cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Around 2:30 p.m. appellant asked DeFreitas if he could talk with him in another room. At that point, appellant said he wished to cooperate and tell them where the drugs could be found. DeFreitas responded that he could not talk to appellant because he had asked for a lawyer. Appellant said he had changed his mind and wanted to talk. Appellant then said he would take the officer to the place where the drugs were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">They drove to the Bridge Road address. Appellant led the detective to the El Camino<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and indicated the drugs were in the backseat. They then learned the drugs had already been recovered by other officers pursuant to the search warrant. The trial judge found they \u201carrived only moments after Detective Wright recovered the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Later that day, after DeFreitas described the surveillance to him, appellant said, \u201cOkay, so you know that I come here, pick it up, and then go over to CW\u2019s. I only sold a little. I use as well. It\u2019s for pain. What\u2019s the difference, I\u2019ll be gone soon anyway.\u201d When he asked how much he sold, appellant said he needed to talk to an attorney, and the conversation ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">II. <em>MIRANDA </em>RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Appellant claims the evidence was insufficient for the trial court to find DeFreitas informed appellant of all his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In examining this claim, the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant was informed of these rights will not be overturned unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support that finding. <em>See Commonwealth v. Benjamin, </em>28 Va.App. 548, 552-53, 507 S.E.2d 113, 115 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In the case of <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court explained the rule established by <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Accordingly, we laid down \u201cconcrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow.\u201d <em>[Miranda, </em>384 U.S.] at 442[, 86 S.Ct. 1602]. Those guidelines established that the admissibility in evidence of any statement given during custodial interrogation of a suspect would depend on whether the police provided the suspect with four warnings. <em>These warnings (which have come to be knoum colloquially as \u201cMiranda rights\u201d) </em>are: a suspect \u201chas the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 479[, 86 S.Ct. 1602].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">530 U.S. 428, 435, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000) (emphasis added). Previously, the Supreme Court has called them \u201cthe now-familiar warnings.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 310, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The trial court did not err by inferring from the detective\u2019s use of the phrase, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings,\u201d during his testimony that he informed appellant of these four rights, although the court was not required to make this inference.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>First, other courts have held that similar testimony was sufficient to prove the <em>Miranda </em>rights were read to a defendant. In <em>Phelps v. Duckworth, </em>for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">At trial, the arresting officer testified that he \u201cread [Mr. Phelps] his rights\u201d following the arrest. The state argues that this testimony does not conclusively show that the petitioner was read his <em>Miranda </em>warnings as opposed to some other warnings. The state does not speculate as to what other rights Mr. Phelps <em>reasonably </em>might have been read immediately following his arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">The district court found that the record revealed that Mr. Phelps was read his <em>Miranda </em>warnings following arrest. We will not set aside a district court\u2019s factual finding unless it is clearly erroneous. In reviewing the lower court finding, we may infer reasonable conclusions drawn from the record as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">We fully agree with the district court that Mr. Phelps was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings by the arresting officer. To hold otherwise, in light of the arresting officer\u2019s own testimony, would contradict reason and common sense. The present case is plainly distinguishable from <em>Fletcher [v. Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 605, 102 S.Ct. 1309, 71 L.Ed.2d 490 (1982)], where there was no evidence in the record that the defendant had been read his rights, <em>Miranda </em>or otherwise. There is nothing in the present record which suggests that the rights read to Mr. Phelps by the arresting officer were not <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">757 F.2d 811, 816, <em>rev\u2019d on altern. gds. en banc, </em>772 F.2d 1410 (7th Cir.1985). <em>See also State v. Esser, </em>166 Wis.2d 897, 480 N.W.2d 541, 543-44 (Wis.Ct.App.1992) (noting \u201c[t]he phrase <em>\u2018Miranda rights\u2019 </em>conjures up the well-known litany of rights which many citizens could recite verbatim,\u201d and affirming a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>trial court\u2019s finding that these rights were read to a suspect, based on evidence that the officer read his \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d to the defendant \u201cfrom a police department <em>Miranda </em>card\u201d that was not introduced into evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Here, the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding. DeFreitas testified that, after he arrested appellant, \u201cI <em>Mirandized </em>him\u201d before beginning their initial conversation. The detective admitted he did not read the rights from a preprinted card, but instead recited them \u201cfrom [his] memory.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also asked appellant \u201cif he understood his rights,\u201d and appellant responded that he did. DeFreitas then \u201c[a]sked him if he wished to talk to me without an attorney present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The record contains no hint that anything other than the traditional <em>Miranda </em>rights were explained to appellant. While other trial courts might not reach the same conclusion, appellate courts must defer to the judge\u2019s factual finding where the evidence supports that finding. <em>See Benjamin, </em>28 Va.App. at 552-58, 507 S.E.2d at 115. The evidence here supports the trial court\u2019s factual finding that appellant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">III. SUPPRESSION OF THE DRUGS</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Appellant also claims the evidence found in the El Camino should have been suppressed because the search warrant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for the Bridge Road house where the car was parked lacked probable cause and because the car was not listed on the warrant as a place to search. Even assuming both these arguments are correct, the evidence should not have been suppressed. The drugs were admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine even if the warrant and resulting search were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>When evidence is collected as the result of an unconstitutional process, normally it should be excluded under the exclusionary rule or as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d However, very limited exceptions to this rule do exist. One such exception is the inevitable discovery rule, which is an off-shoot of the independent source doctrine. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 536-39, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988); <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 446-48, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984); <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 199-201, 503 S.E.2d 233, 238-39 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The inevitable discovery exception \u201chas long been recognized in Virginia.\u201d <em>Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 639, 655, 347 S.E.2d 175, 184 (1986). In order to apply this exception, this Court, in <em>Walls, </em>required a showing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">\u201c(1) a reasonable probability [exists] that the evidence in question would have been discovered by lawful means but for the police misconduct, (2) that the leads making the discovery inevitable were possessed by the police at the time of the misconduct, and (3) that the police also prior to the misconduct were actively pursuing the alternative line of investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 656, 347 S.E.2d at 185 (quoting <em>United States v. Cherry, </em>759 F.2d 1196, 1204 (5th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The trial court here concluded the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence met this test, finding that DeFreitas arrived \u201conly moments\u201d after Chappell\u2019s recovery of the drugs, that the police had appellant in custody prior to any of the alleged misbehavior by Chappell, and that DeFreitas actively pursued the alternative source of information. As this conclusion involves a mixed question of fact and law, we defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them, but review the ultimate question of law, the application of the inevitable discovery doctrine, <em>de novo. See Trent v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 248, 250, 544 S.E.2d 379, 380 (2001). <em>See also Williams, </em>467 U.S. at 444 n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 2501 (inevitable discovery should be proven by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>preponderance of the evidence, applying the usual burdens for a motion to suppress).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">First, more than a reasonable probability exists that, without the warrant, the police would have recovered the drugs in the El Camino. Obtaining the search warrant had nothing to do with appellant\u2019s discussion with DeFreitas. Appellant\u2019s decision to voluntarily disclose the location of the drugs provided the police with a completely independent basis for searching the El Camino.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the officers had never attempted to obtain a search warrant for the Bridge Road address, they still would have arrested appellant. This arrest and events at his home, not the search warrant, prompted appellant to disclose to police that the cocaine was in the backseat of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">As appellant actually took DeFreitas to the exact location where the police earlier found the drugs, speculation about an abstract future discovery of the drugs is unnecessary. The evidence here clearly shows discovery of the contraband was more than reasonably probable; it was inevitable, even without the allegedly improper warrant and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The second prong of the test was met also. The police \u201cpossessed the lead\u201d at the time they applied to the magistrate for the warrant: they had appellant, the \u201clead,\u201d in custody and had <em>Mirandized </em>him. While appellant initially invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights and did not talk with DeFreitas, the police still had appellant under arrest. Appellant does not contest the legality of this arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Finally, the officers were actively pursuing this alternative source of information. DeFreitas initially asked if appellant wanted to talk to the police. Although appellant appeared uncooperative at that point, the officers did not take him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>jail, but instead held him in his home. Clearly, the investigation had not concluded. The police still wanted to hear any information appellant was willing to disclose. They were doing all they could do constitutionally, once appellant invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights, to pursue this lead.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In this case, DeFreitas\u2019s lead was completely separate from the alleged police \u201cmisconduct\u201d related to the warrant, as appellant\u2019s cooperation was obtained independently of the request for the search warrant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Cherry, </em>759 F.2d at 1205 n. 11; <em>Walls, </em>2 Va.App. at 643, 347 S.E.2d at 177. Chappell, who requested the warrant, did not know about appellant\u2019s statements when he submitted his affidavit to the magistrate nor when he began the search at Bridge Road. DeFreitas did not know what appellant would say or where the drugs would be found. Appellant did not know about the alleged inadequacies of the warrant and the search. The warrant and search procedure in no way tainted appellant\u2019s disclosure of the location of the drugs because the two investigations were independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Appellant argues the alternative lines of investigation also must flow from completely independent sources. However, he cites no authority to support this interpretation of the rule, and we do not believe this prong suggests such an extreme view. The requirement is only that the alternative line of investigation is not tainted by the allegedly unconstitutional source of information, allowing a court to find that \u201cthe police would have obtained that evidence if no misconduct had taken place.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. at 444, 104 S.Ct. 2501. <em>See also Cherry, </em>759 F.2d at 1205. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lamas, </em>930 F.2d 1099, 1103-04 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>obtained based on Lamas\u2019s invalid consent to search his house was admissible under the inevitable discovery rule where an officer had probable cause and left to obtain a search warrant prior to the improper consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">This analysis is especially applicable here, where if Chappell had never requested the search warrant and never began his search, DeFreitas still would have recovered the cocaine in the backseat of the El Camino, based on appellant\u2019s cooperation. In fact, if the process for obtaining the warrant had been slower, the drugs <em>would have </em>been recovered based on appellant\u2019s cooperation rather than the execution of the warrant. Excluding this evidence would exact \u201cthe enormous societal cost of excluding truth,\u201d while providing no deterrence of police misconduct because an officer \u201cwill rarely, if ever, be in a position to calculate whether [this] evidence sought would inevitably be discovered.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. at 445, 104 S.Ct. 2501.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">As the evidence found in the El Camino is admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine, we do not need to examine appellant\u2019s remaining arguments. Any impropriety related to the affidavit and the execution of the search at Bridge Road did not taint the independent investigation by DeFreitas.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Because appellant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and because the inevitable discovery doctrine allowed introduction of the drugs obtained pursuant to the search warrant, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\">. The El Camino was registered in appellant\u2019s name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">. Clearly, the Commonwealth risks a finding by the trial court that the complete warnings were not given where an officer testifies only that he informed the suspect of his <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">. The prosecution was arguing Mr. Phelps\u2019s silence after his arrest could be used to impeach his trial testimony. <em>Phelps, </em>757 F.2d at 815. Such impeachment evidence is allowed only if a defendant was not read his <em>Miranda </em>rights after his arrest. <em>Id. See generally Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">. Defense counsel did not challenge DeFreitas\u2019s memory at trial nor does he challenge it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\">. The Commonwealth does not argue that appellant lacked standing to object to a search warrant for his mother\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">. Seizure of the drugs based on appellant\u2019s statements was constitutionally permissible without a warrant based on both consent to search, <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 447, 454, 524 S.E.2d 155, 159 (2000) <em>(en banc), </em>and the automobile exception, <em>McCary v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 219, 227-28, 321 S.E.2d 637, 641-42 (1984). Appellant does not argue this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. Appellant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See </em>II, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">. The record does not indicate whether appellant knew Chappell was attempting to get a search warrant for the Bridge Road residence. The allegedly improper actions taken by the police in relation to the warrant and search occurred after Chappell left appellant\u2019s home. Nothing suggests that appellant knew about the allegedly improper action or that his decision to talk to DeFreitas was in any way influenced by those actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
