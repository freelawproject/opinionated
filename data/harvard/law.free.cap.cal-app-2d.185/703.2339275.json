Following his examination of the record and discussions with the defendant, counsel has informed the court and the defendant that he can find no legal basis sufficient to constitute a ground for appeal. Although no brief has been filed, this court, in accordance with our usual custom in such circumstances, has independently reviewed the record. It is our conclusion that counsel is correct in that we, too, find the appeal wholly devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">Although numerous witnesses were called by the prosecution, the testimony of defendant\u2019s common-law wife alone was amply sufficient to sustain the conviction. Additionally, the instructions given by the court fully and fairly instructed the jury upon all material elements of the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>And since the record discloses no procedural errors, nothing further need be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Van Dyke, P.
