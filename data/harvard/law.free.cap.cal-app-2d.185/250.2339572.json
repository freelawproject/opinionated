A motion for a new trial was denied. Probation was granted. Defendant appeals from the judgment (order granting probation) and the order denying a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">At the time in question William S. Biddle was and had been for about nine years a police officer of the city of Los Angeles. In February 1959 he was given a number of locations to check, apparently for bookmaking. Between February and June, while in uniform, he saw defendant \u201cmore than once.\u201d In February or March he saw defendant at 2128 South Hooper Street, a business establishment. Defendant approached Biddle and said he wanted to talk to him. Biddle said, \u201cAll right.\u201d Defendant said his bookmaking activities at 2128 South Hooper were being hampered by the extensive investigations conducted by the police. He asked Biddle if he had a \u201chard on for him,\u201d or if he had a personal grudge against him and that was why he was investigating his places so much; Biddle told defendant he was not mad at him, he and the police department \u201chad no hard on for him\u201d; it was part of his duties to conduct bookmaking investigations and he would continue to make them at defendant\u2019s locations. Defendant said, \u201cYou sure are hurting my business. Can\u2019t I do anything for you?\u201d Biddle replied, \u201cNo, there is nothing you can do for me.\u201d They parted.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">On June 22, 1959, Biddle, in uniform, went to an alley in south Los Angeles in response to a radio call. Defendant met him and said he wanted to talk to him. Biddle said he would not talk to him because his field supervisor and other officers were in the area. After handling the radio call, Biddle went to his police vehicle. Defendant walked to the vehicle and this conversation occurred: Defendant: \u201cYou sure are hurting my bookmaking business. Isn\u2019t there anything I can do for you? Do you want to take a little take?\u201d Biddle: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Defendant: \u201cWhiskey.\u201d Biddle: \u201cI am not interested in whiskey.\u201d Defendant told Biddle that if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>wanted the whiskey he could get all he wanted at a liquor store at 1501 Bast 22d Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Between June 22 and 30, Biddle arrested a man named Clemmons on a charge o\u00a3 bookmaking at an establishment operated by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Biddle saw defendant again on June 30,1959, at 2128 South Hooper. Biddle was in the establishment making an arrest of some person and asked \u201cWhere\u2019s Tommie Ray?\u201d Defendant entered the premises and told Biddle he would like to talk to him after he was through. Biddle, defendant, and the man under arrest walked out of the establishment. Biddle told the man under arrest to sit in the police car. Biddle and defendant walked to the corner. Defendant asked him why he did not pick up the whiskey. Biddle said he was not interested in whiskey. Defendant: \u201cWhat are you interested in?\u201d Biddle: \u201cWomen.\u201d Defendant: \u201cThat can be quite expensive.\u201d Biddle: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Biddle told defendant he did not want to talk to him in uniform while he was working, that if he wanted to talk to him to do it \u201cat an off-duty hour at a designated place.\u201d It was arranged they would meet at a park called South Park in Los Angeles at 10 a.m. on July 3, 1959. Defendant told Biddle he did not want to talk to him in an enclosed building or in either of their vehicles \u201cbecause of the fear of bugs, \u2019 \u2019 the meeting should be a casual one, they would walk through the park and accidentally bump into each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">About 10 a.m. on July 3, 1959, Biddle, accompanied by other officers in a separate vehicle, went to South Park. He had a microphone with a battery and a transmitter concealed on his person. He entered the park. The other officers did not accompany him. Defendant drove to near the park, left his car, and walked into the park. Defendant met Biddle, and in a low, whispering tone asked him if he were \u201cbugged or wired,\u201d and searched his outer clothing with his hands, feeling parts of his body. Biddle asked how business was, and defendant said, \u201cBad.\u201d Defendant asked Biddle, \u201cDo you want to take a little take?\u201d Biddle: \u201cOf whiskey?\u201d Defendant: \u201cNo.\u201d Biddle: \u201cI thought you were talking about something else.\u201d Defendant: \u201cYou name it.\u201d Biddle: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d Defendant: \u201cThen I\u2019ll have something to go on.\u201d Biddle: \u201cI know five books that you have.\u201d Defendant said he did not have more than three. Biddle: 1 \u2018 Oh, come off of it. You\u2019ve got more than three spots.\u201d Defendant laughed, again ran his hands up and down the sides of Biddle\u2019s body, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>held up four fingers. Biddle: \u201cWhat do you mean\u2014four bills a month?\u201d Defendant: \u201c$10 a week for each spot.\u201d Biddle: \u201cThen you got four places?\u201d Defendant: \u201cYou tell me what you want to do for it.\u201d Biddle : \u201cI never done [sic] anything like this before, so I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how much money you make. I don\u2019t know how your business is. All I know is I go in the book spots.\u201d Defendant: \u201cYou\u2019re hurting my business, coming in as often as you do.\u201d Biddle: \u201cLike you say, there\u2019s no reason to hit you like I do.\u201d Defendant laughed, held up his four fingers again, and said: \u201c$10 a week for each spot.\u201d Biddle: \u201c$10 a week for each spot? It\u2019s kind of low, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Defendant: \u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014just about right.\u201d Biddle: \u201cIt\u2019s worth $10 a spot. I\u2019m going to have to know where your four spots is [sic]. I thought you had five spots, three of them on Central there.\u201d After further conversation relative to the \u201cspots\u201d defendant operated, defendant said: \u201cDo you want to work by the week or the month?\u201d Biddle: \u201cWork by the week, I guess. It would be better, but how would I meet you? I don\u2019t want anyone else involved in this.\u201d Defendant: \u201cThere ain\u2019t nobody else involved in this.\u201d Biddle: \u201cIn other words, you\u2019ll pay me $10 a week for each spot?\u201d Defendant: \u201cYah.\u201d Biddle: \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you, huh?\u201d Defendant: \u201cI want you, you know, just, do what you\u2019ve been doing, naturally\u2014that\u2019s the thing you know\u2014keep nothing else away.\u2019\u2019 Biddle: \u201cIn other words, you want me to keep the heat away?\u201d Defendant: \u201cWell, do the best you can, you know what I mean\u2014you\u2019ll have to do it in a way\u2014you know-.\u201d Biddle: \u201cI know.\u201d Defendant: \u201cI mean just keep working normally, just break off lightly, you know. You don\u2019t have to do it sudden like, you know what I mean?\u201d Biddle: \u201cYah.\u201d Defendant: \u201cOtherwise, if you can\u2019t do no good\u2014enough to go there. Just remember I\u2019ll be on the street. ... I couldn\u2019t tell you you couldn\u2019t go there, because that\u2019s your business, you know what I mean? Otherwise, you and I have an understanding. You\u2019ve got a job to do and I\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d Biddle: \u201cSo you won\u2019t go more than $40 a week?\u201d Defendant: \u201cBusiness, you know\u2014of course-.\u201d Biddle: \u201cIn other words, whether you make it or not, I get my $40 ? \u2019 \u2019 Defendant: 11 That\u2019s right. \u2019 \u2019 Defendant took two $20 bills from his pocket, took Biddle\u2019s package of cigarettes, looked at it, handed Biddle the two bills and the package of cigarettes, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s for this week, that\u2019s for this week. Sunday week will be for next week, right?\u201d We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>related the material parts of the conversation. During the conversation other officers were parked nearby making a record of the conversation. Biddle took the two bills to the police internal affairs division where he recorded the serial numbers and placed them in a safe. Defendant was arrested on July 10,1959. During the period from about a week before June 22 to July 3 Biddle kept his superiors informed as to his contacts with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The only point urged for reversal is: \u201cIt is our contention that the money paid to Officer Biddle by the defendant-appellant Ray was paid only after Ray had been induced to do so by the policeman Biddle. It was entrapment. The idea of obtaining the money from Ray originated in the mind of Biddle; Ray had no intention at any time of bribing the officer.\u2019\u2019 This statement, of course, says the evidence shows as a matter of law that defendant was entrapped. The point cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Entrapment is a positive defense, imposing on an accused the burden of showing he was induced to commit the offense for which he is on trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 450, 455 [240 P.2d 1024].)  Entrapment is not established as a matter of law where there is any substantial evidence in the record from which it may be inferred that the criminal intent to commit the offense charged originated in the mind of the accused. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Malotte, </em>46 Cal.2d 59, 64-65 [292 P.2d 511].)  Merely affording an opportunity for the commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment.  \u201cWhere the doing of an act is a crime, regardless of the consent of anyone, the courts are agreed that if the criminal intent originates in the mind of the accused and the offense is completed, the fact that an opportunity was furnished, or that the accused is aided in the commission of the crime in order to secure the evidence necessary to prosecute him therefor, constitutes no defense.\u2019\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lindsey, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 914, 917 [203 P.2d 572].)  Where an accused has a pre-existing criminal intent, the fact that when solicited by a decoy he commits a crime does not show entrapment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benford, </em>53 Cal.2d 1, 10 [345 P.2d 928].)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">It is clearly inferable from the evidence that defendant was engaged in bookmaking. He had at least three such establishments and the police were investigating him. About a week before June 22, 1959, defendant approached Officer Biddle. In the course of the conversation he com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>plained about the activities of the police and asked the officer, \u201cCan\u2019t I do anything for you?\u201d Testimony of defendant to the effect the officer \u201cpropositioned\u201d him in this conversation merely created a conflict in the evidence. On June 22 defendant again approached the officer, said he wanted to talk to him, and added, \u201cYou sure are hurting my bookmaking business. Isn\u2019t there anything I can do for you? Do you want to take a little take?\u201d Defendant said he did not say <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>a little take, \u2019 \u2019 that he said \u2018 \u2018 a little taste, \u2019 \u2019 and was referring to whiskey. It was for the trial court to determine as a matter of fact whether he said \u201ca little take\u201d or \u201ca little taste.\u201d On June 30 defendant asked the officer why he did not pick up the whiskey. When the officer told defendant he was not interested in whiskey, defendant asked, \u201cWhat are you interested in?\u201d In testifying, defendant admitted he gave the officer $40 but claimed he did so through fear because the officer threatened to close his place of business unless he gave him money. Obviously the trial judge gave no credit to defendant\u2019s story. The trial court\u2019s determination of the veracity of a witness is final.  The existence or nonexistence of entrapment is a question of fact for the trier of fact. <em>(People </em>v. Castro, 167 Cal.App.2d 332, 337 [334 P.2d 602].)  The evidence warranted the court in inferring that defendant was not persuaded or lured but that he knowingly committed the offense, and that the idea of bribery did not originate in the mind of the officer but in the mind of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The judgment and order denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Shinn, P. J., and Ford, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
