A jury found appellant guilty of robbery of the first degree. He was acquitted of the charge of ear theft. He has appealed from the judgment and the order denying him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The record discloses that appellant spent the greater part of November 27, 1959, and the early hours of the following day, alternately in the Sierra Club, the Travelers Hotel bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>and back in the Sierra Club, in the city of Auburn, where his activities consisted of a combination of drinking, gambling, fighting and dancing. At approximately 2:15 a.m. on the morning of November 28th, appellant and one Richard Ottmann, an accomplice, left the Sierra Club, and drove to the residence of Ottmann in the latter\u2019s automobile. Upon arriving at Ottmann\u2019s home, appellant remained seated in the automobile. Ottmann entered his house and shortly thereafter returned to the car with two pairs of heavy workman\u2019s gloves, a jacket, two hats, a box of shotgun shells and a shotgun. Appellant stated that their purpose was, \u201cI guess he\u2014we was [sic] planning to rob a place or something. \u2019 \u2019 After appellant and Ottmann discussed robbing a service station, they drove to the vicinity of the Sierra College in Auburn, where Ottmann stole a light green 1956 Ford automobile with white sidewall tires. The shotgun and other paraphernalia acquired by Ottmann were transferred to the stolen car. Appellant put on the jacket, gloves and hat and the two men drove off, leaving Ottmann\u2019s ear behind. Ottmann sat in the back seat with the shotgun for greater maneuverability of the weapon. The first stop was at a Standard service station on United States Highway 40 near Lou LaBonte\u2019s restaurant. Appellant pulled into the service station and told Ottmann, \u201cget the attendant.\u201d Ottmann replied, \u201cGo on out of here,\u201d and they left before the attendant arrived. When they were back on the highway, appellant asked Ottmann whether he was \u2018 \u2018 chicken. \u2019 \u2019 Thereupon appellant turned the automobile around and again drove to the same service station. Ottmann, however, once more refused to act and when the attendant arrived he was merely asked to check the oil. They drove to the Hilltop Standard station in Auburn, where the robbery was committed. The station attendant testified that one of the occupants of the ear sat in the back seat, wore a white bandana over his face, and pointed a gun at him through the window. He ordered the attendant to empty the cash box in a hurry. The attendant took the entire tray containing approximately $44 in cash and handed it to Ottmann through the rear window of the automobile. After the robbery appellant drove toward Ophir, where they left the highway and stopped on a dirt road where the money was divided. They drove to Loomis and thence to Roseville where appellant and Ottmann were arrested and taken to the Roseville Police Station. The loaded shotgun, the box of shotgun shells, the gloves and hat were all found in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>During the booking procedure in the Roseville Police Station, appellant admitted driving the car used in the robbery but denied having anything to do with the gun or the actual taking of the money. At the same time it was noted that he wore a white handkerchief around his neck and was wearing a heavy jacket. The booking officer testified that appellant said, \u201che\u2019d been drinking quite a bit, couldn\u2019t remember quite a bit of it, didn\u2019t know why they did it. . . He further testified that appellant said part of the money he had in his coat pocket belonged to the service station. Appellant later that morning, after having been removed to the Auburn Police Station, requested to see Police Chief Young. This was arranged. Police Chief Young testified that immediately upon his arrival appellant said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get me out of here. What\u2019s my bail, . . .,\u201d to which he replied, \u201cI have nothing to do with establishing bail. That will be done by the Court.\u201d Appellant then stated, \u201cWhy did I get mixed up in this anyway for nine lousy bucks? That's all I got out of it. I don\u2019t need nine bucks. I don\u2019t [need] money. . . . You have some pull around here. ... If you would just open that door, you would never see me again. I\u2019d take off. I \u2019ll leave the country. \u2019 \u2019 On November 30, 1959, a recorded conversation was had between appellant and A. B. McParlane, investigator for the district attorney\u2019s office. During that conversation appellant stated that upon leaving the Sierra Club and arriving at Ottmann\u2019s home, \u201cHe [Ottmann] went up and got the shotgun and coat and gloves. Then he put those in the car. Then he went back up and got me a coat and pair of gloves.\u201d He was asked, \u201cWhy did he get the coat and gloves?\u201d and answered, \u201cLike I\u2014I guess he\u2014we were planning to rob a place or something.\u201d He further stated that he had worn the leather jacket and gloves supplied by Ottmann and that he had a white handkerchief \u201cknotted up in front of my face.\u201d Investigator McParlane also testified that in an earlier interview appellant said, \u201che believed they were going to rob somebody. I asked him why they used the jackets, hats and gloves, and he said he believed it was for the purpose of disguising their identification so no one would recognize them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Several witnesses testified that appellant was in a very intoxicated condition throughout the evening and when he left the Sierra Club on the morning of the robbery. There was also testimony that at the age of 17 years appellant suffered a serious head injury which resulted in a marked change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in his personality; that his reputation for truth and honesty was good but when intoxicated his conduct was distinctly altered for the worse. Appellant, himself, testified that while he could remember leaving the Sierra Club, going to Ottmann\u2019s house, wearing the jacket, gloves and hat, the theft of the automobile by Ottmann, the driving into the first Standard station near LaBonte\u2019s restaurant, and their subsequently being stopped and arrested in Roseville, he nevertheless had no recollection of any participation in the robbery of the Hilltop service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">A psychiatrist, a defense witness, testified that in his opinion appellant was not conscious of his actions at the time of the robbery. Dr. G. Dean Tipton, Medical Director and Superintendent of DeWitt State Hospital, a licensed medical doctor and psychiatrist, a witness for the prosecution, however expressed the opinion that appellant was aware of what was taking place on the night of the robbery. His opinion was based upon the facts told him by appellant and from his examination of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> Appellant requested the following instructions which were refused by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201cYou are also instructed that you must acquit the defendant if you have a reasonable doubt that he was actually conscious of the acts being committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cYou are instructed that if you have a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s intent then you must acquit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Appellant contends that since his main defense was a lack of consciousness of the act committed the refusal to give these particular instructions was prejudicial error. There is no merit in this contention. The record discloses that the trial court gave the following instructions on the subject matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuJ\">\u201cSection 26 of the Penal Code of the State of California states: Persons Capable of Committing Crime, Exceptions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">\u2018 \u2018 All persons are capable of committing crimes except those belonging to the following classes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\u201cSubdivision 5. Persons who committed the act <em>charged </em>e\u00a5 rnado the emission without being conscious thereof.\u201d (Italicized word added in ink.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">\u201cIn the case of certain crimes it is necessary that in addition to the intended act which characterizes the offense, the act must be accompanied by a specific or particular intent without which such a crime may not be committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">\u201cThus in the crime of robbery, a necessary element is the existence in the mind of the perpetrator of the specific intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>to steal <em>permanently deprived the owner of his property, </em>and unless such intent so exists, that crime is not committed.\u201d (Italicized words added in ink.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cWhenever the actual existence of any particular purpose, motive or intent is a necessary element to constitute any particular species or degree of crime, the jury may take into consideration the fact that the accused was intoxicated at the time, in determining the purpose, motive or intent with which he committed the act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201cThus the defendant may not be found guilty of the crime of . . . <em>robbery . . . </em>unless you can and do find from the evidence that he had the <em>specific </em>intent to permanently deprive the owner of his . . . <em>property. </em>This fact requires an inquiry into the state of mind under which the defendant committed the act charged, if he did commit it. In pursuing that inquiry, it is proper to consider whether he was intoxicated at the time of the alleged offense. The weight to be given the evidence on that question and the significance to attach to it, in relation to all the other evidence, are exclusively within your province.\u201d (Italicized words added in ink.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201cFor the purpose of the issues now on trial, you must presume that the defendant was sane at the time of his alleged conduct, which, it is charged, constituted the crime described in the information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u201cYou are reminded, however, that a person may be legally sane, as we define that term in dealing with the question of criminal responsibility, and yet be in an abnormal mental or nervous condition; and because of such condition, he might be less likely or unable to have or hold a specific intent or a certain state of mind, which as\u2014is an essential ingredient of a certain crime. We have received evidence bearing on the mental and nervous condition of the defendant at the time of the alleged commission of the crimes charged. Such evidence may be considered by you in determining whether or not the defendant did (the) (any) overt act charged against him and, if so, whether or not at that time there existed in him the specific mental factor which, as you have been instructed, must accompany that act to constitute a certain crime or degree of crime....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The record also discloses that the trial court gave complete instructions on the subject of reasonable doubt. Thus, it appears that the jury was fully and fairly instructed upon the subject matter presented by defendant\u2019s proposed instructions.  \u201c When the jury are fully and fairly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>structed upon a subject it is not error for the trial court to refuse defendant\u2019s proposed instructions which are mere repetitions. The court is not required to state the law to the jury-more than once, but may, as a general rule, refuse requested instructions which are fully covered by other instructions.  A defendant in any given case is not entitled to have his own particular phrasing of the law adopted by the court or given to the jury. It is sufficient if the substance of the law applicable to his case is set forth by the court correctly in its instructions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Parchen, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 215, 223 [98 P.2d 1045]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Pineda, </em>41 Cal.App.2d 100 [106 P.2d 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Appellant also contends that there is insufficient evidence to corroborate the testimony of the accomplice, Ottmann. We find no merit in this contention. Appellant\u2019s own admissions, as hereinabove related, tending to connect him with the robbery, furnish sufficient corroboration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 42, 44 [198 P.2d 58], citing cases.) Appellant had in his possession money stolen from the service station.  Possession of stolen property alone has been held sufficient to corroborate an accomplice\u2019s testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wynkoop, </em>165 Cal.App.2d 540 [331 P.2d 1040].)  Further the evidence, aside from the testimony of the accomplice, places appellant in the driver\u2019s seat of the automobile which was directly used in the robbery. This sufficiently corroborates the testimony of Ottmann, the accomplice.  As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>50 Cal.2d 245, 257 [324 P.2d 556]: \u201cThe evidence need not corroborate the accomplice as to every fact to which he testifies but is sufficient if it does not require interpretation and direction from the testimony of the accomplice yet tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense in such a way as reasonably may satisfy a jury that the accomplice is telling the truth; it must tend to implicate the defendant and therefore must relate to some act or fact which is an element of the crime but it is not necessary that the corroborative evidence be sufficient in itself to establish every element of the offense charged. [Citing cases.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Appellant also contends that there is no evidence tending to constitute a confession and therefore the trial court committed prejudicial error by giving the jury an instruction on confession. The court gave instructions defining the terms \u201cconfession\u201d and \u201cadmission.\u201d Concerning \u201cconfession\u201d the court instructed: \u201cThe law absolutely forbids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>you to consider a confession in determining the innocence or guilt of a defendant unless the confession was voluntarily made, and although the Court has admitted evidence tending to show that the defendant made a confession, you must disregard the asserted confession entirely unless you, yourselves, by your own weighing of all the evidence, your own judging of the credibility of the witnesses, and your own reasonable deductions, conclude that the alleged confession was not only made, but was voluntary.\u201d It is clear from the record that no statement of the appellant in the nature of a confession was proved, although the appellant, as hereinabove quoted, made various conflicting statements which constituted admissions. None or all of the statements could be construed as measuring up to a confession, hence, as this court stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Nielson, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 20, 29 [6 Cal.Rptr. 367], \u201c. . . Under such circumstances it was error to instruct on confessions, and the court misinformed the jury when it told them that it admitted evidence tending to show that the defendant had made a confession.\u201d . . [A] confession by a defendant leaves nothing to be determined, in that it is a declaration of his intentional participation in a criminal act, and must be a statement of such nature that no other inference than the guilt of the defendant may be drawn therefrom. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ferdinand, </em>194 Cal. 555, 568-569 [229 P. 341]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Chan Chaun, </em>41 Cal.App.2d 586, 593 [107 P.2d 455].) In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Nielson, supra, </em>in discussing \u201cconfessions\u201d and \u201cadmissions,\u201d the court further told the jury that though a confession must be shown to have been voluntary that rule would not apply to admissions. This, too, was error, hence there is no distinction in law in this respect between admissions and confessions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Atchley, </em>53 Cal.2d 160, 170 [346 P.2d 764].) Further, as in the Nielson case, <em>supra, </em>at page 29, \u201c. . . the principal error lay in the statement by the court that it had received evidence tending to show a confession when the fact was otherwise, for this was a characterization of evidence which the jury might well have considered was the court\u2019s estimate of the legal effect of statements made bjr the appellant. ...\u201d In the instant case, as in the Nielson case, \u201cThere was actually no claim by the prosecution that the appellant had confessed and an examination of the record shows that no such position was taken in argument. Argument was, of course, addressed to the admissions made, as was proper, but nothing was said in the way of a claim that the appellant had ever confessed the crime with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>which he was charged. In weighing the effect of the error we are discussing, we must bear in mind that the jury were instructed after the arguments were in and that the court\u2019s instructions were the last words spoken to the jurors before they began their deliberations. The court\u2019s statement that evidence had been received tending to show a confession, coupled with the court\u2019s definition of that term, and the further instruction concerning how the jury should determine whether a confession had been made, and if so, whether it had been voluntary, compel a reversal....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The information charged in Count I a violation of section 10851 of the Vehicle Code (car theft), and in Count II a violation of section 211 of the Penal Code (robbery). Appellant contends that these offenses were not connected together in their commission and were not different offenses of the same class of crimes within the meaning of section 954 of the Penal Code and therefore the trial court erred in overruling his demurrer to the information on those grounds. We find no merit in this contention. The record discloses that the automobile was stolen for the purpose, and used in the commission, of the robbery. The shotgun and other articles used in the robbery were transported in the stolen automobile. An accusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 954.) Further, as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Chessman, </em>52 Cal.2d 467, 492 [341 P.2d 679], . .It appears that the situation here comes within the holding of cases which permit joinder of offenses, even though they do not relate to the same transaction and were committed at different times and places and against different victims, where there is a common element of substantial importance in their commission. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We do not deem it necessary to discuss other assignments of error claimed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The judgment and the order denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Van Dyke, P. J., and Schottky, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 4, 1960, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 7, 1960.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
