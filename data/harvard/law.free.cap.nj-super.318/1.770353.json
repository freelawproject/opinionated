Cassidy, a County Detective since 1986, was assigned to the Tactical Narcotics Team Unit since its inception in 1991. The main objective of that unit \u201cis to arrest individuals who are street-level narcotics violators in known narcotics distribution areas.\u201d It is a \u201chigh-visibility unit.\u201d Its personnel drives \u201cstandard unmarked police vehicles,\u201d and wear badges around their necks and shirts with the State Police logo.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">On January 4, 1994, at approximately 10:18 p.m., Detectives Cassidy, Mayo and another officer were driving through the vicinity of 123 North Fifth Avenue in Long Branch, \u201ca known narcotics area.\u201d The area had been identified as such through \u201csurveillance,\u201d \u201cnarcotics purchases,\u201d \u201cintelligence,\u201d \u201cprior narcotics arrests\u201d and \u201cnumerous complaints,\u201d including those via a police \u201chot line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">On the evening in question, Cassidy observed defendant standing in the driveway of 123 North Fifth Avenue. As the unmarked police ear approached, defendant walked down the driveway \u201ctowards the street,\u201d \u201clooked at the vehicle\u201d and then \u201cturned around and walked back up to the driveway [to] where he was initially standing.\u201d The vehicle\u2019s \u201chigh beams\u201d permitted good visibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Cassidy testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">Based on my training and experience with narcotics enforcement in drug areas, individuals that sell drugs will stand in a more hidden area, and when a vehicle approaches, they approach the roadway in order to get that oncoming vehicle\u2019s attention in case they want drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">There were no \u201cbarriers\u201d impeding or \u201climiting access\u201d to, or a view of, the driveway from the street, and upon observing defendant\u2019s actions, Cassidy \u201cdrove the police car into the driveway,\u201d leaving the \u201ctail end of the vehicle\u201d in or near the street. While the vehicle was still in motion and \u201cprior to stopping,\u201d Cassidy \u201cobserved [defendant] drop an item from his left hand which fell onto the driveway.\u201d The ear then came to a complete stop and was placed in park. The police had no contact with defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>before Cassidy saw him make the drop. As the officers exited their vehicle, defendant took \u201cone to two steps forward from where he dropped that item.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Cassidy approached defendant and asked his name, to which defendant replied \u201cRonald Gibson.\u201d Defendant was asked why he was in that driveway and why he walked down and back up the driveway when he observed the approaching vehicle. Defendant stated that he lived in the house at 123 North Fifth Avenue, \u201cthought we were somebody else,\u201d and \u201cwalked back up the driveway\u201d upon realizing his mistake. After defendant stated again that he lived in the adjoining residence, Cassidy stated his belief that defendant, in fact, \u201cresided in the red house across the street,\u201d which defendant then admitted. According to Cassidy, defendant \u201cadmitted he lived across the street, not at the house he was standing in the driveway of.\u201d Cassidy further testified that, although he had never before met defendant, he had knowledge of him because \u201cwhen we go into certain areas, we make a note of known drug areas, known drug houses, the local drug dealers\u2019 names.\u201d After speaking with defendant and while Mayo watched defendant, Cassidy walked to the area where he observed defendant drop the item and, with the aid of a flashlight, retrieved the evidence in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">At the subsequent trial it was developed that the officers observed defendant drop a glove and that Cassidy picked up a small chunk of cocaine, a razor blade and a glove which contained \u201can additional package\u201d of crack cocaine and heroin. On cross-examination during the trial, Cassidy further stated that the reason for ascertaining defendant\u2019s place of residence was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">It showed that he was not being honest with his replies to my questions. He was attempting to conceal something: the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">The motion judge found Detective Cassidy to be \u201cvery credible.\u201d The judge specifically noted that Cassidy did not \u201cgo right over to\u201d the dropped item and did so only after conducting a \u201cfield investigation of [defendant].\u201d The judge further stated that confirmation of defendant\u2019s residence, and thus his willingness to lie, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>resulted in \u201ca reasonable suspicion that the explanation that was given was also potentially a fabrication, that he was looking for somebody else in the car and turned around when he found out that it was not that individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Based on the facts as set forth by Detective Cassidy, the judge concluded that this was \u201cnot a <em>Tucker </em>situation,\u201d <em>see State v. Tucker, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>358, 627 A.2d 174 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>158, 642 A.2d 401 (1994), and in fact, it was really a <em>\u201cState [v.] Alexander </em>situation of a step-up of the circumstances.\u201d <em>See State v. Alexander, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 468 A.2d 713 (App.Div.1983), <em>certif. denied, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>267, 475 A.2d 570 (1984). Citing <em>Tucker, </em>the court found that no coercion, either physical or otherwise, forced defendant to abandon the later seized item that he previously had in his possession. And citing <em>Alexander, </em>the judge stated that, standing alone, Cassidy\u2019s experience and the fact that this situation occurred in the \u201cdead of winter, 10:18 at night, [in] a high drug-crime area\u201d would not by itself create an articulable suspicion. However, the judge concluded that the totality of the circumstances, including defendant\u2019s \u201cabandon[ment] [of] the item\u201d \u201cbefore the police did anything or said anything\u201d (other than pulling into the driveway), the \u201cfield investigation\u201d resulting in defendant\u2019s willingness to lie, and revelation of defendant\u2019s identity as an alleged drug dealer, gave rise to \u201can articulable suspicion\u201d to \u201c[go] over and seiz[e]\u201d the \u201cabandoned\u201d item. The court further held that irrespective of \u201cany articulable suspicion,\u201d defendant\u2019s constitutional right to privacy was not violated by the police because \u201cthe action of pulling into the driveway did not violate [d]efendant\u2019s rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">New Jersey has long recognized that a temporary street-detention based on less than probable cause may be constitutional. In a <em>pre-Terry </em>decision, we recognized that a police officer\u2019s duties include vital preventive roles and that reason and common sense dictate \u201che should clearly have the right to stop persons on the street for summary inquiry where, as here, the circumstances are so highly suspicious as to call for such an inquiry.\u201d <em>State v. Dilley, </em>[49 <em>N.J. </em>460, 464, 231 A.2d 353 (1967) ]. In determining the reasonableness of the detention, we conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ed that all factors must be balanced, including the basis of suspicion on the part of the police officer and the nature and extent of the restraint on the individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">In sum, to determine the lawfulness of a given seizure under New Jersey law, it is incumbent upon a reviewing court to evaluate the totality of circumstances surrounding the police-citizen encounter, balancing the State\u2019s interest in effective law enforcement against the individual\u2019s right to be protected from unwarranted and/or overbearing police intrusions. An investigatory stop is valid only if the officer has a \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d based upon an objective observation that the person stopped has been or is about to engage in criminal wrongdoing. The \u201carticulable reasons\u201d or \"particularized suspicion\u201d of criminal activity must be based upon the law enforcement officer\u2019s assessment of the totality of circumstances with which he is faced. Such observations are those that, in view of officer\u2019s experience and knowledge, taken together with rational inferences drawn from those facts, reasonablfy] warrant the limited intrusion upon the individual\u2019s freedom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\"><em>[State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 503-04, 517 A.2d 859 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\"><em>See also State v. Donis, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>44, 63, 723 A.2d 35 (1998) (Stein, J. concurring); <em>State v. Citarella, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>272, 278-80, 712 A.2d 1096 (1998); <em>State v. Arthur, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7-10, 691 A.2d 808 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">In deciding the validity of an investigatory stop, the evaluating court must \u201cgive weight to \u2018the officer\u2019s knowledge and experience\u2019 as well as \u2018rational inferences that could be drawn from the facts objectively and reasonable viewed in light of the officer\u2019s expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Citarella, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 278, 712 A.2d 1096 (quoting <em>State v. Arthur, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 10-11, 691 A.2d 808). In determining whether a reasonable suspicion exists, the court must engage in a factual inquiry as to the observations made by the police at the time of the stop, thereby basing its determination on the totality of the circumstances. <em>See State v. Arthur, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 11-12, 691 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">In the present case, Cassidy, the only witness at the motion hearing, testified that he observed defendant involved in furtive conduct in a known narcotics area attempting to approach an oncoming vehicle from a hidden area and retreating when he saw who was approaching. Like the trial judge, however, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>decide whether those observations by themselves gave rise to a \u2018\u201cparticularized suspicion\u2019 based upon an objective observation\u201d that defendant \u201chas been or is about to engage in criminal wrongdoing,\u201d <em>State v. Donis, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 63, 723 A.2d 35 (Stein, J. concurring), so as to justify an investigatory stop. The fact is that defendant dropped the drugs <em>before </em>there was any investigatory stop or questioning. Thus, the critical question, as the case is presented to us, is whether the police could enter the driveway, even if to make an investigatory stop. For if they could, the events that followed were justified by the observation of defendant dropping an item and walking away from it, independent of his answers to their questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Defendant argues that the driveway is a \u201ccurtilage\u201d to his residence and that, in any event, he had a reasonable expectation of privacy from unlawful police intrusion on the driveway of the home where he actually lived. Given our holding, we need not examine whether there is any evidentiary basis for the assertion, in connection with the motion to suppress, that defendant lived in the adjoining house. At the trial defendant testified that he was forced to say \u201cI live across the street with my mom [and so said] because I didn\u2019t want no problems\u201d with the police. At trial, defendant also testified that \u201cmy mother owns both houses that are in question\u201d and that he was living \u201cin the downstairs apartment\u201d of 123 North Fifth Avenue. However, there was no such testimony at the motion to suppress and no evidentiary basis for defendant\u2019s curtilage contention. We take this opportunity to remind the parties that on appeal \u201cwe may only consider whether the motion to suppress was properly decided based on the evidence presented at that time.\u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 76, 278 A.2d 223 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>293, 281 A.2d 806 (1971). <em>See also, e.g., Simmons v.

Here, defendant\u2019s movement about the driveway, whether it was owned by him, his mother or any other person, was within the public view and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>observed from the public thoroughfare. Although the driveway was close to the house, the fence along the front of the house did not prevent entrance through the normal and expected use of the driveway, and the driveway was clearly observable from the street. <em>Cf. State v. Ball, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 507, 530 A.2d 833. Accordingly, defendant could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Property is abandoned when one \u201cvoluntarily discards, leaves behind or otherwise relinquishes his interest in the property in question so that he can no longer retain a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to it at the time of the search.\u201d <em>State v.

The trial judge\u2019s finding that defendant abandoned the property he dropped on the driveway is supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>See State v.

The State argues to the contrary because the offenses \u201crelated to two distinguishable groups of drugs,\u201d and the trial judge found there were \u201ctwo separate, distinct findings on that driveway and in the glove.\u201d However, the jury was not instructed that different substances related to different counts, nor did the verdict sheet which asked whether defendant possessed or possessed with intent to distribute \u201ceither cocaine or heroin.\u201d The judge\u2019s charge did not in any way distinguish between the substances relating to either count,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the record suggests that defendant was simultaneously holding all substances (perhaps some inside and some outside the glove) at the time they were dropped. In the absence of a special verdict, we do not know if the jury found that defendant possessed heroin, cocaine, or both, and if cocaine, whether defendant was found to possess all that was retrieved by the police. Nor do we know if the jury found that defendant intended to distribute both substances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, the convictions must merge. <em>Cf. State v.
