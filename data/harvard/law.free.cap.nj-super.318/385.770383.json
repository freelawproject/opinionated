The municipality seeks injunctive relief against an alleged public nuisance. A claim for damages also is asserted. The Village of Ridgefield Park contends that various activities by the railroad on its right-of-way and side tracks along the Hackensack River in Bergen County are annoying adjacent citizens and damaging their properties. The Law Division judge denied all relief on the ground of federal preemption by railroad regulation and granted summary judgment to the railroad. We affirm, with modification. We conclude that plaintiff and the citizens must first seek relief from federal authorities, who may choose to defer, at least to some extent, to state regulation under the police powers customarily reserved to the states where citizens claim damage and oppression from a public nuisance generated by an interstate railroad. Our affirmance of the summary judgment is without prejudice to the municipality\u2019s and its citizens\u2019 rights to move to reopen the matter at the trial level, if the federal regulatory authority either declines to entertain the claim on the merits or finds justification for state action in the circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Plaintiff Village of Ridgefield Park (Village) in Bergen County, population 12,500, brought this complaint in four counts to enjoin defendant New York Susquehanna &amp; Western Railway Corporation (the railroad) from using property the railroad owns as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>right-of-way in plaintiff Village and now uses as a railroad maintenance facility. Before 1992 defendant\u2019s 125-foot right-of-way located in the Village consisted of a single railroad track used only for moving freight trains through the municipality. In 1992 the railroad relocated its maintenance facility from a remote section of the Borough of Ridgefield, to the south, called the Little Ferry Yard, to its right-of-way in the Village near residential homes, a funeral home, and a public park. The railroad did not obtain any construction or land-use permits from the Village and will not allow the Village to perform any routine safety, health and fire inspections on railroad facilities in the right-of-way through the Village. The railroad alleges federal preemption prevents plaintiff from invoking routine local police powers. Complaints by the Village and its residents include continuous noise from as many as a dozen idling locomotive engines near residences which occurs even into the night hours, vibration of houses caused by these idling locomotive engines, soot on homes, unpleasant odor caused by diesel fumes, bright lights during the night, fear of dangerous diesel fuel leakage if defendant\u2019s fuel tanks are not properly equipped with secondary containment systems, and a reduction in property values. Two of the four counts of plaintiff\u2019s rather generalized complaint for injunctive relief also demand judgment for compensatory damages. No local individuals, property owners, or citizens are joined as plaintiffs. The Village itself describes no particularized damage to municipal property. For this reason, we view this essentially as an action for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Plaintiff raises these four issues on its appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">I. Whether the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 addresses only the economic regulation of railroads and does not preempt the Village from exercising its police power in the areas of safety, health and welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">II. Whether the judge\u2019s decision in granting summary judgment to defendant on the issue of breach of contract was in error and should be reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">III. Whether the Appellate Division should exercise original jurisdiction under <em>R. </em>2:10-5 to grant the Village summary judgment on its public nuisance claims as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>IV. Whether the judge erred in dismissing plaintiff Village\u2019s federal Oil Pollution Act claim as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">This is the procedural context. Plaintiff Village filed this complaint on November 18, 1993 against the railroad seeking an injunction to stop the railroad from operating its locomotive refueling and light-maintenance facility (facility) near the residential section. In 1992 the railroad had relocated this facility from a more remote section of the Borough of Ridgefield, to the south of the Village, known as Little Ferry Yard. The Village sought a judicial order requiring the railroad to obtain site-plan approval and other local permits and approvals, to permit municipal inspections, and to cease its annoying refueling and maintenance operations. Plaintiff further alleges the railroad breached an implied contract to construct an engine house designed to minimize noise and air pollution from its maintenance operations in the Village. Plaintiff also alleged the railroad was in violation of local zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">On November 5, 1996 the railroad filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim or in the alternative for summary judgment. The railroad\u2019s affirmative defenses included the assertion that any claims by the Village were preempted by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, were barred by failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and constituted an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. On February 18, 1997 the Village filed a response to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint or summary judgment and a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">On February 6, 1998 Judge Sciuto heard oral arguments and entered an order dismissing plaintiffs complaint and granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, essentially on federal preemption grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The railroad is a \u201ccommon carrier engaged in the business of transporting goods in interstate commerce.\u201d Since 1893 the railroad had used a site called \u201cThe Little Ferry Yard\u201d as its railroad terminal. This yard was located in the Borough of Ridgefield, more remote from local residences and south of Overpeck Creek, the border between the Borough and the Village, and also on the Hackensack River. This \u201cLittle Ferry Yard\u201d consisted of a roundhouse, turntable, sand tower, maintenance facility and various shops used to service and maintain railroad equipment. In the 1980\u2019s the railroad expanded the Little Ferry Yard \u201cto accommodate additional freight traffic\u201d and unloading of cargo in the yard. The railroad also owned the subject 125-foot right-of-way, traversing the western edge of the Village along the course of the Hackensack River in an area zoned 1-1 for \u201clight industrial\u201d uses. Prior to 1992 the right-of-way in the Village had consisted of one track used for freight trains to pass through. To the east, between the bluff and immediately adjacent to defendant\u2019s right-of-way in the Village, Conrail owns a single-track right-of-way used for through-train traffic only. The railroad\u2019s right-of-way in the Village is bordered on the west by the Hackensack River and a strip of light-industrial uses along the bank of the river. The heavily-traveled Ridgefield Avenue and Bergen Turnpike is to the east of the Conrail track. The residential area and small park subject of the plaintiffs complaint on behalf of its citizens sits on a high bluff, just east of Ridgefield Avenue and the Bergen Turnpike. The north boundary of the precise site of the railroad\u2019s servicing, maintenance, switching and other operations in the Village right-of-way is the overpass of State Highway 46. Interstate Route 80 is several hundred yards north of Highway 46. Interstate 95 is about one-half mile to the east of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In 1991 the railroad sold its Little Ferry Yard and railroad terminal to CSX Rail Systems (CSX) for twenty-one million dollars so it could \u201cbenefit from additional rail traffic from the CSX operations into the Ridgefield site.\u201d After the sale, CSX <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>refused to allow the railroad to continue its refueling and light-maintenance operations at the Little Ferry site at the Borough of Ridgefield. This required the railroad to relocate its so-called \u201clight-maintenance\u201d facility to its approximately 125-foot right-of-way located in the Village, where some side-track was added.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Plaintiff alleged that in May and June of 1992 the railroad began constructing several new facilities on the Village site: a thirty to forty-foot sand tower, together with permanent installation of fuel oil tank cars, pumps to distribute the fuel oil, a servicing or lube oil tank, and permanent railroad boxcars used as shops, offices and septic and sanitary facilities. The railroad did not obtain any zoning or construction permits for these improvements. The railroad admits that refueling and servicing takes place at the Village site; this includes: \u201cadding diesel fuel to the fuel tank of the locomotive; adding engine oil to the crankcase; adding water to the radiators; and adding sand to the on-board holding tanks for traction in wet rail conditions.\u201d Recently, a permanent fuel tank was installed, allegedly with secondary containment safeguards, which defendant asserts now meets EPA approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">[This section, containing a very detailed factual recital, is redacted for publication purposes as unnecessary for understanding the preemption principles here implicated. <em>R. </em>1:36-3.]</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Judge Sciuto heard oral arguments on the summary judgment cross motions on February 6, 1998. At argument the railroad\u2019s attorney claimed the maintenance facility located in the Village \u201cis not a maintenance yard in the truest sense\u201d but that it is \u201cjust a refueling stop.\u201d He explained that long-range trains, destined for the Village and ultimately the Little Ferry Yard, coming from the west coast carry containers shipped from the Orient. These one-to-two-mile-long trains destined for the Village do not arrive at any scheduled time. Defendant\u2019s attorney said there was no way of predicting when the trains arrive and that they could arrive during the early hours of the morning. The containers remain under U.S. Custom seal until they arrive at the railroad facility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>He said Custom\u2019s officers break the containers\u2019 seals at the Village facility. He said the railroad also refuels and reoils these long-range trains at the facility located in the Village. He said the railroad facility \u201cservices the four or five locomotives it takes to pull a train [one to two-miles] long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Judge Sciuto relied on a Georgia Federal District Court case, <em>Norfolk Southern Railway Co. &amp; Central of Ga RR Co. v. City of Austell, </em>Docket No. 1:97-cv-1018-RLV (N.D.Ga., August 19, 1997), (not otherwise officially reported) in determining the ICC Termination Act of 1995, 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7\u00a7 701-727; \u00a7\u00a7 10101-16105, absolutely preempted the Village\u2019s police powers in the circumstance. He quoted the <em>Austell </em>federal judge\u2019s statement that the Act \u201cwas passed in an effort to reduce regulation of railroads and other modes of surface transportation.\u201d Judge Sciuto concluded that the railroad\u2019s activities in the Village including fueling, oiling and sanding the trains promotes its overall railroad operation. He agreed with the <em>Austell </em>holding that the remedies provided under the ICC Termination Act demonstrated Congress\u2019 intention to preempt state regulatory authority over railroad operations. The judge found the railroad\u2019s operations were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Regarding the noise and pollution nuisance issues, Judge Sciuto said plaintiff should seek redress from the \u201cSurface Transportation Board or other federal agency which regulates air emissions or oil pollution emissions,\u201d not from the court. Regarding the engine-house contract issue, the judge found there was no meeting of the minds, and if discussion about a contract was made in an effort to settle a dispute, any evidence of a concession would be excluded by <em>N.J.R.E. </em>408 regarding settlements or proposals of settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICC Termination Act or Act) replaced the Interstate Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Commission with the Surface Transportation Board (Board or STB). 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 701. The ICC Termination Act became effective January 1,1996. Pub.L. No. 104 \u2014 88 (1995) (codified at 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 701 to 727 and 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10101 to 16105). The Board has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier which is \u201conly by railroad.\u201d 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>10501(a) and (b). The Act\u2019s preemption clause is broad: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the Board over ... the construction, acquisition, operation ... of ... facilities, even if the tracks are located, or intended to be located, entirely in one State, is exclusive. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under Federal or State Law.\u201d 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 10501(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Village argues the ICC Termination Act does not completely preempt the police powers of the State of New Jersey and its municipalities. The Village argues preemption by federal law is not favored in areas where state police power has routinely been exercised unless the legislation clearly displaces the state police power. The Village asserts that because the ICC Termination Act does not explicitly bar all state action, its police powers are still extant. Plaintiff also argues that the judge erred in dismissing its nuisance claim because the ICC Termination Act does not preempt state action designed to protect public health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The railroad asserts the ICC Termination Act \u201cpreempts local regulations that conflict with or frustrate Congress\u2019 delegation of regulatory authority to the [Surface Transportation Board], which, within its scope, is exclusive.\u201d The railroad also argues plaintiffs nuisance claim was properly preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">A defendant relying on an affirmative defense has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 435, 648 A.2d 223 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995); <em>Pagano v. United Jersey Bank, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 500, 648 A.2d 269 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>220, 670 A.2d 509 (1996). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>railroad raises preemption as an affirmative defense and has the burden of persuasion to demonstrate the Village\u2019s claims are indeed preempted. <em>R. 4:5-4; </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Rules, </em>Comment <em>R. 4:5-4 </em>[13A\u2014railroads]. <em>See also Maher v. New Jersey Transit R.O., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>455, 463, 593 A.2d 750 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declares \u201c[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. X. The preemption doctrine is rooted in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. de la Cuesta, </em>458 <em>U.S. </em>141, 153, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982). The Supremacy Clause states, \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land____\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>art VI, cl. 2. In conducting a preemption analysis, the \u201cdomain expressly preempted\u201d by the statutory language must be identified, keeping in mind two considerations. <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>470, 484-85,116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). First, courts should \u201cstart with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>504, 545-46, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992). Second, \u201cany understanding of the scope of a pre-emption statute must rest primarily on \u2018a fair understanding of congressional purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485-86, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240 (citing <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. </em>at 530, n. 27, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2608)(opinion of Justice Stevens)). The overriding principle in a preemption analysis is whether Congress intended to preempt state law and power. <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>at 494, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240; <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>at 516, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2608; <em>Strasenburgh v. Straubmuller, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>527, 539, 683 A.2d 818 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Congress\u2019 intent is \u201cprimarily discerned from the language of the pre-emption statute and the statutory framework <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>surrounding it.\u201d <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>at 486, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240. \u201cThe clearest indication of [the Legislature\u2019s intent] is the statutory language.\u201d <em>Medical Soc. of N.J. v. N.J. Dept. of Law &amp; Public Safety, </em>420 <em>N.J. </em>18, 26, 575 A.2d 1348 (1990). A court should \u201clook first to the statute\u2019s plain language to derive its meaning, absent any specific indication of legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Town of Morristown v. Woman\u2019s Club, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>605, 610, 592 A.2d 216 (1991). \u201cWhere a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court may not impose an interpretation other than the statute\u2019s ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Munoz v. New Jersey Auto. Full Ins. Underwriting, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>377, 384, 678 A.2d 1051 (1996). The legislative history and the announced policy surrounding the statute may also be relevant to determine whether Congress intended the statute to preempt State law. <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>at 494, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240. \u201cPre-emption may be either express or implied and is \u2018compelled whether Congress\u2019 command is explicitly stated in the statute\u2019s language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fidelity Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. v. de la Cuesta, </em>458 <em>U.S. </em>at 153, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>3014 (citing <em>Janes v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>519, 525, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977)). State law which conflicts with federal law is without effect. <em>Cipollone, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>at 504, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2608 (citing <em>U.S.C.A. </em>Const, art. 6, cl. 2). \u201cEven where Congress has not completely displaced state regulation in a specific area, state law is nullified to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.\u201d <em>Fidelity Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. v. de la Cuesta, </em>458 <em>U.S. </em>at 153, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>3014. \u201cIn the absence of an express congressional command, state law is pre-empted if that law actually conflicts with federal law.\u201d <em>Cipollone, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>at 516, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2608.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Any preemption analysis must focus on the assumption that state police powers are not preempted unless this was the clear purpose of Congress. <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>at 484-85, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240. Determining Congress\u2019 intent must start with analyzing the statutory language of the preemption statute. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240.

Thus, pursuant to the statutory language, the Board appears to have exclusive jurisdiction over everything pertaining to the railroad\u2019s facility in the Village mentioned in the Act\u2019s definition of transportation, <em>i.e., </em>the tracks and sidetracks, the sand tower, the lube oil and diesel fueling facilities and tanks, the converted box cars, the yard bulls, the proposed engine house, and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The legislative history and policy surrounding the statute may also be considered in determining the scope of a statute\u2019s preemption. <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>at 494, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240. The section-by-section analysis portion of the congressional \u201chistory\u201d to the ICC Termination Act, entitled <em>Section. 10301. General Jurisdiction, </em>for example, states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">This provision replaces the railroad portion of former Section 10501. Conforming changes are made to reflect the direct and complete pre-emption of State <em>economic regulation </em>of railroads____ The former disclaimer regarding residual State police powers is eliminated as unnecessary, in view of the Federal policy of occupying the entire field of economic regulation of the interstate rail transportation. <em>Although States retain the police powers reserved by the Constitution, the Federal scheme of economic regulation and deregulation is intended to address and encompass all such regulation and to be completely exclusive.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\"><em>[H.R. Conf. Rep. </em>No. 104-422, Dec. 18, 1995; (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">When the Act was adopted, Congress retained the section entitled general jurisdiction, delineated as \u00a7 10501. However, the Congressional intent stated above with regard to the proposed \u00a7 10301 readily applies to \u00a7 10501. Both sections cover the same topic, general jurisdiction. The only distinction is the section number assigned. From the language in this legislative history, Congress surely intended the Act to preempt all State <em>economic </em>regulation of railroads. But it is also apparent from the noted history that Congress intended the states retain certain police powers reserved by the Constitution. We conclude that all state action with any economic impact on railroads was preempted by the Act and that the states retained a certain residuum of historic police powers, but presumably those not related to railroad service, operations and physical properties or structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>A review of the \u201cRail Transportation Policy\u201d section of the Act reveals the Act\u2019s focus is on the deregulation of many aspects of the interstate railroad system, not only on strictly economic aspects. For example, one policy stated is to \u201creduce regulatory barriers to entry into and exit from the industry.\u201d 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10101(7). Another policy is to \u201cminimize the need for Federal regulatory control over .the rail transportation system and to require fair and expeditious regulatory decisions when regulation is required.\u201d 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 10101(2). Another policy is to increase \u201ccompetition and demand for services.\u201d 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 10101(1). The \u201cPolicy\u201d section also states that \u201cit is the policy of the United States Government ... (8) to operate transportation facilities and equipment without detriment to the public health and safety.\u201d 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 10101(8). The policy section also states that safety, safe and suitable working conditions, unlawful discrimination, anti-trust violations, and energy conservation are policy considerations. <em>Id. </em>at (3), (11), (12) and (14). However, the dominant public policy emphasis is on a very substantial overall deregulation of the railroad industry. As aptly stated in <em>CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>1573, 1583 (N.D.Ga.1996), \u201c[b]y preempting state regulation of railroad operations, and granting exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of almost all aspects of railroad operations to the [Board], Congress removes the ability of states to frustrate its policy of deregulating and reviving the railroad industry.\u201d The Act obviously intended that national transportation interests dominate over parochial concerns and impulses.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">A few courts in the land have addressed the issue of preemption under the ICC Termination Act of 1995. In 1996 the Nebraska Supreme Court held it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether Burlington Northern Railroad Company\u2019s application to \u201cdiscontinue its \u2018Osmond Direct Service Agency5 and transfer that agency\u2019s services to Burlington\u2019s Lincoln agency\u201d was properly granted by Nebraska\u2019s Public Service Commission. <em>In re Application of Burlington Northern Railroad, </em>249 <em>Neb. </em>821, 545 N.W.2d 749 (1996). The Nebraska Supreme Court held it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>lacked \u201cjurisdiction to address the matter because the ICC Termination Act of 1995 preempts state remedies and vests exclusive jurisdiction in the federal government for interstate rail matters affecting practices, routes, services, and facilities of rail carriers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>545 N.W.2d at 750. The court found that 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10501(a) of the ICC Termination Act granted exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers in the Surface Transportation Board and that state courts could no longer consider the \u201cpractices, routes, services, and facilities of interstate rail carriers.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>545 N.W.2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In 1996, a Georgia federal district court addressed whether the ICC Termination Act of 1995 preempted the Georgia Public Service Commission\u2019s \u201cauthority to regulate railroad agency closings in Georgia.\u201d <em>CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1573. Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission had regulated its state\u2019s railroads since 1897. Plaintiffs CSX and Norfolk maintained railroad agency offices in Georgia which were responsible for ticket sales, baggage handling, and customer information. The Georgia Public Service Commission denied CSX\u2019s requests for permission to modify their agency offices or discontinue them. <em>Id. </em>at 1575. The federal court determined the language contained in 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10501(b)(2) was an \u201cexpress preemption clause\u201d and clearly showed Congress\u2019 \u201cintent to preempt state regulatory authority over railroad operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1581. The pertinent part of the statute relied upon by that court states, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this part, the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under Federal or State law.\u201d 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10501(b)(2). The court said regulating the closing of railroad agencies came within \u201cregulation of rail transportation.\u201d <em>CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1581. The court also stated, \u201c[t]he Act was passed in an effort to reduce the regulation of railroads and other modes of surface transportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1576 (citing 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10101).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>In 1997, a federal district court in Montana ruled the ICC Termination Act preempted economic regulation of rail transportation and expressly preempted Montana state law regarding discontinuance of railroad station agencies. <em>Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation v. Anderson, </em>959 <em>F.Supp. </em>1288 (D.Mont.1997). The court also agreed with the reasoning in <em>CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1573. The Montana federal court, relying on 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 10501(b)(2) stated the Act \u201creserves no area of regulation for the individual states \u2014 agency regulation or otherwise.\u201d <em>Burlington Northern, </em>959 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1295. That court stated the Act preempted \u201ceconomic regulation\u201d and that \u201c[t]he statutory language and accompanying legislative record evidence Congress\u2019 clear and manifest intent to occupy the entire field of economic regulation of rail transportation____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296. In <em>Rushing v. Kansas City Southern Railway Company, </em>14 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>869 (S.D.Miss.1998), the federal district judge declined on federal preemption grounds to grant relief by injunction against common-law nuisance claim based on coupling and whistle noise and engine traffic vibration. <em>See Georgia Public Service Commission v. CSX Transportation, Inc., </em>225 <em>Ga.App. </em>787, 484 S.E.2d 799 (1997) (ICCTA preempted state public service commission\u2019s ruling on staffing of service facility).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In October 1998 the Ninth Circuit addressed the preemption issue in <em>City of Auburn v. U.S. Government, </em>154 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir.1998) (the \u201cStampede Pass\u201d case). The Ninth Circuit held the ICC Termination Act specifically preempts state and local environmental and land use permitting laws regarding railroad operations because of the plain language of the Act and the statutory structure. <em>Id. </em>at 1031. In the \u201cStampede Pass\u201d case the Ninth Circuit echoed the Georgia federal district court\u2019s conclusion on the breadth of the Act\u2019s preemption clause, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">The preemptive effect of the ICCTA, which went into effect January 1, 1996, is a question of first impression on the appellate level of this circuit. The district courts which have had the opportunity to examine this question have applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>federal preemption. Despite the petitioner\u2019s claims to the contrary, the reasoning of these courts support preemption in this case as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">In <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Georgia Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>1573 (N.D.Ga.1996), the district court found \u00a7 10501(b)(2)\u2019s preemption of state regulation of railroad agency closings by stating: \u201cIt is difficult to imagine a broader statement of Congress\u2019s intent to preempt state regulatory authority over railroad operations.\u201d 944 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1581. \u201cInterpreting the preemption clause in the ICC Termination Act to be broad enough to preempt state regulation of agency closings,\u201d the court stated, \u201cis consistent with the Act\u2019s grant of exclusive jurisdiction over almost all matters of rail regulation to the STB.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1029-30.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The Ninth Circuit responded to the City of Auburn\u2019s claim in the \u201cStampede Pass\u201d case that ICCTA did not attempt to preempt local environmental regulation by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">Auburn attempts to distinguish its permitting requirements as environmental rather than economic regulation, claiming this is a \u201ctraditional state police power\u201d that Congress did not intend to preempt. It correctly points out that courts have declined to preempt state environmental regulation in some other contexts. <em>See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. Hammond, </em>726 F.2d 483, 501 (9th Cir.1984). However, the pivotal question is not the nature of the state regulation, but the language and congressional intent of the specific federal statute. <em>See, e.g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>724, 738, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2380, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985); <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>85, 95, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2890, 77 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 490 (1983) (Preemption of state law is compelled if Congress\u2019 command is explicitly stated in the federal statute\u2019s language or implicitly contained in its structure or purpose.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">For example, in <em>Hammond, </em>the court allowed an Alaska statute governing the discharge of ballast by oil tankers after finding that in the Clean Water Act, Congress \u201cclearly expressed its intent to allow the states to take an active role in abating water pollution.\u201d 726 F.2d at 489. In contrast, there is no evidence that Congress intended any such state role under the ICCTA to regulate the railroads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">Additionally, <em>given the broad language of \u00a7 10501(b)(2), </em>(granting the STB exclusive jurisdiction over construction, acquisition, operation, abandonment, or discontinuance of rail lines) <em>the distinction between \u201ceconomic\u201d and \u201cenvironmental\u201d regulation begins to blur. For if local authorities have the ability to impose \u201cenvironmental\u201d permitting regulations on the railroad, such power will in fact amount to \u201ceconomic regulation\u201d if the carrier </em>is <em>prevented from, constructing, acquiring, operating, abandoning, or discontinuing a line.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">We believe the congressional intent to preempt this kind o\u00ed state and local regulation of rail lines is explicit in the plain language of the ICCTA and the statutory framework surrounding it. See <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>470, 486, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). Because congressional intent is clear, and the preemption of rail activity is a valid exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause, we affirm the STB\u2019s finding of federal preemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1024-25; emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>We also point out that in the \u201cStampede Pass\u201d case the STB, when requested, quickly granted an administrative audience and rendered a prompt decision on the environmental health and safety claims of the county and local government bodies allegedly affected by the opening of the new service. <em>Id. </em>at 1027. The Ninth Circuit found that the agency had promptly and fully considered the environmental consequences of \u201cconcerns such as rail traffic increases, transportation safety, energy, air quality, and noise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">This fortifies our conclusion that the concerns raised by the Village here are a matter at least for the primary jurisdiction of the responsible agency, the STB, if not ultimately one of total federal preemption. We contrast this situation with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recent ruling allowing that common-law \u201crun-of-the-mill personal injury claims\u201d for money damages arising from airline travel is not inconsistent with the preemption features of the Airline Deregulation Act, 49 <em>U.S.C.A.App. </em>\u00a7 1305(a)(1), <em>Charas v. Trans World Airlines, </em>160 F.3d 1259 (9th Cir.1998). Allowing money judgments against the railroad for carelessly injuring people does not affect the operation or interrupt the service of the railroad, although it may incidentally raise insurance rates or overall business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We conclude that the plaintiff must submit its claim to the STB for resolution. This action is essentially for injunctive relief. As noted, the Village includes a claim for money damages but does not itself assert any specific damage to municipal property from defendant\u2019s operation. We doubt any occurred. Thus, in the present posture of this case, a court could not award money damages for tortious conduct. The claim is and remains a claim for injunctive relief against a public nuisance created by the defendant\u2019s railroad operations. To afford plaintiff injunctive relief we would have to hold that the Law Division could, if it agrees with plaintiff\u2019s claim of public nuisance, order that defendant (1) submit to standard municipal inspections and remove certain facilities or cease using them if they do not comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>applicable local standards (the sand tower; the converted box cars used as administrative facilities; the tank-cars and lube oil vessel used for refueling and servicing, or the recently erected fuel tank) and (2) cease or diminish its annoying operations, allowing multiple engines perhaps a dozen or more (and cars) to stand and idle in the Village at night or at anytime the number of engines is substantial, creating soot, tremors and unseemly noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We conclude that if the Law Division judge had the type of control over defendant\u2019s operation to order this relief, he would be invading the preempted area of exclusive federal regulation. Further, if the judge ordered local inspections concerning sanitary and sewer facilities, building and safety codes, and land-use permitting process, he would be condoning, if not ordering, regulation of defendant\u2019s railroad facilities in violation of the overarching federal legislative scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We are most reluctant to remand for a plenary hearing to consider injunctive relief in a situation where we cannot tell the remand court the scope of the adjudicative powers which it may use to enforce plaintiffs claims. We are constrained to conclude that plaintiff must present its claim to the STB in the first instance under the doctrines of federal preemption and primary jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAs the agency with authority delegated from Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>gress to implement the provisions of the ICC Termination Act, the STB is uniquely qualified to determine whether state law should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>be preempted.\u201d <em>CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1584 (quoting <em>Medtronic, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>at 496, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240.) The STB may act on the problem and devise a plan which gives these troubled citizens a measure of relief. We cannot presume and have no reason to believe that the STB will ignore legitimate citizen complaints. The STB may also choose to spell out the precise contours of the residual state police powers which it finds survive the broadly-phrased federal preemption statute and are compatible with the national policy of railroad deregulation and federal primacy. If so, this present action will be promptly reinstated at the trial level upon plaintiffs application and given every priority towards an expedited resolution. Finally, if the STB declines to consider these complaints on the merits, we will construe this as a signal that there is no federal preemption in the circumstances, giving the state court the right on appropriate and timely application to resurrect this action and to proceed on the merits of the public nuisance claims. The site cannot forever remain a regulatory \u201cno-man\u2019s land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Finally, we affirm the judge\u2019s dismissal of the contract claim for several reasons. In view of our finding on federal preemption, plaintiff can obviously not obtain an enforceable court order to compel the railroad to build the engine house, as once proposed by defendant. Indeed, based on this record we cannot envision how construction of the engine house as proposed would alleviate any of the myriad problems plaintiff describes.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">We are also convinced that the basic elements of an enforceable contract \u2014 a meeting of the minds and adequate consideration \u2014 8 are not here present. Any forbearance for a few months on this lawsuit is probably illusory consideration in this context. <em>See </em>I <em>Farnsworth, Contracts </em>\u00a7 2.19 at 134 (1990). From this record, it is obvious the parties never formally agreed upon anything. No municipal resolutions or any other writings describe the alleged agreement. Throughout the 1990\u2019s the railroad avoid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ed doing anything about the complaints of the Village (except to install the fuel tank required by EPA); the Village in turn tried to move the railroad\u2019s activities on the right-of-way out-of-town. The concept of a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d is virtually chimerical in the circumstance. We also conclude that because plaintiff did not plead a claim under the Oil Pollution Act, 33 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2702, the motion judge properly eschewed consideration of that assertion in his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Affirmed, as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> <em>See </em>Gellhom &amp; Levin, <em>Administrative Law and Process in a Nutshell </em>at 383-86 (West 1997) where the authors state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">E. PRIMARY JURISDICTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">Unlike the preceding topics examined in this chapter, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is <em>not </em>a defense to judicial review of agency action. Indeed, it comes into play only in cases that fall within the original jurisdiction of the courts. However, it is often discussed in conjunction with exhaustion and ripeness because, like those doctrines, it is a tool by which courts seek to avoid interfering with an agency's ability to carry out its statutory functions in a coherent way. Briefly, primary jurisdiction questions arise when a court hearing a civil or criminal case encounters an issue that also falls within the distinctive competence of an administrative agency. If the court chooses to invoke the doctrine, it will suspend consideration of the disputed issue and direct the parties to take the matter to the agency for an initial determination. Thus, the primary jurisdiction doctrine is some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>what analogous to the federal courts\u2019 practice of abstaining from deciding an issue of state law so that state courts may address the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">There are two principal reasons for requiring a private litigant to resort to the administrative process before pm-suing court litigation. First, a referral to the agency may preserve needed uniformity in a regulatory program. Thus, in <em>Texas &amp; Pac. R.R. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., </em>204 <em>U.S. </em>426, 27 <em>S.Ct. </em>350, 51 <em>L.Ed. </em>553 (1907), a shipper sued the railroad in state court, alleging that the railroad\u2019s rates, which had been approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, were unreasonably high. The Court held that this question was within the primary jurisdiction of the ICC, because a major objective of the Interstate Commerce Act had been to achieve national uniformity of rates, and this goal would be frustrated if numerous courts across the country could enforce ad hoc judgments as to whether individual rates were excessive. Second, the litigation may involve issues that go beyond the conventional experience of judges, and on which the expertise of the agency could be helpful. In <em>United States v. Western Pacific R.R., </em>352 <em>U.S. </em>59, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956), a railroad shipped napalm in steel casings for the Army, charging its established rate for \"incendiary bombs.\" The Army claimed that the (lower) rate for \"gasoline in steel drums\" applied, and the railroad sued for payment in the Court of Claims. On appeal, the Supreme Court again referred the question to the ICC: since that agency had approved the tariffs in which the two rates appeared, it was in the best position to know whether the purposes underlying the high rate for \"incendiary bombs\" were implicated in this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 383-84],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">* ** * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">As these cases suggest, the basic justification for the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is to coordinate the work of agencies and courts. Their activities are most likely to come into conflict where the agency's regulation is pervasive, and where uniform interpretations are necessary to assure effective regulation. Therefore, the doctrine is most likely to be applied in cases concerning the intensively regulated industries \u2014 where agencies control entry, price, and nature and quality of service \u2014 than in cases concerning industries that are subject to less extensive controls. In the end, however, invocation of the doctrine is highly discretionary and seems to depend on whether the court actually feels out of its depth as it confronts the issues raised by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 385-86.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">For several recent examples of primary jurisdiction <em>see MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Teleconcepts, Inc., </em>71 F.3d 1086, 1102-03 (3d Cir.1995) (Third Circuit deferred to Pennsylvania state public utility commission); <em>Boss v. Rockland Electric Co., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>33, 40, 468 A.2d 1055 (1983) (Court deferred to PUC).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
