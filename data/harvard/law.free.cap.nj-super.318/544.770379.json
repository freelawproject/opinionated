Plaintiffs complaint asserted that the ordinance enacted by defendant violated the 1981 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14r-118 (L. 1981, c. 266).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>On the return date of an order to show cause issued coincident with the filing of plaintiffs complaint, Assignment Judge Robert A. Longhi considered oral argument. The judge reserved decision, but in a subsequent written opinion declared Ordinance 97-4 valid and accordingly dismissed plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Ordinance 97-4 (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d) was enacted on April 7, 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and delineated the authority of the Director of Police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the Ordinance, the Director of Police is appointed by the Mayor and may be removed by the Mayor, unless the Council disapproves of the removal by a two-thirds majority vote. On the date the Ordinance was enacted, the Director of Police was defendant Thomas Maltese, a civilian, who had been appointed in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Apparently in anticipation of the passage of the Ordinance, on March 31, 1997, Maltese issued a directive instructing all bureau commanders of the Township police department to report directly to him, rather than to Captain Stanke, the highest ranking officer on the police force. This directive was apparently designed to comply with the municipal ordinance, and <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118, requiring that a municipality provide for a line of authority through which the appropriate authority adopts rules and regulations for the governance of the police force and for the discipline of its members. The designation of the \u201cappropriate authority\u201d is required, whereas the office of police chief is optional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Director of Police is appointed by the Mayor and may be removed by the Mayor, unless the Council disapproves of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>removal by a two-thirds majority vote. Article II, Section 2A of the ordinance names the appropriate authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">The North Brunswick Police Department shall come under the jurisdiction of the Appropriate Authority, which is hereby created pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118. Said Appropriate Authority shall be the Director of Police. <em>The Appropriate Authority shall be directly responsible to the Mayor of the Township. </em>The Director of Police, in addition to those powers and duties enumerated in section 5<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of this article, shall be responsible for the operation of the police department pursuant to policies established by said Director and shall be responsible for the promulgation, updating, and/or ratification of the Rules and Regulations for police personnel which shall be known as the Rules and Regulations for the Police Department of the Township of North Brunswick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">[emphasis added.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">It is apparent from the record that Maltese\u2019s directive in anticipation of the enactment of the Ordinance prompted the PBA to initiate this litigation. PBA\u2019s primary contention is that the Ordinance empowers the Director of Police to promulgate rules and regulations, a legislative function. It thus asserted that the Ordinance which also empowers the Director with authority to control the daily functions of the police force, an executive function, impermissibly entrusts both a legislative function and an executive function to the same person. PBA therefore contends that two separate individuals must perform these two distinct functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>PBA also contends entrusting one person with the responsibility for the duties of a police chief and of the \u201cappropriate authority\u201d contradicts <em>Hartmann v. Police Dep\u2019t of Ridgewood, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 609 A.2d 61 (App.Div.1992) and <em>In re Baldinger, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 531 A.2d 1087 (Law Div.1987). The judge rejected this contention and specifically noted that both <em>Hartmann </em>and <em>Baldinger </em>addressed the power struggle between the appropriate authority and the chief of police where the municipality had opted to create the position of a chief of police. We also note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14 \u2014 118 has been construed in <em>Quaglietta v. Borough of Haledon, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 440 A.2d 82 (Law Div.1981); <em>Gauntt v. Mayor and Council of City of Bridgeton, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 477 A.2d 381 (App.Div.1984), <em>overruled in part, Falcone v. DeFuria, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>219, 510 A.2d 1174 (1986); and more recently in <em>Grasso v. Borough Council of Glassboro, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 500 A.2d 10 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>453, 511 A.2d 639 (1986). <em>Quaglietta, Gauntt, </em>and <em>Grasso </em>similarly involved municipalities having a police chief. That, of course, is not the scenario created by Ordinance 97-4 and as such, those decisions have little applicability to the issues raised in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Citing <em>Falcone v. Defuria, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549, 489 A.2d 1260 (Law Div.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 489 A.2d 1263 (App.Div.1985), aff<em>'d, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>219, 510 A.2d 1174 (1986), the judge noted in his opinion that <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118 was enacted as a legislative amendment designed \u201cto provide a system for checks and balances in the position of Chief of Police, so that one person could not become a tyrant.\u201d <em>Falcone </em>particularly noted the tensions that exist between the appropriate authority and the chief of police where a municipality has opted to create a police force with a chief of police. Unlike other reported decisions interpreting <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118, <em>see </em>Section I, <em>supra, </em>here Ordinance 97-4 involves the somewhat unique, but clearly permissible, example of a municipality exercising its option of creating a police force without designat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ing a chief of police. \u201cThe ordinance <em>may </em>provide for the appointment of a <em>chief of police </em>... as the governing body shall deem necessary for the effective government of the force.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In construing the Ordinance and <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118, the judge rejected PBA\u2019s argument and specifically concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWB\">There is nothing in the Township ordinance which is inconsistent with the statute or case law. The governing body, the township council, as well as the state legislature, create the laws. The police are part of the executive branch and enforce the laws. As the executive administrator, the Director of Police is responsible for rules and regulations within the department which will help the department in fulfilling its duty to execute the laws. This is an appropriate function of the executive branch, and the North Brunswick ordinance is an appropriate use of the municipality\u2019s power to create and maintain a police force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">It is fundamental that \u201c \u2018the meaning of a statute must ... be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheeran v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., Inc., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>548, 556, 404 A.2d 625 (1979) (quoting <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 <em>U.S. </em>470, 485, 37 <em>S.Ct. </em>192, 194, 61 <em>L.

Bambrick, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 549, 427 A.2d 113 (App.Div.1981); <em>Raubar v. Raubar, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 360, 718 A.2d 705 (Law Div.1998) (citing <em>Matter of Resyn Corp., </em>945 <em>F.</em>2d 1279, 1283 (3d Cir.1991) (stating that, where the legislature has expressed its intention in plain language and the legislative history does not demonstrate a contrary purpose, the court is bound to follow the statutory provision as written)); <em>see also </em>2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.01 5th Ed. (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118 clearly requires that a municipality must have an appropriate authority to oversee the police department. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The appropriate authority may be one of the enumerated persons or groups (mayor, executive officer, director, governing body, etc.) or the municipality may create a body specifically to become the appropriate authority. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118. The appropriate authority adopts rules and regulations for the department, and the discipline of the members; additionally, the appropriate authority establishes policies for the daily operations of the department. The appropriate authority is a civilian position.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">By its challenge to the Ordinance, PBA questions whether a Director of Police in a municipality that has opted not to name a chief of police may assume some of the duties normally assigned to the chief of police in the daily operations of the police department. We think it obvious that, where a municipality has opted not to name a chief of police, the Director of Police is vested with such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">North Brunswick has designated the Director of Police as the \u201cappropriate authority\u201d within the framework of the statutory scheme envisioned by the Legislature in enacting the amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118. Without a chief of police, all police officers are subordinate to the Director of Police in accordance with rank, as delineated in the Ordinance, Article II, Section I, and the Director is entitled to assume duties ordinarily assigned to a chief of police, including directing daily operations of the police department. In fact, the Ordinance provides that the Director of Police be responsible for the operation of the police department, establish policies for the department, and promulgate rules for the personnel. These responsibilities include prescribing duties and daily assignments of police officers. It is abundantly clear that the Legislature recognized that if a municipality opted not to create the position of chief of police, a municipality^ police department would require leadership in the daily operations of the department. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14 \u2014 118 does not prohibit the Director of Police from also being the \u201cappropriate authority,\u201d despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>fact that the Director of Police is also required to report to the Mayor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On appeal, PBA also raises an argument, rejected in the Law Division, that the daily operations of the police force should be the responsibility of the highest ranking certified police officer. However, that argument is specifically rejected by the clear legislative mandate which permits a municipality to opt not to have a chief of police and to designate an \u201cappropriate authority\u201d to supervise the police department. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118 does not include the highest ranking certified police officer in a police department as being entitled to be named as \u201cappropriate authority.\u201d We therefore agree with the Law Division judge that PBA\u2019s contention is without legal merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">The governing body of any municipality, by ordinance, may create and establish, as an executive and enforcement function of municipal government, a police force, whether as a department or as a division, bureau or other agency thereof, and provide for the maintenance, regulation and control thereof.
