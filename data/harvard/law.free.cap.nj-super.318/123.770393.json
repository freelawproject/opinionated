In light of our decision, we find it unnecessary to address the issues raised in Points II and III of defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-17\">These are the relevant facts. On Monday, April 4, 1994, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Investigator John Appleyard and Investigator Anthony Strivolino of the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Office arrived at an apartment in Jersey City on the report of a suspicious death. Investigator Appleyard testified that when he arrived at the apartment the police were present and he was escorted to a front room where he observed a dead male infant lying in a child\u2019s car seat. The investigator described the corpse as \u201ca little in rough shape physically. He had what appeared to be a couple of bruises on the forehead, some drooping skin. He looked very thin.\u201d Present in the apartment were defendant, who was the infant\u2019s mother and her mother; an elderly female neighbor; and three of defendant\u2019s four other children, all of whom were under the age of five. The father, co-defendant Philip Carter, was not there.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The investigator testified that defendant was crying and appeared \u201cdistraught.\u201d He stated that defendant told him she had last fed the infant on Sunday around 7:30 a.m. and last saw him alive between noon and 1:00 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. She told the investigator that she left the infant in Carter\u2019s care while she slept and that when she awoke, at about 11:00 p.m. on Sunday night, she looked in on the child and then went downstairs to a neighbor where she remained until 7:30 a.m. Monday morning. She explained that she expected Carter to care for the child if he woke up. When defendant returned to the apartment and went to check on the infant at around 7:30 a.m. on Monday, he felt cold and stiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">An autopsy conducted by the State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. that day reported the immediate cause of death as \u201cbattered child syndrome with blunt impact crania![,] cerebral[,] and cervical injuries\u201d; \u201cdehydration\u201d and \u201cextreme emaciation due to lack of food.\u201d The medical examiner testified that the corpse was in \u201cvery poor physical condition with evidence of chronic trauma,\u201d including head and neck injuries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The medical examiner also described the infant as looking like \u201can African Md you see in magazines from a Third World country, like victims of starvation____ He looked kind of like an old man more than he looked like a baby.\u201d Although he was unable to state the exact time of death, he did state that the infant died as the result of \u201c[t]he combination of anatomical findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">At the apartment, Investigator Appleyard questioned defendant as to why there was no infant formula. He testified that defendant had told him she had recently received a case of formula from a public assistance program known as \u2018WIC,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but he did not find any. The investigator stated that defendant attempted to rationalize the situation' by explaining that she used Carnation evaporated milk when she ran out of formula. Investigator Apple-yard described the apartment and defendant\u2019s children as filthy, noting there was only one dirty crib which apparently was used by the one year old child. After about an hour and one-half, Investigator Appleyard asked defendant to accompany him to the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and she agreed to do so. He did not advise her that she was free to refuse his request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">At 9:45 a.m., Investigators Appleyard and Strivolino put defendant in the back of their unmarked vehicle and drove her to the prosecutor\u2019s office where, at approximately 10:00 a.m., she was placed in a ten-by-ten-foot room in the homicide unit for further questioning. Defendant remained alone in the room for more than an hour before the questioning began. Thereafter, Investigators Appleyard and Strivolino seated themselves on either side of her and conducted a preliminary interview. Defendant then took the oath and gave a formal tape-recorded statement. The taped statement, comprising twenty-five pages of transcribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>questions and answers, was recorded between 11:35 and 11:59 a.m. In the statement, defendant denied that she had physically abused the infant. She stated that the child had been bom addicted to cocaine,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but when specifically asked whether she \u201c[did] cocaine\u201d on Sunday, she responded \u201cno.\u201d She did, however, admit that she and co-defendant occasionally inhaled cocaine and that she had used the drag on the Thursday preceding the infant\u2019s death. She also admitted to drinking alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">At no time was defendant told that her presence at the prosecutor\u2019s office was voluntary or that she was free to leave. Nor was she advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Even after giving her statement, she was not told she could leave, and in fact, she remained in the prosecutor\u2019s office until she was formally arrested later that day, presumably after the medical examiner reported the autopsy results.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Investigator Appleyard testified that he took defendant to the prosecutor\u2019s office because he wished to question her further and it was too chaotic to continue the questioning in the apartment. He also indicated that he did not consider defendant to be \u201ca suspect\u201d inasmuch as the infant\u2019s death might have been a SIDS death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, he noted that at the end of the interview defendant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question of whether any pressure or coercion was used to force or compel her to give the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">At the conclusion of the <em>Miranda </em>hearing, the trial judge determined that defendant\u2019s statements should be admitted despite the investigator\u2019s failure to give defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The court concluded that <em>Miranda </em>did not apply here because defendant was not in custody and was free to leave at any time during the interview. He determined that the interview was held at a time when it was not clear to the investigator whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>was investigating a homicide or an accidental death and therefore defendant was not a \u201csuspect\u201d in a homicide. Although the court acknowledged that the infant appeared to be \u201cin a state of dehydration and malnutrition,\u201d it nonetheless concluded that there was nothing to suggest to the investigator, not even a \u201chint,\u201d that there was \u201cmistreatment by the mother and a homicide,\u201d and concluded that Investigator Appleyard was \u201cnot asking questions [in the apartment] to determine that [she was] a suspect.\u201d The court then indicated that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary and not coerced and therefore would be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It is well settled that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required when a person is subject to \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 444, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 1612, 16 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 694, 706 (1966). \u201cCustodial interrogation\u201d means \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Absent <em>Miranda </em>warnings, statements made by a defendant in custody, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, may not be used in the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief. <em>State v. Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 275, 511 A.2d 80 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>\u201cMiranda </em>turns on the potentially inquisitorial nature of police questioning and the inherent psychological pressure on a suspect in custody.\u201d <em>State v. P.Z., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>86, 102, 703 A.2d 901 (1997) (citing <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 445-58, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1612-19, 16 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 707-14). Moreover, it \u201c[is] the compulsive aspect of custodial interrogation, and not the strength or content of the government\u2019s suspicions at the time the questioning [is] conducted\u201d which implicates the <em>Miranda </em>requirements. <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>318, 323, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1526, 1529, 128 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>293, 299 (1994) (quoting <em>Beckwith v. United States, </em>425 <em>U.S. </em>341, 346, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1612, 1616, 48 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 1, 7 (1976)). Indeed, unless the officer\u2019s beliefs are conveyed in some way to the person being interrogated or interviewed, they do not affect the <em>Miranda </em>custody inquiry; a law enforcement officer\u2019s beliefs are \u201crelevant only to the extent they influence[ ] the objective conditions sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>rounding [the] interrogation\u201d and \u201cwould affect how a reasonable person in the position of the individual being questioned would gauge the breadth of his or her \u2018freedom of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1530, 128 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 300 (quoting <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>420, 440, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3138, 3150, 82 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 317, 335 (1984)). Hence, subjective beliefs may be only one among many factors bearing upon the determination of whether an individual is in custody. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Hence, the test is an objective one which focuses on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Ibid.; see also P.Z., supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 102-03, 703 A.2d 901. Those circumstances include the time and place of the interrogation, the length of the interrogation, the nature of the questions, the conduct of the police, the status of the interrogator, the status of the suspect, and other such factors. <em>See P.Z., supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 703 A.2d 901; <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 252, 708 A.2d 716 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>381, 718 A.2d 1210 (1998); <em>State v. Coburn, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 595-96, 535 A.2d 531 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>300, 540 A.2d 1281 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In <em>State v. Coburn, </em>we explained that \u201cthe standard is the objective reasonable man test.\u201d 221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 596, 535 A.2d 531. There, we indicated that \u201ccustody exists if the action of the interrogating officers and the surrounding circumstances, fairly construed, would reasonably lead a detainee to believe he could not leave freely.\u201d <em>Ibid.; accord State v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 477, 637 A.2d 553 (App.Div.1994). Accordingly, courts are directed always to apply a case-by-case approach in which the totality of the circumstances are examined in determining whether a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d has occurred. <em>O\u2019Loughlin, supra, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 477, 637 A.2d 553; <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super </em>168, 177, 329 A.2d 75 (App.Div.1974), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>267, 337 A.2d 371 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In this case, from the outset of the investigation both the investigators and defendant had to have been aware that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>infant expired under suspicious circumstances. The dead infant appeared emaciated, dehydrated and bruised. Just observing the corpse revealed the child had suffered severely at the hands of his supposed caretakers. Indeed, the medical examiner compared him to a third-world victim of starvation. Investigator Appleyard had seen the infant\u2019s pitiable condition and the deplorable state of the apartment. He also knew that defendant was the infant\u2019s mother and the person charged with his care and well-being. Thus, it strains credulity to conclude, as the trial court did here, that Investigator Appleyard believed that the infant\u2019s death was accidental; rather, it had to be apparent to both defendant and the investigator that defendant had contributed to his death in some respect. In deciding whether defendant was free to leave the prosecutor\u2019s office, the trial court placed too much emphasis on the investigator\u2019s subjective belief that the infant might have died of SIDS or some other accidental cause. As previously noted, it is not the subjective views of the interrogator that governs the determination of \u201ccustody,\u201d but the objective surrounding circumstances that are determinative. <em>Stansbury, supra, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>at 323, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1529, 128 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Those circumstances here included the horrific condition of the dead infant, as well as the inherently coercive physical environment of the prosecutor\u2019s office, the length of time defendant remained at the office, and the nature of the questions put to defendant. These were such that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have realized she was a target of the prosecutor\u2019s investigation and was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Defendant was placed in a small room alone where she remained unattended for an hour before any questioning began. She was then joined by two investigators who sat on either side of her, interviewing her for more than one-half hour before she gave a formal statement. Additionally, before the questioning began, defendant was warned of the solemnity of the oath, was sworn to tell the truth, and was then asked questions designed to elicit incrhninating responses concerning the infant\u2019s care and defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>dant\u2019s alcohol and cocaine use at or about the time the infant expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In these circumstances, we are persuaded that the court erred in admitting the statement. Defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d and was therefore entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings before she was interrogated. As a result, defendant\u2019s statement to the investigators at the prosecutor\u2019s office should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">This finding of a <em>Miranda </em>violation does not end our inquiry, however. We must examine the consequences that flow from that violation. If the admission of defendant\u2019s unwarned statement had the clear capacity to cause an unfair result, then the convictions must be reversed and a new trial ordered. In other words, we must determine whether the erroneous admission of defendant\u2019s incriminating statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. McCloskey, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>18, 29, 446 A.2d 1201 (1982) (applying harmless error standard to determine whether reversal was required when statement was admitted against defendant in violation of his constitutional right against self-incrimination); <em>see also State v. Spruell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>32, 42-43, 577 A.2d 821 (1990) (observing that regardless of whether an error is of constitutional dimension, \u201c[t]he ultimate inquiry [must] focus[ ] on the possibility of injustice \u2018sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In this case, the jury convicted defendant of aggravated manslaughter, rejecting the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a provides that a person is guilty of aggravated manslaughter when he or she \u201crecklessly causes death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d In contrast, a conviction for reckless manslaughter requires only that the conduct causing death be committed \u201crecklessly.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-4b(l). Recklessness under circumstances \u201cmanifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life ... is significantly more serious than ordinary reckless conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Farrell, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>386, 390, 594 A.2d 1338 (App.Div.1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The higher degree of recklessness involves not just a possibility that death mil occur, but a probability of its occurrence. <em>State v. Curtis, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 364-65, 479 A.2d 425 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>212, 491 A.2d 708 (1984). Thus, to convict a defendant of aggravated manslaughter, the State must prove not only that the defendant acted recklessly but also that he acted \u201cunder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2C:ll-4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">This additional element focuses on the circumstances under which the defendant acted, rather than the defendant\u2019s state of mind. <em>Curtis, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 364-65, 479 A.2d 425; <em>see also State v. Saunders, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. 322, </em>326, 649 A.2d 885 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>442, 655 A.2d 444 (1995). If the defendant\u2019s actions created a probability as opposed to the mere possibility of death in light of the attendant circumstances, then the defendant is deemed to have acted with extreme indifference to human life. <em>Curtis, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 364, 479 A.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We are convinced that, given the evidence of the infant\u2019s pitiable condition, the improperly admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s use of cocaine near the time of the infant\u2019s demise had to have contributed to the jury\u2019s conclusion that defendant acted with \u201cextreme indifference to human life,\u201d resulting in her conviction for aggravated manslaughter. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a. That this evidence was capable of having such an effect is reflected in the prosecutor\u2019s argument in summation which drew a connection between defendant\u2019s \u201cchronic\u201d drug habit, the suspicious disappearance of the free infant formula provided by WIC, implying it had been sold to obtain' money to buy drugs, and the child\u2019s physical condition and resulting death. Without the improperly admitted evidence of recent cocaine use and the prejudicial inferences that a jury could reasonably have drawn from the missing formula, we cannot state that a jury would have found defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury would have to have concluded that defendant\u2019s recklessness was so \u201cextreme\u201d that defendant \u201cdid not care whether [her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>son] lived or died.\u201d <em>Curtis, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 367, 479 A.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Notably, defendant moved to redact those damaging portions of the statement, but the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s motion. Had the court acceded to the request, the error might well have been viewed as harmless. We recognize the jury knew defendant had used cocaine in the past, as reflected by her trial stipulation that the infant was born addicted to the drug, but the evidence depicting defendant as an ongoing drug addict creates a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the evidence of her recent use contributed to the conviction. <em>See State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 339, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). Hence, the error in admitting the statement during the State\u2019s case-in-chief contrary to <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirements cannot be condoned as harmless error. There is a strong \u201cpossibility of injustice, \u2018sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spruell, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 43, 577 A.2d 821 (quoting <em>State v. Melvin, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18-19, 319 A.2d 450 (1974)). Accordingly, we are convinced defendant was denied \u201ca fair trial and a fair decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 338, 273 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The judgment of conviction is reversed, and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-18\"> <em>Miranda v.
