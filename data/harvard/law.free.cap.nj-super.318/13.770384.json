Polanski, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>344, 544 A.2d 852 (1988), had been satisfied. <em>See also Cooper v. Cooper, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>42, 491 A.2d 606 (1984); <em>Winer v. Winer, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 515-21, 575 A.2d 518 (App.Div.1990). Plaintiff also argues that the trial court misapplied its discretion in denying his motion for <em>pendente lite </em>physical custody of the children; and that, \u201c[p]ursuant to <em>R. </em>5:3-3, an expert must be appointed ... to resolve the issue of custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">We affirm substantially for the reasons articulated by Judge O\u2019Connor in her comprehensive opinion disposing of all the issues raised by the parties, 318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 722 A.2d 986 (Ch.Div.1998). We add a word only to emphasize the holding that a plenary hearing is not necessary in every case- where removal of children is at issue, but rather only where a <em>prima fade </em>showing has been made that a genuine issue of fact exists bearing upon a critical question such as the best interests of the children, interference with parental rights, or the existence of a good faith reason to move. Here, Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s analysis that no such issue genuinely existed was unflawed; therefore, she was able, appropriately, to apply the <em>Holder </em>criteria without the need for further factual development beyond that provided by the parties in the motion papers and on oral argument. As Judge O\u2019Connor also suggested, it is problematic whether a legitimate removal contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>versy exists at all where the parent challenging the move has, himself or herself, relocated to a distant place. In the context of the circumstances in this case, we need not address that question, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
