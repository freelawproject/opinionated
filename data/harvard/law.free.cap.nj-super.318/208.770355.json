As we note hereafter, as of the date of this trial, April 3, 1997, of the approximately 4500 City employees, approximately 2000 were affected by the residency requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The primary thrust of the judge\u2019s decision may be gleaned from a small portion of his lengthy opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Plaintiffs urge that, as a result of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>CWA v. Treffinger, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 677 A.2d 295 (Law Div.1996), Newark is estopped to enforce its residency requirement against the five remaining plaintiffs because Newark had official knowledge that the plaintiffs were not residents at the time they became employees of Newark, or in the case of Simons was a resident of Newark, but moved out of Newark in 1989, and Newark did nothing until 1996. Plaintiffs misconstrue the decision in <em>CWA vs. Treffinger. </em>In that case, the allegation was that the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders (Board) adopted a resolution on September 14, 1978 requiring all employees of Essex County to be residents of the County. On January 4, 1996, the County Executive issued an executive order declaring the County\u2019s intention to enforce the residency requirement contained in the resolution adopted by the Board. On the plaintiffs applications for a preliminary injunction, the Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">This record clearly indicates the County\u2019s official knowledge of violations of the residency requirement. <em>The County has failed to set forth any evidence of a single attempt to enforce the residency requirement from September of 1978 to January of 1996. Based on the foregoing, the plaintiffs at this stage in the proceedings have shown a reasonable probability of ultimate </em>success <em>on the merits to estop the County from enforcing the residency requirement, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">[291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360, 677 A.2d 295.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">Thus, a critical factor in the <em>CWA v. Treffinger </em>case was that there was not one instance of enforcement of the residency ordinance from 1978 to 1996. <em>In the present case, the record is replete with evidence of enforcement by the city of its residency ordinance either by termination of employees or by granting waivers to non-resident employees. The fact that Newark periodically entered into a cam,</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>paign to enforce its residency ordinance does not detract from its efforts nor does it constitute a ground for estoppel against Newark.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The single reason for the judge\u2019s decision dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was the evidence of instances where the residency ordinance had been enforced by defendants, thus permitting his conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was distinguishable from the complaint in <em>Treffinger </em>where the County was unable to set forth <em>\u201cany </em>evidence of a single attempt to enforce the residence requirement.\u201d 291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360, 677 A.2d 295. We agree with this conclusion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">We have thoroughly canvassed the record on appeal with particular emphasis on the appendices filed by both parties. Our review clearly allows the conclusion that prior to 1993 there were numerous instances where the City communicated with its employees seeking information respecting an employee\u2019s place of residence or seeking to confirm that an employee had in fact moved into the City following the date employment commenced. We do discern some laxity in the City\u2019s strict enforcement of its residency ordinance between October 1993 \u2014 the month plaintiff Byrd was hired \u2014 and the City\u2019s general announcement of strict enforcement in January 1996. This laxity is evidenced by the City\u2019s failure to strictly enforce the residency ordinance in its employment of each of the five plaintiffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet, the record does demonstrate that the ordinance was not totally ignored during that same period. This is best illustrated by the inclusion of a residency affidavit within the documents completed by every new City employee, the reference to the residency ordinance within employee handbooks intended to be disseminated to all new employees, and the reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>to the residency ordinance in a slide presentation presented as part of an orientation program available to new employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">It is evident from the record that although the City may have been lax in strictly enforcing its residency ordinance, the City certainly did not engage in a studied policy of non-enforcement. We cannot conclude that the negligible exceptions exemplified by the individual experiences of the plaintiffs constitutes sufficient evidence that defendant engaged in a studied policy of non-enforcement as discussed in <em>Treffinger. </em>Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons articulated by the trial judge in his written opinion of May 15, 1997. We add these additional comments to highlight some of the salient reasons which guide our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">On November 17,1975, the City of Newark adopted a municipal residency ordinance requiring all City employees thereafter hired to reside in the City. The ordinance provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">All officers and employees of the City who shall hereafter become employees of the City are hereby required as a condition of their continued employment to have their place of abode in the City and to be bona fide residents therein, except as otherwise provided by the charter____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">The Director of any department or the Mayor or City Clerk is hereby authorized in his discretion, for good cause shown, to permit any officer or employee of the City in his respective department or office to remain in the employ of the City without complying with the provisions hereof, where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">(a) The health of any officer or employee necessitated residence outside to the City limits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">(b) The nature of the employment is such as to require residence outside of the City limits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">(e) Special talent or technique which is necessary for the operation of government not found among Newark residents exists justifying residence outside of the City limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">Failure of any officer or employee to comply with this section shall be cause for his removal or discharge from the City service.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">[Newark, N.J., Rev. Ordinance 2:14-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The trial judge summarized the trial testimony of each individual plaintiff. The only other witness presented by plaintiffs at trial was Michael A. James. James was at that time the president of Newark Council No. 21 which represents \u201c[all] white collar workers and some professional employees of the City, of Newark.\u201d James was then employed as the Executive Assistant to the City Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On direct examination, James testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Q. Mr. James, do you know the approximate number of employees in the City of Newark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">A. It\u2019s approximately about 44-4500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">Q. Out of those 4500, how many of them are police and fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">A. Approximately 2500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">Q. Now are the police and fire exempt from the residency requirement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">Q. Now out of the 2,000 employees that are not police and fire, approximately how many of those are grandfathered, meaning that they were hired prior to November 2,1976?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">A. I don\u2019t know all of them, but I remember that we came up with, from trying to gather those employees who are still with the City, that there\u2019s approximately 100-150 of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">Q. So out of the approximately 1850 employees that are subject to the residency requirement, how many of those reside outside the city?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">A. About 200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-15\">Q. Now, out of the 200 that reside outside of the City, approximately how many of those are not being terminated for violating the residency requirement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-16\">A. Close to 100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-17\">Q. Now, out of the approximate 100 employees that are not being terminated for violating the residency requirement, how many of those are provisional employees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al-\">A. In our union, there are approximately 35-40 of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-18\">Q. That are not being terminated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-19\">A. No, excuse me, no. Out of the provisionals, I would say about 90 of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">Neither additional direct testimony nor cross-examination elicited an explanation why approximately 100 of the approximate 200 employees residing outside the City were not notified of the City\u2019s intention to terminate their employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">The primary witness for the defense was Glenn Grant, the City\u2019s Business Administrator.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Grant testified to the City\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>efforts to enforce the residency ordinance following the decision in <em>Trainor v. City of Newark, </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 368 A.2d 381 (App.Div.1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>255, 377 A.2d 661 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Grant testified that, on at least three occasions, in 1989, 1991, and 1993, each City employee was notified by a statement on their individual City paycheck of the residency requirement to the effect that all \u201cemployees hired after November 2, 1976 must maintain residence in the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Prior to February 23, 1996, the residency ordinance provided three classifications of employees who were entitled to apply for a waiver of the residency requirement. Although on February 23, 1996, the Mayor delegated his authority to grant or deny waiver applications to the business administrator, the City honored all waivers which had been granted prior to that date. Grant testified that after February 23, 1996, in certain instances he granted waiver applications and in other instances denied waiver applications. The judge ultimately concluded as part of his findings of fact that the existence of a waiver policy and the denial or grant of individual waivers was one indicia of the City\u2019s enforcement of the residency ordinance, both prior to and after January 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">On May 24,1996, Grant compiled a list of twenty-one employees in each City department who had previously received a written waiver or a conditional written waiver and a list of 100 employees who had been identified as non-residents of the City who had not received a waiver. Each department head received a communication from Grant specifically identifying those employees in his/her department identified in each category. Each department head was directed to notify those identified employees who had not, as of that date, complied with the City residency ordinance that \u201cthey risk losing their job to a qualified Newark resident if they do not satisfy the residency requirement by September 1,1996.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">As noted, we have thoroughly reviewed the appendices filed on appeal which comprise 574 pages. Many of the documents contained therein are copies of communications between the City and various employees seeking verification of residency or an explanation of an employee\u2019s intent to obtain City residency. Although the bulk of these exhibits demonstrate that the City expended a greater effort to assure compliance with the residency ordinance before 1980 and after January 1996, nonetheless the exhibits do establish periodic efforts in the intervening years to enforce the ordinance. In <em>Kennedy v. City of Newark, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>178, 148 A.2d 473 (1959), the Supreme Court, in discussing the validity of residency ordinances noted, \u201claxity\u201d in enforcement is insufficient to warrant a finding of a \u201cstudied policy not to enforce\u201d a residency ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 148 A.2d 473. The City\u2019s laxity, however, did not give rise to any sustainable complaint by any individual plaintiff. The trial judge correctly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\"> The same ultimate relief was demanded in the remaining eight counts of plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaint. Each additional count delineated a basis for the requested ultimate relief: estoppel (count two); alleged violation of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a71983, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and Article 1, H 1 of the New Jersey Constitution on due process grounds (count three), and on equal protection grounds (count six); waiver (count four); laches (count five); an alleged violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-1.5 (count seven); an alleged violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-1.3 (count eight); and an alleged violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.4a(l) and (5) (count nine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-14\"> As of the date of trial there were only five individual plaintiffs. Some of the other initial fifty-eight individual plaintiffs had their complaints transferred for administrative disposition before the Merit Board, some moved into the City, and the remainder left their positions with the City. Voluntary stipulations of dismissal were filed on behalf of those individual plaintiff employees in the latter two categories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b241-11\"> In a separate application, plaintiffs sought a stay of the June 10, 1997 order pending appeal. On July 8, 1997, the trial judge entered an order staying enforcement of the June 10, 1997 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b241-12\"> These statistics are discussed in Part II of this opinion. As noted in that section, 2500 employees of the City are exempt from the residency ordinance requirement by virtue of an exception for police and fire department employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\"> The trial judge fully discussed the employment record of each plaintiff. We find no reason to repeat those findings as we conclude that the salient facts pertinent to each plaintiff were properly considered by the judge in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Suffice it to say, the record amply demonstrates that each plaintiff knew, prior to January 1996, that the City had a residency ordinance, that each knew that she was expected to reside in Newark or, in the alternative, obtain a written waiver pursuant to the ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b243-16\"> Although a referendum was passed on November 2, 1976, providing that the residency ordinance would have a prospective effect applicable to new employees hired after November 2, 1976, the referendum was never codified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>City. However, as a result of the referendum, the following Public Notice was issued by the City Clerk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\n<em>PUBLIC NOTICE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">The Municipal Council of the City of Newark, New Jersey on November 17, 1975 reconsidered an ordinance entitled, \"ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 14, PERSONNEL PRACTICES AND POLICIES, OF TITLE 2, ADMINISTRATION, OF THE REVISED ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, 1966, AS AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTED (RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS MODIFIED)\" which was rejected by the Mayor on May 23, 1975 which rejection was overridden by the Municipal Council on November 17, 1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">A Petition was filed with me requesting that the question</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">\"Shall the City of Newark adopt an amendment to its residency requirement for municipal officers and employees which would make the residency requirement prospective only after the date of this referendum and would exempt from the residence requirement employees possessing special talents or techniques necessary for operation of government\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Q\">be submitted by referendum to the voters of the City of Newark.
