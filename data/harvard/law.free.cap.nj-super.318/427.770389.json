We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">This lawsuit was based on an accident that took place about 1:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 16, 1989. Theresa R. Wallace (decedent) was alone in her 1989 Ford Mustang, driving on Bordentown Avenue in Sayreville, New Jersey. At a curve in the road, decedent lost control of her car. The Mustang rolled over several times, and she was ejected through the car\u2019s sunroof. She landed on a parked vehicle and died instantly of a fractured skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Lloyd Wallace (plaintiff), on behalf of his deceased twenty-two-year-old daughter, filed a wrongful death, products liability action against Ford Motor Company (Ford), which manufactured decedent\u2019s car, and Conti-Causeway Ford &amp; Lincoln Mercury (ContiCauseway), which sold this new car to decedent in April 1989. Plaintiffs cause of action was predicated on the fact that, at some point in the accident, the right rear axle had snapped and the right rear wheel had disconnected from decedent\u2019s car. Plaintiff alleged a manufacturing defect in the right rear axle which caused a wobble in the right rear wheel, which eventually led to the shear-fracture found in the right rear axle after the accident. Plaintiff asserted that this axle snapped, and this caused decedent to lose control of her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Ford and Conti-Causeway (defendants) maintained that decedent lost control of her car at the curve because she was drunk, (.168 blood alcohol content) and speeding at seventy miles per hour in a fifty mile per hour zone. Rather than causing the roll-over accident, defendants asserted that the right rear axle fractured <em>after </em>the accident began, when the car, which became airborne several times, landed on its right rear wheel during one of the rollovers. The force of this impact with the pavement fractured the right rear axle, disconnecting the right rear wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The first two questions # 1 and # 2 on the eight-question verdict sheet asked this of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">1. Was the axle defective while under the control of Ford Motor Company and/or Causeway Ford?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">YES_ NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">IF YOUR ANSWER IS \u201cNO\u201d TO QUESTION #1, THEN CEASE YOUR DELIBERATIONS AND RETURN YOUR VERDICT TO THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">IF YOUR ANSWER IS \u2018YES\u201d TO QUESTION # 1, PROCEED TO ANSWER QUESTION #2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">2. Was the defect in the axle a proximate cause of the accident of September 16, 1989?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-13\">YES_ NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-14\">IF YOUR ANSWER IS \u201cNO\u201d TO QUESTION #2, THEN CEASE YOUR DELIBERATIONS AND RETURN YOUR VERDICT TO THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-16\">IF YOUR ANSWER IS \u2018YES\u201d TO QUESTION #2, PROCEED TO ANSWER QUESTION #3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">The jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the first question, finding that the right rear axle in decedent\u2019s ear was not defective while under the control of defendants. In view of this answer, the jury did not have to determine if this alleged defect was a proximate cause of the accident, nor did they have to decide if decedent was negligent or if her negligence was a proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-19\">On appeal, plaintiff raises the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-20\">POINT I PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ADMISSIONS OF LIABILITY IN THE REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED ADMITTED FOR TRIAL PURPOSES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-21\">POINT II WITHOUT WAIVER OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S CONTENTION THAT A JUDGMENT <em>N.O.V. </em>SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTERED IN HIS FAVOR, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S TREATMENT OF THE PLAINTIFF AND HIS ATTORNEY WARRANTS REVERSAL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">POINT III NO EVIDENCE OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION AGAINST DECEDENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERMITTED IN THIS CASE AND IT WAS REVERSIBLE ERROR BY THE COURT TO ALLOW IT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">POINT IV THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENSE EXPERT WITNESSES, KENT, EISENBERG AND VOLLMERHAUSEN, SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRICKEN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">POINT V SHOULD THE APPELLATE COURT DENY PLAINTIFF\u2019S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT <em>N.O.V. </em>AND/OR MISTRIAL AND OTHER RELIEF SOUGHT, THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO A NEW TRIAL UNDER <em>B. </em>4:49-1 <em>ET. SEQ.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">POINT VI PLAINTIFF PROVED A CASE OF BREACH OF EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED JUDGMENT OF LIABILITY AGAINST DEFENDANTS ON THOSE ISSUES ALONE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">POINT VII THE TRIAL JURY EXPERIMENTED WITH THE EVIDENCE IN THE JURY ROOM (PARTICULARLY THE AXLE, WHEEL AND ITS PARTS) AND PLAINTIFF\u2019S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND NEW TRIAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">POINT VIII THE \u201cNET OPINIONS\u201d OF DEFENSE COUNSEL IN THEIR DOCUMENTS (THEY WERE NOT EXPERT REPORTS) SHOULD HAVE BARRED THEIR TESTIMONY ALONG WITH THE OUTSTANDING COURT ORDERS WHICH WERE VIOLATED, AND THE EVIDENCE USED AS THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR OPINION WAS TOO REMOTE AND NOT PROPERLY FOUNDED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">POINT IX THE ADMINISTRATION OF FINES AGAINST WALLACE\u2019S ATTORNEY FOR ALLEGED CONTEMPT AND THE INTIMIDATION OF HIS ATTORNEY BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY WAS A GROSS MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW AND AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHICH WARRANTS REVERSAL AND REMISSION OF FINES</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">After a review of the trial record, certain videotapes offered into evidence, the briefs and argument thereon and the applicable law, we are satisfied that the issues raised, except for one raised under Point V concerning the viability of the defense of intoxication to a product liability cause of action, are clearly without merit, warranting only the following discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(\u00ed )(C) &amp; (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">[Points I, II, III, IV, part of Point V, VI, VII, VIII, and Point IX have been omitted for publication purposes].</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Plaintiff makes a vague reference to Ms \u201carguments regarding whether intoxication can be used as a defense in product liability cases.\u201d He notes that it cannot be used as a defense to product liability cases in the work place, citing <em>Suter v. San Angelo, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>150, 158, 406 A.2d 140 (1979), but that no mention is made to a non-workplace environment such as tMs automobile product liability action. Plaintiff contends the defense of intoxication should be unavailable here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The Products Liability Act (Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to -7, was enacted on July 22, 1987. It applies to all product liability actions filed after its enactment date. <em>Becker v. Baron Bros., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>145, 151, 649 A.2d 613 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u201cA plaintiffs conduct in using a product may implicate several distinct legal issues,\u201d in that it \u201cmay relate to the existence of a defect, the issue of causation, or comparative fault.\u201d William A. Dreier, Hannah G. Goldman &amp; Eric D. Katz, <em>New Jersey Products Liability &amp; Tome Torts Law, </em>\u00a7 16:3 at 385 (1998) (hereafter <em>Dreier). See Jurado v. Western Gear Works, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>375, 387, 619 A.2d 1312 (1993). Whether a product has a manufacturing defect or design defect \u201cfocuses on the condition of the product as it left the control of the manufacturer\u201d and, therefore, the conduct of an injured plaintiff \u201cwhich occurs at some time after that reference point\u201d is not relevant in determining the existence of a manufacturing defect or design defect. <em>Grier v. Cochran Western Corp., </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 324-25, 705 A.2d 1262 (App.Div.1998). <em>See, e.g., Johansen v. Makita USA, Inc., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>86, 101, 607 A.2d 637 (1992) (noting that \u201c[bjecause the risk-utility analysis is based on the premise that a product is defective if it is dangerous when marketed, the post-marketing conduct of one plaintiff cannot inform that determmation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">However, a plaintiff\u2019s conduct may be relevant to the \u201cquestion of proximate cause,\u201d in that a jury may find that plaintiff\u2019s conduct' \u201chad been the sole cause of the accident.\u201d <em>Johansen, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 102-03, 607 A.2d 637. <em>See Grier, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>supra, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 325, 705 A.2d 1262 (concluding that, while evidence of plaintiffs post-marketing conduct was \u201cirrelevant to the question of whether the product was defective,\u201d such conduct may be considered \u201con the issue of proximate cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">While the \u201cdoctrine of comparative fault ... focuses on the plaintiffs conduct in contributing to the occurrence of an accident,\u201d at present there is, in New Jersey, \u201cno case law directly addressing the application of comparative negligence principles in cases alleging product defect where the plaintiffs conduct was a factor in the happening of the accident but not because of his or her use of the product.\u201d <em>Dreier, supra, </em>\u00a7 16:3-2 at 386 and \u00a7 16:5 at 387. However, there appears to be no obstacle to considering plaintiffs \u201cconduct ... in the happening of the accident,\u201d even though it is \u201cunrelated to a product\u2019s use:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">For example, the plaintiff may have been speeding in a vehicle and that speed might have been a cause of an accident which was also caused by a defect in the vehicle. The plaintiff could not be said to have proceeded in the face of a known risk if he or she did not know of the defect in the vehicle____ In these examples there are multiple causes for an accident or injury and there is no reason not to apply the usual comparative negligence rules for concurrent fault. For these product-unrelated causes, there should be no bar to recognizing the plaintiffs conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\"><em>[Id. </em>\u00a7 16:5 at 387-88.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Under New Jersey law, \u201cevidence of alcohol consumption\u201d by the injured plaintiff prior to the accident may be admissible \u201cin a products liability case\u201d because such evidence may be \u201crelevant ... to the issue of proximate cause.\u201d <em>Hulmes v. Honda Motor Co., </em>936 <em>F.Supp. </em>195, 201 (D.N.J.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>141 F.3d 1154 (3d.Cir.1998), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>49, 142 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>38 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\"><em>Swajian v. General Motors Corp., </em>916 <em>F.2d </em>31 (1st Cir.1990), is especially persuasive because it factually mirrors this case. On June 5, 1986, Maurica Swajian (Mrs. Swajian) was driving her 1986 GMC \u201cwhen the vehicle began to sway, went out of control, and rolled over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. Mrs. Swajian was killed when she was thrown from the vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>After this one-vehicle accident, the right rear axle of Mrs. Swajian\u2019s vehicle was found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>fractured. <em>Ibid. </em>Given this, Gregory Swajian (Swajian), Mrs. Swajian\u2019s husband, filed a products liability action against General Motors Corporation (GMC), based upon \u201cdefects in the manufacture and design of the right rear axle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32-33. Swajian alleged that the right rear axle \u201cfailed during normal operation thereby causing a rollover accident resulting in his wife\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. Among other things, GMC countered that the \u201cvehicle rollover was caused solely by driver error as a result of Mrs. Swajian\u2019s intoxication.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The main factual dispute concerning the accident itself was \u201cwhether the axle fractured before the rollover sequence began,\u201d i.e., \u201cwhether the right rear wheel separated before the rollover began or after it was already in progress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 35. Daniel Mitchell, the driver closest to Mrs. Swajian\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident, testified that Mrs. Swajian\u2019s vehicle \u201cpassed him in a normal manner, and when he next saw it, it was in the process of flipping over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. Mitchell also testified that he \u201ccould not recall whether the right rear wheel was still attached to the vehicle when he saw it flipping,\u201d in that he \u201cnever saw the wheel leave the vehicle and could not recall whether it was still on the vehicle when he saw it in the process of flipping over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 35. Finally, Mitchell testified that he \u201cbecame aware of the [right] wheel only when his passenger, Kim Gallante, cautioned him about the wheel, which was rolling across the roadway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">At trial, Swajian\u2019s expert witnesses testified that the right rear axle \u201cfailed as a result of a fatigue fracture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. This, of course, supported Swajian\u2019s position that the \u201cright rear wheel separated before the rollover began,\u201d which meant that the right rear axle \u201cfailed during normal operation thereby causing ... [the] rollover accident resulting in his wife\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Prior to trial, GMC took the position that the \u201cvehicle rollover was caused solely by driver error as a result of Mrs. Swajian\u2019s intoxication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. In support of its position that the axle had not fractured before the rollover sequence began, GMC had evidence that, after work on the day of her accident, Mrs. Swajian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>had \u201cconsumed a number of alcoholic beverages.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cImmediately following the accident,\u201d Mrs. Swajian was taken to a hospital, \u201cwhere blood samples were obtained and a blood alcohol content of 0.174 was measured.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In Rhode Island (where the accident took place), a blood alcohol level of 0.10% is \u201cpresumptive evidence of intoxication.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Prior to trial, Swajian filed a motion to \u201cexclude all reference to decedent\u2019s consumption of alcoholic beverages and her blood alcohol level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. The District Court judge granted this motion, holding that, given the \u201cdramatic\u201d extent of Mrs. Swajian\u2019s intoxication, this evidence was \u201cunduly inflammatory and far outweighs its probative value.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge barred any \u201cevidence of intoxication.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The jury found GMC liable, and awarded Swajian $449,033 for the loss to Mrs. Swajian\u2019s estate and $551,000 for his loss of consortium. <em>Id. </em>at 33. Among other things, GMC appealed the District Court\u2019s decision to \u201cexclude all evidence of Mrs. Swajian\u2019s intoxication.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The Court of Appeals concluded that granting the motion to exclude this evidence constituted \u201cclear error,\u201d reversing and remanding for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 35. The Court of Appeals explained why as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">Granting this motion denied the jury the opportunity to fairly judge this case. The district court erred in characterizing the intoxication as merely \u201ccorroborative evidence\u201d of abnormal driving, since it is essential evidence from which the jury could infer the cause of the accident. The cause of the loss of control is the ultimate issue in the case, and, without this explanation, the jury had only Swajian\u2019s allegations of design defects to consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 34.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">The trial judge made no specific finding of \u201cunfair prejudice.\u201d It appears, from the trial judge\u2019s order, that evidence of intoxication would have been admissible if the decedent had consumed less alcohol, and thus decedent\u2019s estate profits from her misconduct only because it was so egregious. This cannot be the law. Furthermore, the trial court ignored the probative value of the evidence to GMC\u2019s case. Armed with this evidence, the jury could have concluded that driver error contributed significantly to, if not caused, decedent\u2019s accident. As it was, the jury was presented with the following factual scenario: the two month old vehicle was travelling down a straight, flat road in good weather when it swayed and went out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of control for no apparent reason. The only explanation proffered was that there was a defect in one of the axles. Without the evidence of intoxication the jury was left with no reason for the loss of control other than Swajian\u2019s allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">[ftid]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">Evidence of intoxication is, by definition, prejudicial because that is precisely the intended function of relevant and probative evidence. Indeed, that evidence could have prompted the jury to return a verdict for GMC. This hardly renders the evidence unduly inflammatory; it simply highlights its significance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">[Id at 35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We are satisfied that the intoxication of the decedent was properly admitted on the issue of comparative negligence which was pled as a defense in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
