The order compels plaintiff Ross Hannan to disclose a chronology of events in the form of \u201cnotes\u201d he prepared relating to the care received during his treatment and hospitalization. Plaintiff prepared the notes in accordance with his attorney\u2019s instructions in anticipation of instituting suit. The motion judge concluded that since plaintiff had referred to the notes in answering interrogatories, he waived any attorney-client privilege afforded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-20 (N.J.R.E. 504). We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">Plaintiff, a diabetic, underwent an above-the-knee amputation of his right leg at defendant St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center (St. Joseph\u2019s). In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that St. Joseph\u2019s and its employees, and defendants Frank Yuppa, M.D. and Lee Snipes, were negligent in their diagnoses and in failing to maintain proper radiologic and diagnostic equipment at the hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tal \u201cto facilitate a timely and exact diagnosis\u201d of plaintiffs condition. Plaintiffs also charge that defendants Manny Christakos, M. D., Mark Needle, M.D., Joseph Vitale, M.D., and Francis Ferrante, M.D., were negligent in their treatment of plaintiff during the hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">A week after being released from the hospital, plaintiff retained counsel, who advised him to prepare a \u201cchronology of events to the best of his recollection in order to communicate to counsel the order of events and better facilitate his representation.\u201d Plaintiff prepared the notes and forwarded them to his attorney. Copies were made by the attorney and the original notes were returned to plaintiff. According to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, \u201cthe[] notes were used by both [plaintiff] and myself in preparation of his answers to Interrogatories prior to the time that those answers were submitted to the defendants.\u201d Plaintiff acknowledges that he referred to the notes in answering the interrogatories. During his deposition plaintiff referred to the interrogatories to refresh his recollection while being deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Defendants Christakos and Needle moved to compel production of plaintiffs notes. Plaintiff resisted disclosure, citing the attorney-client and work-product privileges. The motion judge ordered that the notes be disclosed, reasoning that plaintiff had waived the alleged attorney-client privilege by utilizing them in preparing answers to interrogatories. Citing <em>Coyle v. Estate of Simon, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 588 A.2d 1293 (App.Div.1991) and <em>N.J.R.E. </em>612, the judge observed that \u201conce a party utilizes those notes whether it be to answer interrogatories, to assist in answering interrogatories ... or in anticipation to testify at trial or at depositions, there is a waiver.\u201d At plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, which was denied, the motion judge elaborated, stating that a party \u201ccannot read something, look at something, use those notes to jog one\u2019s memory or refresh one\u2019s memory and then not be subject to cross examination based on those very notes the witness or party has been utilizing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The attorney-client privilege is codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-20 <em>(N.J.R.E. </em>504). It states in pertinent part that \u201ccommunications between lawyer and his client in the course of that relationship and in professional confidence, are privileged----\u201d The attorney-client privilege \u201crecognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and rests on the need to \u2018encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients.\u2019\u201d <em>United Jersey Bank v. Wolosoff, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 561, 483 A.2d 821 (App.Div.1984) (quoting <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>383, 389, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>677, 684, 66 L.Ed.2d 584, 591 (1981)). \u201c \u2018Preserving the sanctity of confidentiality of a client\u2019s disclosures to his attorney [promotes] an open atmosphere of trust.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 561, 483 A.2d 821 (quoting <em>Reardon v. Marlayne, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>460, 470, 416 A.2d 852 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The privilege applies to \u201ccommunications\u201d between the lawyer and his client; the \u201ccommunications\u201d must be made \u201cin professional confidence.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504; <em>Coyle, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 282, 588 A.2d 1293. In other words, the privilege \u201caccords the shield of secrecy only with respect to confidential communications made within the context of the strict relation of attorney and client.\u201d <em>United Jersey Bank, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 562, 483 A.2d 821. If the purpose of the communication is to aid the attorney in giving legal advice to his client or to prepare for litigation, then the privilege applies. <em>Payton v. New Jersey Turnpike Auth., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>524, 551, 691 A.2d 321 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Here, plaintiffs attorney instructed plaintiff to prepare a chronology of facts relating to his medical treatment. Plaintiff prepared such chronology in the form of notes and forwarded the notes to his attorney. The notes, when forwarded to counsel, were clearly \u201ccommunications between lawyer and his client in the course of that relationship....\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-20; <em>see Coyle, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 281, 588 A.2d 1293 (\u201c[a]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the time they were given, plaintiffs\u2019 written statements to their attorney reciting facts relating to their claims were protected by the attorney-client privilege\u201d); <em>see also Macey v. Rollins Envtl. Servs. (N.J.), Inc., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 540, 432 A.2d 960 (App.Div.1981) (holding that statements prepared by corporate agent at the behest of the corporation\u2019s general counsel were protected by the attorney-client privilege). In addition, such \u201ccommunications\u201d carry a presumption of confidentiality. <em>See </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>Comment 8 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504(3) (Gann 1999). The notes were therefore protected by the privilege at the time they were forwarded to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Plaintiffs notes were also protected by the work-product privilege. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(e) provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Subject to the provisions of <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d), a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under <em>R. </em>4:10-2(a) and <em>prepared in anticipation of litigation </em>or for trial <em>by </em>or for <em>another party </em>or by or for that other party\u2019s representative ... only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Here, the notes in question, were \u201cprepared in anticipation of litigation ... by ... another party,\u201d the plaintiff. In <em>Roe v. Roe, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 601 A.2d 1201 (App.Div.1992), plaintiff kept a diary about specific events occurring between herself and her husband against whom she later filed a domestic violence complaint. Plaintiffs counsel had directed plaintiff to keep the diary after she consulted him about her marital problems. <em>Id. </em>at 433, 601 A.2d 1201. The trial judge decided the diary was work-product prepared at the request of counsel and that any privilege or protection had not been waived, and therefore quashed defendant\u2019s subpoena demanding its production. <em>Ibid. </em>We found no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">So too here. According to plaintiffs counsel, the plaintiffs notes were prepared at counsel\u2019s behest to \u201cbetter facilitate his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>representation.\u201d Defendants concede that the notes were prepared in anticipation of litigation. Plaintiffs counsel may use the notes to determine which legal theories of medical malpractice are best supported by plaintiffs factual recollections.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The closer question is whether plaintiff waived his privileges afforded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-20 <em>(N.J.R.E. </em>504) and the work-product rule. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-29 <em>(N.J.R.E. </em>530) addresses waiver and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">A person waives his right or privilege to refuse to disclose or to prevent another from disclosing a specified matter if he or any other person while the holder thereof has (a) contracted with anyone not to claim the right or privilege or, (b) without coercion and with knowledge of his right or privilege, made disclosure of any part of the privileged matter or consented to such a disclosure made by anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">On its face, this rule appears to be inapplicable. At best it may be argued that subsection (b) applies <em>(i.e., </em>disclosure of privileged matter). However, there was no \u201cdisclosure\u201d of privileged communication to a third party. Plaintiff merely used his notes to refresh his memory prior to answering interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Citing <em>Coyle, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 588 A.2d 1293, the motion judge found a waiver of the attorney-client privilege because, as noted, plaintiff had utilized the notes in answering interrogatories. In <em>Coyle, </em>a medical malpractice action, plaintiffs each gave their attorney a written statement in which they recited the factual basis of their claims against defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 588 A.2d 1293. The attorney in turn gave copies of the statements to two expert witnesses who were expected to testify on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf at trial. Both experts read the statements, but could not recall which portions of the statements, if any, they relied on in forming the opinions expected to be given at trial. <em>Ibid. </em>Although we found that the statements were protected by the attorney-client privilege, we held that plaintiffs waived the attorney-client privilege when the statements were submitted to the experts. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>observed, \u201cwhere the client expects to use the communication itself as evidence, it is no longer secret. The privilege is thereby lost, and the communication must be disclosed in discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282, 588 A.2d 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Our holding in <em>Coyle </em>was anchored to the application of <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d)(1), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">A party may through interrogatories require any other party to disclose the names and addresses of each person whom the other party expects to call at trial as an expert witness, ... to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">We held that <em>R. </em>4:10 \u2014 2(d)(1) required plaintiffs to disclose to defendants \u201can otherwise privileged communication made to his or her ... expert if that communication is used by the expert to arrive at an opinion that the expert will give at trial.\u201d <em>Coyle, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 282-83, 588 A.2d 1293. We cautioned, however, that only that portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 statements used by the experts \u201care free of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 588 A.2d 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Unlike in <em>Coyle, </em>plaintiff here did not disclose the notes to an expert for the purpose of having an expert rely on the notes in rendering an opinion. The notes were disclosed to no one except plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and were utilized solely to answer interrogatories. Thus, <em>R. </em>4:10 \u2014 2(d)(1) is inapplicable. It is, of course, clear that answers to interrogatories may, under limited circumstances, be introduced as substantive evidence at trial. <em>See R. </em>4:17-8. However, it does not follow that the process of answering interrogatories (except when a privileged communication is made to an expert and used by the expert to arrive at an opinion) is governed by <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d)(l) or decisional law addressing the admissibility of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">The motion judge also reasoned that the process of answering interrogatories is controlled by <em>N.J.R.E. </em>612. That rule, addressing writings used to refresh memory, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">[I]f a witness <em>while testifying </em>uses a writing to refresh the witness\u2019 memory for the purpose of <em>testifying, </em>an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the hearing for inspection and use in cross-examining the witness____ If the witness has used a writing to refresh the witness\u2019 memory <em>before testifying, </em>the court in its discretion and in the interest of justice may accord the adverse party the same right to the writing as that party would have if the writing had been used by the witness while <em>testifying.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>612 relates to testimonial evidence. \u201c \u2018[T]estimony\u2019 is in fact a particular kind or species of evidence, namely, that which comes to the tribunal through living witnesses speaking under oath or affirmation in the presence of the tribunal, judicial or quasi-judicial.\u201d 29 <em>Am.Jur.2\u00e1 Evidence </em>\u00a7 5 (1994). The first sentence of the rule is inapplicable because plaintiff did not refresh his memory by referring to the notes \u201cwhile testifying.\u201d While it may be so that both answering interrogatories and testifying occur under oath, it does not follow that the acts of answering interrogatories and giving testimony are synonymous. The second sentence does not apply because defendants did not make the requisite preliminary showing that plaintiff referred to the notes \u201cto refresh [his] memory before testifying[.]\u201d In fact, plaintiff expressly stated that he did not refer to the notes prior to his deposition. We therefore find no waiver of the attorney-client privilege as it applies to the notes plaintiff prepared in anticipation of litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Defendants argue that if plaintiff has not waived the attorney-client and work-product privileges, the privileges should be pierced because defendants have a compelling need to examine plaintiffs notes. Defendant Christakos points out that \u201c[t]here are very significant factual differences among the parties\u2019 recollections as to how the events during the plaintiffs hospitalization actually occurred[,]\u201d that plaintiffs notes \u201cmay provide evidence of what actually occurred\u201d and, because \u201cwitness credibility\u201d will be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>central issue in the case, defendant \u201cshould be allowed to obtain all relevant factual information available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In <em>In re Kozlov, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>232, 243-44, 398 A.2d 882 (1979), our Supreme Court defined the \u201cnecessary foundations to the valid piercing of [the attorney-client] privilege____\u201d There must be: (1) a legitimate need of the party to reach the evidence sought to be privileged; (2) a showing of relevance and materiality; and (3) the information cannot be secured from any less intrusive source.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">As to the work-product privilege, documents prepared by a party in anticipation of litigation are discoverable if the party seeking discovery \u201chas substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c). The rule is intended to accommodate the competing policy considerations in the discovery area; the interest in privacy of preparation of litigation, and our firm policy that essential justice is better achieved \u201cwhen there has been full disclosure so that the parties are conversant with all the available facts.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Rainner, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>50, 56, 350 A.2d 473 (1976). In <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>for example, the Court held that the plaintiff in a personal injury action was entitled to obtain motion picture films taken of her by defendant\u2019s private investigator during a surveillance prior to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 53-57, 350 A.2d 473. The Court reasoned that plaintiff had established a \u201csubstantial need\u201d to inspect the films since plaintiff would be unduly surprised by production of the film at trial without having the opportunity to challenge the integrity of the film or to develop evidence to counter it. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 350 A.2d 473. Also, plaintiff could not obtain the substantial equivalent of the film \u201cwithout undue hardship\u201d because of the uniqueness of the film having been taken eighteen months prior to the deposition of the investigator. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 350 A.2d 473. <em>See also In re Environmental Ins. Declaratory Judgment Actions, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 318, 612 A.2d 1338 (App.Div.1992) (recognizing that an interview report of a deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>employee would satisfy the substantial need/undue hardship standard under <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Whether we apply the test pronounced in <em>Kozlov, supra, </em>or the \u201csubstantial need\u201d test under <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c), we are satisfied that plaintiffs notes need not be disclosed. The information sought by defendants concerning the treatment and events occurring during the hospitalization are presumably recorded in the detailed hospital and physicians\u2019 records prepared during plaintiffs hospitalization. Thus, the information can be secured from a \u201cless intrusive source.\u201d <em>Kozlov, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 243, 398 A.2d 882. The facts contained in the hospital and physicians\u2019 records are the best evidence of what occurred during plaintiffs hospitalization and are at least the \u201csubstantial equivalent\u201d of plaintiffs notes. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c). Indeed, the hospital records will most likely be more reliable and more authoritative than plaintiffs self-recorded notes. <em>See e.g., N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6) (exception to the hearsay rule relating to business records); <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(4) (exception to the rule relating to statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment). Moreover, if the records were insufficient, defendants had the opportunity to find out exactly what plaintiff recalled concerning the care he received during his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\"> If, of course, plaintiff uses his notes while actually testifying during trial, or reviews the notes to refresh his recollection prior to testifying, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>612 may be applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
