This application was for the wife of the appellant; whom he alleged to be a material witness in his behalf, and whom he claims was sick and unable to attend court, although present in the town of Eastland where court was being held. We think no error is manifested by the record in overruling this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The testimony as to her condition was conflicting, but if full faith and credit be given that offered by appellant and that offered by the state be disregarded we think it clear that the testimony is such as to indicate that the condition of the appellant\u2019s wife is chronic and there is no showing made excusing appellant for not having taken the deposition of his wife, and neither is there a sufficient showing in the record to indicate any probability of her condition being better at another term of the court. We may observe in passing that the affidavit of the wife as to what her testimony would have been is not found in the record and not attached to the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">By bills of exceptions Nos. 2 and 3, appellant complains at the argument of the prosecuting attorney in the case. The court qualifies these bills by saying that they were solicited and invited by the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel, and in this condition of the record no error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">We think the court was not in error in permitting the state to prove that one of the parties who came with appellant to the house where the difficulty occurred was under the influence of liquor. It was certainly not of such importance as to justify a reversal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Neither do we think the court was in error in permitting the witness Turnbow to detail a conversation he had with the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>lant at the home of Turnbow, where the shooting occurred. This conversation took place immediately before the shooting and was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"And\">Appellant\u2019s complaint at the court\u2019s action in sustaining the state\u2019s objection to a question asked the witness Turnbow by him is without merit. The question was leading and suggestive and if appellant desired to go into the matter it was his duty to conform to the rules of evidence in asking the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We have examined the other complaints contained in the record and have reached the conclusion that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Believing that the facts are entirely sufficient to support the verdict and finding no errors of procedure in the record, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b393-11\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ-m\">\u2014 Appellant renews complaint of the refusal of his applications for continuance. Having same in mind, we have carefully sifted the testimony supporting the proposition that the continuance should have been granted. It was sought because of the absence of appellant\u2019s wife. She had come with him to court and, according to appellant\u2019s contention, had been taken ill after arriving at the county seat. Several physicians, who examined her, testified as to her condition. It seems without dispute that the disease from which she suffered was chronic. All said physicians testified that the condition of nervousness and illness resulting from the prospect of being used as a witness in her husband\u2019s case, would likely recur at any future time. She had been suffering from said disease for several years. No effort had been made to take her deposition or perpetuate her testimony. We gather from the testimony of the physicians that one element in the condition of the wife when examined by them, grew out of the fact of having made an automobile trip. On this point the sister of appellant\u2019s wife was used as a witness for the state. She said that the wife of appellant came to witness\u2019 house on the morning of the trial; that she was up and walking around and was not complaining of anything more than usual until noon; that up until the time appellant\u2019s wife heard the case was going to trial she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>was walking around the house, but when she heard that it was going to trial she went off and laid down. Giving consideration to all this testimony, we are satisfied the learned trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing this continuance. The qualifications put on appellant\u2019s bills of exception Nos. 2 and 3 leave no question of the fact that the argument of the State\u2019s Attorney complained of therein, was in reply to argument used by appellant\u2019s counsel. There is nothing in the proposition that the state proved that a party who was with appellant was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
