F. Williams, punishment is two years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Appellant was on his way to the gin with a load of cotton on a wagon. Williams drove up behind him in an automobile and signaled for room to pass. Appellant was slow to give any part of the road. Finally Williams passed by, going into a ditch with two wheels of his car. As he went by he said to appellant, \u201cWhy in tfye hell don\u2019t you turn out and give me part of the road?\u201d to which appellant replied, \u201cWhy in the hell don\u2019t you drive around me?\u201d Williams went on to the store after some articles, and returning met appellant and asked him what he had said. Williams claims appellant made no reply except to begin shooting at him (Williams) with a pistol; that after appellant had fired several times he (Williams) fired once at appellant. The latter claimed to be acting in self-defense; that Williams had a pistol when he got out of his car and fired at \"appellant first. Other witnesses present testified, some supporting Williams\u2019 version, and some in part sustaining appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The court charged upon assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and self-defense in a manner satisfactory to accused. No objections were made to the charge, and no exceptions taken to any proceeding during the trial. The verdict is supported by the evidence, it being the jury\u2019s province to determine the conflicts therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
