On January 13, 1926, an additional allowance of time of thirty days was made. The statute permitting the extension of time (Art. 760, C. C. P., Rev. of 1925) concludes with these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-19\">\u201c* * * but the same shall not be so extended as to delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the filing thereof within ninety days from the date the notice of appeal is given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-3\">Observance of this statutory provision compels this court to sustain the objection of the state\u2019s attorney to the consideration of the statement of facts and bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The indictment appears regular, and there being no facts or complaints of the procedure properly before this court, it has no chance but to order that the judgment be affirmed.
