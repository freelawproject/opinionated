Appellant testified denying the transaction occurred as detailed by Sneed, but claimed Sneed lost his money in a dice game with appellant and Williams. This issue was properly submitted to the jury and it was settled in favor of the state. The criticism of the charge appears to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">Two special charges were requested, the first of which is brought forward' by proper bill of exception complaining because the court declined to instruct the jury to return <em>a </em>verdict of not guilty for various reasons set out in the charge, all of which turn upon the claimed insufficiency of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>dence. Without setting out the testimony more in detail than has already been done it is sufficient to say that the state made out its case as alleged in the indictment by the evidence or prosecuting witness and the jury accepted that as the true version of the matter. The trial court was warranted in declining to give the charge requested. We are without authority to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Special charge No. 2 is simply marked \u201crefused.\u201d It bears no notation indicating that appellant excepted to its refusal and complaint of such refusal is not brought forward by separate bill of exception. However, we note this special charge presents the defense of appellant to the effect that the money of which Sneed claims to have been robbed was really won by appellant and Williams in a game of dice. This issue was properly and fully submitted in the court\u2019s main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Finding no error in the record the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
