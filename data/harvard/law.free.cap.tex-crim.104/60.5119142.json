The indictment was for selling liquor to one Cicero Downs, who testified that on the occasion in question he was intoxicated, but remembered going with two other men to appellant\u2019s house, and also that he paid $5.00 for some whiskey. One of the other men testified that he went with the party to appellant\u2019s house and two quarts of whiskey in a half-gallon jar were put into the car in a tow sack. He was asked the question if he saw appellant deliver the whiskey and stated he saw him lay it down on the porch at his house, and that as well as he remembers Cicero Downs picked it up and carried it to the car. The third man testified that he went .with Downs and the other witness to appellant\u2019s house, and saw him there, and saw Cicero Downs with two quarts of whiskey in a tow sack; that they called appellant to the fence and he and Cicero had a few min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>utes\u2019 talk and then walked off down beside the fence into appellant\u2019s house and that when they came back they had the whiskey with them in a tow sack, and it seemed to him that Cicero was carrying it and that he brought it back, and that he did not remember which one put it in the car. No testimony was offered by the defense. No other person than appellant was shown to have been present or to have had any dealings with said parties or any connection with the whiskey. If there be any question as to the sufficiency of the testimony to make out a case by direct, evidence, there could be no escape from the proposition that the testimony is so nearly direct and positive as to bring it within the rule laid down by many authorities that where the accused is put in such juxtaposition to the main fact as to leave no question, it would not be reversible error to fail to charge - on circumstantial evidence.

We set out the facts substantially. We re-state them: The state had three witnesses; Downs</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">swore that he knew where appellant lived on May 30, 1924, and that he went to appellant\u2019s house with Davidson and Bass and got some shinny; that Bass brought it to the car and witness paid for it; that the car was stopped close to appellant\u2019s house, that witness was drunk on the occasion and did. not remember seeing appellant, that he did not think he saw him. Davidson swore that he saw appellant on the date mentioned at his house, that he saw appellant lay the whiskey down on the porch of his house and, as well as witness remembered, Cicero Downs picked it up and carried it to the car; that was the only whiskey bought by the party that day, if it was bought. Bass swore that the three went to appellant\u2019s house and saw him, and that he saw Downs with two quarts of whiskey which he \u201cgot from Modeshaw Fuller,\u201d that they called appellant out to the fence, and appellant and Downs walked off into the former\u2019s house and \u201cwhen they came back they came back with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>it in a tow sackthat the party got no whiskey from any one else that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We have here then a case in which three men swear they got whiskey at appellant\u2019s house, saw no one but him, dealt with no one but him, called for no one but him, he came out, and one of the party went into appellant\u2019s house with him and came out carrying a tow sack containing whiskey. The man carrying the whiskey said he was drunk on on the occasion but knew that he paid for it. One of the men, referring to the whiskey, said that another one of the party got it from Modeshaw Fuller, this being appellant\u2019s name. The conclusion seems to us irresistible. The facts in evidence practically exclude the possibility of the connection of any other person with the transaction save appellant and the purchasing parties. We are still of opinion that it was not reversible error to fail to charge on circumstancial evidence, and the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
