That she admitted and no more. This was controverted by Costillo, who acted as interpreter, and he was corroborated by other witnesses who gave testimony. This being the only question upon which the right to a new trial could be predicated under the present record and being a controverted question, its decision by the trial court is binding here.-</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">Upon the record before us, this court is not warranted in reversing the judgment. It is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
