There are but two bills of exceptions contained in the record. Each of these bills complain at the argument of the district attorney. Bill No. 1 shows that the following argument was used: \u201cI want you to consider the bastard child he the defendant has or is going to bring into the world, think of no happy Christmas to enjoy, no daddy to meet at home.\u201d By bill No. <em>2 </em>complaint is made of the following remarks: \u201cIf you give this defendant a death penalty or a term of fifty years in the pen, which he ought to have, Maurine Cotner has hers already.\u201d We think these statements were not of such an inflammatory character as to justify a reversal of the case. They were matters of inference drawn by the district attorney from the facts in evidence in the case. They were certainly not of sufficient importance to justify a reversal in view of the fact that the lowest penalty was assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The court correctly refused defendant\u2019s special charge No. 1 by which he sought to have the jury instructed that if they had a reasonable doubt as to whether some other person than the defendant had had carnal knowledge of the prosecutrix prior to the 2nd day of May, 1925, to acquit the defendant. A charge should always be based on evidence contained in the record and we have searched this record in vain for any testimony, direct or circumstantial, to the effect that any person other than the defendant had ever had carnal intercourse with the prosecutrix, and if the testimony is to be believed she had never had such intercourse with him except at the time at which he is charged with having raped her. There is no suggestion in this record that the prosecutrix was of unchaste character prior to the time of the alleged rape and the court correctly refused to present this theory in his charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Morrow, Presiding Justice, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b390-5\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A9GX\">The prosecutrix, Maurine Cotner, testified to the act of intercourse with the appellant. According to her statement, she and the appellant, her brother-in-law, walked home at night from a gathering. The appellant and his wife lived in a box car. The prosecutrix was slightly over fifteen years of age. The circumstances implied consent. There was no outcry or disclosure until her pregnancy was discovered, some five months after\" the occurrence. There was corroboration to the point that she and the appellant were out together on the night in question. She was very strenuously cross-examined with reference to her associations with other boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In his motion for rehearing, appellant insists that the story of the prosecutrix is so out of harmony with human experience as to be incredible and that in the absence of corroboration her testimony is not sufficient to support the verdict. We fail to perceive any cogent reason for holding her testimony to the act of intercourse incredible. It is true that she did not report it and claims to have made some faint resistance. Though the jury believed she made no resistance or objection, she being under the age of consent, corroboration was not essential.\u201d See Hamilton v. State, 35 Tex. Crim. Rep. 372; Snodgrass v. State, 67 Tex. Crim. Rep. 615; Newton v. State, 58 Tex. Crim. Rep. 316. The due administration of justice requires careful scrutiny of the testimony of the prosecutrix, but does not authorize its arbitrary rejection by the appellate court. See Gazley v. State, 17 Tex. Crim. App. 277; Cock v. State, 228 S. W. 213, see p. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Appellant refers to the case of Adkins v. State, 65 Tex. Crim. Rep. 924; Kee v. State, 65 S. W. 517. Tinker\u2019s case, 253 S. W. 531, on motion for rehearing, is not analogous, the conviction being reversed upon an error or practice. The announcement made in Gazley\u2019s case, supra, was re-affirmed and cases cited in support of it. However, Tinker\u2019s case, supra, is not an authority against the affirmance of the present judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
