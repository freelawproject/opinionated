Bill No. one complains at the court\u2019s action in overruling his challenge to three of the jurors for the reason that said jurors on their voir dire answered that they had conscientious scruples against the infliction of the death penalty as a punishment for crime. The bill simply shows that defendant challenged said jurors for that reason and his challenge for cause was by the court overruled. The bill of exceptions nowhere shows that defendant\u2019s peremptory challenges were exhausted and it fails to show that an objectionable juror sat on the trial of the case. This bill fails to show any error. Nairn v. State, 45 S. W. 704. Mancillas v. State, 76 S. W. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">Bill of exceptions No. 2 complains at the court\u2019s action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>refusing to quash the writ of special venire for the reason that the j urors were not served in person but were served by a postal card. This bill is qualified by the court with the statement that the whole venire was present upon the call of this case except those who had been excused by counsel or by the court for legal reasons or who had removed from the county. There being perhaps two or three of the latter. \u201cThe purpose of the personal summons is to procure the attendance of the jurors. When that is accomplished by an irregular summons, the form of summons is not available as a ground for quashing the writ unless some injury is shown.\u201d Brown v. State, 222 S. W. 255, citing Whittington v. State, 215 S. W. 457. 12th American and English Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice, p. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">There being no errors of procedure found in the record and the evidence being sufficient to support the verdict, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b229-9\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A8F\">The correctness of the disposition of appellant\u2019s complaint in Bill of Exceptions No. 1 is called in question. It is believed that upon the reasons stated in the original opinion, the bill fails to show error. All that can be ascertained from the bill is that three of the veniremen declared on their voir dire that they had conscientious scruples against the infliction of the death penalty as a punishment for crime. The appellant\u2019s challenge for cause was overruled but he exercised peremptory challenges. In selecting the jury all of his peremptory challenges were exhausted. If the court\u2019s ruling was wrong, the facts stated in the bill would not require a reversal for the reason that it is made apparent that the veniremen did not sit upon the jury. It does not appear that any juror who was objectionable was impaneled. As we understand it, the precedents are to this effect: If it appears from the bill of exceptions that a good challenge for cause of a juror was erroneously overruled, the peremptory challenges of the appellant were exhausted, and an objectionable juror sat in the case, a reversal will be authorized. Rothschild v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App. 540; Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas, P. C., Sec. 542, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>many cases are cited. Unless the bill shows that one or more of the jurors who tried the case w\u00e1s an objectionable juror, the error of the court in overruling a challenge for cause made by the defendant will not work a reversal. Myers v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App. 653; Loggins v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App. 72; Burrell v. State, 18 Texas Rep. 730; Villareal v. State, 61 S. W. 716; Mays v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep. 170; Hudson v. State, 28 Texas Crim App. 338; and other cases collated in Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., Sec. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We are not to be understood, however, as intimating that the bill shows a good challenge for cause upon the part of the appellant. So far as we are aware, the exact question has never been presented to this court. We do find in other jurisdictions, however, with a statute like ours, that the possession of conscientious scruples against the infliction of the death penalty for crime is not available to the accused as a challenge for cause. See State v. Compagnet, 48 La. Ann. 1470, 21 So. 46; Cyc. of Law &amp; Proc., Vol. 24, p. 307, Note 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
