L. Lindsey. The testimony shows that J. L. Lindsey was in partnership with one L. H. Krough and that this firm had possession and control of the automobile at the time it was stolen. Appellant seriously contends that the proof does not meet the allegations in the indictment, in that same charges that the property was stolen from Lindsey and the proof shows that it was in the custody of Lindsey and Krough. The rule is correctly stated by Mr. Branch as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">\u201cWhen property is owned either by general or special owners in common, or jointly between two or more persons, the ownership may be alleged to be in all or either of them.\u201d Par. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>4, </em>Sec. 2434, Branch\u2019s P. C. for many authorities supporting this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We think the facts are clear to the effect that Lindsey and Krough had the actual care, custody and management of this property and under the authorities above cited, the state was well within its rights in alleging the ownership to be in Lindsey alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Various criticisms are levelled at the court\u2019s charge. We have examined same very carefully and are of the opinion that they are without merit. Appellant\u2019s testimony raised the issue that he believed that he had a right to use the car in quesion in furtherance of the business of Lindsey and Krough and did so without any intent to deprive the owner of the car. The court pertinently and fairly submitted this issue to the jury by telling them that if they found such to be appellant\u2019s intent from the evidence, or if they had a reasonable doubt thereof to acquit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b373-11\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AsZN\">The ownership of the stolen property is laid in J. L. Lindsey. Appellant takes the position that Lindsey was a mere custodian and that the real ownership should have been laid in the sheriff and cites many authorities in support of his position. However, it is not believed that the appellant\u2019s contention is supported by the evidence, the substance of which we quote from the appellant\u2019s brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\"><em>\u201cJ. </em>L. Lindsey testified: \u2018As to the circumstances under which I lost that car I will state the car I had in storage at 411 Main Avenue, on the third floor. The car originally belonged to the San Antonio Motor Sales Company, they sold the car and it was foreclosed on by the sheriff\u2019s office, and they had advertised it for sale, and the sheriff had it, and I had charge of all that stuff at the time. They turned over all of that stuff to me, and I was handling it just as fast as it came in. I guess I had forty-five or fifty cars on the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>floor. And when the sheriff came down there to sell the car, I could not find it; I did not know where it was, in fact that is the first time I had missed it.\u2019 (S. F. p. 2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u201cHe also testified: \u2018As to whether this car belonged to the San Antonio Motor Sales Company, will state, it really belonged to the Union Securities Company; they had the notes on it, and we had a contract \u2014 we bought all of that stuff, as quick as it was sold we taken it over. It really belonged to the sheriff, that is who it belonged to, because the sheriff had the receipts.\u2019 (P. 6.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cL. H. Krough testified that he was the partner of J. L. Lindsey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Krough and Lindsey each testified that they did not consent to the taking of the property. It occurs to us that the sheriff was the general owner and Lindsey the special owner. The announcements of the court found in Frazier\u2019s case, 18 Tex. Crim. App. 434, particularly on page 442, are in accord with the correctness of the ruling of the trial court. Lindsey and his partner were clearly in possession of the property somewhat in the attitude of warehousemen. The property was in their warehouse. They had insurance upon it. It was in their care within the statute. We think they were special owners. See Rabe v. State, 85 Tex. Crim. Rep. 373; McKnight v. State, 70 Tex. Crim. Rep. 470, and other cases collated in the opinion. See also Torrence v. State, 85 Texas Crim. Rep. 311. An exhaustive citation of authorities will be found in 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 312. Among them are King v. State, 100 S. W. 387; Smith v. State, 34 Tex. Crim. Rep. 124; King v. State, 43 Tex. Rep. 351; Cox v. State, 43 Tex. Rep 101; Hill v. State, 11 Tex. Crim. App. 132. In Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 2447, are collated many cases illustrating the distinction between a special owner and a mere custodian. A review of them is deemed inexpedient. Suffice it to say that our examination of them and others has lead us to the conclusions stated, namely, that Lindsey was not a mere custodian but a special owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The evidence being conclusive and without controversy that Lindsey was in possession of the property, the complaint of the charge with reference to the court using the words \u201clegal possession\u201d we think is not such a fault as would warrant a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
