The appeal bond in this case is conditioned that the appellants \u201cshall prosecute their appeal with effect and in case the judgment of the Supreme Court or the Court of Civil Appeals shall be against them, they shall perform its judgment, sentence and decrees, etc.\u201d This bond is wholly insufficient to give this court jurisdiction of the appeal, and for that reason the appeal will have to be dismissed. Anderson et al v. State, 166 S. Wi. 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">It might be proper at this time to call the attention of the appellant\u2019s attorneys to the fact that this case is not briefed in accordance with the rules governing civil cases, which are binding on this court in cases of this kind.

Notwithstanding this fact, there has been no effort to show that the record, as presented insofar as it relates to briefing, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>reflect the true status of the record as made. There is nothing in the record to show that any brief, or copies of the brief, were filed in the trial court within the time and in keeping with the requirements of the rules pertaining to civil cases, nor is it briefed in this court in keeping with the rules applicable to civil cases. We are therefore, on this account, without authority of law to pass upon the merits of the case. Swim v. State, 218 S. W. 761, 86 Texas Crim. Rep. 576; Davis v. State, 226 S. W. 409, 88 Texas Crim.
