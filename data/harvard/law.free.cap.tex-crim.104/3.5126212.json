He\u2019s snooping around town here and I don\u2019t know what he is figuring on.\u201d The sheriff testified that he stated in reply thereto, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep you until morning and investigate you,\u201d\u2014 referring to the defendant, \u2014 \u201cand if you are all right, there is no harm done, and if you are not we will have you.\u201d The state introduced the sheriff as a witness and attempted to have him testify to a conversation he had with appellant after he had received him from the city marshal, whereupon appellant\u2019s counsel objected because the appellant was then under arrest, had not been warned, and the purported statement had not been reduced to writing. It appears that the learned judge entertained some doubts as to the appellant being under arrest, overruled the objection raised, permitted the testimony to go to the jury, and submitted the issue as to whether or not the appellant was under arrest in his general charge for the determination of the jury; to \u2022all of which action of the court the appellant objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">We think the contention of the appellant is correct; that the facts stated clearly show that the appellant was under arrest, and if the evidence is the same upon another trial, the court should so hold, and that it was error to submit said issue to the jury. In the case of Bingham v. State, 97 Tex. Crim. Rep. 594, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>262 S. W. 747, this court held that it was the duty of the trial court to determine whether or not the facts showed appellant to be under arrest, and same was not an issue to be submitted to the jury. See also Warren v. State, 98 Tex. Crim. Rep. 639, 267 S. W. 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">For the errors above discussed, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The foregoing opinion by the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
