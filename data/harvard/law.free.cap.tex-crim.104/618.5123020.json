The court submitted aggravated assault only. No written objections were made to the court\u2019s instructions and no special charges were requested. The first complaint of any alleged error in the instructions to the jury is found in the amended motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The amended practice act relating to the charge and objections thereto enacted in 1913 and now incorporated in Article 658, and 666 C. C. P. (1925) requires objections to the charge to be in writing filed at the time of trial. Since this law became effective it has been the uniform holding of this court that objections to instructions made for the first time in motion for new trial could not be considered. Bargas v.
