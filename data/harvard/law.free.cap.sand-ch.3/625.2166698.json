The toll bridge was built accordingly. In 1832, the legislature authorized the construction of a railway across the sam\u00e9 river, between two distant places, which would necessarily cross the river at or near such bridge, and which was constructed and was carried across the river by a bridge, one-fourth of a mile distant from the former; and in its operation the railroad diminished by one-third, the accustomed receipts of the toll bridge;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-6\"><em>Held, </em>1. That the act conferring the franchise on M., was not a covenant or grant that no similar franchise should be conferred on others ; and did not restrict the authority of a future legislature, to establish a toll bridge or ferry at the same place.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-7\">2. That the grant to the rail road company did not impair the obligation of any contract with M., within the meaning of the prohibition in the constitution of the United States.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-8\">3. That the franchise granted to the rail road company, was not the same as that conferred on M., nor so similar as to be deemed an interference with the latter, in the sense in which a new bridge or ferry interferes with one previously established at the same point.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-9\">4. That if it were a direct interference, the rail road company were authorized to erect and maintain a bridge for the use of their railway, adjacent to M.\u2019s bridge, and the act granting them the power was valid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-10\">It is the province and the right of the legislature, in the exercise of its sovereign duty to provide ways for the use of the people, to authorize the construction and use of newly invented or improved modes of conveying passengers and freight; although the necessary consequence may be, that profitable modes of conveyance in actual use, will thereby be superseded, although those engaged in them will be subjected to the loss of their business and capital; and although valuable franchises previously conferred by the legislature in respect of such old modes, will be rendered unavailable and worthless.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-11\">There is no implication of an exclusive right to a franchise, where the charter or act conferring it, is silent on the subject.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b633-12\">A statute, authorizing an individual to erect a bridge, and to receive tolls for its use, confers upon him a franchise; and a substantial compliance with the conditions imposed by the act, will invest him with its rights and privileges.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Where a franchise has become vested in the donee or grantee, it is no defence to a suit brought by him to assert or maintain the franchise, that he has forfeited it by any subsequent acts of commission or omission.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-5\">There must be a judicial forfeiture of the franchise, at the suit of the state, before individuals can avail themselves of such acts. It cannot be impeached collaterally.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-6\">. Where an act conferring a franchise to build a bridge and to take tolls, provided that the owner of any unauthorized bridge or vessel used to transport passengers at the same point, should pay treble tolls, to be recovered by the donee in an action of debt before a justice; in a suit in equity by the owner of the bridge, against a corporation, for a violation of his franchise through a new bridge, alleged to be unauthorized ;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-7\"><em>Held, </em>1. That the remedy given by the act was cumulative, and did not preclude the donee trom resorting to other actions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-8\">2. If the act were otherwise, the necessity of the case would warrant another remedy, as the corporation could not be sued before a justice.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-9\">3. That chancery has jurisdiction.to restrain by injunction, the unlawful use of the new bridge, at the suit of the owner of the franchise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-10\">4. That chancery would not maintain a suit in his hehalf for an account of the tolls lost through the use of the new bridge ; but if a case were made for its interposition by way of injunction, it would decree an account as an incident to such relief.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-11\">5. That this court would not enforce the penalty provided by the act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-12\">The proprietors of a toll bridge authorized by law, several years after the bridge was built, were incorporated by the legislature. There was no distinct evidence that they accepted the charter, there was proof of some of their own proceedings declining it; and in a <em>quo warranto </em>against them by the attorney general, for assuming to act as a body politic, they had traversed the allegation, and that officer had thereupon entered a judgment of <em>preclusion.\u2014Held, </em>that these facts proved that they had not accepted the charter, and were conclusive on the point that they did not thereby become a body politic or corporate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-13\">A rail road company was chartered with power to build a bridge for their railway across a river. At or near the place where it was to cross, a private bridge had been erected by individuals duly authorized by law, to build a bridge for their own private use, which was entirely convenient, and of sufficient strength for the purposes of the rail road ; and the company purchased the bridge of the owners, reserving to the latter the use of it as <em>before.\u2014Held, </em>that the owners were authorized to sell, and the company to buy the bridge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-14\">A corporation authorized by law to build a bridge at a given point, may buy one already built at the same point, if suitable for their purpose.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b634-15\">February 17, 18, 19, <em>20, 21;</em></otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ao7\">July 21, 1846.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-16\">The bill xvas filed September 16,1843, by Samuel M.

The bridge itself was of the width of twenty-four feet. He also executed to the treasurer of the state, the bond required by the sixth section of the act of 1795. The stone dam mentioned in that act, was never erected. On the 8th day of October, 1796, Lewis Morris executed to Coles, a conveyance in due form, of all his rights to the toll bridge and the franchises granted by the .act of 1790.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-6\">The road to Eastchester, provided in the act of 1790, was laid out; but not being fully opened or made available, the legislature on the 30th of March, 1797, passed an act in these words, viz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-7\">\u201c An act for the relief of John B.

Coles to raise a dam across Harlem River, and to amend an act, entitled an act for building a bridge across Harlem River.\u2019 And whereas it is represented to the legislature, that although the commissioners named for that purpose in the first above mentioned act, had laid out a road from the said bridge to Eastchester, yet the damages to the persons through whose land it was laid out, are not paid, and some part of the said road is not opened; and that the said John B. Coles has already expended a considerable sum of money in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>making, clearing and amending the said road; and that it will require further large sums for that purpose, besides what can be done in the ordinary mode of making and repairing highways in this state. And whereas the said John B. Coles hath prayed relief in the premises. Therefore,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-5\">I. Be it enacted by the people of the state of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, That the said road so laid out shall be, and hereby is established as a public highway from and after the passing of this act; and shall and may be immediately opened as a public highway, although the damages to the persons, or any or either of them, through whose land the same is laid out, may not be paid. And it shall and may be lawful for the said John B. Coles and his assigns, at his and their expense, to cause the said road to be cleared and properly made, for the convenience of travellers, and all others having occasion to use the same road ; and as soon as the same road shall be made and cleared as aforesaid, then and from thenceforth it shall and may be lawful for the said John B. Coles and his assigns, for and during the term of thirty years, to demand and take an additional toll for passing the said bridge, not exceeding fifty per cent, above what is allowed by the acts aforesaid, or either of them ; and that the said John B. Coles shall, at his own expense, keep the said road in repair, during the term he shall exact any additional toll for passing the said bridge.\u201d (20th Sess., chapt. 63; 2 K. &amp; R. 491.) The second section of this act was repealed the following year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-6\">On the 3d of April, 1798, another act was passed by the legislature, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-7\">\u201c An Act to amend the act, entitled An Act for the relief of John B. Coles, and to provide for laying out new roads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-8\">I. Be it enacted by the people of the state of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, That the term of thirty years, allowed in and by the act, entitled \u2018An act for the relief of John B.

Coles, or in any other person or persons claiming under him, or in the Harlem River Bridge Company. (Laws of 1813, p. 237.) And a similar provision was inserted in the acts of May 9th, 1836, and May 15th, 1837, hereinafter stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-7\">On the first day of July, 1804, John B. Coles divided his interest and franchises in the toll bridge, into shares; and sold, transferred and conveyed portions of such shares, to different individuals. From that time, the proprietors of the bridge were usually called the Harlem Bridge Company. The complainants were the owners by purchase and otherwise, of the shares so originated by Coles, including those he retained. In his conveyances of the toll bridge shares, Coles reserved to himself the right to erect the dam provided in the act of 1795, and all other-rights, except the toll bridge and its appurtenant liberties and franchises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-8\">In 1808, the legislature passed an act incorporating the proprietors of the toll bridge by the name of <em>The Harlem Bridge </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>Company. </em>(Private Acts of 1808, p. 66.) There was no distinct evidence that the proprietors, applied for, or accepted the charter thus conferred. The complainants proved that the subject was presented to their consideration at a meeting on the 4th of January, 1809, when it was referred to a committee, who reported to another meeting on the 3d of February, 1809, against accepting the charter, and their report was agreed to. In answer to a communication from the State Comptroller in 1834, the proprietors replied that they were not incorporated, and claimed no privileges as a body politic.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">In October, 1835, the Attorney General, on the relation of Thomas C. Taylor and others, filed in the supreme court, an information in the nature of a <em>quo </em>warranto, against the -now complainants and others, then representing and owning the toll bridge or the principal part of it, alleging that the defendants in the information were exercising the privilege and franchise of being a body politic and corporate, by the name of the Harlem Bridge Company; and also the franchise of having and main- \u25a0 tabling a toll bridge over and across the Harlem River, from the city of New York to the town of Westchester, without being legally incorporated, and without being authorized thereto by law. The proprietors of the bridge put in a plea, setting forth their rights under John B. Coles, and the acts of 1790, 1795, 1797 and 1798, before mentioned, recognized by the act of 1813, to have and maintain the toll bridge, and to take the tolls prescribed in the act; and they traversed the using of any of the corporate rights and privileges alleged in the information. There were many issues joined in respect of the toll bridge, and the right to maintain the same, which it. is unnecessary to state. The Attorney General did not take issue upon the ti'averse of the fact, that they used the rights and privileges of a body politic and corporate, but reciting that they disavowed and disclaimed the same, prayed judgment of exclusion. The supreme court in June, 1839, rendered a judgment accordingly, adjudging that they do in no way intermeddle with such liberties, privileges and franchises of being a body politic and corporate, and of acting as such within this state, but that they be altogether excluded from the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>In support of the objections taken in the answers in this suit, to the complainant\u2019s rights, a mass of testimony was taken respecting the situation and condition of their toll bridge, and the opening left therein, and the draw for the passage of vessels. This testimony proved that since 1825, the opening had not been twenty-five feet wide; and it tended to establish that it was not more than twenty or twenty-one feet in width ; that the bed of the river yas obstructed in the opening, by stones thrown there to support the piers of the bridge, so that vessels could not go through except at high water, and that the draw was not maintained of the requisite width, and that the bridge itself was in a dilapidated condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-5\">On the 25th of April, 1831, an act of the legislature was passed, entitled \u201cAn act to incorporate The New York and Harlaem Rail Road Company,\u201d by which that company was incorporated, with power to build and maintain a railway with a single or double track, from any point on the north bounds of Twenty-Third street in the city of New York, to any point on the Harlem River, between the east bounds of the Third Avenue and the west bounds of the Eighth Avenue; to be used with steam, mechanical and animal power, or any or either of them.

The route thus adopted, ran for the first thirty miles, through the centre of Westchester county, and when the bill was filed, the rail road had been completed and was in active operation for about six miles northwardly of the Harlem River, and trains for the conveyance of passengers, passed over it several times each day from the City Hall in New York, across the Harlem River to its northern termination. Besides which it transported freight daily, its whole length. At the time of the hearing, the rail road had been extended and was in like active use, for a distance of about thirty miles from the Harlem River, through the heart of the county of Westchester, and was in rapid progress towards the county of Putnam. When the bill was filed, the number of passengers who crossed the Harlem River daily in the cars of the Harlem rail road, was one hundred and upwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">The motive powerused on the rail road beyond the compact part of the city of New York, wassteam; and the passengercars were of a large and heavy construction, each containing accommodations for fifty or sixty passengers: And it was proved that the complainants bridge was not of sufficient size or strength to admit of the passage over it, of carriages of such weight as the engines and cars of the Rail Road Company. The cars commenced running across the river, about the twenty-first of September, 1841. The company built a depot for their own use, on the Morrisania side of the river, near the end of their bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\">Prior in time to these events, was the passage of an act by the legislature, on the 15th day of May, 1837, entitled \u201cAn act to authorize the building of a private bridge across the Harlem River,\u201d which was in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-9\">\u201c \u00a7 1.

The bridge thus constructed, was built upon three stone piers, with two abutments, and had a draw which was forty-six feet wide between the stone piers and forty feet wide between the wood projections, when opened. From the tim\u00e9 of its completion, it was used by the inhabitants of Morrisania, for their transit to and from the city of New York. Gates were erected at the end of the bridge which completely inclosed it, and a person was employed to prevent unauthorized persons from crossing the bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">On the tenth day of November, 18-40, The New York and Harlem Rail Road Company entered into an agreement under seal, for the purchase of this bridge and the abutments, (if on trial, it proved to be of sufficient strength,) from Lewis Morris, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Convenient- Morris, Gerard W. Morris, Richard V. Morris, Henry Morris, William H. Morris and Richard L. Morris, who had built and then owned the same ; for the price of $30,000, or the cost and interest, if they were less than that sum. The vendors reserving to the inhabitants of Morrisania, all their rights and privileges, which were conferred upon them by the act of May 15, 1837. And on the 17th day of August, 1841, (a trial of its strength proving satisfactory,) the bridge and abutments were conveyed to the rail road company, by the owners above named, reserving such rights and privileges of the inhabitants of Morrisania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">The Rail Road Company laid the track of their rail-way, on the floor of the bridge which had thus been erected by the Messrs-Morris, and it became a part of their rail road from the city of New York into the county of Westchester. The gentlemen who erected the bridge, and the inhabitants of Morrisania in general, continued to make use of the same bridge for their private purposes, as before. The Rail Road Company employed an attendant to prevent the passage of persons not in their employ, nor inhabitants of Morrisania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\">In respect of the complainants bridge, it was shown that the Third Avenue which terminated at the bridge, was the great thoroughfare from the city of New York to the county of Westchester, and the adjacent country to the north and east. That the travel which formerly crossed the bridge was very great, especially in vehicles of all kinds ; and the bridge was extensively used for foot passengers, and animals led or driven, which were subject to the payment of tolls. That after the rail road commenced running their passenger trains into the county of Westchester, the travel of all descriptions over the complainants bridge, was seriously diminished, and their receipt of tolls reduced about one-third ; and the further extension of the rail road, it was supposed, would still farther affect the receipt of tolls at their bridge, and injure the complainants property therein to an irreparable extent. They contended that from the mode of travelling and freighting on the rail road, it was and would be impracticable for the complainants to ascertain with precision, the extent of their loss and damage by means of the rail road company\u2019s crossing and using the Morris bridge. They also contended, and gave evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>prove, that ever since the construction of that bridge, both the Morris\u2019s while they controlled it, and the rail road company after the sale to them, had so negligently or improperly guarded and taken care of that bridge, that it had been constantly made use of by persons on foot, in vehicles, and with animals, who had no right to cross it, and w ho thereby evaded the payment of the tolls which they ought to have paid to the complainants. The testimony on this subject, failed to establish any such negligence or omission on the part of the Messrs. Morris; but itproved that in some instances, the charge against the rail road company in this particular was well founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-5\">The latter company insisted in their answer, that the complainants were precluded from interfering with the use of the new bridge, because they had raised no objection nor given any warning to the company, although they had looked on and seen the company expending a very large sum of money in constructing the extension of their rail road, which extension, would be utterly useless, without the bridge in question.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-6\"><em>C.

The right granted to L.

The act by its terms was exclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-10\">2. But if it were not so expressed in the act, the grant of tolls necessarily excluded all competition which would diminish the tolls. <em>(Newburgh Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>5 J. C. R. 101, 106, 112; <em>Livingston v. Van Ingen, </em>9 J. R. 568, 573; <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>4 J. C. R. 161.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-11\">II. The complainants, as assignees of John B. Coles, the assignee of Lewis Morris, are entitled to the franchise; and all the * conditions precedent to'the vesting of the exclusive right, were complied with, and have been repeatedly acknowledged by the ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>legislature t\u00f3 have been complied with. (Acts of 1790, 1795, 1797, 1798, before mentioned. <em>The </em>People, <em>ex rel. Taylor </em>v. <em>Thompson and </em>others, 21 Wend. 235 ; reversed in the Court of Errors, 23 ibid. 537.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-5\">III. It was not in the power of the legislature after granting that franchise to Morris, to re-grant any part of it to any other person, or make any other grant, or give any other privilege, which would prevent or impair the full enjoyment of the franchise during its continuance. (3 Kent\u2019s Com. 458, 9; 2 Bl. Com. 37; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Cambridge, Vice-Chancellor, </em>3 Burr. 1656; <em>Wales </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>2 Mass. R. 146 ; <em>Crittenden </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>5 Cowen, 165.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">It is no excuse or justification for the erection of a new bridge or ferry, which interferes with one previously granted, that it Was erected by the King\u2019s license. (Hardres. Rep. 163; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Sir Oliver Butler, </em>3 Lev. 221; <em>S. C. 2 </em>Ventris, 344; <em>Yard </em>v. <em>Ford, 2 </em>Saunder\u2019s Rep. 172; 2 Institutes, 406.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">The act granting the franchise, the acceptance by Lewis Morris and his assignee, John B; Coles, the undertaking to comply with its terms, and in this case the actual building the bridge, and thereby the payment of a valuable consideration, constituted a contract, which by the Constitution of the United States, the legislature could not, directly nor indirectly impair; and which would be infringed by the grant of a franchise to compete with it. (6 Cranch, 87; 7 ibid. <em>164; </em>9 ibid. 49; <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheaton, 516 ; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>8 ibid. 84 ; <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>8 ibid. 50.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-8\">IY. The exception to the exclusive grant to Lewis Morris, in the act of 1790, did not authorize the inhabitants of Harlem and Morrisania to build a bridge across Harlem River for any purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-9\">Y. But if the exception permitted the legislature to pass the act of 15th May, 1837, authorizing the inhabitants of that part of the town of Westchester, which in 1790 was called Morrisania, to build a free bridge for their own private use, the legislature had not the power to authorize any other ferry or bridge over the river, for any purpose whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-10\">YI. The act of 1837, does not authorize a bridge to be erected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>for sale, nor for any purpose but the exclusive private use of the inhabitants of Morrisania. No purchaser of it can appropriate it, or suffer it to be appropriated to any other use. The Rail Road Company, therefore, have acquired no title to the new bridge, and have no right to use, or suffer it to be used for any purpose, unless it be the exclusive private use of the inhabitants of Morrisania.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-5\">VII. The act of 7th May, 1840, (Laws of 1840, p. 190,) authorizing the Rail Road Company to build a bridge across the river, is a violation of the franchise vested in the complainants, and as against them is entirely nugatory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-6\">VIII. The erection and use of the new bridge by the defendants, so near and creating so injurious a competition to the bridge of the complainants, affording facilities to every traveller to shun the complainant\u2019s bridge, which he would otherwise pass; is in respect to the complainant\u2019s franchise, a <em>nuisance ; </em>and this court will grant a perpetual injunction to secure the enjoyment of the complainant\u2019s franchise. <em>(Newburgh Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>5 J. C. R. 101.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">IX. The objection, that the complainants can only obtain redress by action of debt before a justice, cannot prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-8\">The Rail Road Company being a corporation, cannot be sued before a justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-9\">The right to sue before a justice for treble toll, was given as a cumulative remedy; is of a penal character ; and no other remedies are excluded by it. <em>(Crittenden </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>5 Cowen, 165.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-10\">X. The remedy at law is altogether inadequate and inappropriate ; and the necessity of resorting to this court, quite palpable. It cannot decline jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-11\">XI. The act of incorporation of 1808, has nothing to do with the matter. It was not accepted, nor acted under ; was always disclaimed, and there is a judgment of preclusion against any possible right under it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-12\">XII. The objections relative to the width of the opening of the draw, the depth of water in the draw, and the detention of vessels, are of no avail,</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-13\">(a) They seek to establish a forfeiture of rights once duly vested, and founded upon a valuable consideration; and such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>forfeiture cannot be set up and tried in this collateral way.

F. </em>Butler, for the New York and Harlem Rail Road Company, argued the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-12\">I. The complainants are not the assignees of Lewis Morris, .and if they are such assignees, they have no title to maintain the bill in this cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-13\">(Under this point, reference is made to the points in behalf of Messrs. Morris.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-14\">II. The New York and Harlem Rail Road Company, whether their purchase of the new bridge by the indenture of the 17th August, 1841, was authorized by the act of the legislature or not, do not, by their use of said bridge, violate, infringe or interfere with the franchise granted to Lewis Morris by the act of the 31st of March, 1790 ; and the complainants, admitting them $\u00f3 be the assignees of Lewis Morris, and admitting also that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>franchise granted to him is yet in existence, have no title as against the Rail Road Company, td the relief sought by the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-5\">1. The franchise granted by the act of 1790, was merely that of erecting and maintaining an ordinary bridge, in connection with a common highway, adapted to the passage of vehicles, horses, cattle, and foot passengers, in the manner and according to the usage of that day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">The franchise of-erecting and maintaining a bridge as part of a rail road, was neither granted, contemplated nor foreseen, at the time of the passage of that act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\"><em>2. </em>The bridge of the New York and Harlem Rail Road Company being used by them as a part of their rail road for the passage of their cars, and for that purpose exclusively, is not an interference with the franchise of the complainants. The cars of the company are neither pleasure carriages, wagons, nor carts, within the meaning of the act of 1790 ; nor are the passengers conveyed in such cars, such passengers as are intended by that act. <em>(Lansing </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>8 Cowen, 146; S. <em>C. </em>in Error, 4 Wend. 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-8\">III. The use of said bridge, under and by means of the indenture of 17th August, 1841, is agreeable to and authorized by the act of the 7th May, 1840, empowering the Rail Road Company to construct a bridge across the Harlem River; and even if otherwise, it is not for the complainants to interfere.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-9\">1. This bridge was lawfully erected- by the inhabitants of Morrisania, under ..the act of the 15th May, 1837; which act was fairly within the exception contained in the act of 1790, and therefore constitutional and valid. <em>(Charles River Bridge </em>v. <em>Warren Bridge, </em>11 Peters, 420, 546 to 553, opinion of Taney Ch.

Co., </em>6 Paige, 564.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-10\">2. The bridge being lawfully in existence at the place in question, it was not only competent for the Rail Road Company to contract for its use, as a part of their rail road, but such contract was in furtherance of the interest of the public and the intent of the legislature; because less injurious to the navigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>than the erection of a new bridge.

Morris.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b658-16\">The Assistant Vice-Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"ARz\">All the defendants concur in making various objections to the complainant\u2019s right to maintain this suit, and I will first examine those objections without stopping to inquire which of the defendants has omitted to pave the way for them in his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-17\"><em>First. </em>It is said that John B. Coles reserved the bridge franchise in his conveyance to the trustees, in 1804.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-18\">The fact is clearly otherwise. The franchise reserved, was that of erecting and maintaining a dam, which the supreme court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>held, in the <em>quo warranto </em>case hereafter referred to, was entirely distinct from the erection of a bridge. And the whole object of the grant, was to convey the right to the bridge and the tolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">' <em>Second. </em>In 1808, the legislature passed an act incorporating \u25a0the then owners of the Harlem Bridge, and it is insisted that the corporation alone can file a bill in respect of the franchises in question. The burthen of establishing the acceptance of the charter is upon the defendants, and the proof falls far short of making it out. This is sufficient to dispose of the point, but if the testimony were much stronger to prove the acceptance of the charter, I think that the judgment in the suit of the People, would be decisive in the complainants favor. The People, on the relation of Thomas C. Taylor and others, in 1836 filed an information, alleging amongst other things, that these complainants were exercising the franchise of being a body politic and corporate by the name of the Harlem Bridge Company, having usurped the same, and calling on them to show by what warrant they claimed to use and exercise such franchise. In their plea to the information, the now complainants alleged that they never used the franchise of a corporation. Upon this, the Attorney General, in behalf of the people took judgment of preclusion. These proceedings, while they preclude the complainants and the state from setting up that the former are a body corporate, ought certainly to prevent strangers from insisting the contrary, in a case where the question arises collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"><em>Third. </em>The next objection led to the taking of considerable testimony. It is, that the complainants, and those preceding them in the ownership of the bridge, never complied with the conditions and requirements which formed the consideration of the several acts of the legislature ; and that, if there were a sufficient compliance originally, they have forfeited their right to maintain their franchise, by neglecting for a long time to keep up the bridge and its appurtenances, pursuant to the terms of those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The supreme court decided, in the <em>quo warranto </em>case before mentioned, that the act of 1795 modified the provisions of the act of 1790, in respect of the width of the Harlem Bridge, and that the privilege of erecting a dam, was an additional grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>which John B. Coles might either exercise or omit, without affecting his right to build the bridge. The court therefore held, that Coles had complied with the conditions of the grant contained in the acts authorizing the bridge, by the erection of one only twenty-four feet wide, although it did not rest on a stone dam, or foundation. It appears that the opening for vessels and the draw over the same, were originally made of the size prescribed by the act of 1790, and that John B. Coles executed a bond, in conformity to the sixth section of the act of 1795.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">I have no doubt, therefore, that the conditions annexed to the franchise in the acts granting the same, were substantially performed by Coles and his associates, and that they became duly invested with the rights and privileges conferred by those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Before investigating the grounds upon which it is alleged that the owners of the bridge have forfeited their franchise, l am met with a preliminary inquiry. Can these defendants be permitted to set up such forfeiture in answer to this suit <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Admitting for the sake of the argument, that the bridge as now maintained, is a public nuisance on account of its obstruction of the navigation, it is of no avail to the defendants, unless they can show that they are specially injured thereby. Now, it is not pretended that the closing of the opening and draw entirely, would affect the defendants at all. As a nuisance therefore, they are not in a position to complain of the bridge in a civil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The ground taken by the defendants here, is not analogous to setting up, by way of defence to an action for tolls, by a turnpike or bridge company, that the turnpike or bridge is out of repair. Such a defence, while it shows that the company is not entitled to recover the tolls, does not interfere with the company\u2019s title to its franchise; and in a suit for tolls subsequently due, a judgment against the company in a former suit, would not' prevent a recovery. The defendant would be compelled to prove a defence, as if no former suit had existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">It cannot be shown in defence to the suit of a corporation, that the plaintiff\u2019s have forfeited their corporate rights by misuser or by non-user.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Advantage can be taken of such forfeiture, only on process on behalf of the state, instituted directly against the corporation, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the purpose of avoiding the charter or act of incorporation; and individuals cannot avail themselves of it in collateral suits, until it be judicially declared. (Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, 507; 2d Ed., and the numerous cases there cited. <em>Trustees of Vernon Society </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>6 Cowen, 23; <em>Bank of Niagara </em>v. Johnson, 8 Wend. 645.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The grants to Lewis Morris and John B. Coles by the legislature, were as much a franchise as is the power to act as a body corporate; and must be forfeited judicially, before individuals can avail themselves of any misuser or omission to keep up their bridge in the manner prescribed by law. As to the nature of the grant, if any reference be necessary, see 3 Kent\u2019s Comm. 458, and <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>The </em>People, (23 Wend. 579, 580, 596, per Verplanck, Senator.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">It is therefore foreign to this case, to examine the alleged omissions of the complainants to keep up their bridge, and the opening and draw in the same, in the manner required by the acts authorizing its erection.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>It is insisted by some of the defendants, that the complainants, if they have any remedy, are restricted to the action of debt given by the second section of the act of 1790, against the owners of any bridge or vessel interfering with the enjoyment of their franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">One answer to this is, that the owners of the obnoxious bridge being a body corporate, no suit could be maintained against them in a justice\u2019s court at the time this cause was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The case of <em>Livingston and Fulton </em>v. <em>Van Ingen and others, </em>(9 Johns. 507, 562, 569, &amp;c. 585, &amp;c.) decides that the parties in possession of an exclusive right or privilege granted by a statute, are entitled to an injunction to restrain others from infringing that right, although the statute imposed various forfeitures on persons so offending.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">This principle is sufficient to sustain the bill in its chief object, if the right claimed by it be found to exist in the complainants ; and as it may prove unnecessary to pursue the inquiry in respect of the claim made for an account, I will waive it for the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The other reasons assigned for the objection of want of equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ill the bill, will be examined hereafter, if there remain any necessity for looking into them, after disposing of the more important points in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Next, as to the right^of Lewis Morris, Gouverneur Morris and others, to erect the bridge which is the subject of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">This is abundantly established by the grant in the Morrisania patents of 1676 and 1697, the express reservation in the act of 1790, authorizing the bridge of the complainants, and the statute passed May 15, 1837, enacting that the inhabitants of Morrisania might build a free bridge for their private use across the Harlem River, between Harlem and Morrisania.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Indeed, this right is not seriously disputed by the complainants, although they contend that the expensive bridge which was erected by the Morris\u2019s, was really intended for the use to which it has been subsequently appropriated. As to this, without noticing its materiality, it suffices to say that whatever those gentlemen might have <em>hoped, </em>they could not have relied upon transferring it to the Harlem Rail Road Company, for that corporation was not then empowered to cross the Harlem River.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">I have now come to the grave and very important question, presented by the pleadings, viz., the right of the Harlem Rail Road Company, to purchase the bridge built by the Messrs. Morris\u2019s and to use it for the purposes of their railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The charter of this company, passed in 1831, authorized it to construct a rail road from Twenty-third street in the city of New York to the Harlem River, at any point between the Third and Eighth Avenues. (Laws of 1831, Ch. 263, p. 323.) The rail road was laid out upon the line of the Fourth Avenue, and prior to 1840, was finished and in active operation from the City Hall to the termination of the Fourth Avenue, at the southerly side of the Harlem River, directly at the point where the Morrisania bridge crossed the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">In 1832, the New York and Albany Rail Road Company was incorporated, authorizing a railway from the city of New York (commencing where the Fourth Avenue terminates at the Harlem River,) to the city of Albany. (Laws of 1832, Ch. 162, p. 258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">In 1836, this charter was amended, and the company empow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ered to extend their rail road into the city o\u00ed New York ; but nothing in the act was to be so construed as to infringe such rights and privileges as the Harlem Bridge Company possessed by virtue of any statute. The act authorized the company to construct their road across any streams which it might intersect, except the Hudson River. (Laws of 1836, Ch. 268, p. 373.) The same power was conferred by the original act of incorpora-* tion in 1832.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">On the 7th of May, 1840, an act was passed, which authorized the Harlem Rail Road Company to construct a rail road through the county of Westchester, commencing at the Harlem River, and extending northwardly to meet the New York and Albany Rail Road Company, with a branch to the line of the state of Connecticut. The act authorized the Harlem Rail Road Company to construct a bridge across Harlem River, in order to connect their road as then built, with the extension permitted by that act. The second section provided that the company should possess all the powers, and be subject to all the restrictions, that are contained in the several acts authorizing the construction of The New York and Albany Rail Road Company, and prohibited them from using any part of the road of the Westchester Turnpike Company, except upon making compensation. (Laws of 1840, Ch. 242, p. 190.) Aside from the principal question involved, it is contended that inasmuch as the inhabitants of Morrisania could build a bridge for no other purpose than for their exclusive private use, they could not erect one for sale: No purchaser could acquire a right to appropriate the bridge when built, to any other use than that of those inhabitants : Therefore the Harlem Rail Road Company have acquired no title to the bridge by their purchase from the Morris\u2019s, and have no right to use it or to suffer it to be used, for any purpose except the private use of the inhabitants of Morrisania.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">This argument might be indisputable if it were applied to an ordinary purchaser, or to a corporation having no authority to carry a rail road over the Harlem River. But these defendants were expressly authorized to cross the river with their railway in order to connect it as then built, with the Westchester extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>They were also empowered to purchase any lands or real estate, which were necessary for the construction of their road, and if the owners were unwilling to sell, the company could take such lands, on making compensation in the mode pointed out fey the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The bridge of the Morris\u2019s stood at the very spot where the defendants were required by the act of 1840, to cross the river to continue their rail road. Its materials and superstructure were the private property of the Morris\u2019s, although subject to the private use of the other inhabitants of Morrisania. The company had an undoubted right to take the bridge, whether the Morris\u2019s were willing or not, on making to them compensation for its value, and making a suitable provision for the use of it by them and the other inhabitants entitled to its benefit. Under these circumstances, it appears to me that nothing can be plainer than that the company had a perfect right to buy the bridge for' the use of their rail road.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">So far as the navigation of the river was concerned, it was far better for the public interest that there should be but one bridge, for the use of both the rail road and the inhabitants of Morrisania; and in respect of the complainants, it was no worse for them, but rather the contrary, because the use of the bridge by the railroad, would unavoidably interfere with its free and unrestricted use by the ordinary travel of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The complainants insist further, that the act of 1840, authorizing the Harlem Rail Road Company to build a bridge across the river, is a violation of the franchise vested in them, and as against them, is entirely nugatory. They do not deny the power of the legislature to authorize the company to build such a bridge, but they contend that the legislature itself could authorize it, only upon making proper compensation to them for the consequent injury to their franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">These positions were very ably and earnestly argued by the learned counsel for the complainants; but in the present state of the law on the subject, as established in this court, it would be quite superfluous for me to enter into an elaborate discussion of the momentous principles involved in its consideration, or to examine critically the force, extent and authority of the leading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>case relied on by the defendants. <em>(Charles River Bridge </em>v. <em>Warren </em>Bridge, 11 Peters, 420.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In <em>The Mohawk Bridge Company </em>v. <em>The Utica and Schenectady Rail Road </em>Company, (6 Paige, 554,) the complainant\u2019s charter prohibited others from establishing a ferry within one mile from their toll bridge. The defendants were authorized to construct a railway from Schenectady to Utica, which gave them the right to build a bridge across the Mohawk River for the passage of their engines and cars, and they commenced building it about a hundred rods distant from the plaintiff\u2019s bridge. The latter thereupon applied for an injunction, alleging amongst other grounds, that the rail road would divert the travel from their toll bridge, and thus interfere injuriously with the exclusive privilege secured to them by their charter. The chancellor declared his opinion, that the charter of the Mohawk Bridge Company did not deprive a future legislature of the right to authorize the erection of another bridge within the prescribed limits, whenever the public good should appear to require it; much less was the legislature deprived of the power to provide for the conveyance of freight or passengers from one part of the state to another, by an improvement which was entirely unknown at the time when the grant to the bridge company was made. And if that grant had in terms, given to the corporation the exclusive right of erecting a toll bridge across the river at Schenectady, this subsequent grant to the rail road company to cross the river with their railway from Schenectady to Utica, and to transport passengers thereon in the course of their business in the conveyance of travellers from one place to another, would not have been an infringement of the privileges conferred by such prior grant; as the rail road bridge would not be a toll bridge, within the intent and meaning of the grant to the first company. The motion for the injunction was denied on another ground, but it is evident that the chancellor would have denied it for the reasons just stated, if no other had existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">More recently, in the case of <em>The Oswego Falls Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Fish and others, </em>decided May 25th, 1846,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the bill was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to restrain the defendants from erecting a free bridge across the Oswego River, between the falls and the north line of the village of Fulton, which they were authorized to do as commissioners, by an act of the legislature passed in 1838. (Laws of 1838, Chapt. 254, p. 240.)- The complainants toll bridge across the Oswego River, terminated about the centre of the village of Fulton, and the defendants had laid out the free bridge so that it would terminate within the village, near to the toll bridge. The act authorized the commissioners to purchase and repair the Oswego Falls bridge, instead of building a new bridge, if in their opinion, the public interest would be best promoted thereby. The charter of the Oswego Falls Bridge Company, (Laws of 1824, ch. 293, p. 351.) authorized them to erect a bridge over the Oswego River, and to receive tolls in the usual manner. Vice Chancellor Gridley of the fifth circuit, dismissed the bill. The complainants appealed, and the chancellor affirmed the decree. In his decision, he says, <em>\u201c </em>The only question, therefore, is whether the legislature had the right to authorize the erection of a free bridge across the Oswego River, so near to the bridge which the complainants had erected under their charter, as- to diminish their tolls and materially impair the profits of the company. I had occasion to consider the power of the legislature in this respect, incidentally, in the case of <em>The Mohawk Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>The Utica and Schenectady R. R. Co., </em>(6 Paige\u2019s Rep. 554,) and I then came to the conclusion that the grant to a corporation to erect a toll bridge across a river, without any restriction of the power of the legislature to grant a similar privilege to others, would not deprive a future legislature of the power to authorize the erection of another bridge, which would divert a portion, of the travel from the bridge which had been previously erected. Since that decision, we have been furnished with the reported case of the <em>Charles River Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>The Proprietors of the Warren Bridge, </em>(11 Peter\u2019s R. 420,) decided by the supreme court of the United States, a few months before. That case cannot be distinguished in principle from the present; and as the question was fully considered there, in the very able opinion of Chief Justice Taney, who delivered the judgment of the court, it would be useless to go over the same ground.\u201d The same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>point apparently, was decided by the Chancellor, in the case of <em>Meads, Receiver &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>April 2, 1844, (4th Barbour\u2019s Notes of Chancellor\u2019s Decisions, p. 14,) where the exclusive right was set up in respect of a ferry.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The second section of the act of 1790 for building the Harlem bridge, provides,\u00bfthat it shall not be lawful for any person or persons whatsoever, to erect any other bridge over or across the Harlem River to Morrisania, or to keep any vessel to ferry any person across the river from Morrisania to Harlem, except for the private use of the inhabitants of those townships. And the complainants insist, (to repeat their point,) that this is a grant and covenant on the part of the legislature, that it will not permit any person except those inhabitants, to erect any bridge or ferry, and those could erect one for their private use only. That the grant was by its terms exclusive, and if it were not so expressed, the grant of tolls necessarily excluded all competition which would diminish the tolls; and it was not in the power of the legislature, afterwards to make a grant which would impair the full enjoyment of the franchise conferred on the bridge, and any such grant would be void under the constitution of the United States, as impairing the obligation of the contract made by the state with the Harlem Bridge Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">As to these positions of the complainants, the <em>Charles River Bridge </em>case, with that of the <em>Stourbridge Canal Company </em>v. <em>Whaley, </em>(2 Barn. &amp; Ad. 792,) is decisive against any implication of an exclusive right, when the charter is silent on the subject ; and the decisions of the chancellor to which I have referred, appear to me to be equally conclusive against any restriction of the power of the legislature to charter a new toll bridge, or to authorize a free bridge, in competition with that allowed across the Harlem River by the act of 1790. Other cases to the same effect, will be noticed hereafter. The act of 1790 does not declare that the legislature will not permit another bridge to be erected. Indeed, the declaration inserted in the second section, \u2022was evidently aimed at the rights which it was supposed the inhabitants of Morrisania and Harlem might claim under their old patents, rather than against any interference by others with the franchise granted to the bridge company. As to all persons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>other than the inhabitants of Morrisania and Harlem, such a provision was wholly unnecessary, because no one could set up a toll bridge or ferry, without authority from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The case of <em>The Newburgh Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>(5 J. C. R. 101,) cited by the complainants, does not conflict with these views. There, individuals without the sanction of law, laid out a road and built a bridge, the manifest effect of which was to enable travellers to evade the complainants bridge and toll gate; and the chancellor restrained them by injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">It was argued on the part of the defendants, that the rail road bridge, used merely for its appropriate purpose of passing their locomotive engines and trains of cars across the Harlem River, on their way from the city of New York to their various stopping places in Westchester county; does not violate, infringe, or _ interfere with, the franchise granted to the Harlem Bridge Company by the act of 1790. There is undoubtedly much force in this argument. The rail road bridge, <em>as such, </em>is incapable of being used for the passage of any vehicle, animal, or foot passenger, for whose passage the complainants are entitled to receive toll. The fact that the rail road bridge, <em>as built for the private use of the inhabitants of Morrisania, </em>may be crossed by such vehicles, &amp;c., does not affect the consideration of this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">On the other hand, the complainants bridge has not the capacity to pass over the Harlem River, any of the Rail Road Company's -.engines, or their trains or cars drawn by such engines. And if the .complainants were to lay down a suitable railway track, and strengthen their bridge so that the engines and trains ,of the defendants might cross it, there is nothing in their charter which would warrant them in exacting toll from the defendants, <em>(Stourbridge Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Whaley, </em>above cited.) This demonstrates that the franchise granted to the defendants, is not the same as .that vested in the complainants; nor is there such a similarity between them as renders the one an interference with the other, in .the .sense in which a new bridge or a ferry interferes with a prior one established at ,the same point.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The influence of the rail road on .the complainants profits from \u00a3heir bridge, is more analogous to that which has been effected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>in respect of many branches of business, bv the astonishing ini- i provements of the last thirty years. The Erie canal broke up and destroyed the long lines of heavy teams which formerly monopolized the transportation west of Albany ; and diminished more than one-half, the profits of the turnpike companies between Albany and Canandaigua. The line of rail roads which succeeded, drove from the road the throng of <em>stage </em>coaches, which were profitably employed in the conveyance of passengers to and from the great west. Yet neither the army of teamsters thrown out of business, nor the turnpike corporations, ever claimed compensation from the state in respect of the Erie canal; nor did the stage owners claim redress against the rail road companies, which destroyed their business, and diminished one-half, the value of their capital. If it be answered, that most of these were mere individuals, or the enterprises of men associated together, and not basking in the sunshine of legislative privilege ; I reply, that the turnpike companies were corporations, and that the others invested capital in a business, <em>quasi </em>public, and acquired a -valuable good will in their pursuits, with as much claim on the favor and protection of the state, as the builders of the Harlem bridge; with this difference only, that the latter had no right to set up their bridge without the permission of the state, wh le the pursuits of the former were open to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">If then the progressive spirit of the age, have developed and matured a mode of conveying passengers and freights, from place to place, across rivers and over morasses, which was unknown in 1790; can there be any doubt that the legislature, in the exercise of its sovereign duty to provide ways for the use of the people, may authorize the construction and use of such new invention, although the necessary consequence may be, that the prior modes of conveyance will be superseded, and those who were profitably engaged in their pursuit, will be subjected to the loss of their business and capital <em>1 </em>I think the right and the duty of the legislature in such a case, is too clear to be questioned ; and that those who were enjoying franchises previously conferred, which are thereby rendered worthless, stand in no worse position and are no more entitled to sympathy or compensation, than the numerous classes of mechanics and other individuals,1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>who are daily subjected to great losses and sacrifices, by new I inventions and improvements, superseding and destroying those in profitable use.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">An analogous case in our own courts is that of <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Smith and </em>others, (8 Cowen, 146, affirmed in 4 Wend. 9,) where the wharves of the owners of lots in the city of Albany, were rendered almost valueless, by the erection of the Albany pier, under an act of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Previous to the decision of the Charles River Bridge case, the supreme court of New Hampshire held that the grant of a ferry, did not prevent the legislature from granting to another person, the exclusive right of erecting a toll bridge within certain limits, which included the place where the ferry was situated. And the court expressed their opinion, that were there no terms of exclusion in the grant of the bridge, another bridge might be authorized within the same limits. There being an exclusive grant of the bridge in that case, the court decided that the legislature could not authorize the erection of another bridge, without provision for the compensation of the first grantee. <em>(Piscataqua Bridge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>Bridge, 7 N. H. Rep. 35, 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">And the supreme court of Alabama had held in 1835, that the grant of a ferry, where it was not exclusive, did not prevent the legislature from chartering a toll bridge near the ferry, without making any provision for compensation to the owner of the ferry. <em>(Dyer </em>v. <em>Tuscaloosa Bridge </em>Company, 2 Porter\u2019s R. 296.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Subsequent to the case of Charles River Bridge, the court of appeals in Virginia, unanimously held that a monopoly cannot be implied, from the grant to construct a work of public improvement and to take the profits; to give such monopoly, there must be an express provision in the act or charter, whereby the legislature restrains itself from granting charters for rival and competing works. And the court applied the doctrine in a suit by a canal company, against a company subsequently chartered to construct a rail road along the same valley. <em>(Tuckahoe Canal Company </em>v. <em>Tuckahoe Rail Road </em>Company, 11 Leigh\u2019s R. 42, 69, 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Such being the established law on the subject, I must, on both grounds, decide against granting to the complainants any relief founded upon the assumption that the Harlem Rail Road Company have no right to maintain the bridge in question across the Harlem River, for the use of their rail road.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">There remains another, though very inferior ground of relief set up in the bill, which is reposed on the alleged misuser of the bridge by the defendants, by permitting, or by their negligence suffering, persons who had no right, to pass over the bridge, and thereby evade the payment of the tolls to which the complainants were entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">. I do not think that there can be any account, in connection with this injury alone. There is no pretence that the defendants have received any \u00a1money from persons who have evaded the toll bridge. They have no right to receive compensation for crossing the rail road bridge, and they have not claimed any such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The injury to the complainants, is one in the nature of damages. The remedy provided by the second section of the act of 1790, gives a penalty which a court of equity will not enforce; and they can have no redress here, except as incidental to some other relief which this court has jurisdiction to grant. Still if it shall appear that they are entitled to an injunction on this branch of their case, it will then be proper to direct an account of what they might have received in tolls, but for the acts or omissions of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">As to the remedy by injunction, 1 am satisfied that the unauthorized use of the rail road bridge alleged in the bill, constitutes such a nuisance to the complainants in the enjoyment of their franchise, that they are entitled to an injunction to restrain it in future.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The rightful use of the bridge, is restricted by law to the purposes of the rail road, and the private use of the inhabitants of Morrisania. The act of 1837 permitting its erection, provided that it should be used in conformity with the right reserved to those inhabitants in the act of 1790, granting the complainants bridge, <em>and not otherwise. </em>Thus there was attached to the private bridge, the reasonable condition, that those erecting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>maintaining it should so keep and, use it, that it should not interfere with the rights and privileges vested in the owners of the toll bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">If it be made to appear that the owners of the Morrisania bridge, have failed so to keep and preserve the same from being used by persons not authorized to use it; the difficulties in the way of ascertaining and proving every case, or even a considerable portion of the instances, of such improper use of the bridge and the great facility for evading the complainants bridge, and the excessive injury to their franchise which such carelessness of the owners of the other bridge may occasion ; furnish abundant grounds for this court to restrain the owners by injunction. The complainants right being undisputed, the case falls within the ordinary jurisdiction of the court against nuisances.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">I have looked into the testimony relating to the use of the rail road bridge by persons not authorized, and am satisfied that the rail road company have not exercised that diligence to prevent such persons crossing their bridge, which they were bound to do in reference to the complainants franchise. By their purchase of a bridge already built, adapted to the ordinary travel of the country, they became liable to this duty, which before was incumbent on those who erected it. If they had built a bridge for the use of their rail road only, it would have had no floor or proper conveniences for ordinary travel, and they would not have been subjected to this burthen.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">There is nothing in the case however, to implicate the Morris\u2019s in this disregard of the complainants rights. Their erection of the bridge, and their sale of it was lawful; and in the conveyance to the rail road company, they stipulated for no other or further use of the bridge for ordinary travel, than they were entitled to while they owned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">And the testimony does not prove that during the time they owned and controlled the bridge, there was any use made of it to the complainants detriment, or that they were negligent in preventing unauthorized persons from travelling over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The complainants having failed to establish any ground of relief against the Messrs, Morris\u2019s, the bill as to them must be dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>As to the Harlem Rail Road Company, the complainants appear to be entitled to an injunction, restraining the company during the residue of the term of the complainants franchise, from permitting or suffering the bridge in question to be used for the passage of any vehicles, foot passengers or animals, for the passage of which over their bridge the complainants are authorized to demand toll; or for any purpose, save the use of the company\u2019s rail road, and the private use of the inhabitants of Morrisania.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The details of the injunction will be adjusted on settling the decree; and the complainants may have liberty to apply on the foot of the decree, for future relief in case the injunction be violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">I will also dispose of the question of costs between these parties, to this time, by directing that neither party shall recover costs against the other. The complainants have shown a case for relief, though they have failed in the principal object of their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">They are entitled also to a reference, to ascertain what tolls they have lost since the rail road bridge was conveyed to the company, in consequence of the neglect or omission of the company to prevent its use by persons who were not authorized to make use of it without paying toll to the complainants. But I doubt whether this right to a reference, will pay the expense of its prosecution ; and I will direct that if the complainants take a reference and fail to make out a demand exceeding $100, they shall pay the rail road company\u2019s costs of the reference and proceedings thereon. If they make out more than $100, the company will be decreed to pay the amount to them, with the costs, subsequent to the entry of the decree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> Now reported in 1 Barb.
