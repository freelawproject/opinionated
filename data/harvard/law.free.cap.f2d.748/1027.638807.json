He urges, first, that no substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s finding that his breathing impairment \u2014 chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, chronic bronchitis, and episodic asthma \u2014 is not \u201csevere.\u201d (The non-severity finding by itself disqualified Martin from receiving disability benefits.) Martin also urges that the evidence before the Secretary required her to find that his impairment fits a <em>per se </em>disability category. We agree with Martin and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-15\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-16\">Martin is now fifty-five years of age and practically illiterate. From 1958 until the mid-1960\u2019s, he worked as a deckhand on tugboats in the New Orleans area. He then became a tugboat pilot and worked at that job until January 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-17\">In February 1980, Martin reported to a United States Public Health Service Hospital complaining of shortness of breath. Shortly thereafter, Public Health Service physicians recommended Martin \u201cpermanently not fit for duty.\u201d As a result, the United States Coast Guard required Martin to surrender his pilot\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-18\">Martin applied for disability benefits on March 13, 1981. A disability examiner determined that Martin had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which caused \u201cbreathing complaints and occasional attacks.\u201d He nevertheless determined that Martin was not disabled because his condition was not \u201csevere for purposes of this program.\u201d Upon a requested reconsideration, another disability examiner affirmed the.finding of non-severity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-19\">On November 5, 1981, Martin received a hearing before an administrative law judge. ' The administrative law judge accepted into evidence medical records establishing Martin\u2019s extensive history of medical treatment between February 1980 and the date of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-20\">There were at least nine instances of outpatient treatment at the United States Public Health Service Hospital (USPHSH). (February 21, 1980; April 2, 1980; May 30, 1980; July 16, 1980; March 4, 1981; May 28, 1981; June 18, 1981; July 1, 1981, and July 6, 1981.) The records of the treatments confirm diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and chronic bronchitis. They show that Martin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>\u201cwheezes,\u201d \u201cgets short of breath with minimal exertion,\u201d and has \u201cscattered rhonchi,\u201d a \u201chistory of several attacks of bronchial asthma,\u201d \u201cexpiratory wheezes,\u201d and a continuing need to take seven or more medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">The records also established four instances of emergency room treatment. (October 30, 1980; October 31, 1980; December 12, 1980; and unknown date). On one of these occasions, Martin was taken to the emergency room by ambulance. The records of these emergency room visits describe Martin as short of breath, wheezing, coughing \u201cgreenish-yellow sputum,\u201d and having \u201cdiffuse rhonchi.\u201d In the emergency room, Martin was treated with intravenous injections and inhalation therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">The records further established five instances of hospitalization, for twenty-three, three, fourteen, six, and six days respectively. (March 3,1980; June 3,1980; October 31, 1980; December 16, 1980; and June 5, 1981.) On certain hospitalizations, Martin was treated by intravenous injection for multiple attacks. On two occasions during hospitalization, Martin\u2019s attacks became so severe he was placed in an intensive care unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">The hospitalization records show that Martin complained \u201cof shortness of breath over the previous 5 to 6 weeks with progression to the point he could not take care of himself.\u201d One report describes Martin as \u201cin obvious respiratory distress lying on a stretcher having audible wheezing.\u201d Martin produced \u201cdark green and thick\u201d sputum. Physicians prescribed aminophyl-line, prednisone, catapres, hydrochlorothia-zide, potassium chloride, ampicillin, vanceril inhaler, steroids, and other medication. They variously diagnosed Martin as suffering from chronic bronchitis, chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma (acute bronchospastic episode), and bronchospastic episodes. One record shows Martin\u2019s prognosis as \u201cpoor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">Finally, there were records of clinical testing. Hospital tests, administered <em>after </em>his recovery from attacks, show approximately normal lung function. Martin also underwent breath capacity testing by non-treating physicians on April 21, 1980, August 19, 1980, and July 16, 1981. The first testing showed breathing capacity as low as 51% of expected capacity, \u201cfindings compatible with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\u201d The second testing showed breathing capacity as high as 78% of expected capacity, \u201cconsistent with obstructive ventilitory impairment.\u201d The third testing showed breathing capacity as high as 85% of expected capacity; the report of this test diagnosed Martin as having a history of bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but noted the test results were \u201ccompatible with normal spiro-metry.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">In his testimony before the administrative law judge, Martin stated: \u201cI just stay around the house and sit around and watch a little television and when an attack comes on me I have to lay flat down on the bed.\u201d Martin testified that he cannot carry a bag of groceries or help his wife with house work, and that smoke, perfume, deodorant, and automobile exhaust aggravate his condition. Martin testified that, during an attack, he cannot get out of bed to walk across the room or go to the bathroom and that he had these attacks two or three times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">The administrative law judge accepted the affidavit of Martin\u2019s wife, which stated: \u201cPeriodically my husband can\u2019t breathe and he must lay flat in bed. My husband is unable to exercise, to mop, cut grass, vacuum, sweep, or do anything with any physical activity at all. A lot of times he cannot even walk from one room to another.\u201d The administrative law judge also accepted a proffer that Martin\u2019s neighbor would, if he testified, corroborate Martin and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">The administrative law judge found that Martin had a \u201chistory of bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\u201d Based solely on the results of tests measuring Martin\u2019s breathing capacity, however, the administrative law judge found that these impairments were not \u201csevere.\u201d The Appeals Council adopted the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, stating only that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>was substantial evidence that Martin\u2019s impairment was not \u201csevere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">In the action Martin filed below, a magistrate concluded that Martin had the capacity to do sedentary work, had engaged in skilled or semi-skilled employment, and possessed so-called \u201ctransferable\u201d skills. Applying vocational guidelines used by the Secretary, the magistrate concluded there was substantial evidence to support a finding of no disability. The district court adopted the decision of the magistrate and entered final judgment against Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">I. <em>Statutory and Regulatory Scheme and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">As part of the Social Security Act, Congress provided for the payment of disability insurance benefits to insured workers who become disabled. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. Disability is defined, in all cases other than blindness, to mean the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Further, \u201can individual ... shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, <em>considering his age, education, and work experience, </em>engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">Pursuant to these statutory provisions, the Secretary has promulgated regulations that establish a five-step disability-determining process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1984). First, a claimant who at the time of his disability claim is engaged in substantial gainful employment is not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b) (1984). Second, the claimant is automatically denied benefits if the asserted impairment is not severe, without consideration of his residual functional capacity, age, education or work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) (1984). Third, if the asserted impairment is severe, the claimant is <em>per se </em>disabled if his impairment meets or equals an impairment described in 20 C.F.R., Subpart P, Appendix 1 (1984). 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d) (1984). Fourth, a claimant with a severe impairment that is not <em>per se </em>disabling is denied benefits if he is capable of doing past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e) (1984). Fifth, a claimant who cannot return to past relevant work is denied benefits if he can engage in work available in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">The Secretary eliminated Martin at step 2. The district court eliminated Martin at step 5. Martin claims that step 3\u2019s <em>per se </em>disability provisions should have been applied. In considering these respective contentions, we are guided by the substantial evidence standard of review. <em>Taylor v. Heckler, </em>742 F.2d 253, 256 (5th Cir.1984). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-12\">This standard of review is not a rubber stamp for the Secretary\u2019s decision and involves more than a search for evidence supporting the Secretary\u2019s findings. We must scrutinize the record and take into account whatever fairly detracts from the substantiality of evidence supporting the Secretary\u2019s findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\"><em>Tome v. Schweiker, </em>724 F.2d 711, 713 (8th Cir.1984). <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">For reasons to be explained more fully in II, <em>infra, </em>we hold that the Secretary was in error in eliminating Martin at step 2, because the impairment was more than a slight abnormality with minimal effect on his ability to work, the test for elimination at step 2. We likewise find that the district court erred in eliminating Martin on a step 5 analysis, not only because it was inappropriate on judicial review for the first time to apply administrative criteria not themselves considered by the Secretary, but also because the district court's application of step 5 standards was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>II. <em>Severity of Impairment</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJ2R\">An impairment \u201cis not severe if it does not significantly limit [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental abilities to do basic work activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(a) (1984). These include numerous activities; examples relevant here are \u201cwalking, standing, sitting, lifting, pushing, pulling, reaching, carrying, or handling.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1521(b)(1) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">The \u201csignificantly limit\u201d language of the regulation must be understood in light of its history. A predecessor regulation prevented a disability finding if there was only a \u201cslight abnormality.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1502(a) (1968). This \u201cslight abnormality\u201d regulation was replaced by a \u201csevere impairment\u201d regulation in 1978 which, however, did not change in essential meaning the predecessor regulatory standard. <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 919 (11th Cir.1984). The Second Circuit has noted that the \u201csevere impairment\u201d recodification equates with the predecessor \u201cslight impairment\u201d standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-5\">The Secretary\u2019s preamble in the Federal Register reveals that the \u201cseverity\u201d regulation, as originally promulgated in 1978, was meant to clarify the 1968 regulation\u2019s terms \u201ca slight neurosis, slight impairment of sight or hearing, or other slight abnormality or combination of slight abnormality\u201d but was not intended to \u201calter the levels of severity for a finding of ... [\u2018]not disabledf\u2019] on the basis of medical considerations alone,\u201d 43 F.R. 55358. The recodification in 1980 evinces no change in this expression of the Secretary\u2019s intent, 45 F.R. 55574.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao0\"><em>Chico v. Schweiker, </em>710 F.2d 947, 954 n. 10 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">Further, the Eleventh Circuit has noted that, in a document titled <em>Appeals Council Review of Sequential Evaluation Under Expanded Vocational Regulations </em>(1980), the Appeals Council stated that \u201can impairment can be considered as \u2018not severe\u2019 only if it is a slight abnormality which has such a minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education or work experience.\u201d <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 920 (11th Cir.1984). In <em>Brady, </em>the Eleventh Circuit adopted the Appeals Council\u2019s definition of severe, adding that the severity requirement means only that the alleged impairment must cause a limitation on basic work activity that is not \u201cmeaningless.\u201d <em>Brady, supra, </em>at 920. <em>See Taylor v. Schweiker, </em>739 F.2d 1240, 1243 n. 2 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Evans v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 1012, 1014 n. 3 (4th .Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">We recently adopted this construction of the Secretary\u2019s regulation as stated in <em>Chico </em>and <em>Brady, supra. Estran v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d. 340 (5th Cir.1984). In <em>Estran, </em>however, we remanded because the Secretary may have found no severe impairment without reference to the slight abnormality definition of non-severity. Nevertheless, we specifically adopted the view that the severity requirement was equivalent to the previous slight abnormality requirement. We referred approvingly to the holding of the Eleventh Circuit that \u201can impairment can be considered as not severe only if it is a slight abnormality which has such minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education or work experience.\u201d <em>Estran, supra, </em>745 F.2d 340 at 341 (quoting Brady).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">We find that the <em>Estran-Brady-Chico </em>formulation of the step 2 non-severity elimination test is correct and accords with the Secretary\u2019s understanding of her own regulations. Moreover, it accords with the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d), quoted at I, <em>supra, </em>which does not state an absolute severity requirement. Finally, it is consistent with the apparent meaning of \u201csignificantly limit ... basic work activities\u201d as stated in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">Repeatedly diagnosed asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic bronchitis are obviously not slight, insignificant, or meaningless impairments. The Secretary herself lists them as possible <em>per se </em>disabling impairments. 20 C.F.R., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Chapter III, Subpart P, Appendix 1, \u00a7 3.00 (1984). Moreover, the diagnoses of these serious ailments in this case were accompanied by overwhelming evidence of repeated hospitalization and emergency room, outpatient, and intensive care treatment and by uncontradicted evidence that Martin suffers attacks two or three times a week, often rendering him unable to stand or walk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The Secretary could have reached a different result only by ignoring this evidence. It appears that is what happened. The administrative law judge\u2019s decision found that Martin\u2019s impairments are not severe because they \u201care very mild and not in any way physically restricting.\u201d He based that finding on (1) Martin\u2019s testimony \u201cas to his daily activities\u201d and (2) \u201c[t]he minimal clinical findings.\u201d Martin, however, testified that he cannot even carry a bag of groceries and is, for the most part, house-ridden. And it is inconceivable that clinical findings are \u201cminimal\u201d when they show severe shortness of breath, wheezing and vomiting, and symptoms so severe that Martin daily took as many as seven or more medicines and required intensive care treatment on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">At bottom, it appears that the Secretary reached her decision by focusing only on the results of testing of Martin\u2019s breathing capacity. This was an impermissibly restrictive view of the evidence. The results of those tests do not show Martin\u2019s functioning capability and do not erase the reality that Martin required repeated hospitalization, emergency room and intensive care treatment and is practically house-ridden, suffering two or three incapacitating attacks per week. Martin\u2019s physicians, confronted with most of these test results, found him permanently unfit for duty, hospitalized him, prescribed extensive medication, and without exception diagnosed him as suffering from asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">The issue here did not require the evaluation of conflicting medical evidence, for the outpatient, emergency room and hospital medical reports uniformly establish the nature of Martin\u2019s impairment and its debilitating effect. The breathing tests show only that Martin enjoyed a range of breathing capacity in a fume-free environment when not suffering an attack. The tests do not purport to cast doubt on Martin\u2019s history of attacks. Nor do they measure his ability to sit, stand, walk, exert himself or tolerate the air in a particular work place. Moreover, the test results confirm Martin\u2019s past diagnoses. Simply put, the Secretary misused the results of the breathing tests and improperly ignored all other evidence of record. <em>See Fruge v. Harris, </em>631 F.2d 1244, 1246 (5th Cir.1980) (absent good cause, \u201csubstantial weight\u201d must be accorded opinion of treating physicians).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">Finally, we note that this case is quite similar to a recent Fourth Circuit decision. <em>Evans v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 1012, 1014-15 (4th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Evans, </em>the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>chief complaint was asthma with bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <em>Id., </em>734 F.2d at 1013. Much like Martin, the claimant testified that his breathing problem forced him to spend substantial time lying down at home. <em>Id. </em>Also like Martin, the claimant in <em>Evans </em>was hospitalized repeatedly. <em>Id., </em>734 F.2d at 1014. As the USPHSH has declared Martin permanently unfit for duty, the Veterans Administration declared the claimant in <em>Evans </em>permanently disabled. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Carroll\u2019s testing of the present claimant Martin showed him to have a lung capacity as much as 85% and as low as 51% of normal, while testing of the claimant in <em>Evans </em>showed his lung capacity to be as much as 68% of normal. <em>Id. </em>As here, the Secretary determined the claimant in <em>Evans </em>not to have a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit evidenced no hesitation in reversing and directing an award of benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-4\">[T]he medical evidence overwhelmingly supports the claimant\u2019s position that he is unable to work, and there is insubstantial evidence in the record to support the AU\u2019s conclusion that Evans\u2019 disabilities are \u201cnot severe.\u201d Because the uncontro-verted evidence reveals that Evans is permanently and totally disabled, we conclude that the Secretary is obliged to find in favor of the claimant in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1015.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">As will be shown in IV, <em>infra, </em>we similarly conclude that Martin has, in fact, proved a severe impairment that is <em>per se </em>disabling under Appendix 1 of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">III. <em>Substantial Gainful Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">The district court, upon the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, found that substantial evidence showed Martin capable of engaging in substantial gainful employment. It did so by applying the Secretary\u2019s vocational guidelines. 20 C.F.R., Chapter III, Subpart P, Appendix 2. In particular, it applied Table No. 1, Rule 201.11, which provides that a person is not disabled if he is (1) closely approaching advanced age (age 50 to 54), (2) has limited education or less, (3) is skilled or semi-skilled, (4) has transferable skills, and (5) has a residual functional capacity permitting sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-12\">The Secretary cites, and we have found, no precedent in this or any circuit permitting the federal courts to make a disability determination based on the vocational guidelines when the Secretary has not applied the guidelines or made the necessary subsidiary findings. We are doubtful that this is appropriate as a general matter and conclude that it led to error in this particular case. <em>Cf. Delgado v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 570, 574 (9th Cir.1983) (reversing non-severity determination and declining to \u201cmake assumptions\u201d necessary to determine ability of claimant to return to former work).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">First, when nonexertional limitations are shown, a disability decision cannot be made solely on the basis of the vocational guidelines.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Martin asserts nonexertional limitations caused by a breathing. impairment that is aggravated by fumes, including smoke, perfume, deodorant and car exhaust. <em>Allen v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 726 </em>F.2d 1470, 1472-73 (9th Cir.1984) (respiratory problems aggravated by dust or fumes are nonexertional impairment). Second, we find no basis in the record to conclude that Martin has the residual functional capacity to engage in sedentary work, a finding necessary for application of Table No. 1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Third, the record discloses no evidence that Martin developed transferable skills as a tugboat pilot, a critical finding because non-transferability would, under Table 1, require a disability finding. Rule 201.10. And fourth, Martin is now fifty-five years old, which places him in the \u201cadvanced age\u201d category (age 55 and over), 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1563(d) (1984); this affects the transferability issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">IV. <em>Per Se Impairment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">The Secretary has determined that certain impairments result in an automatic finding of disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-1520(d), 404.1525. Those impairments are listed at 20 C.F.R., Chapter III, Subpart P, Appendix 1. Part A, Section 3 of Appendix 1 lists those impairments of the respiratory systems which result in a disability finding. Section 3.00 C states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-12\">When a respiratory impairment is episodic in nature, as may occur in complications of bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, the frequency of severe epi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>sodes despite prescribed treatment is the criteron for determining the level of impairment. Documentation for episodic asthma should include the hospital or emergency records indicating the dates of treatment, clinical findings of presentation, what treatment was given and for what period of time, in the clinical response. Severe attacks of episodic asthma, as listed in Section 3.03B are defined as prolonged episodes lasting at least several hours, requiring intensive treatment such as intravenous drug administration or inhalation therapy in a hospital or emergency room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">According to Section 3.03 B, asthma is disabling if there are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-5\">[e]pisodes of severe attacks (see 3.00C) in spite of prescribed treatment, occurring at least once every two months, or on an average of at least six times a year and prolonged expiration with wheezing or rhonchi between attacks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">The medical records in this case unquestionably establish that Martin falls into this category. His diagnosis consistently has been of asthma, chronic bronchitis, bronc-hospastic episodes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (The January 7, 1981 USPHS outpatient report lumps these diagnoses under the general description \u201cbronchial asthma.\u201d) For this condition, Martin was hospitalized five times between the claimed onset of disability, January 1980, and his hearing before the administrative law judge, November 1981. In each of these hospitalizations, Martin received \u201cintensive treatment such as intravenous drug administration or inhalation therapy.\u201d The five hospitalizations account for more than five \u201csevere attacks\u201d because Martin suffered multiple attacks during as well as prior to hospitalization. Moreover, the medical records demonstrate four emergency room episodes. These total to over nine severe attacks in a fifteen-month period and put Martin squarely within the' average of six severe attacks in a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">The medical records also demonstrate prolonged expiration with wheezing between attacks. The record of May 28, 1981 outpatient treatment notes, for example, that Martin experiences \u201cexpiratory wheezes.\u201d The earlier May 30, 1980 outpatient treatment record shows that Martin experienced shortness of breath and that he \u201cwheezes.\u201d The record of Martin\u2019s June 5, 1981 hospitalization showed \u201cmarked inspiratory and expiratory wheezing in all fields.\u201d Moreover, Martin himself testified to his chronic respiratory distress, indicating two or three attacks per week. His testimony, while not establishing two or three attacks requiring intensive treatment in each week, certainly fulfills the requirement in Appendix 1, Section 3.03 B, <em>supra, </em>that there be distress in the periods between severe attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">We express our concern that three and one-half years have elapsed since Martin applied for benefits to which he is entitled. The record indicates that Martin is not wealthy. He is, rather, typical of claimants who have worked hard for decades and who, upon finding themselves unable to continue work, apply for the insurance benefits for which they have paid premiums from every paycheck they have ever earned. To delay benefits for over three and one-half years to such persons requires some justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">Unfortunately, little justification is shown for the extensive delay in this case. The Secretary denied benefits upon a finding of no severe impairment even though (1) the Appeals Council\u2019s previously-stated understanding of the severity requirement clearly indicates that Martin suffers from a severe impairment and (2) it is plain that Martin\u2019s history of emergency room treatment, intensive care treatment, and general hospitalization establishes the severity and <em>per se </em>disabling nature of his impairment. On judicial review, the Secretary has urged the court to uphold the denial of benefits on plainly inapplicable grounds, i.e., consideration of the vocational guidelines (by the court itself for the first time on judicial review) \u2014 which, at best for the Secretary, would have resulted in a remand for administrative consideration of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>This scenario, at the least, is not in keeping with the remedial purposes of the disability provisions of the Social Security Act and may in future cases expose the Secretary to liability for costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and other expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504; <em>Cornella v. Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d 978 (8th Cir.1984). We do not consider that issue here because it was not raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand to the district court for entry of an order directing the Secretary to grant Martin\u2019s application for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">. Martin's testimony was relevant to the severity question, and the Secretary did not expressly evaluate it or explain her evaluation, as the courts have suggested is required in cases such as the present, where the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints are shown to be medically significant to the issue of determining his disability, <em>see, e.g., Scharlow v. Schweiker, </em>655 F.2d 645, 648-49 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">It does appear that the administrative law judge implicitly credited Martin\u2019s testimony, as his decision purports in part to rest on it. In addition, Martin's testimony was internally consistent, consistent with his wife's affidavit and uncontradicted by any other witness. His complaints clearly derived from medically determined impairments, and the medical records showed numerous episodes of pulmonary distress consistent with Martin\u2019s testimony. These objective manifestations were obviously relevant to a determination of the claimant\u2019s credibility, and here, in the absence of any contrary evidence, it would have been error to reject Martin\u2019s testimony as incredible. <em>See Tome v. Schweiker, </em>724 F.2d 711, 713 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Simmons v. Harris, </em>602 F.2d 1233, 1236 (5th Cir.1979). <em>See generally Taylor v. Heckler, </em>742 F.2d 253, 256 n. 2 (5th Cir.1984) (Secretary may, for proper legal reasons, reject claimant\u2019s testimony \"where the medical evidence is inconclusive\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1103-13\">. We note also a significant number of reversals of non-severity determinations, indicating that the Secretary is misapplying the severity test. <em>E.g., Estran v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 340 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>1984); <em>Taylor v. Schweiker, </em>739 F.2d 1240, 1242-43 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Smith v. Heckler, </em>735 F.2d 312, 316-17 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 920-21 (11th Cir.1984) (shortness of breath); <em>Reinhart v.
