During the course of construction, Ruby-Collins encountered unanticipated groundwater in a section of the jobsite which it claims could not have been discovered in the pre-bid site inspection specified in the contract. The contractor submitted a claim for an equitable adjustment of the contract price to the supervising engineer in which it requested over nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars to cover time, labor, materials and equipment necessary to dewater the site and complete construction. The engineer took no action. However, the City directly responded and refused any adjustment. When the City refused a subsequent request to arbitrate the dispute, the contractor invoked the diversity jurisdiction of the district court and filed an action to compel arbitration under the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14. The City\u2019s pleadings admitted execution of the written contract but asserted that the Act was inapplicable because the contract did not involve interstate commerce and contained no enforceable agreement to arbitrate claims for equitable adjustment. After holding an evidentiary hearing at which the contractor proved the interstate nexus required by \u00a7 2 of the Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, the court found an enforceable agreement in \u00a7 50-01 of the contract and ordered the city to honor it. The City now appeals alleging that the district court erred in failing to hold a \u201csummary trial\u201d, in ignoring Alabama law which declares contracts divesting courts of jurisdiction over disputes arising in the future <em>void ab initio </em>and in misinterpreting \u00a7 50-01 as an enforceable agreement to arbitrate a claim for equitable adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">Though the City concedes the execution of the written contract and the authenticity and admissibility of the contract copies submitted to the court, it nevertheless argues that it has been denied a statutory right to a \u201csummary trial\u201d concerning \u201cthe making of the agreement for arbitration,\u201d which is purportedly guaranteed by 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. The argument is frivolous. Appellant has raised only one issue which even arguably addresses \u201cthe making of the arbitration agreement.\u201d The city contends that the parties could have formed no enforceable agreement to arbitrate a future dispute because all such agreements are <em>void ab initio </em>under Alabama law. Though the appellant has correctly stated the position of the Alabama courts up to and including the date of oral argument before this court, the question raises no issue of fact, to be determined at trial. Moreover, the legal premise upon which it is based is no longer recognized as valid in the state courts of Alabama. Intervening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>state authority recognizes that the United States Arbitration Act creates a federal right to enter into enforceable agreements to arbitrate future disputes which may not be limited by state law. <em>Ex Parte Alabama Oxygen Co., </em>452 So.2d 860, 861 (Ala. 1984). At oral argument before this court, the City conceded that the contractor had proven that the construction contract involved interstate commerce and that the act would therefore apply to any arbitration agreement contained within that contract. Consequently, we find no error in failing to hold a \u201csummary trial\u201d (a term neither employed by the statute nor defined by the City) or in failing to apply state law limitations on the formation and interpretation of arbitration agreements to a contract which falls under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The construction of the pertinent contract clauses is more problematic due to the complex nature of a public works contract which consists of a hodge-podge of government forms. The possible remedies available to the parties appear in \u00a7 50-01 of the general conditions and supplemental general conditions 3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 7<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which supercede any conflicting general provisions by the authority of supplemental general condition 1(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The City argues that no section of the contract can be construed as an enforceable arbitration agreement because supplemental condition 7 states that the parties <em>may </em>agree to arbitrate disputes arising out of the contract and that any construction of the contractual language of other paragraphs as an enforceable agreement would fail to give effect to this language. We disagree. The district court\u2019s opinion does no violence to rules of contract construction in recognizing that the parties to the instant contract may recognize the value and validity of arbitration agreements in one section of the contract and actually form such an agreement in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">The City next raises an alternative equitable argument that inasmuch as the language of \u00a7 50-01 does not grant the power to enter judgment on an arbitration award, no order specifically enforcing the agreement can be entered because a court may not require the parties to perform a useless act. Though \u00a7 9 of the Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9, does authorize a court to enter judgment on an arbitrator\u2019s award if the parties so provide in their agreement, nothing in the language of the Act, which grants the district court the power to compel arbitration and enforce awards in independent sections, implies that Congress intended to limit the court\u2019s authority to enforce an agreement to those cases in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>it has the power to enforce the award. Nor do we have confidence in the City\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 50-01 as failing to grant the district court the power to affirm the award or in its characterization of arbitration as \u201cuseless\u201d in the absence of such authority. The Supreme Court has construed an arbitration agreement which provided that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was \u201cfinal and binding\u201d as authorizing entry of judgment. <em>Marine Transit Corp. v. Dreyfus, </em>284 U.S. 263, 276, 52 S.Ct. 166, 169, 76 L.Ed. 282 (1932). The language of \u00a7 50-01, though somewhat loosely drafted, implies that the results of arbitration would be final. Moreover, the City\u2019s argument ignores the fact that a state or federal court which lacks the statutory or contractual authority to enter judgment enforcing an arbitration award may still hear and adjudicate an action based upon a party\u2019s failure to honor the award itself. <em>A.J. Curtis Co. v. D. W. Falls, Inc., </em>305 F.2d 811 (3d Cir.1962); <em>McCullough v. Clinch-Mitchell Const. Co., </em>71 F.2d 17, 22 (8th Cir.) <em>cert. denied </em>293 U.S. 582, 55 S.Ct. 96, 79 L.Ed. 678 (1934). Further, the evidence gathering and fact finding functions of arbitration are useful <em>per se </em>and assist in resolving disputes through encouraging settlement or fixing the parties\u2019 positions in succeeding arbitration or litigation. Cf. <em>Dallas Typographical Union No. 173 v. A.H. Belo Co., </em>372 F.2d 577, 583 (5th Cir. 1967) (arbitrator may draw freely on principles akin to stare decisis, res judicata and collateral estoppel in related cases); <em>see also, Maidman v. O\u2019Brien, </em>473 F.Supp. 25, 29 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (collateral estoppel applied to suit following arbitration); <em>Hotel, Motel, Restaurant and Hirise Employees and Bartenders\u2019 Union, Local 355 v. Fontainebleau Hotel Corp., </em>423 F.Supp. 83, 85 (S.D.Fla.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Next, appellant asks us to hold that the scope of any arbitration agreement found in \u00a7 50-01 is so limited by its own terms and the superceding language of Special Condition 3 which grants the City final authority whether to grant an adjustment of the contract price due to varying site conditions, as to preclude its application to the instant dispute. We do not agree. Though Special Condition 3 imposes certain conditions upon the contractor\u2019s pursuit of a claim for adjustment of the contract price, it also provides that an equitable adjustment \u201cshall be made\u201d if the Owner (the city) finds a material variance between the site conditions and the contract specifications. Special Condition 3 fails, however, to specify or limit the remedies available in the event that the owner violates his contractual obligation to adjust the contract price. Special Condition 7, \u201cRemedies\u201d specifically provides that the parties may arbitrate claims \u201cunless the contract otherwise provides.\u201d Because Special Condition 3 contains no express limitation on arbitration, we conclude that an arbitration agreement appearing elsewhere in the contract may be applied to a dispute arising out of the City\u2019s failure to grant an equitable adjustment without running afoul of Special Conditions 3 or 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Finally we are faced with the seminal question in this case. Can \u00a7 50-01, recited below, be construed as an arbitration agreement which would cover the instant dispute? In answering this question we are bound by the special rule of contract construction which is applied in all cases brought under the Arbitration Act: arbitration clauses are to be generously construed and all doubts are to be resolved in favor of arbitration. <em>Seaboard Coast Line Ry. v. Trailer Train Co., </em>690 F.2d 1343 (11th Cir.1982). Though the language of \u00a7 50-01, recited below,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is hardly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>language of choice for an arbitration agreement covering the instant dispute, we are unable to find error in the district court\u2019s construction of the contract. The Engineer is charged with a duty to decide questions which may arise as to \u201cthe quality and acceptability of the work performed, the rate of the progress of the work, interpretation of the Drawings and Specifications and all questions as to the acceptable fulfillment of the Agreement on the part of the Contractor,\u201d and the contract finally provides \u201cAll claims of the Owner or the Contractor shall be presented to the Engineer for his decisions which shall be final except in eases where time and/or financial considerations are involved, and such cases shall be subject to arbitration if not solved by mutual agreement between the Owner and the Contractor.\u201d A determination whether the work site materially differs from the contract specifications necessarily involves some of those factors which are committed to the Engineer\u2019s judgment (e.g. interpretation of drawings and specifications). Obviously, financial considerations are the heart of the instant contractor\u2019s claim. Though we entertain some doubt whether the agreement was intended to cover the instant claim, we must enforce federal policy and come down in favor of arbitration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\">.
