Finding no error in the district court\u2019s determination, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">Kathryn Davis Matthews was hired on November 18, 1980, by A-1, Inc., a mobile home sales company, as a sales associate in the Lubbock, Texas, office. She was the only female sales associate in the office. She was discharged from her position on July 11, 1981, for (1) violating company policy prohibiting \u201cmoonlighting\u201d and (2) tardiness and absenteeism. Her \u201cmoonlighting\u201d activity was selling Mary Kay cosmetics. Although there were no documented instances of tardiness and absenteeism in her file, at trial A-1\u2019s manager, Wayne Swinney, was able to recall three instances: (1) when her mother was ill, (2) when she went to the hairdresser, and (3) when she had car trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">The male sales associates in the office were treated differently both while employed and as to discharge: (1) male associates with tardiness and absenteeism problems were counseled about them and in some instances formal documentation concerning the problems were placed in their files; (2) male associates were permitted to leave the lot on personal errands and to go to the barbershop; (3) two of the male associates engaged in some \u201cmoonlighting\u201d activity, even on company time; (4) rather than being discharged for \u201cmoonlighting,\u201d the male employees were given an exemption from the company rule; and (5) no male employees were terminated for tardiness and absenteeism unless there was also a problem with their productivity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">The district court, after a bench trial, found that Matthews\u2019 termination constituted sex discrimination<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and awarded her $4,203.39 for lost back wages and $6,000 for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-15\">(1) Finding of Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">A-1 argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by relying on a non-material fact, <em>i.e., </em>the sexual harassment of Matthews by A-1\u2019s manager Swinney, in reaching its finding of discrimination, and that the finding of discrimination was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">a. Sexual Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-18\">The district court did find that Swinney made sexual advances to Matthews when he required her to work alone with him in the office late at night. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. </em>The court, however, clearly and unequivocally stated that it considered the sexual harassment only as relevant background evidence and that no recovery could be based on this factor because it was not included in the E.E.O.C. charge. <em>See United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 554-55, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1887, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977); <em>Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., </em>431 F.2d 455, 460-67 (5th Cir.1970). \u201c[T]he filing of a charge of discrimination with the EEOC is a condition precedent to the bringing of a civil action under Title VII\u201d <em>San</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number><em>chez, </em>431 F.2d at 460. While technical omissions of legal theories from the E.E. O.C. charge do not preclude a plaintiff from including those theories in the Title VII complaint, in such a case the <em>acts </em>upon which those theories are based must be noted in the charge. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 464-67. The district court did not consider the sexual harassment acts that were not mentioned in the charge as within the scope of this civil action and Matthews has not alleged that the court erred in excluding those acts as a basis for recovery or that the theory of sex discrimination encompasses sexual harassment. Therefore, A-l\u2019s contentions that the district court gave only token acknowledgement to the requirement that a discriminatory act be timely raised in an E.E.O.C. charge to present a claim in a subsequent suit are completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">As to A-l\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s taking notice of the presence of sexual harassment in Matthews\u2019 employment situation \u201cunquestionably, and impermissibly, colored its judgment, resulting in a clearly erroneous ultimate finding of discrimination,\u201d no supporting facts or argument are presented on appeal except for one quote from the court\u2019s order denying A-l\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The complete quoted sentence reads: \u201cThe court, after hearing all the evidence and judging the credibility of the witnesses, found that defendant\u2019s termination of plaintiff was for impermissible sexually motivated reasons and that the supposedly legitimate causes advanced by defendant were pretextual.\u201d Even if A-1 means to argue that the court\u2019s use of the word \u201csexually\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> necessarily referred to the harassment acts rather than being merely the grammatically correct usage of an adverb as a modifier<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the context of the sentence, the argument has no merit. The district court\u2019s opinion, as noted previously, clearly indicates that the acts of sexual harassment were not the basis of the court\u2019s finding of discrimination based on sex. The opinion also specifies in detail the various ways in which the employer treated male and female employees differently that did provide the basis for the determination,</p>\n<p id=\"AX1\">b. Clearly Erroneous Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">Although the factual inquiry in this case is simply \u201cwhether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff,\u201d there are two ways in which a plaintiff may succeed in carrying the burden of persuasion on discriminatory intent: \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>United States Postal Serv. Board of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1482, 75 L.Ed.2d 403, 410-11 (1983) (quoting <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). In this case, the district court found A-1\u2019s reasons for discharging Matthews to be pretextual. A-1 concedes on appeal that the court\u2019s findings concerning tardiness and absenteeism were not clearly erroneous. It challenges only the court\u2019s findings as to \u201cmoonlighting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">The district court found that a male employee, Mr. Wood, had engaged in some \u201cmoonlighting\u201d activities (the retention of an automobile dealership license), but that they did not \u201crise to the level of a day-today business involvement,\u201d and that he was allowed to resign for other reasons. However, as to another employee, Mr. Kallerman, the court found that he kept the books for his mobile home rental enterprise on company time and was granted an exemption from company policy after being given an opportunity to explain his \u201cmoonlighting\u201d business. In contrast, the court found that Matthews \u201cwas terminated immediately on the day [manager] Swinney learned of her cosmetic sales.\u201d She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>\u201cnot afforded an opportunity to divest herself of any interest, nor was an exemption sought on her behalf.\u201d Swinney had sought the exemption for Mr. Kallerman from A-1\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">A-l argues that the court ignored the prior approval given to Wood and Kallerman to engage in their outside activities and that Matthews was fired for engaging in her \u201cmoonlighting\u201d activities surreptitiously. Matthews argues that the very fact that Swinney sought to accommodate the \u201cmoonlighting\u201d activities of the two men while viewing her cosmetic sales as an unquestionable violation of company policy is evidence of sex discrimination. In <em>Chescheir v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>713 F.2d 1142 (5th Cir.1983), this Court upheld a finding that an employer applied its \u201claw school\u201d rule differently to male and female employees. <em>Id. </em>at 1149. Women who violated the rule (by attending law school) were immediately discharged and potential violators were investigated promptly while no male employees were discharged because of the \u201claw school\u201d rule and those suspected of it were not investigated. <em>Id. Chescheir </em>supports Matthews\u2019 interpretation of the finding that A-1\u2019s \u201cmoonlighting\u201d policy was discriminatorily applied. <em>Id. </em>at 1150; <em>see E.E.O.C. v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>688 F.2d 338, 340 (5th Cir.1982). The challenged findings as to \u201cmoonlighting\u201d are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">(2) Interim Earnings</p>\n<p id=\"aqp-dedup-0\">A-l also argues that the court\u2019s calculation of damages violated the following provision of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g): \u201cInterim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.\u201d Matthews had been earning a minimum monthly draw of $2,000 while at A-1. Less than two months after her discharge, she obtained employment with another mobile home sales office where she averaged $1,881.22 in commissions per month over a seven-month period. The district court deducted these interim earnings from her damage award. However, Matthews left her new job in Lubbock and moved to Amarillo after marrying and remained unemployed for three months. She then obtained employment at which she earned an average of $2,910.32 per month. The court construed her damages to cease when she began earning wages in excess of what she had received at A-1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">Relying on <em>Merriweather v. Hercules, Inc., </em>631 F.2d 1161 (5th Cir.1980), A-1 argues that the damage award must be reduced by <em>any </em>earnings, including those at the higher paying job in Amarillo. However, <em>Merriweather </em>is inapposite in that it holds that interim earnings need not be from employment similar in nature to that discharged from, but must include all earnings acquired during the interim <em>period </em>from any type of work obtained. <em>Id. </em>at 1168. A-1 also relies on <em>Ford Motor Co. v. E.E.O.C., </em>458 U.S. 219, 102 S.Ct. 3057, 73 L.Ed.2d 721 (1982). <em>Ford </em>is even less applicable to the present facts, holding that a \u201cclaimant\u2019s statutory obligation to minimize damages requires him to accept an unconditional offer of the job originally sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 102 S.Ct. at 3067. The actual obligation to mitigate damages is well-established and not in dispute. Nothing in <em>Ford </em>obligates the court to extend the period for calculating damages past the time of acceptance of a higher-paying position. As Matthews correctly argues, the relevant question is whether the district court properly determined the interim period. \u201cThe determination of the back pay period is a factual matter to be set aside only when clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Ches-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number><em>cheir v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>713 F.2d at 1150 (5th Cir.1983). Other courts have found that a claim for back pay ceases when the claimant begins to earn more than she had been earning with the defendant employer. <em>See, e.g., Di Salvo v. Chamber of Commerce, </em>568 F.2d at 598; <em>Somers v. Aldine Indep. School Dist., </em>464 F.Supp. 900, 903 (S.D.Tex.1979), <em>aff'd </em>620 F.2d 298 (5th Cir.1980). The district court, in this case, properly refused to deduct Matthews\u2019 earnings at a higher paying position from her damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The issues in this case having been joined, the evidence having been adduced, and the district court having made findings that are supported by the record and proper conclusions of law, the judgment entered is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">. There was no allegation of lack of productivity by Matthews in the reasons given for her discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">. The court also noted in its findings that although the case did not specifically involve sexual harassment, only Matthews was requested to work late alone in the office with Swinney, and that Swinney used the \"midnight conferences\u201d as opportunities for sexual advances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">. A-1 actually misquotes the word as \"sexual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">. That \u201csex\u201d is commonly used to modify \u201cdiscrimination\u201d does not lead to the conclusion that the use of \"sexually motivated reasons\u201d is a reference to sexual harassment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">. The court actually found the interim period to end on March 31, 1982, when Matthews resigned from the position at which she was earning 81,881.22 per month to move to Amarillo with her husband. The court also did not award any damages for the three months after her voluntary relocation. While the court's reasoning focuses on the cessation of damages at the time Matthews began to earn a higher income, the court would also have been correct in finding the interim period to have ended when Matthews resigned from her position at Lubbock because of her marriage. <em>See Di Salvo v. Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City, </em>568 F.2d 593, 598 (8th Cir.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
