Congress has not addressed this precise question. Neither the Act, its legislative history, nor its implementing regulations explicitly mention German reparations payments made pursuant to the Federal Law for the Compensation of Victims of National Socialist Persecution of June 28, 1956.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we reverse the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) determination that German reparations payments are income for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">Felicia Grunfeder, born a year before the Germans invaded Poland in World War II, was confined with her family in the Warsaw ghetto. She escaped in a coffin lifted over the fence separating the Jewish cemetery from the Polish cemetery. Grunfeder then lived with a Polish family in the Polish section of Warsaw until the Nazis imprisoned them in the Lager Rote-Rose concentration camp. Liberated by the Americans at the end of the war, Grunfeder was reunited with her mother. They both relocated to the United States in 1949. Grunfeder\u2019s father and the other members of her family perished at the hands of the Nazis.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">Grunfeder developed severe psychological problems as a result of her experiences during the war. She petitioned the German government under the German Restitution Act and started receiving monthly reparations payments of 159 DM (approximately $228) in 1968. Because the psychological effects she suffers have been disabling, Grunfeder applied for and began receiving SSI payments of $119 in 1974. In 1980, the SSA learned that Grunfeder was receiving German reparations payments and terminated her SSI benefits on the ground that the reparations payments constituted \u201cunearned income\u201d under the Act and made her ineligible for SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">The Secretary denied Grunfeder\u2019s motion for reconsideration, an administrative law judge denied her appeal, and the Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Council denied her request for a review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Exercising jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), the district court dismissed Grunfeder\u2019s complaint seeking review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Grunfeder now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Ai1\">Our court has \u201ccarefully examined [the question] when the receipt of an item of value by an SSI beneficiary constitutes income which is actually available to meet the beneficiary\u2019s basic needs.\u201d <em>Summy v. Schweiker, </em>688 F.2d 1233, 1235 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>see Whaley v. Schweiker, </em>663 F.2d 871, 873-75 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In <em>Whaley, </em>we overturned the determination of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the amount of increased pension benefits the Veterans Administration pays a veteran for the support of his dependent children constitutes income in determining SSI eligibility. 663 F.2d at 875. We dismissed the Secretary\u2019s argument that because the veteran could use the dependent\u2019s portion for his own needs, that amount fell within the SSA\u2019s definition of income as \u201canything [an individual can use] to meet [his] basic needs for food, clothing, or shelter.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1102(a) (1981). In determining the proper accommodation between the Veterans Administration regulations and the SSI provisions, we noted that \u201c[t]he interpretation of the Veterans Administration regulations by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, a department unrelated to the Veterans Administration,] is not entitled to deference.\u201d 663 F.2d at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Likewise, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the German Restitution Act and the intended uses of reparations payments is entitled to little deference. Although we generally give some deference to an implementing agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">where, as here, the review is not of a question of fact, but of a judgment as to the proper balance to be struck between conflicting interests, \u2018[t]he deference owed ... cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia which results in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\"><em>NLRB v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 292, 85 S.Ct. 980, 988, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965) (quoting <em>American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, </em>380 U.S. 300, 318, 85 S.Ct. 955, 967, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">In determining that the definition of income for SSI eligibility purposes includes German reparations payments, the SSA implicitly balanced our Government\u2019s interest in allocating a limited pool of funds to support the country\u2019s aged, blind, and disabled against our Government\u2019s interest in restoring a semblance of normal existence to Holocaust survivors who live in the United States. This type of policy decision, which implicates foreign affairs, is outside the Secretary\u2019s expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Congress has vested reviewing courts with the duty to \u201cdecide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976). Courts are the final authority on questions of statutory construction, <em>Tulalip Tribes of Washington v. FERC, </em>732 F.2d 1451, 1454 (9th Cir.1984), particularly in areas where, as here, the construction requires consideration of broad concerns beyond the agency\u2019s expertise. As we construe the Act\u2019s relevant SSI provisions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383c, German reparations payments are not includable as income. Therefore, we find that the Secretary\u2019s contrary determination is \u201cnot in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), and we set it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">The SSI program is designed to supplement the income of needy aged, blind, or disabled persons. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 (1976). An individual is eligible for SSI benefits if his annual \u201cincome\u201d is below $1,752 and his \u201cresources\u201d are less than $1,500. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1382(a)(1). Congress defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201cincome\u201d for SSI purposes in \u00a7 1382a as both \u201cearned\u201d and \u201cunearned\u201d income. Congress specifies that earned income means \u201conly\u201d wages, net earnings from self-employment, refunds of Federal income tax, and remuneration for services performed in a work activities center. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1382a(a)(l) (Supp. IV 1980). In contrast, Congress generally describes unearned income as \u201call other income,\u201d including seven categories of receipts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1382a(a)(2) (A)-(F) (1976). Although Congress lists 12 types of receipts that \u201cshall be excluded\u201d from income, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1382a(b) (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), Congress never defines the term \u201cincome\u201d itself and leaves considerable .flexibility in the statutory criteria for eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">The SSA, however, has expansively defined \u201cincome\u201d as \u201cthe receipt by . an individual of any property ... which he can apply ... to meeting his basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1102(a) (1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The SSA excludes only those receipts listed in other sections of the regulations. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.1105-416.1112, 416.1145-416.1175 (1980). On the basis of this administrative definition and the fact that German reparations payments are not specifically listed as an exclusion, the Secretary argues that reparations payments are countable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As stated earlier, Congress has not explicitly addressed the \u2022 narrow question whether German reparations payments are income for the purposes of determining SSI eligibility. To ascertain Congress\u2019s intent on this question, we first look to the history of how Congress has treated Holocaust survivors. We then examine how Congress and the SSA have treated analogous payments. Finally, we employ the doctrine of international comity to aid us, in determining congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">A. <em>History: Congress and its Treatment of Holocaust Survivors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">We first examine the question presented by this case, and the pertinent SSI provisions, in the light of federal policy according special consideration to victims of the Holocaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">In 1948, Congress welcomed the Holocaust survivors to the United States by excluding them from immigration quota requirements. <em>See </em>Displaced Persons Act of 1948, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1951-1965 (1952), <em>amended by </em>50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1951-1965 (1958), <em>omitted at </em>50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1951-1965 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Even before Congress addressed the issue of taxing German reparations payments, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had consistently ruled that reparations payments did not constitute \u201cincome\u201d because they \u201care in the nature of reimbursement for the deprivation of civil or personal rights.\u201d Rev.Rul. 58-500, 1958-2 C.B. 21; <em>see also </em>Rev.Rul. 56-518, 1956-2 C.B. 25 (using same language). Congress subsequently confirmed the IRS\u2019s assumption that Congress intended to exclude German reparations payments from taxable income because of their penitent purpose and restitutionary character. In 1954, the Senate ratified the Convention Between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, July 22, 1954, 5 U.S.T. 2768, T.I.A.S. No. 3133, and in 1965, ratified a protocol modifying the 1954 convention. The protocol exempted from income taxation the reparations payments made to Holocaust victims residing in the United States:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Pensions, annuities and other amounts paid by one of the contracting States or by a juridical person organized under the public laws of that State as compensation for an injury or damage sustained as a result of hostilities or political persecution shall be exempt from tax by the other State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Protocol Modifying the Convention Between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and to Certain Other Taxes, Sept. 7, 1965, art. XI(1)(c), 18 U.S.T. 1875, 1884, T.I.A.S. No. 5920.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Moreover, in 1978, the House and Senate passed a joint resolution designating April 28 and 29, 1979, as \u201cDays of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust,\u201d in recognition of the fact that \u201con April 28 and 29 of 1945 the Armed Forces of the United States liberated the surviving victims of Nazi internment in the concentration camp in Dachau, Germany, and revealed to the world evidence of a tragic human holocaust that must never be forgotten.\u201d H.R.J.Res. 1014, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 124 Cong.Rec. 26725, <em>enacted but not codified, </em>92 Stat. 628 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Two years later, Congress ensured that Americans would remember the Holocaust by establishing the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. 36 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1408 (1982) (enacted Oct. 7, 1980). The Council\u2019s functions include providing for \u201cappropriate ways for the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual, national, civic commemoration of the holocaust,\u201d and constructing \u201ca permanent living memorial museum to the victims of the holocaust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1401. The accompanying House Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">The holocaust has been recognized as the systematic act of extermination of nearly 6 million Jews in Europe before and during World War II. During this same period millions of people suffered death and destruction at the hands of those who embraced the Nazi philosophy. The records of history fail to provide evidence of another act of genocide of this, or even approaching this, magnitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">The armies of the United States were the primary discoverers of the locations used for extermination, the records of the systematic genocide and the few survivors. Of those few survivors of the holocaust, many subsequently emigrated to the United States and they and their descendents now form an integral part of our society. The historic perspective of the nation has been clearly affected by this event in such a way that historians generally recognize the holocaust as an occurrence of the history of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">H.R.Rep. No. 1347, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3343, 3344.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">Congress has thus acknowledged that unprecedented atrocities were committed during the Holocaust, accepted the surviving victims as members of our society, and accorded special recognition to the German government\u2019s reparations payments by excluding them from Federal income tax. Therefore, even though Congress has not spoken explicitly on the issue whether German reparations payments are to be excluded from income for SSI eligibility purposes, Congress\u2019s reaction to the Holocaust and its recognition of the restitutionary nature of the reparations payments indicate an intent to exclude those payments from countable income for SSI purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"ArK\">B. <em>How Congress and the SSA Have Treated Analogous Receipts</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aid\">In at least one analogous situation, Congress has explicitly excluded reparations payments from the computation of income for SSI purposes. In the Blackfeet and Gros Ventre Tribes of Montana Judgment Funds Distribution Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1261-1265 (1976), Congress provides that payments the United States Government makes to two Native American tribes are excluded from income for both federal income tax and SSI eligibility purposes. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1264. As Senator Ribicoff observed, the SSI exclusion for these payments \u201cfollows congressional intent to rectify past injus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tice perpetrated against the American Indian.\u201d 118 Cong.Rec. 4027 (1972). Similarly, Holocaust survivors receive reparations payments to make amends for past injustices and horrors perpetrated against them by the Nazis. These payments are not designed to support basic needs, but to assuage psychological wounds that will never heal. The fact that the Blackfeet and Gros Ventre payments are not included in the SSI list of exclusions from income, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a(b) (1976), indicates that the list is not exclusive and that Congress may have intended to exclude similar receipts not specified in the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Moreover, the SSA in effect concedes this interpretation. It excludes from income federal reparations payments to Alaskan Native Americans even though Congress has not explicitly provided for their exclusion in either the Act or the legislation establishing the payments. <em>See </em>Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-1628 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980). Congress specifically provides that the Alaskan payments are exempt from income taxation, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1620(a) (1976), but does not mention whether they are also excluded from income for SSI purposes. Apparently treating the income tax exemption as an indication of congressional intent, the SSA excluded the Alaskan native payments from income for SSI purposes \u201cto the same extent that those payments are exempt from taxation by reason of [the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act].\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1146(1) (1980).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The SSA\u2019s willingness to exclude the Alaskan native payments despite congressional silence. undermines the Secretary\u2019s argument that German reparations payments. are non-excludable unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise. The inconsistency in this position is even more pronounced when we focus on the basis for excluding the Alaskan payments \u2014 the income tax exemption \u2014 which is equally applicable to the German reparations payments. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974), \u201cthe weight of an administrative interpretation will depend, among other things, upon \u2018its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements\u2019 of an agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 94 S.Ct. at 1075 (quoting <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)). The exclusion of Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, and Alaskan Native payments, when considered in light of congressional concern for the victims of the Holocaust, provides us with a solid basis for finding German reparations payments excludable in determining eligibility for SSI benefits and for setting aside the Secretary\u2019s anomalous interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">In an effort to minimize the importance of these analogous examples, the Secretary cites two other types of benefits that Congress does include as income for SSI purposes: workers\u2019 compensation and veterans\u2019 compensation payments. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a(a)(2)(B) (1976). Here, the analogy is inapposite. Unlike German reparations, workers\u2019 compensation payments arise from a commercial employee-employer relationship. They are essentially a substitution for loss of earnings, not compensation for an injustice committed upon the employee. Indeed, workers\u2019 compensation is paid without regard to fault; the premiums imposed on the employer fund insurance against workplace injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The inclusion of veterans\u2019 compensation payments is noninstructive for similar reasons. Veterans\u2019 payments do not embody an admission of fault or expression of penitence for deprivation of personal rights. The absence of a penitent purpose thus distinguishes both types of payments from the German reparations payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">In short, because both Congress and the SSA have excluded analogous reparations payments from income in determining SSI eligibility, and because workers\u2019 compensation and veterans\u2019 compensation payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>are distinguishable, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to exclude German reparations payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">C. <em>The Role of International Comity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The doctrine of international comity gives us another reason for concluding that Congress intended to exclude German reparations payments from income for SSI purposes. Absent an expression of congressional intent to the contrary, considerations of courtesy and mutuality require our courts to construe domestic legislation in a way that minimizes interference with the purpose or effect of foreign law. <em>See, e.g., Lauritzen v. Larsen, </em>345 U.S. 571, 576-78, 592-93, 73 S.Ct. 921, 925-26, 933-34, 97 L.Ed. 1254 (1953) (term \u201c[a]ny seaman\u201d in Jones Act held not to include Danish sailor with regard to events on Danish ship outside U.S. waters); <em>Foley Bros. v. Filardo, </em>336 U.S. 281, 285, 69 S.Ct. 575, 577, 93 L.Ed. 680 (1949) (term \u201c[ejvery contract\u201d in Eight Hour Law held not to include a contract between the U.S. and a private contractor for work in a foreign country). This principle of statutory construction, \u201ca valid approach whereby unexpressed congressional intent may be ascertained,\u201d is \u201cbased on the assumption that Congress is primarily concerned with domestic conditions.\u201d <em>Foley, </em>336 U.S. at 285, 69 S.Ct. at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">There are two reasons why we think the principles of comity support setting aside the SSA\u2019s determination that German reparations payments are countable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">First, including German reparations payments as income for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility would frustrate the German Restitution Act\u2019s penitent and res-titutionary purposes. Depriving Grunfeder of SSI benefits would force her to spend the reparations payments on basic necessities and leave her with no restitution for the suffering she endures as a result of the Holocaust. Unlike the SSI payments, which are designed to provide basic necessities, the German payments are designed to make the recipients whole. Excluding Blackfeet and Gros Ventre payments from income for SSI eligibility demonstrates Congress\u2019s acknowledgment that inclusion would frustrate the payments\u2019 restitution-ary purpose. And the SSA\u2019s exclusion of the Alaskan native payments can only be explained as an attempt to effectuate congressional intent to provide for reparation. If exclusion is necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, and Alaskan native payments, it follows that exclusion is also necessary to avoid frustrating the purpose of the German reparations payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Second, Congress has expressed no desire to interfere with the German government\u2019s attempt to make amends for crimes committed during the Holocaust. Instead, Congress has established a Memorial Council to commemorate Days of Remembrance and to erect a permanent living museum on behalf of the victims. Moreover, Congress has agreed not to subject the German reparations payments to Federal income taxation. We think that these congressional actions reflect a desire to effectuate fully the German government\u2019s restitutionary intent in making reparations payments. For these reasons, the doctrine of comity supports interpretation of the SSI provisions to exclude German reparations payments from income in determining SSI eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">In sum, even though Congress has not spoken directly on the matter, we conclude that Congress\u2019s historical concern for Holocaust victims and Congress\u2019s and the SSA\u2019s treatment of analogous payments, when considered in conjunction with principles of international comity, indicate a congressional intent to exclude German reparations payments from income in determining SSI eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">This case requires us to resolve a conflict between the Government\u2019s interest in allocating a limited pool of funds to support the country\u2019s aged, blind, and disabled, and the Government\u2019s interest in restoring a semblance of normal existence to Holocaust survivors who are part of our society. In resolving the matter in favor of the latter, we follow the lead of Congress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Having recognized the great suffering of people like Felicia Grunfeder, and having consistently taken steps to ameliorate their plight, Congress could not have intended to undermine its own longstanding policy favoring their welfare by counting German reparations payments as income in determining eligibility for SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Today\u2019s decision is in harmony with Congress\u2019s desire to provide some solace to the victims of one of human history's terrible tragedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">SCHROEDER, ALARCON, FERGUSON, BOOCHEVER and REINHARDT, Circuit Judges, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">NELSON, Circuit Judge, concurring with the exception of Section C.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">FERGUSON, Circuit Judge, concurring; SCHROEDER and ALARCON, Circuit Judges, joining.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Although concurring in the court\u2019s well reasoned opinion, I arrive at the same result by analyzing the issue in a different manner. This analysis does not dep\u00e9nd on the status of the recipient but instead rests on the status of the funds received. Tort compensation traditionally has been excluded from the definition of income and, unless Congress specifically states otherwise, the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383c, should not be construed as modifying this longstanding definition. Because the reparations payments at issue here are in the nature of tort compensation, Rev.Rul. 57-505, 1957-2 C.B. 50 (such' payments are \u201cin the nature of reimbursement for the deprivation of civil or personal rights\u201d); Rev.Rul. 56-518, 1956-2 C.B. 25 (German reparation payments are paid on account of \u201csuffered damage to life, body, health, liberty, rights of property ownership, or to professional or economic advancement\u201d), they neither constitute \u201cincome\u201d under the income tax laws, Rev.Rul. 71-477, 1971-2 C.B. 479; Rev.Rul. 58-500, 1958-2 C.B. 21; Rev.Rul. 57-505, 1957-2 C.B. 50; Rev.Rul. 56-518, 1956-2 C.B. 25, nor under the Act for purposes of determining eligibility for supplementary security income (\u201cSSI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Despite the broad definition accorded to the term \u201cgross income\u201d under the tax laws, <em>Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., </em>348 U.S. 426, 429-32, 75 S.Ct. 473, 475-77, 99 L.Ed. 483 (1955); I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a), payments received in the nature of tort compensation have never been considered income. <em>See Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., </em>348 U.S. at 432 n. 8, 75 S.Ct. at 477 n. 8; <em>Roemer v. Commissioner, </em>716 F.2d 693, 696 (9th Cir.1983). Congress has explicitly excluded personal injury recoveries from the definition of income since 1918. Revenue Act of 1918, Ch. 18, \u00a7 213(b)(2), 40 Stat. 1057 (1919). Today such recoveries are excluded from income under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">To be eligible for SSI benefits under the Act, an individual must be aged, blind, or disabled with an income not exceeding a meager $1,752 per year and resources no greater than $1,500 (unmarried) or $2,250 (married). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(1). An individual\u2019s annual income consists of both his or her earned and unearned income as defined in section 1382a of the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a. In section 1382a(2), Congress defines \u201cunearned income\u201d as all income other than earned income and sets forth a nonexhaustive list of specific items constituting unearned income. Tort compensation is not included in that list. When it omitted such compensation from the list, Congress did so with the knowledge that historically personal injury recoveries have always been excluded from the definition of income. Had Congress wished to alter this longstanding definition it would have so stated. <em>See </em>2A C.D. Sands, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.30 (1973) (legislature is presumed to have given legal terms in a statute the same meaning as that given to them in the jurisprudence of this country absent a manifested intent to the contrary). This is further underscored by the fact that Congress deemed it neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>sary to expressly list items such as gifts, inheritances, prizes and awards, workmen's compensation payments, and life insurance proceeds which are either fully or partially excluded from income under the income tax laws, so that, contrary to the usual tax treatment, the entire amount of such items would be included in the calculation of income for SSI purposes. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a(2)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F). This explicit inclusion of items exempted or partially exempted from income under the income tax laws evidences Congress\u2019 intention not to include tort damages within the definition of income for purposes of SSI eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The rationale underlying the exclusion of compensation paid for personal injuries from gross income under the income tax laws, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(2), is that such compensation makes the victim \u201cwhole from a previous loss of personal rights\u2014 because, in effect, [it] restore[s] a loss to capital.\u201d <em>Starrels v. Commissioner, </em>304 F.2d 574, 576 (9th Cir.1962). <em>See also Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., </em>348 U.S. 426, 432 n. 8, 75 S.Ct. 473, 477 n. 8, 99 L.Ed. 483 (1955) (referring to the long history of Internal Revenue Service rulings holding personal injury recoveries nontaxable on the theory that they correspond to a return of capital); <em>Roemer v. Commissioner, </em>716 F.2d 693 (9th Cir.1983) (entire lump-sum recovery of damages in a defamation action is excludable from gross income as damages received \u201con account of personal injuries\u201d and the award should not be differentiated as includable or excludable on the basis of whether the amount recovered was in consideration of damage to plaintiff\u2019s personal life or his professional career). This understanding has led the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to interpret liberally the statute excluding such recoveries from income so as to include both punitive damages and all compensatory damages (whether for pain and suffering or loss of employment) where there has been a personal injury. Rev.Rul. 75-45, 1975-1 C.B. 47. <em>See also Roemer v. Commissioner, </em>716 F.2d at 700. This same rationale applies to the calculation of income for determining eligibility for SSI. When money is received as- compensation for wrongful loss there is no economic gain or accession to wealth but only an attempt to restore the recipient to the position he occupied prior to the loss. The recipient is perhaps made whole, but not enriched. <em>Starrels, </em>304 F.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">When determining whether a SSI applicant\u2019s income exceeds $1,752 the rationale discussed above with respect to tax laws requires exclusion of tort compensation from this calculation. For example, the person with one arm and a tort recovery for the loss of his other arm is no better off than he was with two arms and no tort recovery. <em>See Starrels v. Commissioner, </em>304 F.2d at 576; <em>Hawkins v. Commissioner, </em>6 B.T.A. 1023, 1025 (1927) (\u201cSuch compensation ... adds nothing to the individual . . . . It is an attempt to make the plaintiff whole as before the injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Even though the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) defines \u201cincome\u201d as \u201canything you receive in cash or in kind that you can use to meet your needs for food, clothing, or shelter,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.-1102, the Secretary has not treated \u201cincome\u201d as including all monetary receipts. The Secretary has excluded payments made for land claims under the Alaska Native Claims Act from the calculation of income for SSI purposes since 1974, despite the fact that Congress only expressly exempted such payments from income tax, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1620(a), and not from the definition of income for purposes of SSI eligibility. 1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2389. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1124(b), App. IV(a) (regulations under the Act exempting such payments from income for SSI purposes). The purpose of the Alaska Native Claims Act is \u201cto provide an equitable solution to the [land] claims made by the Natives of Alaska through a combination grant of land and money,\u201d 1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2193. When the Secretary excluded the benefits received by the Alaska Natives, she clearly understood the traditional rule that payments received in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>nature of tort compensation have never been considered income. The payments received by Mrs. Grunfeder in this.case are of the same nature as those received by the Alaska Natives. The only difference is the status of the recipients. This underscores the reason why I would decide this case not on the status of the recipient but upon the status of the funds which are received.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Because the traditional exclusion of tort recoveries from the definition of \u201cincome\u201d continues under the Act, payments received in the nature of tort compensation, such as the ones involved here, are to be disregarded in calculating an individual\u2019s income for purposes of determining eligibility for SSI. Basing our decision on this analysis would also exclude from the definition of income for SSI purposes payments such as those received by former prisoners of war and internees under the War Claims Act of 1948, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 2001-2017; .see Rev.Rul. 56-462, 1956-2 C.B. 20 (payments to former prisoners of war captured and held during the hostilities in Korea as compensation for the loss of their personal rights are not includable in the gross income of the recipients for federal income tax purposes); Rev.Rul. 55-132, 1955-1 C.B. 213 (payments authorized by War Claims Act to former prisoners of war are in the nature of reimbursement for loss of personal rights and are not includable in the gross income of the recipient); those made to victims of criminal acts as restitution for the pecuniary losses they suffer as a direct result of those acts, <em>see </em>Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 13959-13974; and any payments made to satisfy the claims of those who suffered hardship as a result of Executive Order 9066, 7 Fed.Reg. 1407 (Feb. 19, 1942), which caused the relocation and internment of persons of Japanese ancestry as well as citizens of the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands. <em>See </em>American-Japanese Evacuation Claims Act, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-87; <em>Japanese American Evacuation Redress, 1988: Hearings on S.1520 Before the Subcomm. on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, </em>98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, <em>Personal Justice Denied </em>(1982); 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2405-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The definition of income does not depend on the status of the recipient but on the nature of the payment received. Tort compensation has traditionally been excluded from the definition of income and, unless Congress specifically states otherwise, the Act should not be construed as modifying this longstanding definition. Thus, because tort recoveries are not \u201cincome,\u201d the reparation payments at issue here, which are in the nature of tort compensation, are not \u201cincome\u201d for the purposes of determining eligibility for SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">GOODWIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting; WALLACE, J. BLAINE ANDERSON and CANBY, Circuit Judges, joining:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The majority\u2019s exposition of what the Congress might have intended if the question had been before it is probably as accurate as that sort of speculation ever can be. The original panel that decided this case, however, was dealing with the law as it was, and not as it might have been had the Congress been better advised. I would not have taken the .case en banc, and would adhere to the original panel decision. See <em>Grunfeder v. Heckler, </em>708 F.2d 458 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The SSI program is a need-based program. An individual is eligible for SSI benefits if that person\u2019s income and resources fall below certain statutory figures. Grunfeder\u2019s resources do not fall below those figures. Having recognized these considerations, the majority looks to a number of statutes in which Congress did express an intent that certain benefits not be counted as unearned income to decide that Congress intended <em>sub silentio </em>the same result here. The original panel took the same statutory examples to reveal that Congress knows how to make policy exceptions of this kind when it chooses to do so. Much of what the majority has to say about the equities in this case can hardly be disputed. Indeed, Congress would no doubt lend a willing ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The analogies which the majority draws to lump sum awards, however, do not apply to a need-based statutory scheme of the kind presently before us. While not mentioned by the majority, Grunfeder received the various lump sum awards to which she was entitled, and they have not been counted against her. I believe the original panel made the correct analysis of the law to apply to this case for the reasons carefully stated in its opinion. The tragic history of Germany between 1935 and 1945 sheds no light on the narrow question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\">.
