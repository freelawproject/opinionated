The Senate issued the subpoena in question in April 1984, in connection with its investigation of events at Cerro Maravilla. In May, the Governor told the Senate he would not comply. In August, the Senate (through its President) asked the Commonwealth\u2019s Superior Court to issue an order (under the legal authority of Puerto Rico Political Code, \u00a7 34-A, 2 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 154a) requiring the Governor to comply with the subpoena. The Commonwealth court issued the order. The Governor removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. That federal court refused the Senate\u2019s request for remand. 594 F.Supp. 1390. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The federal court stayed the Commonwealth court\u2019s compliance order pending further federal proceedings. The Senate now appeals and in the alternative asks for a writ of mandamus requiring a remand. Treating the appeal as a request for a writ, and for the reasons given below, we grant the writ of mandamus that the Senate seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The Governor sought to remove this ease to federal court under the authority of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. That provision allows removal of a case presenting \u201ca claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States . . . .\u201d The Supreme Court of the United States has made clear that, in deciding (for removal purposes) whether a case presents a federal \u201cclaim or right,\u201d a court is to ask whether the plaintiff\u2019s <em>claim to relief </em>rests upon a federal right, and the court is to look only to <em>plaintiffs complaint </em>to find the answer. <em>Gully v. First National Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 112, 57 S.Ct. 96, 97, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936) (\u201cright or immunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States must be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action\u201d); <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 2847, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983) (\u201cdefendant may not remove a case to federal court unless the <em>plaintiffs </em>complaint established that the case \u2018arises under\u2019 federal law\u201d); <em>Taylor v. Anderson, </em>234 U.S. 74, 75-76, 34 S.Ct. 724, 724, 58 L.Ed. 1218 (1914) (\u201cwhether a case is one arising under [federal] ... law ... must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration\u201d); <em>Charles D. Bonanno Linen Service, Inc. v. McCarthy, </em>708 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.) (case law requires that the \u201celements of the federal claim appear on the face of the state court complaint, without reference to other documents\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 346, 78 L.Ed.2d 312 (1983). In this instance, the Senate\u2019s state court \u201ccomplaint\u201d (a petition for enforcement) makes no reference to federal law; it bases its right to enforcement of the subpoena entirely upon the law of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, namely, Political Code \u00a7 34-A. Thus, under <em>Franchise Tax Board, Gully, Bonanno, </em>and a host of other cases, \u00a7 1441 does not authorize removal of the case to federal court. <em>(See </em>Appendix for text of the Complaint.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">The Governor makes a two-step argument in an effort to escape the authority of these cases. First, he claims that the Senate\u2019s court action involves a federal issue, namely, whether enforcement of the subpoena would violate a federal requirement that Puerto Rico\u2019s Constitution provide \u201ca republican form of government.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 731c. He recognizes, however, that this claim is insufficient, for the simple involvement of a federal issue in a case does not authorize removal if that involvement arises by way of a federal <em>defense. Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2847. Justice Cardozo pointed out in <em>Gully, </em>not only that the federal controversy \u201cmust be disclosed on the face of the complaint, unaided by the answer or petition for removal\u201d but also that not even \u201cthe complaint itself\u201d provides a basis for jurisdiction \u201cin so far as it goes beyond a statement of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and anticipates or replies to a probable <em>defense.\u201d </em>299 U.S. at 113, 57 S.Ct. at 98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>(emphasis added). And the Supreme Court recently reiterated that \u201ca federal court does not have original jurisdiction over a case in which the complaint presents a state-law cause of action, but also asserts ... that a federal <em>defense </em>the defendant may raise is not sufficient to defeat the claim.\u201d <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2846-47 (emphasis added). <em>See Taylor v. Anderson, supra </em>(federal claim must be determined from complaint \u201cunaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose\u201d). Thus, the Governor adds a second step to his argument. He says that the federal argument is so important that it (or its denial) is an inextricable part of the plaintiffs <em>affirmative </em>case. Although the district court accepted this argument, we do not find it convincing for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In the first place, a natural reading of the pleadings in this ease suggests that the \u201crepublican form of government\u201d argument is at best a defense. The plaintiff seeks a Commonwealth court \u2018subpoena enforcement\u2019 order, the right to which (it says) is granted by Commonwealth law. The defendant argues that if Commonwealth law provides such a right, it unconstitutionally conflicts with a federal statute. The defendant adds that the Senate bears the burden of disproving this federal contention. But burdens of proof are beside the point, for the simple fact is that the federal issue would not appear in the ease unless defendant chose to assert it. That fact, in this context, militates strongly in favor of calling the issue a \u2018defense\u2019 regardless of who bears whatever proof burdens may be relevant. (Compare the insanity <em>defense, </em>which a court considers only if defendant raises the matter, but which, once raised, the prosecutor has the burden of disproving. Davis <em>v. United States, </em>160 U.S. 469, 486-88, 16 S.Ct. 353, 357-58, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895).)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">In the second place, to view this defense as part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim runs counter to Supreme Court authority. We know that there are unusual cases in which a federal court will look beyond the literal words of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint, preventing him from defeating \u201cremoval by omitting to plead necessary federal questions.\u201d <em>See Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, </em>376 F.2d 337, 339-40 (6th Cir.1967), <em>aff'd, </em>390 U.S. 557, 88 S.Ct. 1235, 20 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968); <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2852. But these cases have focused on such matters as state labor law claims \u2014 brought in an area that federal labor law <em>totally occupied. </em>Thus, the Supreme Court has written that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4b\">... if a federal cause of action completely preempts a state cause of action any complaint that comes within the scope of the federal cause of action necessarily \u2018arises under\u2019 federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-12\"><em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2854. Yet, while writing these very words about labor law cases, the Supreme Court held that a state law tax-related claim to money held by a federally regulated pension fund could <em>not </em>be removed, even though the complaint itself revealed that the sole issue in the case was whether federal pension law preempted the state law on which the plaintiff rested its claim. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff (a California state tax board) asserted a claim under <em>state </em>law. While plaintiff\u2019s complaint raised the federal issue, it did so, says the court, by way of anticipating a <em>defense. Id. </em>at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2854. There is no more reason here than in <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>for viewing the \u201cfederal issue\u201d as if it formed part of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, rather than as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">In fact, <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>is a far stronger case than this one for viewing the \u201cfederal defense\u201d as if it formed part of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The federal claim here is weak on the merits. The courts have read the analogous \u201crepublican form of government\u201d clause of the federal constitution as typically raising \u2018non-justiciable\u2019 issues suitable for resolution by the political branches of government, not the courts. <em>See, e.g., In re Duncan, </em>139 U.S. 449, 11 S.Ct. 573, 35 L.Ed. 219 (1891); <em>Lu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>ther v. Borden, </em>7 How. (48 U.S.) 1, 12 L.Ed. 581 (1849). Moreover, unlike <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>the complaint here fails to reveal the existence of this federal defense. Not even the Governor\u2019s lengthy response to the Senate (attached to the Senate\u2019s Commonwealth court complaint as an appendix) mentions the federal issue; it refers only to an \u2018executive privilege\u2019 defense based upon <em>Commonwealth </em>law; and, it mentions federal eases only by way of analogy. How can one claim that federal issues permeate a complaint \u2014 or occupy the field \u2014 -when the issues are often held non-justiciable; when the complaint does not mention them; and when even the initial \u2018defense\u2019 statement rests upon Commonwealth, rather than federal, law?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Under these circumstances, to find the federal statutory issue inextricably part of plaintiff\u2019s \u2018cause of action\u2019 (rather than a defense) would work something of a jurisdictional revolution. After all, local land condemnation cases or zoning cases often involve a potential federal Compensation Clause defense; public nuisance abatement actions may encompass federal Due Process issues; local subpoena cases may involve a host of federal statutory or constitutional objections. Congress constitutionally might have allowed removal of these or many other local cases involving federal defenses, but it did not do so. <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2847 n. 9. We must respect that congressional judgment. If respondents are arguing that there is something special about Puerto Rico that makes such local cases \u2018federal\u2019 in nature, the authoritative judicial response is that of Chief Judge Magruder to an analogous argument: \u201cIt simply can\u2019t be so.\u201d <em>Figueroa v. People of Puerto Rico, </em>232 F.2d 615, 620 (1st Cir.1956) (the fact that Puerto Rico\u2019s Constitution\u2019s jury trial right was promulgated under, and subject to limitations of, federal Public Law 600, does not make the interpretation of that right a question of federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Finally, the authority on which the district court relied for its conclusion is not on point. The court cited the following language from <em>Franchise Tax Board:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Congress has given the lower federal courts jurisdiction to hear ... by removal ..., only those cases in which a well pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff\u2019s right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">463 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2856. Once one reads this language with due emphasis upon the words \u201cwell pleaded complaint,\u201d and in light of the court\u2019s prior statement in the opinion that federal <em>defenses </em>do not count, whatever appearance of support this language seems to give simply evaporates. The district court also relies upon <em>Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co., </em>255 U.S. 180, 41 S.Ct. 243, 65 L.Ed. 577 (1921). But in that case the thrust of plaintiff\u2019s claim (brought in federal court) was that defendants\u2019 proposed action was unlawful because an authorizing federal statute was unconstitutional; plaintiff\u2019s complaint revealed the federal basis for its claim on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">We conclude that the district court committed jurisdictional error in retaining this case. And, despite respondent\u2019s complex, and often heroic, arguments to the contrary, the error is a fairly obvious and serious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">We also conclude that this is an appropriate case for exercise of \u201cthe discretionary, and sparingly used, writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>In re La Providencia Development Corp., </em>406 F.2d 251, 253 (1st Cir.1969). We realize that the underlying investigation out of which this appellate proceeding arises is freighted with intense political and emotional overtones. We can make here no attempt to assess the propriety of the actions and procedures of either party. But of overarching importance, far outlasting the tempests of the present controversies, is the importance of both Commonwealth and federal courts adhering to their proper jurisdiction. Here we have found the district court to have been persuaded to misunderstand the clear meaning of the removal statute as expounded in a long line of Supreme Court (and circuit court) cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and to remove a case to federal court that did not fall within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. The analysis leading to this result, if allowed to stand, would apply equally to a host of other cases, thus needlessly interfering with Commonwealth legislative, executive, and court proceedings, and undermining basic principles of comity. Those principles suggest that such unauthorized intrusion should be speedily corrected. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the authority of the Senate to conduct the investigation at issue expires with the expiration of the session itself on December 81, 1984. Thus, even a short delay while the district court decides the merits threatens to deprive the Senate of whatever legal remedy the law may give it. This combination of jurisdictional error, upon an important matter of federal court/Commonwealth relations, with the possibility of harm through further delay, warrants issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">We have read <em>Ex parte Harding, </em>219 U.S. 363, 31 S.Ct. 324, 55 L.Ed. 252 (1911), a case that the Governor cites for the proposition that the courts of appeals cannot issue mandamus to force remand of a case wrongly removed. But, <em>Harding </em>does not hold this. The <em>Harding </em>Court found that mandamus issues only in exceptional circumstances. And this case presents exceptional circumstances. Among the factors mentioned above, we stress the need here to exercise this circuit\u2019s supervisory powers in order to maintain sound and legally correct relations between the federal courts and the Commonwealth government. <em>See In re Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, </em>695 F.2d 17, 25 (1st Cir. 1982); <em>cf. In re La Providencia Development Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We therefore conclude that the writ should issue vacating the orders entered by the district court in this case and remanding the matter forthwith to the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. While we do not believe that this order should be stayed, we withhold issuance of the writ for 48 hours after the issuance of this opinion to allow the respondent to seek a stay from the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">In deciding this case the way we have, we wish to make clear that we have made no judgment about the propriety of the procedures followed in issuing the subpoena in this case, nor do we express any view about the legal merits of the Senate\u2019s claim of right to a subpoena, or about the legal merits of a defense based on executive privilege. Our judgment here concerns only the technical legal question of the right to removal of this case to a federal court. No other matter is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We note that we have issued this opinion <em>\u201cper curiam.\u201d </em>While this form of opinion often is used to dispose of minor matters, it can also be used to reflect the fact that each judge of the panel believes the matter at issue is significant and agrees in detail with the opinion\u2019s reasoning and conclusions. We use the form here for the latter reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\n<em>A writ of mandamus shall be issued requiring the federal district court to vacate the orders in this case and to remand this case to the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">(APPENDIX: THE \u201cCOMPLAINT\u201d) TRANSLATION APPENDIX # 2a</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">SUPERIOR COURT OF PUERTO RICO SAN JUAN SECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">MIGUEL HERNANDEZ AGOSTO, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico per se and representing the Senate of Puerto Rico and the Judiciary Commission, Plaintiff, vs. Carlos Romero Bar-celo, Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">CIVIL NO.

In section 2-1, resolution No. 91 provides that once the ordered investigation is ended the Judiciary Commission must: \u201csubmit to the consideration of the Senate whatever legislation it recommends\u201d from its determination of facts and the knowledge acquired during the investigation herein ordered and that has as its objective the avoidance of any future repetition of the wrongs discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">4. On May 28, 1982, the Senate Judiciary Commission approved a \u201cRegulations for the conduct of the Senate Investigation on Cerro Maravilla\u201d.

In compliance with its charge and by virtue of the authority conferred by Law and the Regulations of the Investigation on April 27, 1984, the President of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Mr. Aponte Perez, issued a subpoena to the Honorable Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo in which it required that the Honorable Governor or his authorized representative deliver to the Commission on the 11th day of May, 1984, at 10 a.m. the information and documents therein specified. A certified copy of said subpoena duly served is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">6.

On May 14, 1984, the Senate Judiciary Commission approved a resolution to \u201crequest that the Honorable President of the Senate of Puerto Rico representing the Commission and in the name of the Senate initiate the corresponding Judicial action in accordance with Section 154A of Chapter 9 Title 2 of the Laws of Puerto Rico Annotated to require the Honorable Governor of Puerto Rico, Carlos Romero Barcelo, to deliver all of those documents and information required in Paragraphs 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 3, 3A, 4, 5, 5A, 5B, 6, 6A, 6B, 7, and 8 of the summons that was issued so that he deliver them on May 11, 1984, and whose delivery the Honorable Carlos Romero Barcelo has refused to make.\u201d A certified copy of the May 14, 1984, resolution of the Judiciary Commission is attached as Exhibit 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">9.
