In 1976 and 1977, Krodel, then a 60 year old management analyst at the BHA, applied for five separate promotions and was rejected for each. After exhausting his administrative remedies, he brought suit against the Bureau and various BHA supervisors in their official capacity, claiming that the BHA\u2019s refusal to promote him violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>He also sued various BHA officials, in their individual and official capacities, for infringing his first and fifth amendment rights. Krodel sought declaratory relief, promotion and back pay under the ADEA; he also sought damages from the individual defendants under his constitutional claim. Although the district court dismissed his constitutional claims, it found that the BHA had violated the ADEA in its refusal to promote Krodel to a Supervisory Management Analyst Position (\u201cPosition 1\u201d) in February of 1976. On appeal, the Bureau challenges the district court\u2019s age discrimination holding; Krodel challenges only its dismissal of his first amendment claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">I. The Background</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">The age discrimination claim hinges on the circumstances surrounding the BHA\u2019s selection of Mary Pronovost rather than Krodel to fill Position 1. Krodel was initially hired as a management analyst by the BHA in December of 1968; in July of 1971, he was promoted from level GS-11 to level GS-12. His eight years of experience as a management analyst and his qualifications for Position 1 are not disputed by the government. Pronovost, who was 39 years old at the time of the promotion, joined the BHA in 1973 as a GS-11 staff assistant in the BHA\u2019s Division of Facilities after serving as a confidential assistant in another section of the agency. <em>See Krodel v. Young, </em>Civ. No. 80-3183, slip op. at 5-6 (February 9, 1983) [hereinafter cited as \u201cADEA Opinion\u201d]. Pronovost had no management analyst experience whatsoever until three months before her promotion. <em>See id. </em>at 6, 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">On July 28, 1975, the BHA announced that it would consider applications for a GS-13 Supervisory Management Analyst position. Applications for the vacancy were solicited from all employees of the Department of Health and Human Services, for a period of approximately three weeks. <em>See id. </em>at 4. Krodel applied for this position, but Pronovost did not. In November of 1975, defendant Levi Ogden, the head of the relevant BHA section, decided to cancel the vacancy announcement because, in his judgment, none of the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>cants demonstrated the requisite experience in management analysis. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">While the initial applications for Position 1 were pending, Pronovost attended a three-day training course in management for government administrators. <em>See id. </em>at 6. In December, Ogden requested that Pronovost be reassigned to a GS-12 Management Analyst position in the BHA\u2019s central office; effective December 7, 1975, she was reassigned to that position without competition. <em>Id. </em>On February 11, 1976, the vacancy announcement for Position 1 was reposted. The second announcement, however, solicited only employees of the central office and remained open only until February 18th. At trial, Ogden could give no explanation for reducing the time period and the area of consideration for the second vacancy announcement. <em>See id. </em>at 7. This time, both Krodel and Pronovost applied for the promotion to Position 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The BHA\u2019s personnel office determined that seven applicants, including Krodel and Pronovost, met the minimum qualifications for Position 1 and referred those names to a rating panel comprised of defendant Hal-let Duncan and another BHA supervisor. The rating panel submitted to Ogden a \u201cbest qualified list\u201d consisting of Krodel, Pronovost and another BHA employee, then 41 years old. After reviewing the best qualified list, Ogden wrote a memorandum recommending the selection of Pro-novost. <em>See id. </em>at 13. Ogden stated that his recommendation was \u201cbased on personal observation and frequent professional contact with [Pronovost]\u201d in her position in the Division of Facilities and \u201cher outstanding performance of duties as a Management Analyst since December 1975.\u201d Memorandum to the Director of BHA (March 17,1976), Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 211a. Consistent with standard BHA practice, Ogden\u2019s recommendation was approved by defendants Robert Trachten-berg, Director of the BHA, and John Poore, Assistant Director of the BHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">After exhausting his administrative remedies, Krodel sued BHA officials for age discrimination in connection with the Bureau\u2019s failure to promote him to Position 1 and to four other positions at the BHA. He also alleged that the BHA had refused to promote him in retaliation for his critical comments about \u201cagency mismanagement, misuse of funds and human ignorance and inefficiency,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s First Amended Complaint \u00b6 53, J.A. at 34a, thereby violating his first amendment rights. Finally he claimed that the BHA\u2019s actions deprived him of a \u201cvested property interest\u201d in \u201cpromotion and managerial status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He sought promotion and back pay from defendant Andrew Young, the present director of the BHA, and Bivens-type<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> damages from the other individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Pursuant to the Bureau\u2019s motion under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court dismissed Krodel\u2019s constitutional claims at the onset of the litigation. <em>See Krodel v. Young, </em>Civ. No. 80-3183, mem. op. at 2-3 (July 9, 1981) [hereinafter cited as <em>\u201cConstitutional Opinion\u201d). </em>The court ruled that Krodel could not establish that his alleged criticisms of the BHA constituted speech protected by the first amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 2-3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>After a six-day bench trial on the age discrimination claim, the district court concluded that the BHA violated the ADEA in its decision not to promote Krodel to Position 1. Applying the tripartite evidentiary scheme developed in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), the district court ruled that the BHA\u2019s explanation of the promotion decision was unworthy of credence and a pretext for discrimination. <em>See ADEA Opinion </em>at 29. The district court also found indicia of age discrimination in the Bureau\u2019s failure to follow its own promotion policies, statistical evidence, and largely uncontested anecdotal evidence concerning BHA practices. <em>See id. </em>at 33-35. Viewing the evidence as a whole, the district court concluded that \u201cthe true reason underlying [the] promotion [to Position 1] was age discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We now affirm the district court\u2019s ADEA ruling and its dismissal of Krodel\u2019s first amendment action. Because we conclude that Krodel\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>action is barred by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), however, we need not determine whether his alleged criticisms of the BHA constitute protected speech under the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">II. The Age Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The ADEA requires federal employment decisions to \u201cbe made free from any discrimination based on age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(a); <em>cf. id. </em>\u00a7 623 (prohibiting private employers from -taking adverse action against employees \u201cbecause of\u201d their age). The BHA argues that the district court misapprehended the thrust of the ADEA and erroneously employed the age discrimination statute to second-guess government employment decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">The district court\u2019s conclusion of law reflect its belief that plaintiff, and not Ms. Pronovost, was a more appropriate person to fill Position 1. However, the ADEA is not intended as a vehicle for general review of business decisions, and does not provide a remedy for nonselection based on factors, permissible or impermissible, other than age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees at 11. We believe, however, that the relevant ADEA issues on appeal are substantially narrower. They concern whether the district court required from Krodel sufficient proof to create a reasonable inference that the Bureau was motivated by impermissible age discrimination and whether the district court\u2019s factual findings supporting the ultimate issue of age discrimination were clearly erroneous. We conclude that the district court applied the correct legal standard, imposed the appropriate burden of proof on the plaintiff, and did not make any clearly erroneous findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">A. <em>Procedure and Proof Under the ADEA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Courts have generally applied the tripartite evidentiary scheme developed in the context of Title VII litigation to suits brought under the ADEA. <em>See Coburn v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>711 F.2d 339, 342-43 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 488, 78 L.Ed.2d 683 (1983); <em>Cuddy v. Carmen, </em>694 F.2d 853, 856-57 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Johnson v. Lehman, </em>679 F.2d 918, 922 (D.C.Cir.1982). According to the guidelines originally articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>an individual plaintiff claiming disparate treatment must first make out a <em>prima facie case </em>\u2014 i.e., must demonstrate sufficient facts to create a reasonable inference that race, sex or age was a factor in the employment decision at issue. Once a <em>prima facie </em>case has been established, the employer bears a minimal burden of \u201cproducing evidence\u201d tending to show that the plaintiff was denied employment or promotion for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. If the employer does so \u2014 and if his evidence is credible \u2014 the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer\u2019s asserted legitimate reason is a \u201cpretext\u201d for discrimination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 800-02, 93 S.Ct. at 1823-24; <em>Bur-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>dine, </em>450 U.S. at 252-53, 101 S.Ct. at 1093-94; <em>Coburn, </em>711 F.2d at 342; <em>see generally Segar v. Smith, </em>738 F.2d 1249, 1297-98 (D.C.Cir.1984) (Edwards, J., concurring). In disparate treatment cases, \u201cthe ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. at 1093. Moreover, the Supreme Court has recently admonished that the relevant issue on appeal of a fully litigated discrimination suit is ordinarily whether the plaintiff has met this \u201cultimate\u201d burden, not whether one of the intermediate burdens has been met. <em>See United Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"APu3\">In an ADEA case, the plaintiff\u2019s ultimate burden is to prove that age was \u201ca determining factor\u201d in the challenged employment decision. <em>Coburn, </em>711 F.2d at 342; <em>Cuddy, </em>694 F.2d at 857. The plaintiff must prove that \u201cage made a difference in the employer\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>Cuddy, </em>694 F.2d at 857-58, in the sense that, \u201cbut for\u201d the discriminatory motive, the employee would . have been hired, promoted or retained. <em>See id. </em>at 858 &amp; n. 23. The question of discriminatory intent, moreover, is a finding of fact subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review established in Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See Pullman-Standard, Inc. v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 288, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1789, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982); <em>Aikens, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1485. The district court\u2019s ADEA ruling in this case can thus only be overturned if the court committed legal error or if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Gypsum, </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>see Coburn, </em>711 F.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">B. <em>The District Court\u2019s Application of the ADEA Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"ahs-dedup-0\">Neither party disputes the district court\u2019s ruling concerning the first two \u201cstages\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s case. The district court held that Krodel established a <em>prima facie </em>case by demonstrating (1) that he belongs to the statutorily protected age group (40-70 years), (2) that he was, by the government\u2019s own admission, qualified for the position at issue, (3) that he was not promoted and (4) that the employee eventually promoted was outside the protected class. <em>See ADEA Opinion </em>at 26-28. This ruling comports with the governing law in this circuit, <em>see Coburn, </em>711 F.2d at 342; <em>Cuddy, </em>694 at 850-57, and it creates an inference that, absent <em>any </em>evidence to the contrary, the BHA acted for discriminatory reasons. The district court also held that the defendant articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action by \u201cstating simply that the agency selected the better candidate.\u201d <em>ADEA Opinion </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">At this point, the parties were brought to the \u201cultimate question\u201d of motive: the plaintiff was required to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was merely a pretext for age discrimination. As the district court correctly stated, Krodel had to \u201cprove by a preponderance of the evidence that age made a difference in the employer\u2019s decision not to hire him.\u201d <em>ADEA Opinion </em>at 27. This appeal thus hinges on the elements required to prove that the Bureau\u2019s explanation of the challenged promotion was a pretext for discrimination. The Bureau argues that Krodel must discredit its explanation <em>and </em>provide particularized evidence of actual age discrimination in the specific employment decision at issue in order to meet this ultimate burden. Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appel-lees at 11. The district court, by contrast, concluded that Krodel could prevail by demonstrating that the Bureau\u2019s explanation was a sham and by offering additional circumstantial evidence of age discrimination in the BHA. <em>See ADEA Opinion </em>at 35-36. We conclude that the district court\u2019s approach was entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In <em>Burdine, </em>the Court indicated that a discrimination plaintiff could satisfy his or her burden of proof in one of two independent ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion. She now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination. She may succeed in this <em>either </em>directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer <em>or </em>indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095 (emphasis supplied). In <em>Aikens, </em>moreover, the Court clearly indicated that a discrimination plaintiff need not submit direct evidence of discriminatory intent. <em>See Aikens, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1481 n. 3. Noting that \u201ctrial courts should not treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1482, the Court stated that \u201cthe district court must decide which party\u2019s explanation it believes,\u201d <em>id., </em>on the basis of all the evidence before it. <em>See Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2794, 2799, 81 L.Ed.2d 718 (1984); <em>see also Int\u2019l B\u2019hd of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 358 n. 44, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866 n. 44, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (\u201cElimination of [the defendant\u2019s] reasons for the refusal to hire is sufficient, absent any other explanation, to create an inference that the decision was a discriminatory one.\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">This circuit, in turn, has not required an ADEA plaintiff to offer particularized evidence of intentional discrimination in order to prove pretext. <em>See Coburn, </em>711 F.2d at 344; <em>Cuddy, </em>694 F.2d at 859; <em>cf. Segar, </em>738 F.2d at 1302 (Edwards, J., concurring). In <em>Cuddy, </em>the court indicated that age discrimination plaintiffs almost necessarily have to rely on indirect evidence, including discrepancies in the defendant\u2019s proffered explanation, to prove that an employer was motivated by illegitimate concerns.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-14\">[W]hen weighing the evidence the District Court must keep in mind the difficulties plaintiffs face in proving ADEA violations. Employees and applicants for employment have great informational disadvantages: they cannot reach into the minds of decisionmakers, and therefore they usually can gather only circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motives. Hence, the trier of fact should take special care to require of plaintiff only that he present sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable person to draw from it the inference of the fact to be proved. Plaintiff-appellant should only have to show that age was a determining factor, as earlier defined, in the government\u2019s decision to hire someone else by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-15\"><em>Cuddy, </em>694 F.2d at 859 (citations and footnotes omitted). <em>See also Mistretta v. San-dia Corp., </em>639 F.2d 588, 597 (10th Cir. 1980). At the very least, then, <em>Burdine, Aikens </em>and <em>Cuddy </em>make clear that an ADEA plaintiff who has established a pri-ma facie case and has effectively discredited the employer\u2019s proffered justification need not, in all cases, submit additional evidence concerning the particular employment decision at issue in order to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>strate that age was a determining factor in the employer\u2019s action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">In effect, the BHA argues that the plaintiff only proved, and the district court merely concluded, that the government made a poor promotion decision \u2014 a conclusion too weak to support a finding of pretext. Yet the district court clearly relied on more than a simple challenge to the soundness of the defendant\u2019s employment decision. Instead, it found that the government\u2019s version of the selection process was a virtual sham and inferred from this conclusion and the additional circumstantial evidence before it that age was a determining factor in the decision not to promote Krodel. We conclude, then, that the district court applied the correct legal standard to Krodel\u2019s age discrimination claim. The ADEA ruling can only be overturned if the district court committed legal error in <em>considering </em>the plaintiff\u2019s circumstantial evidence of age discrimination or if it made \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d factual findings. <em>See Segar, </em>738 F.2d at 1272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">C. <em>The District Court\u2019s Factual Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Although the district court made numerous findings of fact, they can be grouped into 4 broad categories, each of which is challenged by the defendant: (1) that the Board failed to offer any credible explanation of why Pronovost, the eventual selectee for Position 1, was \u201cbetter qualified\u201d than the plaintiff, (2) that various statistics supported the charge of age discrimination, (3) that a BHA administrator had expressed a general preference for younger employees, and (4) that, as attested to by several witnesses, the BHA generally favored younger employees. We conclude that the district court properly considered this evidence and that its eventual conclusions of fact were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">1. <em>The Bureau explanation. </em>The district court found that Pronovost had been pre-selected for Position 1 in view of the fact that the original vacancy announcement was cancelled and that the subsequent vacancy announcement appeared to be tailored for Pronovost who lacked substantial supervisory experience. <em>See ADEA Opinion </em>at 32-34. The court also found that Pronovost was erroneously overrated by the screening committee \u2014 a rating that placed her on the best qualified list \u2014 and that Ogden\u2019s testimony as to her qualifications was not credible. <em>See id. </em>at 33-34. In effect, the BHA suggests that we should undertake a <em>de novo </em>review of these findings. It argues that the district court erroneously minimized Krodel\u2019s shortcomings as an employee and that the trial judge should have respected Ogden\u2019s \u201cgood-faith evaluation of the factors that led him to believe that Pronovost would make a preferable supervisor.\u201d Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees at 17. The district court, however, carefully examined Pronovost\u2019s qualifications and Ogden\u2019s stated reasons for preferring Pronovost to Krodel and concluded that Ogden\u2019s explanation was unworthy of belief. Ogden was the only witness at trial who testified as to Pronovost\u2019s qualifications \u2014 \u201ca critical witness,\u201d as the court put it. <em>ADEA Opinion </em>at 31. Yet he could not offer any specific reason as to why he recommended her on either direct or cross-examination; indeed he repeatedly stated that he did not recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Pronovost\u2019s work. The district court also noted that Ogden had testified under oath at least three times before the trial (in administrative hearings in 1978 and 1980, and in a deposition in 1982) and that on each prior occasion he admitted that he could not recall Pronovost\u2019s actual performance. <em>See id. </em>at 31-32. \u201c[D]ue regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and we cannot overturn the district court\u2019s reading of Ogden on the cold record before us. Similarly, the district court specifically noted the plaintiff\u2019s possible deficiencies as an employee, <em>see ADEA Opinion </em>at 16-17, and there is no indication that the court \u201cminimized\u201d these considerations in judging Ogden\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The BHA also persistently asserts that the district court\u2019s conclusion that the government did not adhere to its own procedures in selecting Pronovost over the plaintiff \u201cis simply insufficient in and of itself to support a finding of age discrimination.\u201d Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees at 16-17, n. 4. Regardless of whether this position is correct, <em>see supra </em>pp. 706-OS, the court\u2019s finding that Pronovost was preselected for Position 1 is undeniably relevant to the question of discriminatory intent. \u201cThe fact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications does not in itself expose him to ... liability, although this may be probative of whether the employer\u2019s reasons are pretexts for discrimination.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 259, 101 S.Ct. at 1097, <em>see also Cuddy, </em>694 F.2d at 859; <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003, 1012 n. 6 (1st Cir.1979). In this case, of course, the district court did not conclude that the government made a good-faith \u201cmistake\u201d in promoting Pronovost over Krodel; instead, it relied on the improper procedures and uncreditable testimony concerning Pronovost\u2019s promotion to conclude that the government\u2019s explanation was unworthy of belief. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding that Pronovost was preselected for Position 1 was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">2. <em>The district court\u2019s use of statistics. </em>The trial judge considered statistical evidence that the number of ADEA complaints filed against the Management Analysis Branch of the BHA significantly increased between 1974 and 1977, that the percentage of employees over 40 in that Branch decreased after 1974, and that the average age in that office was 37.5. The government offers an explanation other than age discrimination that might account for each \u201cstatistical finding.\u201d More importantly, however, the BHA argues that Kro-del\u2019s statistics cannot be probative of age discrimination because they were not adequately compared to the relevant labor pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The importance of statistical evidence in Title VII and ADEA claims varies considerably according to the type of discrimination alleged. Statistical evidence is crucial in disparate impact cases, where plaintiffs need not prove discriminatory intent but must show that specific employment practices \u201cselect applicants ... in a racial pattern significantly different from that of the pool of applicants.\u201d <em>Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 425, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2375, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975); <em>see Segar, </em>738 F.2d at 1274. In actions involving claims of <em>classwide </em>disparate treatment\u2014 so-called pattern or practice eases \u2014 plaintiffs also typically rely on statistical evidence to show that comparably qualified members of the protected group are treated differently across the board. Courts typically infer a discriminatory motive from this difference in treatment. <em>See Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 361 &amp; n. 46, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1867 &amp; n. 46, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). In these two contexts \u2014 where liability depends on a challenge to systemic employment practices\u2014 courts have required finely tuned statistical evidence, normally demanding a comparison of the employer\u2019s relevant workforce with the qualified populations in the relevant labor market. <em>See Hazelwood School District v. United States, </em>433 U.S. 299, 308 n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 2741 n. 13, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977); <em>Segar, </em>738 F.2d at 1274-75; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Davis v. Califano, </em>613 F.2d 957, 963 (D.C. Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">In <em>individual </em>disparate treatment cases, however, statistical evidence is less significant because the ultimate issue is whether the <em>particular </em>plaintiff was the victim of an illegitimately motivated employment decision. Yet statistical evidence is certainly <em>relevant </em>to a showing of pretext in disparate treatment actions. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 804-05, 93 S.Ct. at 1825-26. Although the Supreme Court has not directly addressed the precision with which an individual disparate treatment plaintiff must present statistical evidence, it has pointed out that such evidence is admissible and may be helpful, though ordinarily not dispositive. <em>See Furnco Constr. Co. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978). The Court has likewise emphasized that statistics \u201ccome in infinite variety and, like other kinds of evidence, they may be rebutted. In short, their usefulness depends on all the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Teamsters, </em>431 U.S. at 340, 97 S.Ct. at 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In the case before us, there is no indication that the district court thought the challenged statistics dispositive of, or even essential to, Krodel\u2019s claim. The trial judge explicitly considered the defendant\u2019s challenges to the meaningfulness of the statistics and concluded that they had at least some relevance to its ultimate judgment concerning discriminatory intent. \u201cAlthough the statistics presented by the plaintiff are broad and tentative,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cthe simple percentage comparisons are not so simplistic as to lack meaning.\u201d <em>ADEA Opinion </em>at 39 n. 3. In this context, a trial judge should be allowed to consider a disparate treatment plaintiff\u2019s statistics and to judge for herself their meaningfulness to the question of discriminatory intent. <em>Cf. Trout v. Lehman, </em>702 F.2d 1094, 1101 (D.C.Cir.1983) (\u201cDeficiencies in the data base may, of course, detract from the value of [statistical] evidence, but ordinarily would not obliterate its evidentiary value.\u201d), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1404, 79 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984). We thus affirm the district court\u2019s treatment of Krodel\u2019s statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">3. <em>Duncan\u2019s age-related remark. </em>The district court also credited a witness\u2019 testimony that Duncan, a Bureau supervisor and a member of the rating panel for Position 1, expressed a general preference for younger employees in the BHA. <em>See ADEA Opinion </em>at 34. The court further noted that Duncan neither admitted nor denied that he had made such a statement. The government argues that this finding of fact was \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d that Duncan in fact denied making any such statement. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant/ Cross Appellees at 14-15. As we read the record, however, Duncan did not deny making , this remark; at best he testified that he did not recall the conversation in question, but he surely left open the possibility he could have made the statement or conveyed such an impression. <em>See </em>Trial Transcript at 663, J.A. at 125a. Age-related comments are certainly probative of discriminatory motive, <em>see Mis-tretta v. Sandia Corp., </em>639 F.2d 588, 600 (10th Cir.1980), and the district court\u2019s conclusion that Duncan made such a remark amounts to a credibility judgment entitled to substantial deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">4. <em>Other anecdotal evidence. </em>Finally, the government attacks the court\u2019s consideration of other anecdotal testimony concerning age discrimination within the BHA. Anecdotal evidence of discrimination plays an important role in discrimination suits by bringing cold numbers to life. <em>See Hazelwood, </em>433 U.S. at 308-09, 97 S.Ct. at 2741-42. The trial judge,, in turn, is normally responsible for determining how much weight such evidence should be accorded. <em>Cf. Segar, </em>738 F.2d at 1278 (\u201cAll evidence that a plaintiff presents can contribute to [an inference of discrimination], and should ... be considered as cumulative.\u201d). Here, the defendants had ample opportunity to challenge the anecdotal evidence at trial, and the district court merely gave the evidence some, not dispositive, weight. The BHA cannot renew its challenges to this evidence on appeal by arguing that such testimony should be given \u201cno weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>whatsoever.\u201d <em>See Scofield v. Bolts &amp; Bolts Retail Stores, </em>21 F.E.P. 1478, 1480 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (finding age-related remarks highly probative of discriminatory intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The BHA argues that, even if these discrete factual findings were not clearly erroneous or based on legal error, the evidence as a whole cannot support the district court\u2019s finding of discriminatory intent. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees at 18; Reply Brief at 4-5. In effect, this position suggests that an appellate court can aggressively review the ultimate finding of discrimination in an ADEA claim free from the constraints of Rule 52(a), even though it is bound by the clearly erroneous rule in reviewing subsidiary factual findings. The Supreme Court has expressly rejected this distinction between \u201cultimate\u201d and \u201csubsidiary\u201d facts for the purposes of reviewing district court findings of discriminatory intent. <em>See Pullman-Standard, Inc. v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). In <em>Pullman-Standard, </em>the Court held that \u201cunder [the seniority provision of Title VII] discriminatory intent is a finding of fact to be made by the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288,102 S.Ct. at 1789. Although the Court indicated that a more aggressive review might be appropriate in other mixed questions of law and fact, <em>see id. </em>at 286-87 n. 16, 102 S.Ct. at 1788-89 n. 16, it rather clearly indicated that a finding of discriminatory intent can be overturned on appeal only if clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Here, the BHA sought to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case by arguing that Pronovost was better qualified for Position 1 than the plaintiff. On all the evidence before it, including testimony concerning suspicious procedures, the critical testimony of the recommending government official, statistical evidence, and anecdotal evidence, the district court concluded that the proffered explanation was a sham and that age was a determining factor in the government\u2019s refusal to promote the plaintiff. In the absence of legal error or clearly erroneous factual findings, the district court\u2019s choice of \u201cwhich party\u2019s explanation of the employer\u2019s motivation it believes,\u201d <em>Aikens, </em>103 S.Ct, at 1482, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">III. The First Amendment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Krodel also alleged in his complaint that the BHA refused to promote him in retaliation for his persistent criticism of the Bureau\u2019s management. As a management analyst, Krodel was responsible for analyzing and criticizing the effectiveness of the BHA\u2019s practices and procedures. <em>See Constitutional Opinion </em>at 2. The district court concluded that Krodel could not state a claim for damages under the first amendment because \u201c[performing one\u2019s job duties is not constitutionally protected speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree that Krodel\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>action under the first amendment should be dismissed, but not for the reason relied upon by the district court. Instead, we conclude that <em>Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), precludes Krodel from seeking first amendment damages from his superiors in a dispute arising out of his employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">In <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), a case decided after the district court\u2019s dismissal of Krodel\u2019s first amendment claim, the Court held that the constitutional status of public employee speech turns on whether the speech relates to \u201ca matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 103 S.Ct. at 1690. Measured against this standard, Krodel\u2019s criticisms of BHA management could <em>conceivably </em>state a claim under the first amendment irrespective of his responsibilities as a management analyst. <em>See, e.g., McKinley v. City of Eloy, </em>705 F.2d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.1983). In any event, the <em>Con-nick </em>Court clearly indicated that the relevant first amendment inquiry must be \u201cdetermined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>48, 103 S.Ct. at 1690-91; <em>see also Murray v. Gardner, </em>741 F.2d 434, 438 (D.C.Cir. 1984) (noting that a public employee\u2019s first amendment claim \u201cdepends on careful scrutiny of the facts surrounding the employee\u2019s declaration\u201d). Because the constitutional status of public employee speech turns on this fact-specific, case-by-case consideration of the relevant context, it would normally be quite difficult to resolve an employee\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. For the purpose of such a motion, the factual allegations of the complaint must be taken as true, and any ambiguity concerning the sufficiency of claim resolved in favor of the pleader. <em>See, e.g., Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); <em>Sinclair v. Kleindienst, </em>711 F.2d 291, 293 (D.C.Cir. 1983). Krodel, in turn, expressly alleges that the BHA retaliated against him for speaking out on matters of public concern. <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s First Amended Complaint \u00b6 53, J.A. at 34a.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We need not, however, determine whether Krodel has alleged constitutionally protected speech because we conclude that his <em>Bivens </em>claim is precluded by <em>Bush. </em>In <em>Bush, </em>the Court declined to allow a career employee of the competitive civil service to bring a damage action under the first amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 2406. In particular, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">Because such claims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States, we conclude that it would be inappropriate for us to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\"><em>Id. </em>As a member of the pre-Civil Service Reform Act competitive civil service, Krodel enjoyed meaningful remedies against the government for a free speech related claim arising out of his employment relationship.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In particular, Krodel could have processed his complaint inside the agency, <em>see </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.108 (1977), and could have obtained direct judicial review of an adverse agency ruling under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. <em>See Carducci v. Regan, </em>714 F.2d 171, 174 n. 1 (D.C.Cir.1982) (collecting cases); <em>see also Porter v. Califano, </em>592 F.2d 770 (5th Cir. 1979). In fact, however, Krodel never raised his first amendment related complaints in any of the five separate grievances he filed at the agency level. His free speech claim is decidedly an afterthought and subsidiary to the age discrimination claim upon which he has prevailed. <em>Cf. Constitutional Opinion </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Krodel himself concedes that \u201c[i]f <em>Bush </em>were the principal relevant case this Court should be inclined to affirm the district court ... on the grounds that there was a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 scheme of civil service remedies both available and used.\u201d Brief for the Appellees/Cross Appellants at 25. Krodel argues, however, that <em>Bush </em>can be distinguished because his criticisms concerned public waste and were therefore in the public interest. This argument was squarely rejected in <em>Bush </em>itself. <em>See Bush, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2417. Because Krodel enjoyed a comprehensive statutory forum for his free speech claims, we conclude that he cannot bring a <em>Bivens </em>action against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>supervisors for infringing his first amendment rights in a dispute arising out of his employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that the, BHA violated the ADEA and its dismissal of Krodel\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">\n<em>Affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\">. Although Krodel originally appealed the district court\u2019s ruling on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees for representation in prior administrative proceedings, he has now conceded that the issue is not properly before the court at this time. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee/Cross-Appellant at 35; <em>see also Krodel v. Young, </em>576 F.Supp. 390 (D.D.C.1983) (awarding fees).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. <em>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Fed.

Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980) (same under the eighth amendment); <em>Davis v.

The district court also interpreted Krodel\u2019s complaint to allege that the BHA had retaliated against him for filing prior age discrimination complaints. <em>See Constitutional Opinion </em>at 2-3. The court concluded that the ADEA provided him with an adequate and exclusive remedy for all such claims. <em>See id. </em>at 3. Finally, the district court held that Krodel had no property interest in being promoted, <em>id. </em>at 3 n. 1, and that the ADEA constituted an exclusive remedy for any other claims that the BHA denied him due process in its promotion decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Krodel does not challenge these rulings on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">. In his <em>Aikens </em>concurrence, Justice Blackmun expressly reaffirmed a discrimination plaintiffs ability to meet his or her ultimate burden by discrediting the employer\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">Th[e] ultimate burden may be met in one of two ways. First, as the Court notes, a plaintiff may persuade the court that the employment decision more likely than not was motivated by a discriminatory reason____ In addition, however, this burden is also carried if the plaintiff shows \"that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d while the Court is correct that the ultimate determination of factual liability in discrimination cases should be no different from that in other types of civil suits, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework requires that a plaintiff prevail when at the third stage of a Title VII trial he demonstrates that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason given by the employer is in fact not the true reason for the employment decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-17\"><em>Aikens, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1483 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">. In <em>Burdine, </em>the Court also suggested that a plaintiff need not always come forward with any additional evidence after discrediting the defendant\u2019s proffered justifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">A satisfactory explanation by the defendant destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination arising from the plaintiff's initial evidence. Nonetheless, this evidence and inferences properly drawn therefrom may be considered by the trier of fact on the issue of whether the defendant's explanation is pretex-tual. Indeed, there may be some cases where the plaintiffs initial evidence, combined with effective cross-examination of the defendant, will suffice to discredit the defendant's explanation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-12\"><em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255 n. 10, 101 S.Ct. at 1095 n. 10; <em>see Segar, </em>738 F.2d at 1269. In this case, of course, Krodel offered additional evidence of age discrimination within the BHA. <em>See infra </em>pp. 708-11. We are thus not squarely presented with the question of whether a discrimination plaintiff can prevail solely on the strength of his or her <em>prima facie </em>case coupled with an effective rebuttal of the employer\u2019s explanation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">. Both Krodel and the plaintiff in <em>Bush </em>were covered by the collection of statutes, executive orders and regulations that preceded the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.). <em>See Bush, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2416. As a member of the pre-CSRA <em>competitive </em>civil service, Krodel was thus in a different position than the appellants in <em>Borrell v. United States International Communications Agency, </em>682 F.2d 981 (D.C.Cir.1982), and <em>Williams v. IRS, </em>745 F.2d 702 (D.C.Cir.1984), who were governed by the CSRA. Those employees could not seek direct judicial review of a prohibited personel practice not amounting to an adverse action; instead, their only statutory remedy was an essentially discretionary and unreviewable petition to the Office of the Special Counsel. <em>See Williams, </em>at 704-05.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
