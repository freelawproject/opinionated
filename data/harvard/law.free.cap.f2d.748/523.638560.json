Watt, </em>D.Nev., 1983, 575 F.Supp. 467 <em>(Carson-Truckee III). </em>The Tribe appeals, arguing that the court applied the wrong legal test to determine whether an award of attorney fees was \u201cappropriate.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">I. FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The underlying suit is one of many, over the years, involving water rights in the Truckee river area of California and Nevada. The Water District, Sierra Pacific Power Company, and the State of Nevada sued officials of the Department of the Interior, seeking to force sale of water impounded behind the Stampede Dam on the Little Truckee River under the Washoe Project Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 614. Interior has used the water primarily to reestablish in Pyramid Lake two species of fish \u2014 the cui-ui fish, an endangered species, and the Lahontan cutthroat trout, a threatened species \u2014 whose survival other diversions of water from the Truckee system has imperiled. The Tribe, opposing the sale of water for municipal and industrial use in the Reno-Sparks area, intervened as a defendant in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In the first phase of the case, the district court rejected several of the Tribe\u2019s defenses, holding that Interior must sell the Water District whatever Stampede Dam water was not needed to fulfill trust obligations to the Tribe and to protect the fish. <em>Carson-Truckee Water Conservancy District v. Watt, </em>D.Nev., 1982, 537 F.Supp. 106 <em>(Carson-Truckee I). </em>In the second phase, the district court held that, under the Endangered Species Act, Interior must give species conservation priority over other purposes of Stampede Dam until the fish are no longer threatened. <em>Carson-Truckee Water Conservancy District v. Watt, </em>D.Nev., 1982, 549 F.Supp. 704 <em>(Carson-Truckee II). </em>The district court also held that because the Endangered Species Act requirements controlled the outcome, Interior\u2019s trust obligations to the Tribe were not ripe for decision. <em>Id. </em>at 713. We recently reviewed these decisions on the merits. <em>Carson-Truckee Water Conservancy District v. Clark, </em>9 Cir., 1984, 741 F.2d 257 <em>(Carson-Truckee IV).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Meanwhile, the district court granted the Tribe\u2019s motion for costs, expert witness fees, and attorney fees for services related to the issues under the Endangered Species Act. Upon receiving the Tribe\u2019s application, however, the district court became concerned about whether an award of attorney fees, particularly the amount requested, was appropriate under the facts of the case. After hearing fresh argument, the district court concluded that an award of attorney fees to the Tribe in any amount was inappropriate. The Tribe appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">II. MERITS.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">A. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">The Tribe argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in denying attorney fees to the Tribe. Such questions of law are freely reviewable on appeal. <em>Societe de Conditionnement v. Hunter Engineering Co., Inc., </em>9 Cir., 1981, 655 F.2d 938, 941; <em>Miller v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 1978, 587 F.2d 991, 994. However, if the district court applied the correct legal standard, we review attorney fees awards under the Endangered Species Act for abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. United States v. First Nat. Bank of Circle, </em>9 Cir., 1984, 732 F.2d 1444, 1446.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">B. <em>The Statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">The citizen suit provisions of the Endangered Species Act authorize attorney fees awards when \u201cappropriate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">The court, in issuing any final order in any suit brought pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any party, <em>whenever the court determines such an award is appropriate.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540(g)(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">C. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">The district court first stated the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>[T]o obtain such an award, I believe it is imperative that the Tribe show that the litigation involved important, complex or novel issues, that the case aided in interpreting the Act, and that the Tribe\u2019s efforts substantially contributed to the goals of the ESA. \u201c[T]he dominant consideration is whether litigation by that party has served the public interest by assisting the interpretation and implementation\u201d of the statute. <em>Alabama Power Company v. Gorsuch, </em>672 F.2d 1, 3 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>see also Sierra Club v. Gorsuch, </em>672 F.2d 33 (D.C.Cir.1982) and <em>Environmental Defense Fund v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>672 F.2d 42 (D.C.Cir.1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">575 F.Supp. at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">D. <em>The Tribe\u2019s Argument.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The Tribe offers a two-step argument. It argues, first, that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia devised a dual standard of \u201cappropriateness\u201d for statutes such as \u00a7 1540(g)(4), depending on whether the requesting party prevailed on the merits, and that in our ease the district court erroneously applied the non-prevailing party standard. It argues, second, that in a decision announced three months before the district court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court held that non-prevailing parties are not eligible for attorney fees awards. <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>1983, 462 U.S. 680, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983). Thus, says the Tribe, the Court abolished the non-prevailing party standard that the district court erroneously relied on. We think, however, that both steps of the argument are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">First, the D.C. Circuit cases, <em>Alabama Power, Sierra Club, </em>and <em>Environmental Defense Fund, supra; see also Village of Kaktovik v. Watt, </em>D.C.Cir., 1982, 689 F.2d 222, 224-25, set forth no dual standard. These decisions held that, under the \u201cwhen appropriate\u201d standard (of the attorney fees provision of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(f)), and similar provisions specifically including the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540(g)(4), courts could award attorney fees to non-prevailing parties as well as to prevailing parties. <em>See Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, supra, </em>462 U.S. 680,-n. 1,103 S.Ct. 3274, 3276 n. 1, 77 L.Ed.2d 938; <em>Kaktovik, </em>689 F.2d at 224 &amp; n. 14. These cases articulated <em>\u201cone </em>standard for appropriateness, and that standard allows courts to award attorneys\u2019 fees to parties who have \u2018substantially contributed\u2019 to the goals of the ... Act.\u201d <em>Sierra Club, </em>672 F.2d at 42 n. 10 (emphasis in the original). <em>See also id. </em>at 36: \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether the litigation\u2014 successful or not \u2014 furthered the goals of the Act.\u201d The cases \u201cmade clear that whether the party claiming costs or fees has prevailed does not control the inquiry on appropriateness, and that the dominant consideration is whether litigation by the party has served the public interest by assisting the interpretation or implementation of the ... Act.\u201d <em>Alabama Power, </em>672 F.2d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Although these cases involved non-prevailing parties, they noted that \u201ceven a prevailing or substantially prevailing party who does not substantially contribute to the goals of the ... Act may not be entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Sierra Club, </em>672 F.2d at 38 n. 8. \u201cAlthough a complainant may have substantially prevailed in an action, the award of costs and attorney fees does not automatically follow. There are other factors which the court should consider in determining the appropriateness of an award of costs and attorney fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39 n. 8, quoting <em>Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, </em>D.C. Cir., 1977, 553 F.2d 1360, 1365. <em>See also Roosevelt Campobello Intern. Park Comm. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>1 Cir., 1983, 711 F.2d 431, 439-41 &amp; n. 15 (awarding fees for prevailing issues proportional to the extent of the party\u2019s contribution to the development of the issues, but not for non-prevailing issues, while noting that \u201csuccess is, of course, not the only criterion\u201d); <em>Kaktovik, supra, </em>689 F.2d at 228 &amp; n. 44 (\u201cwhile prevailing vel non is not to be a conclusive factor, it may be a relevant consideration\u201d in determining whether a party\u2019s contribution is substantial); <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Costle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>5 Cir., 1982, 683 F.2d 941, 943 (awarding fees to the prevailing party not automatically, but because result of suit will aid in the proper implementation and interpretation of the statute). We reject the Tribe\u2019s first argument, that the district court chose the wrong one of two standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">As a second step, the Tribe argues that <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>in reversing the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Sierra Club </em>that non-prevailing parties are eligible for attorney fees, also eliminated the \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d standard for non-prevailing parties. The Tribe argues that the test of \u201cappropriateness\u201d under <em>Ruckelshaus </em>is simply whether the claimant achieved \u201csome degree of success on the merits.\u201d <em>See Ruckelshaus, </em>462 U.S. at -, 103 S.Ct. at 3281. Because the Tribe had some degree of success on the merits, it argues, it is entitled to an award of attorney fees as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\"><em>Ruckelshaus </em>decided that it is not \u201cappropriate\u201d to award attorney fees to a party that achieved no success on the merits of its claims. 462 U.S. at -, 103 S.Ct. at 3276; <em>see Northern Plains Resource Council v. EPA, </em>9 Cir., 1984, 734 F.2d 408. The Court held that Congress intended the \u201cwhen appropriate\u201d standard to permit awards to partially as well as fully prevailing parties. The Tribe invalidly infers from this holding that all parties who achieve some degree of success on the merits are not only eligible for, but are entitled to attorney fees. But <em>Ruckelshaus </em>dealt only with eligibility for, not with entitlement to, a statutory award. <em>See </em>462 U.S. at -, n. 11, 103 S.Ct. at 3279-80, n. 11 (distinguishing permissive and mandatory statutory language); <em>Sierra Club, </em>672 F.2d at 38 n. 8 (distinguishing issues of eligibility and entitlement). Nothing in <em>Ruckel-shaus </em>suggests that the Court meant to reject the rule that, under the \u201cwhen appropriate\u201d standard, an eligible party must make a substantial contribution to the goals of a statute to be entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">The Tribe further argues that the proper standard for awarding attorney fees to prevailing parties is the standard adopted under the attorney fees provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000a-3(b), 2000e-5(k), and the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. But while the D.C. Circuit cases involve attorney fees provisions that are \u201cidentical\u201d to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540(g)(4), <em>Ruckelshaus, supra, </em>462 U.S. at -, n. 1, 103 S.Ct. at 3276 n. 1, the Civil Rights statutes involve the different \u201cprevailing party\u201d statutory standard, under which a prevailing plaintiff \u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fees unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust,\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>1968, 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263; but a prevailing <em>defendant </em>may get attorney fees only if the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous; meritless, or groundless, <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>1980, 449 U.S. 5, 14-15, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178-79. <em>See Ruckelshaus, </em>462 U.S. at---, 103 S.Ct. at 3278-79. Because <em>Ruckelshaus </em>did not disapprove the D.C. Circuit standard for \u201cwhen appropriate\u201d statutes, but only its application to non-prevailing parties, the district court stated the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">E. <em>Application of the Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">The district court stated its reasons for concluding that the Tribe\u2019s participation in this action did not substantially contribute to the goals of the Endangered Species Act. The issue under the Act was relatively narrow; the government had raised the issue before the Tribe intervened, and had energetically litigated the issue; and the Tribe raised defenses that were inconsistent with assisting in the interpretation or implementation of the Act. <em>Carson-Truckee III, </em>575 F.Supp. at 469-70. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-18\">F. <em>Posture of the Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">The attorney fees statute authorizes awards \u201cin any suit brought pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540(g)(4). Paragraph (1) provides that \u201cany citizen may commence a civil suit\u201d against any person or governmental entity that violates the Act, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>against Interior to compel enforcement of the Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1540(g)(1). The Water District had argued that because this is not literally such a suit, the attorney fees provision does not apply. <em>See Roosevelt Cam-pobello, </em>711 F.2d at 440 (raising but not resolving this question). While indicating that it disagreed with the Water District\u2019s argument, the district court declined to decide the issue because it had concluded that an award was not appropriate. 575 F.Supp. at 470. We, too, decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
