We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">The facts are set forth in <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 254 S.E.2d 116 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Mason assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-9\">1. The District Court erred in rejecting Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s refusal to order an independent psychiatric examination violated Appellant\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-10\">2. The District Court erred in rejecting Appellant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at and in connection with the penalty phase of his capital murder trial, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-11\">3. The District Court erred in rejecting Appellant\u2019s Counts I and II concerning the facial and systemic unconstitutionality of the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">Mason\u2019s first assignment of error is foreclosed by <em>Smith v. Baldi, </em>344 U.S. 561, 73 S.Ct. 391, 97 L.Ed. 549 (1953) and <em>Satterfield v. Zahradnick, </em>572 F.2d 443 (4th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">Mason\u2019s second assignment of error must be rejected on the basis of the court\u2019s findings of fact in the state habeas corpus proceedings. After a plenary hearing, the state court found that Mason\u2019s counsel were not ineffective at the penalty phase of the trial. Mason has not established that the state proceedings suffered any of the defects enumerated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Consequently, we must accept the state court\u2019s findings. <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">Furthermore, the state habeas court ordered an examination to determine whether at the time of the offense Mason was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance, or whether his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired. The scope of the examination was intended to elicit information about the mitigating factors set forth in Va. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4 pertaining to a defendant\u2019s mental condition. Upon receiving the report of the examination, the state habeas court found no mitigating abnormalities. It also found that Mason was not prejudiced by any omission of trial counsel. These findings must be accepted by us pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The absence of prejudice is an additional ground for affirmance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">The claims raised in the third assignment of error are barred because of Mason\u2019s procedural default. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). We note that the statutes have been held constitutional. <em>Briley v. Bass, </em>742 F.2d 155 (4th Cir.1984), <em>aff'g </em>584 F.Supp. 807, 838-43 (E.D.Va.1984); <em>Wage v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 251 S.E.2d 202 (1979); <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 248 S.E.2d 135 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">A certificate of probable cause is granted. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. The motion for a stay is denied. <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983). The clerk is directed to issue the mandate forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">The petition for rehearing and for rehearing en banc filed by Morris Odell Mason presents two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-22\">I. In rejecting appellant\u2019s claim that he was denied his right to the appointment of an independent psychiatric expert to assist counsel in the preparation of evidence in mitigation of sentence, the panel failed to address an apparent conflict with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>court\u2019s decision in <em>Williams v. Martin.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\">II. In rejecting Mason\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, the panel improperly relied upon state court \u201cFindings of Fact,\u201d and overlooked an important aspect of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strickland v. Washington.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">With respect to the first issue, the court perceives no conflict with <em>Williams v. Martin, </em>618 F.2d 1021 (4th Cir.1980), which dealt with the appointment of a pathologist for which the South Carolina statute made provision. In contrast, Virginia law made no provision for appointment of a psychiatrist to assist the defendant. <em>See Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 254 S.E.2d 116 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\"><em>Smith v. Baldi, </em>344 U.S. 561, 568, 73 S.Ct. 391, 394, 97 L.Ed. 549 (1953), holds that a state is not under a constitutional mandate to provide the defendant a psychiatrist. The court deems <em>Smith v. Baldi </em>to be controlling precedent to which it must adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Elaborating on the second issue in his petition for rehearing, Mason emphasizes that \u201cboth the performance and the prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>104 S.Ct. 2052, 2070 (1984). Putting aside, for the purpose of addressing the petition for rehearing, the question of the performance of Mason\u2019s counsel at sentencing, we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that Mason had not established prejudice. As the opinion points out, the psychiatric examination ordered by the state habeas court established that Mason suffered no mitigating abnormalities. The findings and conclusions of the state habeas court and the district court satisfy the standards for determining prejudice set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The petition for rehearing is denied. No member of the court has requested a poll on the request for rehearing en banc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
