In <em>Delgado, </em>\u201cthe INS agents' conduct ... consisted simply of questioning employees and arresting those they had probable cause to believe were unlawfully present in the factory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, in addition to questioning Ben-itez-Mendez about his immigration status, the Border Patrol officer placed him in a Border Patrol vehicle before the officer had reasonable suspicion, let alone probable cause, to believe that Ben-itez-Mendez was illegally in the country. Such conduct amounts to a seizure under <em>Anderson </em>and warrants application of the <em>Sureck </em>\u201carticulable facts/reasonable suspicion\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-26\">Slip op. at 2699, second column, 707 F.2d at 1109, first column:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-27\">Insert the call for the following footnote # 2 after \u201c \u2018he had a person there who claimed to be legal status; however, his papers was [sic] in his vehicle.\u2019 \u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-29\">2 Petitioner had not yet violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(e), requiring an alien to \u201cat all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him ____\u201d Since petitioner stated that his papers were in his car, parked adjacent to the field, the officers should have afforded him the opportunity to produce the papers.

It was reasonable for petitioner to leave the papers in his car while he engaged in heavy agricultural labor. Only if the petitioner refused to produce the papers, or was unable to produce valid papers, would he have committed a misdemeanor under \u00a7 1304(e), giving the INS officers probable cause to arrest him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Delete the paragraph at headnote #4 beginning with \u201cBecause petitioner\u2019s arrest violated the Fourth Amendment ...\u201d and substitute the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cWe granted rehearing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>INS v.

Accordingly, even though we have found that petitioner\u2019s arrest violated the Fourth Amendment, the information obtained as the result of the arrest (petitioner\u2019s statements on Form 1-213) was admissible at his deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">On the basis of this evidence, we affirm the immigration judge\u2019s order of deportation. To enable petitioner to seek any available alternative forms of relief and to move for a stay of deportation, our mandate shall issue forty-five days from the date of entry of this judgment. We also reinstate the immigration judge\u2019s grant of 30 days voluntary departure time, to commence on the effective date of any order of deportation issued against petitioner.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
