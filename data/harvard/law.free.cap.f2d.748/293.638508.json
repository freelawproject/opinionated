Because we question whether the Secretary\u2019s decision was informed by the proper legal standard, we vacate the order of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-21\">The claimant, Barbara Davis, is fifty-eight years old. She has a high school education plus one year of business school. She suffers from coronary artery disease with status post bypass graft times four, adult onset diabetes mellitus, mild vascular labyrinthitis, obesity, borderline hypertension, dizziness from Meniere\u2019s disease, and depression, together with pain and discomfort attendant to the above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her complaints also include weakness and pain in her back, hip, and legs, ringing in her ears, blurred vision, and chest pains that are not necessarily brought on by exertion. She last worked in October of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-22\">Davis filed an application for a period of disability, disability insurance benefits, and supplemental security income on May 21, 1980, due to heart disease, diabetes, and hardening of the arteries, claiming a disability onset date of October 9, 1979.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The application was denied initially and upon reconsideration by the Social Security Administration. On January 1, 1981, Davis requested a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The medical evidence received at the hearing included the hospital and clinic records covering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>her visits prior to bypass surgery, the surgery itself, and her subsequent recovery. A vocational expert testified at the hearing as did Davis herself. Following the hearing, the AU arranged for physical and mental consultative examinations. On October 26,1982, after considering the results of these examinations and the evidence adduced at the hearing, the AU issued a decision, concluding that Davis was not entitled to a period of disability and disability insurance benefits or to supplemental social security income.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The AU found that Davis met the special earnings requirements as of the alleged disability date and will continue to meet them at least through December 1984. The AU listed Davis\u2019 medically determinable impairments, describing them to be of \u201ca mild to moderate degree and nature\u201d and indicating that the impairments prohibited Davis from performing other than light work. The AU found that Davis\u2019 \u201cmedical condition does not significantly limit her ability to perform the basic work-related functions of sedentary to light work after July 1980, and [she] has the residual functional capacity necessary for such work,\u201d concluding that \u201c[t]his is not such a \u2018severe\u2019 limitation within the meaning of the Social Security Regulations, specifically Section 404.1520(c) or 416.920(c) as to constitute disability, since claimant\u2019s ability to perform such basic work-related activities is not significantly impaired.\u201d Record Vol. II at 15. The AU found that Davis\u2019 past relevant work included light unskilled work as a maid and as a nutritional aide and light to medium semi-skilled work as a supervisor of motel laundry operations. He indicated that Davis retained skills from her previous semi-skilled job that are transferable to other semi-skilled jobs and that Davis\u2019 ability to perform work-related functions is not significantly affected by her nonexertional impairment of depression. Considering Davis\u2019 maximum sustained work capacity, age, education, and work experience in the light of the medical-vocational guidelines outlined in Appendix 2 of 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P (1983), the AU determined that Davis was \u201cnot disabled.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He concluded that Davis \u201cfailed to establish that her impairments ... prevented her from engaging in former work or any sedentary or sedentary to light substantial gainful semi-skilled activities for any continuous 12-month period beginning on October 9, 1979, through the date of this decision and was not under a \u2018disability\u2019 within the meaning of that term under the Social Security Act, as amended.\u201d Record Vol. II at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The Appeals Council declined review of the AU\u2019s decision, which then became the \u25a0final decision of the Secretary. Davis instituted the instant action in the United States District Court for th\u00e9 Eastern District of Texas to obtain review of the Secretary\u2019s decision pursuant to \u2022 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Finding substantial evidence in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s decision, the district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment and affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision. Davis appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">On appeal, Davis contends that (1) the Secretary\u2019s decision that Davis retains the ability to perform work-related functions is not supported by substantial evidence since a finding of disability is mandated in her case under the listed impairments of Appendix l,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) the Secretary\u2019s application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the residual functional capacity provisions <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was improper since her condition is severe enough to establish a disabling condition on medical evidence alone, and (3) the case should be remanded because the AU failed to obtain a psychological examination as recommended in the psychiatric consultative report and he failed to obtain other medical testing that would aid in determining whether Davis was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We have recently had occasion to reexamine the proper legal standard to be applied in determining whether an ailment constitutes a severe impairment. <em>Estran v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 340, 340-42 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>see also Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Chico v. Schweiker, </em>710 F.2d 947 (2d Cir.1983). We determined that the prevailing definition of a \u201cnon-severe impairment\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> must be read in the light of the Secretary's 1968 regulations defining severe impairment because \u201cthe new terminology was intended solely to clarify, not to change, the definition of \u2018severe impairment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estran, </em>745 F.2d at 340. The 1968 regulations defined a non-severe impairment as \u201ca slight neurosis, slight impairment of sight or hearing, or other slight abnormality or combination of abnormalities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1502(a) (1968). This continues to be the standard in determining whether a claimant\u2019s impairment is severe. \u201c[A]n impairment can be considered as not severe only if it is a slight abnormality which has such minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education or work experience.\u201d <em>Estran, </em>745 F.2d at 341 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>724 F.2d at 920).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Our review of the AU\u2019s determination that Davis\u2019 impairments were not severe under the existing regulations causes us to question whether his determination was informed by the 1968 standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also question whether the district court\u2019s review of the AU\u2019s determination was informed by the 1968 standard. If, in making his decision, the AU was guided by the existing regulations without considering the 1968 standard then his decision constitutes the application of the wrong standard in determining whether Davis\u2019 impairments were severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">After determining that Davis\u2019 impairments were not severe, the AU went on to examine her ability to perform past relevant work or other work in the national economy commensurate with her maximum sustained work capacity, age, education, and work experience. We question why the AU continued his analysis. We note that the Secretary follows a sequential pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>cess in evaluating whether a claimant is disabled and that a finding that a claimant is disabled or not disabled at any point in the review pretermits further review. <em>Barajas v. Heckler, </em>738 F.2d 641, 643 (5th Cir.1984) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)). Having determined that Davis\u2019 impairments were not severe, albeit under what might have been the wrong legal standard, the ALJ presumably need not have considered whether Davis was capable of performing other types of work. <em>See id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We vacate the order of the district court affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision and remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand the ease to the Secretary for explicit consideration of the facts in the light of the proper standard after considering such further evidence as may be offered by either Davis or the Secretary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-16\">. This is the list of Davis' medically .determinable impairments found by the administrative law judge. Record Vol. II at 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-17\">. Davis had previously filed an application for disability benefits and supplemental security income on November 30, 1979, which had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-23\">Because the relevant law and regulations governing a claim for disability benefits are identical to those governing a claim for supplemental income benefits, we treat the two claims together. <em>See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.901 <em>et seq. </em>(1983); <em>Rivers v. Schweiker, </em>684 F.2d 1144, 1146 n. 1 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. The ALJ made specific reference to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1569, 416.969 and 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, \u00a7\u00a7 201.07, 201.15, 202.07, 202.15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 (1983). Appendix 1 is a listing of certain severe impairments that constitute automatic approval of the disability claim without considering the claimant\u2019s age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). One does not inquire whether a claimant has an impairment that meets or equals those listed in Appendix 1 until it has been determined that the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful activity and has a severe impairment. Substantial gainful activity is defined as \"work that (a) [\u00a1Involves doing significant and productive physical or mental duties; and (b) [i]s done (or intended) for pay or profit.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1510; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 404.1572. There is no dispute that Davis was not engaged in substantial gainful activity as of her alleged onset-of-disability date. Hence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>initial inquiry is whether Davis\u2019 impairments are severe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">. Residual functional capacity is a medical assessment of the particular types of work a claimant may be able to do despite her impairments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a); <em>Rivers, </em>684 F.2d at 1159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.921(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">(a) <em>Non-severe impairment: </em>An impairment is not severe if it does not significantly limit your physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\">. The ALJ\u2019s decision conformed to the language of sections 404.1520(c) and 416.920(c) in finding that Davis\u2019 ability to perform \"basic work-related activities is not significantly impaired.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">(c) <em>You must have a severe impairment. </em>If you do not have any impairment(s) which significantly limits your physical or mental ability to do <em>basic work activities, </em>we will find that you do not have a severe impairment and are, therefore, not disabled. We will not consider your age, education, and work experience. However, it is possible for you to have a period of disability for a time in the past even though you do not now have a severe impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">(Emphasis added.) The language of section 416.920(c) is nearly identical. Sections 404.-1520(c) and 416.920(c) must be read with \u00a7 416.921(a), which sets out the definition of a \"non-severe impairment\u201d as one that does not \"significantly limit [a person\u2019s] physical or mental abilities to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 3; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.921(b) (defining \"basic work activities\u201d). In making a determination as to the severity of a claimant\u2019s impairments, these regulations must be read in the light of the 1968 regulations. <em>Estran, </em>745 F.2d at 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b367-16\">. On remand, the Secretary should evaluate Davis\u2019 contention that there is a need for further medical and psychiatric testing before an accurate determination as to disability can be made. Davis argues that it was reversible error for the ALJ not to obtain a complete psychological examination when a psychiatrist, in his consultative report, suggested that further \u201d[p]sychological testing might prove of some value in determining whether or not she has any organic brain deterioration.\u201d Record Vol. II at 279. Davis also argues that the ALJ should have ordered' additional medical testing to determine the existence and extent of Meniere\u2019s syndrome and vascular labyrinthitis. We do not offer any views as to whether such testing is warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
