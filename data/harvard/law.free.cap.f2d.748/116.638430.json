Briggs cross-appeals from Judge Miner\u2019s denial of his motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">In 1981, Maglione was a student at the Northwood School, a private school in Lake Placid, New York. On May 29, students from that school were involved in an altercation with some local youths. Following the incident a felony complaint was brought against Maglione charging that he had stabbed one of the Lake Placid youths with a pocket knife during the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">Briggs, an Assistant District Attorney for Essex County, undertook plea bargaining negotiations with Maglione\u2019s counsel. Briggs offered to permit Maglione to plead guilty to a misdemeanor but Maglione declined the offer. Thereafter the Essex County District Attorney\u2019s Office presented the case to a grand jury, which returned a no bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-19\">On April 14, 1983, Maglione filed his complaint in the instant action. The five-paragraph complaint alleged that Briggs \u201cwas in charge of the investigation and involved in the Grand Jury presentation\u201d of Maglione\u2019s case, and that Briggs had acted in bad faith throughout. The complaint alleged violations of Maglione\u2019s civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and sought compensatory and exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">Briggs moved for summary judgment and for attorney\u2019s fees. After submission of affidavits and oral argument, Judge Miner granted the motion for summary judgment but denied the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Maglione appealed the grant of summary judgment and Briggs cross-appealed the denial of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Maglione argues that summary judgment was improper because there was an issue of fact relevant to whether Briggs\u2019 actions were covered by the absolute immunity recognized by <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976), or only by a qualified immunity. <em>See also Taylor v. Kavanagh, </em>640 F.2d 450 (2d Cir.1981) (absolute immunity applies to all \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d activities). However, the only factual dispute Maglione points to is whether Briggs was involved in presenting the case to the grand jury. While this fact may be in dispute, it is clearly not material under <em>Imbler. </em>The presentation of a case to a grand jury falls squarely within the prosecutor\u2019s traditional function and is thus subject to absolute immunity under <em>Imbler. See Powers v. Coe, </em>728 F.2d 97, 104 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The complaint also alleged that Briggs was \u201cin charge of the investigation\u201d of the felony charge, suggesting that he was performing investigatory functions apart from the grand jury inquiry. If there were facts to support this conclusory description of Briggs\u2019 role, the case might fall within the narrow area that <em>Imbler </em>left unresolved, <em>see </em>424 U.S. at 430, 96 S.Ct. at 995; <em>Taylor, </em>640 F.2d at 452. However, Maglione has not specified any facts or circumstances to support this claim. When Judge Miner repeatedly asked counsel to describe Briggs\u2019 actions, counsel for Maglione merely replied that Briggs had acted in bad faith. Since it is Briggs\u2019 conduct rather than his state of mind that is in issue, summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">This leaves only the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. A prevailing defendant in an action brought under Section 1983 is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees if the plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). The district court denied attorney\u2019s fees without findings. We must therefore reverse and remand for reconsideration of whether Maglione\u2019s claim was objectively frivolous. <em>Davidson v. Keenan, </em>740 F.2d 129, 133 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
