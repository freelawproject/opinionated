(Oxeo) petitions for a writ of mandamus to the United States District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Court for the Northern District of California (district court) ordering it: (a) to vacate its order remanding a state court action No. (C-84-4179 RPA) to the Superior Court for San Mateo County, California (state court); (b) to retain jurisdiction over, or dismiss, what Oxeo says is a portion of that action that embodies claims \u201carising under\u201d the Patent Laws of the United States; and (c) to vacate its stay of proceedings in Oxco\u2019s federal court suit for declaratory judgment (No. C-83-1252 RPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Shaw Associates (SA) has moved this court for an award of costs and attorneys fees incurred by SA as a result of Oxeo\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In a 1973 agreement, Shaw Associates. (SA) exclusively licensed Oxeo to use all of SA\u2019s inventions in the field of intravenous (I-V) administration apparatus \u2014 including patented and unpatented inventions, prototypes, plans, trade secrets, know-how, and other information (I-V inventions).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>State Court Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">In 1981, Oxeo notified SA that it would cease paying royalties, except on products covered by SA\u2019s patents and that none of its products was so covered. In 1982, Oxeo sued SA in the state court in San Francisco, alleging that the agreement was unenforceable except in relation to the products covered by SA\u2019s patents, which Oxeo said amounted to only 5% of Oxco\u2019s sales. A month later SA sued Oxeo in the state court in San Mateo, alleging breach of contract and that the contract required payment of royalties on all of Oxco\u2019s I-V administration apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Following extensive proceedings, trial commenced in the San Mateo state court on September 26, 1983. The trial encompassed 24 days, spread over three months, and involved over 500 exhibits, charts, graphs, models, and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Further extensive post-trial briefs and memoranda were received and fully considered. On May 25, 1984, the court issued a Tentative Decision. On October 10,1984, after considering further submissions, the court issued its final STATEMENT OF DECISION and a JUDGMENT.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state court\u2019s 49-page STATEMENT OF DECISION constitutes a reasoned, careful, and thorough review of the evidence, the issues, the authorities, and the bases for its decision, all in full support of its CONCLUSION:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">Oximetrix has breached the express terms of the 1973 Agreement by its failure to pay royalties prior to January 24, 1983. Oximetrix also breached the express terms of the Agreement by its continued use of the Shaw I-V inventions after that date and its repudiation of the Paragraph 8(b) license-back provisions. By the same conduct, Oximetrix has breached the separate implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as described above. The Court directs that judgment shall be entered for Shaw Associates based upon the foregoing Statement of Decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">In its JUDGMENT, the state court held that: (1) the agreement is enforceable; (2) SA is entitled to Oxco\u2019s improvements as provided for in the agreement; (3) Oxeo has no right to continue use of SA\u2019s I-V inventions after Oxeo terminated the agreement on January 24, 1983; (4) Oxco\u2019s I-V products use and are based on SA\u2019s unpa-tented inventions obtained under the agreement; (5) Oxco\u2019s I-V products also use the inventions claimed in valid patents of SA; (6) Oxeo is enjoined from using, directly or indirectly, the I-V inventions of SA; (7) the injunction is stayed for a year, with jurisdiction retained to determine when it should terminate; (8) Oxeo shall pay SA certain compensatory damages; (9) Oxeo must pay SA\u2019s attorney fees from the inception of the litigation through October 4, 1984; and (10) SA shall recover its costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>In support of the injunctive relief granted, the state court said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">In addition to this ground for an injunction based upon the misuse of the unpatented inventions, plans, apparatus and information, the Court further notes that Oximetrix, in its sales of I-V products, continues to utilize patented Shaw I-V inventions. The courts have held that under the circumstances here, such a continued use of patents constitutes a breach of contract enjoinable as such under state law. <em>See, e.g., H.J. Heinz Co. v. Superior Court, </em>42 Cal.2d 164, 266 P.2d 5 (1954); <em>Rogers v. Hensley, </em>194 CaI.App.2d 486, 14 Cal.Rptr. 870 (1961); <em>Seagren v. Smith, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 733, 741, 147 P.2d 682 (1944). The Court notes this state law authority as an alternative, contract-based ground and basis for the injunctive relief herein granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>Federal Court Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Having terminated the agreement in January 1983, Oxeo had thereupon filed in the federal district court an action (C-83-1252 RPA) for declaratory judgment that one of the patents in the agreement was invalid (later amended to include the other patents in the agreement). In May, 1983, the district court stayed proceedings in C-83-1252 RPA, pending completion of the state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On receipt of the state court\u2019s May 25, 1984 Tentative Decision, Oxeo obtained two <em>ex parte </em>extensions of time in which to request a STATEMENT OF DECISION under California Court Rule 232. On June 22, 1984, the last day of the second extension, Oxeo filed its request for a STATEMENT in the state court and its removal petition in the district court. SA moved in the district court to remand the case, and, on August 23, 1984, the district court granted the remand and entered an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">The district court\u2019s order contained these three findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">(1) This action was improvidently removed from state court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">(2) This court does not have jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) because this is not a case which arises under the patent laws of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">(3) The petition for removal was not timely filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b) because it was not filed within thirty days after defendant first ascertained the purported basis for removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">Based on those .findings, the district court ORDERED:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">(1) That the motion to remand is granted, the Petition for Removal is dismissed and the action is remanded forthwith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-16\">(2) That defendant and its counsel are ordered pursuant to this Court\u2019s authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447, Rule 11, Fed. R.Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and the inherent power of this Court to pay plaintiff\u2019s just and reasonable costs and sanctions, including attorneys\u2019 fees, associated with the removal petition . . . .;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-18\">(3) This action is remanded pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore is not reviewable by <em>any </em>means, whether by appeal or by mandamus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d); <em>Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>430 U.S. 723, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">\n<em>Oxco\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-20\">Oxeo makes these arguments in support of its mandamus petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-21\">(1) Removal must be reinstated to \u201cinterdict\u201d the state court\u2019s reach beyond its jurisdiction into \u201cexclusive federal patent jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-22\">(2) This court must grant mandamus to protect its \u201cexclusive appellate jurisdiction over the patent claims\u201d in the declaratory judgment and the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>court action, thus avoiding \u201cderogation of is Congressional mandate to bring doctrinal stability to the Patent Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">(3) Though the state court action did <em>not ' </em>involve patent validity or infringement issues, reference to \u201cvalid\u201d patents and an injunction that included patented inventions in the Tentative Decision made the state action removable on the date the Decision issued, and Oxco\u2019s removal petition was not untimely because it was filed within the prescribed period following <em>that </em>date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">(4) The district court\u2019s continuance of the stay of Oxco\u2019s declaratory judgment action delegates <em>\u201csub-silentio\u201d </em>the disposition of that action to the state court, because the state court injunction includes patented as well as unpatented products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Oxco\u2019s arguments are totally without merit, are based on mutually exclusive concepts, and are drawn in disregard of the record. Its filing and maintenance of the present petition is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">(D</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Concerning the state court\u2019s reference in its STATEMENT OF DECISION to \u201cvalid\u201d patents and the injunction in its JUDGMENT against Oxco\u2019s use of the unpatent-ed and patented inventions in the agreement, Oxeo admits that state courts may decide patent questions, as this court has recognized, <em>Beghin-Say Int\u2019l. v. Ole-Bendt Rasmussen, </em>733 F.2d 1568, 221 USPQ 1121 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Oxeo argues that there was no basis in the state court record for the reference to \u201cvalid\u201d or for what it calls a \u201ccoercive injunction against patent infringement.\u201d The argument ignores Oxco\u2019s own position that it never challenged patent validity in the state court and that its federal court challenge to validity has yet to be heard. The state court\u2019s reference to \u201cvalid\u201d patents was thus eminently correct when it was made. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. The state court entered no \u201cinjunction against patent infringement.\u201d Oxco\u2019s blow-up of the state court\u2019s use of \u201cvalid\u201d is disingenuous. It is also clearly misdirected here. Whether all parts of a state court decision are supported by the trial record is a matter for presentation on appeal to the appropriate court in the judicial system of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">Further, the entire and extended argument of both parties concerning the question of whether \u201cpatent\u201d issues were or were not presented to and decided by the state court is but \u201csound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d The state court, as above indicated, specifically grounded its decision and judgment on state law governing breach of contract. Thus Oxeo, because it was found to have breached the agreement, and to have done so in bad faith, is precluded by the state court judgment from using the patented <em>inventions </em>of the agreement, whatever may eventually be the fate of the patents. Throughout the greater part of its briefs, Oxeo ignores that feature of the state court judgment, arguing here primarily as though the sole basis for the state court judgment was one of patent infringement. At the same time, in countering SA\u2019s arguments, Oxeo rigorously asserts that the state trial was solely on contract matters and makes the statement that \u201cHere, <em>none </em>of the contract royalty obligations can be avoided by a finding of patent invalidity ...\u201d (emphasis Oxco\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">This court does not have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over patent claims\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>may arise in a state court action. Our jurisdiction is limited to appeals of cases in which the jurisdiction of the district court was based in whole or in part on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1). Here, the district court had no jurisdiction, under \u00a7 1338 or otherwise, over SA\u2019s state court contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Indeed, if this court were to grant Oxco\u2019s petition for an order that the district court vacate its remand order, it would be improperly altering the fundamental division of jurisdiction between the state and federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Nor is mandamus required to preserve this court's jurisdiction over any appeal that may eventuate from Oxco\u2019s declaratory judgment action. That action has merely been stayed. If Oxeo maintains its federal court action to have declared invalid certain patents on products the state court injunction precludes it from making anyway (because of its bad faith breach of contract), a judgment entered in that declaratory judgment action will be appealable to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Oxeo treats the district court\u2019s findings that it lacked jurisdiction over the state court action and that Oxco\u2019s petition for removal was untimely as \u201cmutually exclusive.\u201d On the contrary, those findings are clearly alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The state court action sounded in and was based on the contract between SA and Oxeo. Oxeo itself insists on that fact when it suits its purposes to do so. At other times, it infers that words in the state court\u2019s decision made the state action one for patent infringement and thus removable to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">Whether patent issues were raised during the state court trial or were referred to in the state court\u2019s decision would not change the basic nature of the action. Indeed it is settled law that a ease is not removable unless the complaint in the state court shows on its face that resolution of the case depends on a federal question. <em>See Brough v. United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, </em>437 F.2d 748 (1st Cir.1971). Further, that a defense raises a federal question is immaterial. <em>Id. </em>Here, the complaint affirmatively and unequivocally established that resolution of the case did <em>not </em>depend on a federal question of patent law. If a defense-raised federal question would not make removable this non-removable case, it defies understanding how Oxeo could petition for removal on the basis of what the state court said in its decision <em>after trial. </em>Thus, there never was a basis for removal or for Oxco\u2019s present petition seeking its reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">A removal petition is not a vehicle for appealing to a district court what Oxeo describes as a state court\u2019s decision \u201chaving gone beyond its jurisdiction.\u201d That question, if it exists, is for the appellate courts of the state, not the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">The action arose under state contract laws, not under the patent laws. The complaint spoke only of contract claims. It said not a word about patent infringement. Hence, the district court would not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338, and Oxco\u2019s petition for a mandamus ordering the district court to retain jurisdiction it never had must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">The district court\u2019s second finding must be read as meaning that if it had jurisdiction, the petition was untimely. Because the district court found an absence of jurisdiction, we need not and do not reach the untimeliness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">Finally, with regard to the propriety of Oxco\u2019s having brought the present petition for mandamus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-15\">An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In the case cited by the district court, <em>Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>430 U.S. 723, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977), the Supreme Court specifically held that remand orders based on \u00a7 1447(c) for lack of jurisdiction are not reviewable under \u00a7 1447(d) and reversed a contrary holding of the appellate court. Oxeo totally ignores <em>Gravitt </em>in its submissions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Oxeo cited in its main brief <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), and merely suggested that it shows the Supreme Court \u201cis not adverse to creating an exception\u201d to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Oxeo disregarded entirely the language in <em>Thermtron, </em>423 U.S. at 343, 96 S.Ct. at 589, that dramatizes non-reviewability here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar-\">If a trial judge purports to remand a case on the ground that it was removed \u201cimprovidently and without jurisdiction\u201d his order is not subject to challenge in the Court of Appeals by appeal, by mandamus, or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Oxco\u2019s otherwise incredible failure to mention <em>Gravitt </em>is dramatized not only by the Supreme Court\u2019s clear enforcement of \u00a7 1447(d) in that case, but by Oxco\u2019s disregard of the Court\u2019s reference in <em>Gravitt, </em>430 U.S. at 724, 97 S.Ct. at 1440, to <em>Thermtron, </em>the very case Oxeo cites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\"><em>Thermtron </em>did not question but reemphasized the rule that \u00a7 1447(c) remands are not reviewable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The exception in <em>Thermtron </em>was based on the district court\u2019s recognition that it had jurisdiction and on its having remanded solely because its docket was crowded. As the Supreme Court said, 423 U.S. at 343, 96 S.Ct. at 589, the remand there was not based, as it <em>expressly was here, </em>on \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Similarly, in <em>In re Snap-On Tools Corp., </em>720 F.2d 654, 220 USPQ 8 (Fed. Cir.1983), the only other case cited by Oxeo in support of review, the remand, as in <em>Thermtron, </em>was not stated to have been based on \u00a7 1447(c). Non-reviewability of remands under \u00a7 1447(c) has been assailed, but it is the established law in the statute and in the decisions of the Supreme Court upholding the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">' Thus, Oxeo entirely ignores <em>Gravitt, </em>the very Supreme Court case cited by the district court and most closely on all fours with the present case, and cites cases clearly distinct from that before us, while cavalierly ignoring adverse language in the opinions filed in the cited cases. It said nothing at all about Gravitt or Thermtron in its reply brief, though the impropriety of its petition in light of \u00a7 1447(c) and (d) and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance was called to its attention in SA\u2019s brief. Oxco\u2019s lack of candor is regrettable. ABA Model Code, DR 7-102(A)(2), DR 7-106(B)(1); ABA Model Rule 3.3(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">Oxco\u2019s request for mandamus ordering the district court to vacate its stay of Oxco\u2019s declaratory judgment action is equally without support. This court lacks the general authority over district courts exercisable, for example, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 332. <em>In re Precision Screen Machines, Inc., </em>729 F.2d 1428, 1429, 221 USPQ 1034 (Fed.Cir.1984). Whether the stay is continued or vacated has no effect on this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction and the extraordinary remedy of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, <em>United States v. Boe, </em>543 F.2d 151 (CCPA 1976), is not here required \u201cin aid\u201d of this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">The stay was originally entered more than 16 months ago. Oxeo did not then challenge its entry. Beyond the untimeliness of its present challenge to the stay, Oxeo has shown absolutely no abuse of discretion warranting the extraordinary remedy of mandamus ordering termination of the stay, even if this court had the authority to grant that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Oxco\u2019s sole argument for a lifting of the stay is that a refusal to lift it \u201cabdicates\u201d the federal court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over patents. Like Oxco\u2019s other positions, the argument is disingenuous. Lifting of the stay and proceeding with the declaratory judgment action would in itself have no effect on any action taken by the state courts. Indeed, the state court very properly proceeded with its conduct of the judicial process against Oxco\u2019s plea that it should delay that process while awaiting this court\u2019s disposition of the present petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The district court\u2019s continuance of the stay could not possibly constitute an abdication of its jurisdiction to decide the declaratory judgment action, and could not affect the action of the state courts on the contract suit presented to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">\n<em>Costs and Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">As above indicated, the state court awarded costs and attorney fees to SA. The district court applied sanctions, in the form of costs and attorney fees, against Oxeo in respect of its effort to remove the state court action after trial to the federal court. Though the district court stated no specific reasons, it made its reasons clear in its citation of the bases for its action: Rule 11 (filing of unfounded papers to harass or needlessly increase delay and costs); and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (multiplying proceedings to unreasonably, vexatiously increase costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In light of the considerations outlined under (l)-(3) above, there was not even a colorable basis for Oxco\u2019s attempted removal of the state court action to the district court, as the latter recognized in its imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Similarly, as indicated in (3) above, in light of the statute, \u00a7 1447(c) and (d), and in light of the applicable and unchallenged decisions of the Supreme Court, there was not even a colorable basis for Oxco\u2019s present mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Oxco\u2019s present petition confronted this court with a stack of documents more than a foot high and has consumed a substantial portion of the time of the Judges and staff of this court, all to reach a result that the statute and Supreme Court decisions in <em>Gravitt </em>and <em>Thermtron </em>should have made obvious to Oxeo and its counsel from the time at which the thought of mandamusing the district court first occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Oxco\u2019s petition, filed in the face of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), with no citation of apt authority or even minimally acceptable supporting argument, and in total disregard of the Supreme Court authority relied on by the district court, and by SA, has succeeded, and could from the outset have succeeded, only in diverting substantial judicial resources from other, deserving litigants. Its sole effect is and could only have been to unnecessarily and vexatiously increase delay and costs to SA and to the taxpayers who fund the operation of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Thus, there is not and never was a basis for removal or for the present petition. That circumstance was so clear in fact and law that competent counsel could not possibly have failed to recognize it. We are compelled to the conviction that the filing and maintenance of the present petition was based solely on a hope of delaying further the impact of the state court judgment and that it was therefore frivolous. <em>See Chemical Engineering Corp. v. Marlo, Inc., </em>222 USPQ 738 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Amstar Corp. v. Envirotech Corp., </em>730 F.2d 1476, 221 USPQ 649 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Connell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>722 F.2d 1542, 220 USPQ 193 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Asberry v. United States Postal Service, </em>692 F.2d 1378, 215 USPQ 921 (Fed.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">Accordingly, it is ORDERED:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">(1) Oxco\u2019s petition for mandamus is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-15\">(2) Oxeo and its counsel on this petition shall jointly and severally be liable to and shall pay SA an amount equal to SA\u2019s costs and attorney fees incurred by SA in opposing the present petition.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\">. Oxco\u2019s derogation of the Statement as \"prepared by SA\" is here inappropriate. Nothing of record indicates that the Statement is unrepresentative of the state court\u2019s findings and conclusions. Nor would that question be appropriate for determination by this court in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ayd\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">If at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, the district court shall remand the case, and may order the payment of just costs. A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by its clerk to the clerk of the State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\">. Oxco\u2019s motion to file a reply memorandum and appendix, in view of the state court\u2019s issuance of its final STATEMENT OF DECISION and JUDGMENT, was granted. In that reply, Oxeo repeats at length its arguments asserting absence of a federal patent question before the state court. Entirely ignoring the contract basis for the state court\u2019s injunction, Oxeo conjures a horror story in which <em>all </em>patent licensors could enjoin patent infringement after license termination if this case is not removed from the state court. Oxco\u2019s reply brief further ignores SA\u2019s authorities establishing non-reviewability of the present remand order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 deals with suits commenced in State courts and based on denial of equal civil rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
