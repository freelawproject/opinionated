(\u201cPlaytime\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order denying a permanent injunction and finding that the ordinance furthers a substantial governmental interest, is unrelated to the suppression of speech, and is no more restrictive than necessary to further that interest. Case number 83-3980 is a declaratory action involving the same parties and issues, filed by the City of Renton in state court after federal proceedings had begun. This action was twice removed to federal court and twice remanded to state court. Renton appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for fees and costs on the second removal. We reverse in number 83-3805 and affirm in number 83-3980.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b599-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">In April, 1981, the City of Renton enacted ordinance number 3526 which prohibited any \u201cadult motion picture theater\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>within one thousand feet of any residential zone or single or multiple family dwelling, any church or other religious institution, and any public park or area zoned for such use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The ordinance further'prohibited any such theater from locating within one mile of any public or private school. At the time this ordinance was enacted, no adult theaters were located in Renton, although there were other theaters within the proscribed area.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In January, 1982, Playtime acquired two existing theaters in Renton with the purpose of exhibiting adult motion pictures in at least one, the Renton Theater, which is located within the area proscribed by ordinance number 3526.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Just prior to closing the sale of the theater, on January 20, 1982, Playtime filed an action in federal court, seeking a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">A month later, on February 19, 1982, Renton brought suit in state court seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was constitutional on its face and as applied to Playtime\u2019s proposed use. The complaint alleged that an actual dispute existed because of the pending federal lawsuit and because Playtime asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On February 22, 1982, Renton moved to dismiss Playtime\u2019s federal action on the grounds that the federal court should abstain in favor of the state action, citing <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </em>420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">On March'8, 1982, Playtime removed the state action to federal court and Renton moved to remand. On March 25, the magistrate filed his recommendation that abstention was improper in the first action and on April 9, he recommended that the removed state action be remanded for lack of jurisdiction because the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court approved both recommendations, denying the motion to dismiss the federal action on May 5, 1982, and remanding the state action on January 13, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">On May 3, 1982, Renton passed an emergency ordinance, amending ordinance number 3526. The new ordinance added an elaborate statement of reasons for the enactment of the ordinances,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it further de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>fined the word \u201cused,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it reduced the required distance from schools from one mile to 1000 feet. The ordinance also contained a clause stating that the federal litigation created an emergency making immediate adoption of the new ordinance necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ordinance was reenacted on June 14, 1982, without the emergency clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On June 23, 1982, the magistrate heard Playtime\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and Renton\u2019s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. On November 5, 1982, he filed his recommendation to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Renton\u2019s motion and to grant Playtime a preliminary injunction. He found that the ordinance \u201cfor all practical purposes excludes adult theaters from the City,\u201d that only 200 acres were not restricted by the ordinance, and that all of these areas were \u201centirely unsuited to movie theater use.\u201d He further found that Renton had not established a factual basis for the adoption of the ordinance and that the motives behind the ordinance reflected \u201csimple distaste for adult theaters because of the content of the films shown.\u201d On January 11, 1983, the district court entered an order approving and adopting these findings and granting a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the first time, Playtime began showing adult movies at the Renton Theater.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">On February 8, 1983, the parties entered into a stipulation to submit the case for hearing on whether a permanent injunction should issue on the basis of the record already developed. On February 17, 1983, the district court vacated the preliminary injunction and denied the permanent injunction. The court found that 520 acres were available as potential sites for adult theater use and that this ordinance did not substantially restrict first amendment interests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court further held that Renton was not required to show specific adverse impact on Renton from the operation of adult theaters but could rely on the experiences of other cities. Lastly, the court found that the purposes of the ordinance were unrelated to the suppression of speech and that the restrictions it imposed were no greater than necessary to further the governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">On May 19, 1983, after denial of the permanent injunction, and after the notice of appeal was filed in this court, Renton filed an amended complaint in state court seeking, in addition to the originally requested declaratory relief, abatement of the operation of Playtime\u2019s adult theaters. On June 8, 1983, Playtime removed the action to federal court on the ground that Renton sought to enforce statutes that had been declared unconstitutional by this court. The district court remanded because the case did not arise under federal law; the federal issue was only a defense. It denied Renton\u2019s motion for costs and fees because it found that the petition raised serious questions of law and that Playtime had not acted in bad faith. Ren-ton appeals the denial of costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Renton argues that abstention was appropriate in this case because it involves vital state interests, <em>see Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 501, 61 S.Ct. 643, 645, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), and because the exercise of federal jurisdiction would interfere with the pending state action, <em>see Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">A. Pullman <em>Abstention is Inappropriate in This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">We recently held that the <em>Pullman </em>abstention doctrine was inapplicable in a facial challenge to Washington\u2019s anti-obscenity statute. <em>J-R Distributors, Inc. v. Eikenberry, </em>725 F.2d 482 (9th Cir.1984). We recognized that <em>Pullman </em>abstention would almost never be appropriate in first amendment cases because such cases involve strong federal interests and because abstention could result in the suppression of free speech. <em>Id. </em>at 487-88. Similarly, we find that the district court in the ease at hand appropriately declined to abstain because \u201cabstention would not eliminate or materially alter the constitutional issues presented.\u201d <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc. v. Brockett, </em>631 F.2d 135, 137 (9th Cir.1980), <em>aff'd mem., </em>454 U.S. 1022, 102 S.Ct. 557, 70 L.Ed.2d 468 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>B. Younger <em>Abstention is Inappropriate in This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We find <em>Younger </em>abstention inappropriate as well. Federal courts, concerned for federal-state comity, have employed <em>Younger </em>abstention to prevent federal interference with pending state criminal proceedings. <em>Goldie\u2019s Bookstore, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>739 F.2d 466, 469 (9th Cir.1984); <em>see also Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </em>420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975). In this case, Renton asked the district court to abstain in favor of a state court action that sought only a declaration of the ordinance\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The cases applying <em>Younger </em>abstention have arisen in criminal or quasi-criminal contexts. We have refused to extend <em>Younger </em>to civil cases generally. <em>See Goldie\u2019s Bookstore, </em>739 F.2d at 469-70; <em>Champion International Corp. v. Brown, </em>731 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir.1984). We agree with the district court\u2019s refusal to do so in this case as well. As we discussed in <em>Miof-sky v. Superior Court, </em>703 F.2d 332 (9th Cir.1983), in each of the cases in which <em>Younger </em>has been applied in a civil context, the civil suits \u201cbore similarities to criminal proceedings or otherwise implicated state interests vital to the <em>operation </em>of state government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337 (emphasis added). These dual requirements are not present in a civil case seeking only declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Playtime did not violate the ordinance prior to challenging it. Thus, it was not even potentially subject to the sort of enforcement action to which <em>Younger </em>applies. In <em>Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975), the plaintiff challenged a local ordinance prohibiting topless dancing in bars. Three bars in the town were affected and all complied with the ordinance prior to commencing suit in federal court. The day after the federal complaint was filed, one bar, M &amp; L, resumed topless dancing and was prosecuted criminally. The other two bar owners remained in compliance. The court held that <em>Younger </em>abstention applied to M &amp; L, but the retention of jurisdiction over the other two bar owners was proper because they were not subject to criminal prosecution prior to the issuance of the preliminary injunction. Playtime\u2019s position is like that of the two bars in <em>Doran.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Playtime showed adult films in Renton for the first time after the district court entered its preliminary injunction. By the time Renton amended its complaint in the state action to include abatement of the nuisance, making it the sort of enforcement action to which <em>Younger </em>might arguably apply,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> final judgment denying the injunction had already been granted in the district court. At this point, abstention was inappropriate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">THE STANDARDS FOR REGULATION OF SPEECH THROUGH THE USE OF THE ZONING POWER</p>\n<p id=\"AiG\">Local governments may zone for the public welfare. <em>See Berman v. Parker, </em>348 U.S. 26, 32-33, 75 S.Ct. 98, 102-103, 99 L.Ed. 27 (1954). The power is considerable but it must be exercised within constitutional limits. <em>See Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, </em>452 U.S. 61, 68, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2182, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981). We have an obligation to scrutinize strictly zoning decisions that infringe first amendment rights. <em>Tovar v. Billmeyer, </em>721 F.2d 1260, 1264 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 223, 83 L.Ed.2d 152 (1984).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The district court found that 520 acres in Renton were available for adult theater-sites. Although we do not quarrel with the conclusion that 520 acres is outside the restricted zone, we do not agree that the land is available.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A substantial part of the 520 acres is occupied by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">(1) a sewage disposal site and treatment plant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">(2) a horseracing track and environs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">(3) a business park containing buildings suitable only for industrial use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">(4) a warehouse and manufacturing facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-15\">(5) a Mobil Oil tank farm; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-16\">(6) a fully-developed shopping center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">Limiting adult theater uses to these areas is a substantial restriction on speech. Thus, the Renton ordinance, although patterned after the Detroit zoning ordinance upheld in <em>Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976), is quite different in its effect. The Detroit ordinance prohibited the location of an adult theater within 1,000 feet of another adult theater or other use having similar deleterious effects on neighborhoods, or within 500 feet of a residential area. There was no showing in <em>Young </em>that the ordinance seriously limited the number of sites available for adult theaters. The Renton ordinance\u2019s prohibition against adult theaters within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, churches, and residential areas would result in a substantial restriction on this activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">The Supreme Court developed a useful test to measure a challenged regulation affecting speech in <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), cited with approval in <em>Schad, </em>452 U.S. at 69 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. at 2183 n. 7. Under this test, a regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>lation is constitutional only if (1) it is within the constitutional power of the government; (2) it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; (3) the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free speech; and (4) the incidental restriction on first amendment freedom is no greater than essential to further that interest. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. at 1679. Here, Renton bears the burden of proving that the elements of this test are satisfied. <em>See First National Bank v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 786, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"At3\">The parties stipulated that the record developed at the preliminary injunction stage would serve as the record upon which the court could decide the permanent injunction. The parties in effect submitted the case for trial upon an agreed record, the district court resolving any disputed issues of fact presented by the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We review these factual determinations under a clearly erroneous standard. We do not, however, apply a clearly erroneous standard of review to the district court\u2019s findings on the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>factors because our recent decision in <em>United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984), and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984), require us to review them <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">In <em>McConney </em>we held that mixed questions of fact and law are subject to <em>de novo </em>review when they require us \u201cto exercise judgment about the values that animate legal principles . . . .\u201d 728 F.2d at 1202. In no area of law is the consideration of the values behind legal principles more important than when state action threatens to infringe on activity protected by the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">In <em>Bose Cory., </em>the Supreme Court held that a trial court\u2019s finding as to \u201cactual malice\u201d in a libel case was subject to <em>de novo </em>review. The question as framed by the Court was \u201cwhether the evidence in the record ... is of the convincing clarity required to strip the utterance of First Amendment protection____ Judges ... must independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold____\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1965. The Court recognized that it \u201chas regularly conducted an independent review of the record both to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the protected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1962. We have a similar duty in the case at hand.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">APPLICATION OF THE O\u2019BRIEN FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">A. <em>Renton Has Not Shown a Substantial Governmental Interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The record presented by Renton to support its asserted interest in enacting the zoning ordinance is very thin. The ordinance itself contains only conclusory statements. No record of the public hearing was made or preserved. City officials who attended testified that the hearing was held, but said little else. To uphold the substantiality of the governmental interest, the district court had to justify Renton\u2019s reliance on the experiences of other towns and cities, particularly Detroit and Seattle, citing the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Genusa v. City of Peoria, </em>619 F.2d 1203 (7th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In <em>Genusa, </em>the court relied on <em>Young </em>to uphold a provision of a zoning ordinance which required, just as the Detroit ordinance did, the dispersal of adult uses. <em>Id. </em>at 1211. Although the Renton ordinance <em>purports </em>to copy Detroit\u2019s and Seattle\u2019s, it does not solve the same problem in the same manner. The Detroit ordinance was intended to disperse adult theaters throughout the city so that no one district would deteriorate due to a concentration of such theaters. The Seattle ordinance, by contrast, was intended to <em>concentrate </em>the theaters in one place so that the whole city would not bear the effects of them. The Renton ordinance is allegedly aimed at protecting certain uses \u2014 schools, parks, churches and residential areas \u2014 from the perceived unfavorable effects of an adult theater.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">This court and the Supreme Court require Renton to justify its ordinance in the context of <em>Renton\u2019s </em>problems \u2014 not Seattle\u2019s or Detroit\u2019s problems. In <em>Young, </em>the plurality found that the record disclosed a factual basis for the council\u2019s determinations, 427 U.S. at 71, 96 S.Ct. at 2452, and Justice Powell cited \u201creports and affidavits from sociologists and urban planning experts, as well as some laymen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81 n. 4, 96 S.Ct. at 2457-58 n. 4 (Powell, J., concurring).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, in the Seattle case, the zoning ordinance was the \u201cculmination of a long period of study and discussion.\u201d <em>Northend Cinema, Inc. v. City of Seattle, </em>90 Wash.2d 709, 711, 585 P.2d 1153 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 945, 99 S.Ct. 2166, 60 L.Ed.2d 1048 (1979). By contrast, in <em>Schad, </em>which invalidated an ordinance prohibiting live nude dancing in the town, the Supreme Court stressed that the Borough had not adequately justified its substantial restriction by evidence in the record. 452 U.S. at 72, 101 S.Ct. at 2184. The Court cited by way of contrast the full record made in <em>Young. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">In <em>Kuzinich v. County of Santa Clara, </em>689 F.2d 1345 (9th Cir.1982), we reversed summary judgment validating a zoning ordinance regulating adult theaters and bookstores in part because of lack of evidence. We said, \u201cWhile the ordinance here was said to be copied after the Detroit ordinance validated in <em>Young, </em>we find very little evidence bearing on the concentration of adult enterprises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1348. We found that \u201c[cjonclusions alone support the thesis that adult bookstores and movie theaters have any different impact upon traffic and littering than other kinds of businesses have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, in <em>Ebel v. City of Corona, </em>698 F.2d 390, 393 (9th Cir.1983), we remanded for \u201cfactual findings on the validity of the city\u2019s assertions of harm.\u201d <em>Accord Basiardanes v. City of Galveston, </em>682 F.2d 1203, 1215 (5th Cir.1982) (contrasting record in <em>Young </em>against \u201cempty\u201d record before it); <em>Fantasy Book Shop, Inc. v. City of Boston, </em>652 F.2d 1115, 1125 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Cir.1981) (remanding for factual findings to support city\u2019s assertions, stating, \u201cthe government bears the burden of proving some empirical basis for the projections on which it relies.\u201d); <em>Avalon Cinema Corp. v. </em>Thompson, 667 F.2d 659, 661-62 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc) (contrasting <em>Young </em>and requiring city to present evidence to justify its restriction); <em>Keego Harbor Co. v. City of Keego Harbor, </em>657 F.2d 94, 98 (6th Cir.1981) (reversing because city\u2019s post hoc justifications failed to support ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">As in <em>Kuzinich, </em>we find Renton\u2019s justifications conclusory and speculative. Reao ton has not studied the effects of ad theaters and applied any such findings to the particular problems or needs of Renton. The studies done by Detroit on the problems of concentrating adult uses are simply not relevant to the concerns of the Renton ordinance \u2014 the proximity of adult theaters to certain other uses. We do not say that Renton cannot use the experiences of other cities as part of the relevant evidence upon which to base its actions, but in this case those experiences simply are not sufficient to sustain Renton\u2019s burden of showing a significant governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">B. <em>Renton Has Not Proved That The Regulation is Unrelated to the Suppression of Speech.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Renton must prove that its zoning decision was \u201cmotivated by a desire to further a compelling governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression.\u201d <em>Tovar v. Billmeyer, </em>721 F.2d 1260, 1266 (9th Cir.1983); <em>see also Lydo Enterprises v. City of Las Vegas, </em>745 F.2d 1211, 1214-1215 (9th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Both the magistrate and the district court recognized that many of the stated reasons for the ordinance were no more than expressions of dislike for the subject matter.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The record before us raises at least an inference that a motivating factor behind the ordinance was suppression of the content of the speech as opposed merely to regulating the effects of the mode of that speech. <em>See Tovar, </em>721 F.2d at 1266. The record does not reveal that Renton has rebutted the inference. As discussed above, the City had little empirical evidence before it to demonstrate the alleged deleterious effects of adult theaters.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">The district court upheld the ordinance on the ground that Renton\u2019s <em>predominate </em>concerns were legitimate. But that is not the test in this Circuit. Where mixed motives are apparent, as they are here, <em>Tovar </em>requires that the court determine whether <em>\u201ca motivating factor </em>in the zoning decision was to restrict plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of first amendment rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1266 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">Neither the facts before the Renton City Council nor those presented to the district court appear to justify the ordinance\u2019s restriction on protected expression. Renton has not shown that it was not motivated by a desire to suppress <em>speech </em>based on its content.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Given the inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>raised in the record before us, we remand for reconsideration, particularly in light of <em>Tovar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Renton argues, additionally, that even if it has effectively banned adult theaters, the ordinance is constitutional because similar adult theaters exist in nearby Seattle. The Supreme Court rejected such an argument in <em>Schad </em>and we reject it here as well. \u201c \u2018[Ojne is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schad, </em>452 U.S. at 76-77, 101 S.Ct. at 2187 (quoting <em>Schneider v. New Jersey, </em>308 U.S. 147, 163, 60 S.Ct. 146, 151, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939)).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">COSTS AND FEES ON SECOND REMOVAL</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In number 83-3980 Renton claims it is entitled to fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), because Playtime\u2019s second removal was in bad faith.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We review the court\u2019s finding of an absence of bad faith under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Dogherra v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>679 F.2d 1293, 1298 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 990, 103 S.Ct. 346, 74 L.Ed.2d 386 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Renton stresses that this was the second removal petition, but fails to mention that the first was remanded because the district court concluded that the City\u2019s complaint failed to state a justiciable controversy. The district court never reached the second step of deciding if the case could be removed if it had stated a cause of action. The second removal was on the basis of Renton\u2019s amended complaint, which did state a cause of action. This complaint, however, sought enforcement of state laws that had been declared unconstitutional by other courts. Under the circumstances, the district court did not err in finding no bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">The City failed to sustain its burden of justifying its ordinance under the test of <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), as applied in similar eases by the Supreme Court and this court. Accordingly, we reverse and remand case number 83-3805 for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">The district court did not clearly err in denying the City\u2019s motion for costs and fees in connection with the second removal. Accordingly, we affirm in case number 83-3980.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\">. The first ordinance defined an \"adult motion picture theater\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">an enclosed building used for presenting motion picture films, video cassettes, cable television, or any other such visual media, distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting, describing or relating to \"specified sexual activities\u201d or \"specified anatomical areas\" as hereafter defined, for observation by patrons therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">The ordinance defined these terms as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">2. <em>\"Specified Sexual Activities\":</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">(a) Human genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-17\">(b) Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse or sodomy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-24\">(c) Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breast.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-25\">3. <em>\u201cSpecified Anatomical Areas\":</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-26\">(a) Less than completely and opaquely covered <em>human </em>genitals, pubic region, buttock, and female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-27\">(b) Human male genitals in a discernible turgid state, even if completely and opaquely covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-28\">The second ordinance expanded the defined term of \u201cused\" as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-30\">a continuing course of conduct of exhibiting \u201cspecific [sic specified?] sexual activities\u201d and \"specified anatomical area[\"] in a manner which appeals to a prurient interest.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\">. For the purposes of this opinion, \"adult motion picture theater\u201d or \"adult theater\u201d refers to the definition used by the City. <em>See supra </em>note 1. We express no view as to the effect of this definition on the constitutionality of the ordinance. <em>See infra </em>note 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">. \u2019' The City gave the following reasons in the amended ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">1. Areas within close walking distance of single and multiple family dwellings should be free of adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">2. Areas where children could be expected to walk, patronize or recreate should be free of adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">3. Adult entertainment land uses should be located in areas of the City which are not in close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">4. The image of the City of Renton as a pleasant and attractive place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence' of adult entertainment land uses in close proximity to residential land uses, churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-14\">5. Regulation of adult entertainment land uses should be developed to prevent deterioration and/or degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists, rather than in response to an existing problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-19\">6. Commercial areas of the City patronized by young people and children should be free of adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-20\">7. The Renton School District opposes a location of adult entertainment land uses within the perimeters of its policy regarding bussing of students, so that students walking to school will not be subjected to confrontation with the existence of adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-21\">8. The Renton School District finds that location of adult entertainment land uses in areas of the City which are in close proximity to schools, and commercial areas patronized by students and young people/ will have a detrimental effect upon the quality of education which the School District is providing for its students.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-22\">9. The Renton School District finds that education of its students will be negatively affected by location of adult entertainment land uses in close proximity to location of schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-23\">10. Adult entertainment land uses should be regulations [sic] by zoning to separate it from other dissimilar uses just as any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>land use should be separated from uses with characteristics different from itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">11. Residents of the City of Renton, and persons who are non-residents but use the City of Renton for shopping and other commercial needs, will move from the community or shop elsewhere if adult entertainment land uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">12. Location of adult entertainment land uses in proximity to residential uses, churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools, may lead to increased levels of criminal activities, including prostitution, rape, incest and assaults in the vicinity of such adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">13. Merchants in the commercial area of the City are concerned about adverse impacts upon the character and quality of the City in the event that adult entertainment land uses are located within close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools. Location of adult entertainment land uses in close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools, will reduce retail trade to commercial uses in the vicinity, thus reducing property values and tax revenues to the City. Such adverse affect [sic] on property values will cause the loss of some commercial establishments followed by a blighting effect upon the commercial districts within the City, leading to further deterioration of the commercial quality of the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">14. Experience in numerous other cities, including Seattle, Tacoma and Detroit, Michigan, has shown that location of adult entertainment land uses degrade the quality of the area of the City in which they are located and cause a blighting effect upon the City. The skid row effect, which is evident in certain parts of Seattle and other cities, will have a significantly larger affect [sic] upon the City of Renton than other major cities due to the relative sizes of the cities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-12\">15. No evidence has been presented to show that location of adult entertainment land uses within the City will improve the commercial viability of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">16. Location of adult entertainment land uses within walking distance of churches and other religious facilities will have an adverse effect upon the ministry of such churches and will discourage attendance at such churches by the proximity of adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-15\">17. A reasonable regulation of the location of adult entertainment land uses will provide for the protection of the image of the community and its property values, and protect the residents of the community from the adverse effects of such adult entertainment land uses, while providing to those who desire to patronize adult entertainment land uses such an opportunity in areas within the City which are appropriate for location of adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-16\">18. The community will be an undesirable place to live if it is known on the basis of its image as the location of adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-17\">19. A stable atmosphere for the rearing of families cannot be achieved in close proximity to adult entertainment land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-18\">20. The initial location of adult entertainment land uses will lead to the location of additional and similar uses within the same vicinity, thus multiplying the adverse impact of the initial location of adult entertainment land uses upon the residential, [sic] churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools, and the impact upon the image and quality of the character of the community.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-19\">. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b601-20\">. The emergency clause stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-21\">The City Council of the City of Renton finds and declares that an emergency exists because of the pendency of litigation against the City of Renton involving the subject matter of this ordinance, and potential liability of the City of Renton for damages as pleaded in that litigation, and that the immediate adoption of this ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of public peak [sic], health, and safety or for the support of city government and its existing public institutions and the integrity of the zoning of the City of Renton. Therefore, this ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-22\">The City used this clause as justification for a renewed motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment, both of which were filed on May 4, the next day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b602-6\">. We denied the City\u2019s application for a writ of mandamus to stay the preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b602-14\">. The court did not explain the variance between this finding and its prior finding, made at the time it granted the preliminary injunction, that only 200 acres were available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. In <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </em>420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975), the Supreme Court held that a federal court could not enjoin enforcement of a state judgment in a nuisance abatement action brought by the state against an adult theater. The Court rejected the argument that <em>Younger </em>was restricted to criminal proceedings, but carefully limited its holding by recognizing that the state action was \"in important respects ... more akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil cases . . . . The proceeding is both in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 95 S.Ct. at 1208. In <em>Juidice v. Vail, </em>430 U.S. 327, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977), the Court held that <em>Younger </em>applied to a state civil contempt proceeding because the state's \"interest in the contempt process ... vindicates the regular operation of its judicial system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 97 S.Ct. at 1217. In <em>Trainor v. Hernandez, </em>431 U.S. 434, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (1977), abstention was required in deference to a prior state civil action brought by the state of Illinois to recover welfare payments obtained by fraud. The Court noted, however, that the action was \u201can ongoing civil enforcement action ... brought by the State in its sovereign capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 97 S.Ct. at 1918. And, in <em>Moore v. Sims, </em>442 U.S. 415, 99 S.Ct. 2371, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979), abstention was required as to a pending state proceeding in which the state was seeking custody of children abused by their parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b603-14\">. The court in <em>Huffman </em>recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">\"When no state criminal proceeding is pending at the time the federal complaint is filed, federal intervention does not result in dupli-cative legal proceedings or disruption of the state criminal justice system; nor can federal intervention, in that circumstance, be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state court\u2019s ability to enforce constitutional principles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Huffman, </em>420 U.S. at 603, 95 S.Ct. at 1207-1208 (quoting <em>Steffel v.

In <em>Hicks, </em>state officials confiscated allegedly obscene movies and brought an action in state court against two employees of the theater. The theater owners sought injunctive relief in federal court and the day after the owners filed the federal complaint, the state charged the theater owners along with their employees in state court. The court applied <em>Younger </em>because \"appellees were charged ... prior to answering the federal case and prior to any proceedings whatsoever before the three judge court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349-50, 95 S.Ct. at 2292.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b604-13\">. We note that obscenity is not at issue in this case. The City asks us to take notice of a state superior court decision in <em>City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, </em>No. 82-2-02344-2 (Superior Court, King County, Washington, March 9, 1984), in which an advisory jury ruled that four out of ten movies shown by Playtime are obscene. The City did not argue before the district court that Playtime\u2019s movies were obscene. We would not reach the issue in any event since this case does not involve the enforcement of an anti-obscenity statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b604-20\">. Although this circuit has not considered what \"available\u201d means in this context, we draw support from the Court's statement in <em>Young </em>that \u201c[t]he situation would be quite different if the ordinance had the effect of suppressing, or greatly restricting access to, lawful speech.\u201d 427 U.S. at 71 n. 35, 96 S.Ct. at 2453 n. 35. <em>See Basiardanes v. City of Galveston, </em>682 F.2d 1203, 1214 (5th Cir.1982) (expanding on footnote in <em>Young, </em>court noted that permitted locations were \"among warehouses, shipyards, undeveloped areas, and swamps.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">. In <em>Starsky v. Williams, </em>512 F.2d 109 (9th Cir.1975), we recognized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\"[W]hile summary judgment cannot be granted where there are questions of fact to be disposed of, even by consent of all concerned, there is no reason why parties cannot agree to try a case upon affidavits, admissions and agreed documents. In effect, that is what was done here. No objection whatever was made at the time of submission that there were questions of fact which could not be decided upon the evidence before the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aux3\"><em>Id. </em>at 113 (quoting <em>Gillespie v. Norris, </em>231 F.2d 881, 883-84 (9th Cir.1956)). This statement applies here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Playtime asserts that summary judgment was improper because it relied on the district court\u2019s findings on the preliminary injunction in entering into the stipulation. Thus, Playtime argues, when the district court inexplicably changed its findings of fact, it created material disputed issues of fact that would make summary judgment improper. Although we sympathize with Playtime\u2019s argument, we agree with Renton. Playtime made a tactical choice not to submit further documentation or testimony and cannot now complain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b605-23\">.

In <em>Vincent, </em>the ordinance applied to <em>all </em>signs, regardless of the content of their message.

In view of our holding, we need not address the overbreadth or vagueness issues raised by Playtime.

We do not denigrate the validity of this issue, but need not reach it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b608-19\">. The district court\u2019s ruling was oral and no written opinion or docket entry was made. Although Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(2) validates a notice of appeal filed after announcement of a decision or order, it contemplates the entry of a judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, 79. No such entry was made in this case; thus, under Rule 4(a)(2), the notice of appeal has no date of entry to which to conform.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">Nonetheless we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal under <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978). In <em>Bankers Trust, </em>the Supreme Court held that the parties to an appeal could waive Rule 58's separate judgment requirement when the district court clearly evidenced its intent that its order would represent the final decision in the case and the parties did not object to the absence of a separate judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 98 S.Ct. at 1121-22. We find those factors present here. The remand order was entered in the docket and no further proceedings could have existed in federal court. Neither party has objected to the lack of a separate judgment here. Although the district court\u2019s order in <em>Bankers Trust </em>was contained in a written opinion, we do not find that fact controlling except as it bears on the clarity of the court\u2019s intent. The transcript of the hearing on the remand leaves no doubt as to the district court\u2019s intent. Thus, the oral decision was an appealable order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
