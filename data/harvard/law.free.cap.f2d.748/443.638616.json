We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">Appellant contends that he was denied due process when a South Dakota state court refused to provide him a preliminary probation revocation hearing. We disagree. Appellant did not have a protect-able liberty interest. At the time of the revocation hearing, he was incarcerated in Nebraska. Because \u201cappellant was already confined ... [and] had been legally deprived of his liberty ... [,] no interruption of his \u2018liberty\u2019 occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>607 F.2d 220, 222 (8th Cir.1979). Furthermore, even assuming error, the error was harmless. Appellant has not alleged that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to conduct a preliminary hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-18\">Appellant also contends that he was denied due process when the court refused to continue the revocation hearing pending appeal of his Nebraska conviction. This claim has no merit. \u201cFederal courts have consistently ruled that a criminal conviction provides sufficient grounds for revocation of probation even though an appeal from the conviction is still pending.\u201d <em>United States v. Gentile, </em>610 F.2d 541, 542 (8th Cir.1979) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-19\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-16\">.
