HENDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Thomas S. Jones and Central Soya Company, Inc. (\u201cCentral\u201d) both challenge the reasonableness of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded to Jones by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in a successful action against Central alleging a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (\u201cADEA\u201d). The jury found Central\u2019s conduct to be willful and awarded Jones double damages in the amount of $41,666.42. The district court later granted Jones an additional interim amount of $18,796.00 as well as reinstatement with full pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">Pursuant to a provision in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) authorizing reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing plaintiff in an ADEA action, the district court awarded Jones approximately $24,000.00 allocable to counsel fees. On appeal, Jones alleges that the amount was insufficient because of 1) the exceptional result obtained in the litigation, 2) the purported contingency fee arrangement between Jones and his counsel, and 3) the delay in payment of the attorney\u2019s fees. Central cross appeals, contending that the district court improperly awarded Jones attorney\u2019s fees for the time billed for the work of an unnecessary second trial lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">Awards of attorney\u2019s fees in age discrimination actions are governed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) which provides: \u201c[t]he court ... shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be paid by the defendant ....\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b) (rendering section 216(b) applicable to ADEA actions). A number of factors are relevant to the determination whether such an award is reasonable, the most familiar of which were discussed at length in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In this case, the district court based its award on a \u201clodestar\u201d figure consisting of the product of the time invested by Jones\u2019 counsel and an hourly rate. Record, vol. 1, pp. 381-84.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In doing so, the district court addressed each of the factors listed in <em>Johnson </em>and concluded that no adjustment of the lodestar amount was necessary. <em>See id. </em>at 381-86.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We may overturn this award only for \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Dowdell v. City of Apopka, </em>698 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Jones first contends that the lodestar figure should have been increased because of the results obtained in the ADEA action. The district court reasoned that although counsel \u201cachieved substantial relief for the plaintiff in this case, the court does not feel that counsel is entitled to an enhancement bonus on this factor.\u201d Record, vol. 1, p. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States has instructed that \u201c[bjecause acknowledgment of the \u2018results obtained\u2019 generally will be subsumed within other factors used to calculate a reasonable fee it normally should not provide an independent basis for increasing the fee award.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1549, 79 L.Ed.2d 891, 903 (1984). However, \u201cin some eases of exceptional success an enhanced award may be justified.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, 52 (1983); <em>see Blum, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1550, 79 L.Ed.2d at 903 (quoting Hensley). We are confronted here with the question whether the result in this ease constitutes \u201cexceptional success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-25\">Although the Supreme Court has not yet addressed in detail the-circumstances under which an award of attorney\u2019s fees should be enhanced because of the result obtained, the Court noted in <em>Blum </em>that \u201cwhere the experience and special skill of the attorney ... require the expenditure of fewer hours than counsel normally would be expected to spend on a particularly novel or complex issue\u201d an increase may be warranted. <em>Blum, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1549, 79 L.Ed.2d at 902. <em>See also Ramos v. Lamm, </em>713 F.2d 546, 557 (10th Cir.1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>(\u201cexceptional success\u201d may be based upon extraordinary economies of time given the complexity of the task).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Other courts have articulated additional factors that may justify an enhanced attorney\u2019s fee award such as the development of new law furthering important congressional policies, <em>see Phillips v. Smalley Maintenance Services, Inc., </em>711 F.2d 1524, 1530-31 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 718; <em>accord Ramos, </em>713 F.2d at 557,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> success achieved under unusually difficult circumstances, <em>see White v. City of Richmond, </em>713 F.2d 458, 462 (9th Cir.1983) (near complete success achieved in face of highly unfavorable law); <em>Ramos, </em>713 F.2d at 557 (\u201cunusually difficult circumstances\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the size of the award. <em>See Yates v. Mobile County Personnel Board, </em>719 F.2d 1530, 1533 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Wolf v. Frank, </em>555 F.2d 1213, 1218 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 718.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">None of these grounds is sufficiently present in this case to compel the conclusion that the district court abused its discretion. There is no indication that the success of Jones\u2019 attorneys was achieved with any special economics of time or under unusually difficult circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the case did not establish significant new law furthering an important congressional goal, and the $60,462.42 recovered is not such a substantial amount as to require enhancement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">In <em>Ramos </em>the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit observed that \u201ctotal victory\u201d may constitute \u201cexceptional success.\u201d <em>Ramos, </em>713 F.2d at 557. The main thrust of Jones\u2019 argument appears to be based precisely on this point. According to Jones, because he prevailed on all his claims he is entitled to an enhanced award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">We decline, however, to equate \u201ctotal success\u201d with \u201cexceptional success.\u201d Although the Supreme Court in <em>Hensley </em>observed that \u201cthe extent of a plaintiff\u2019s success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an award of attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 440, 103 S.Ct. at 1943, 76 L.Ed.2d at 54, the Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>never suggested that complete victory alone requires an enhanced award. Indeed, the Court specifically distinguished \u201cexcellent\u201d results from \u201cexceptional\u201d results and instructed that only the latter could justify an increased grant of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id., </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52. Winning on all claims does not seem to us to be so unusual that it must be deemed \u201cexceptional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Furthermore, the Court in <em>Hensley </em>held that, given the vast range of success possible in a civil rights action, a decrease in the lodestar amount is not required simply because the plaintiff failed to win every contention raised in his lawsuit. <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 440, 103 S.Ct. at 1943, 76 L.Ed.2d at 55. We believe the converse follows \u2014 just as losing on some claims does not necessarily mandate a decrease in the lodestar figure, neither does winning on all claims demand an increased amount. The central inquiry remains whether the expenditure of counsel\u2019s time was reasonable in light of the overall success achieved. <em>See id., </em>461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">A contrary boilerplate rule that total victory mandates a larger award of attorney\u2019s fees would mean that lawyers fortunate enough to attract clients with highly meritorious claims would always be entitled to increased attorney\u2019s fees. Statutory entitlements to attorney\u2019s fees were not designed to provide windfalls to lawyers. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th CONG., 2d SESS. 6 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.CODE CONG. &amp; AD.NEWS 5908, 5913 (Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">This is not to say that the totality of the success is never a relevant factor in determining whether a result is \u201cexceptional.\u201d We simply hold that the mere fact that a plaintiff recovered everything he sued for in the underlying litigation does not, by itself, mandate an enhanced award. In an appropriate case, the completeness of the success might be weighed along with the legal and factual hurdles, the economies of time and skill involved, the monetary award and the law created in evaluating whether a result is \u201cexceptional.\u201d Because the other influences are not present in this case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to enlarge the fee notwithstanding the fact that Jones recovered on all claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Jones next asserts that the district court erred by not considering the contingency fee arrangement he allegedly had with his counsel. The Supreme Court recently deferred a ruling on whether an upward adjustment of the attorney\u2019s fees is authorized because of the risk of nonrecovery. <em>See Blum, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1550 n. 17, 79 L.Ed.2d at 903 n. 17.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is well established in this circuit, however, that a contingency fee arrangement may justify an increase in an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See, e.g., Hall v. Board of School Commissioners, </em>707 F.2d 464 (11th Cir.1983) (per curiam); <em>Marion v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Barrier, </em>694 F.2d 229, 231-32 (11th Cir. 1982) (per euriam); <em>Jones v. Diamond, </em>636 F.2d 1364, 1382 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>453 U.S. 950, 102 S.Ct. 27, 69 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">To decide the issue in this case we must distinguish between two types of risks an attorney may assume in making a fee arrangement. First, an attorney may risk all entitlement to fees by entering into a conventional contingency agreement with his client. Second, although not making his entitlement to fees dependent upon the verdict or judgment, an attorney always assumes the risk that he will not be paid by his client because of indigency. If an attorney is aware, when finalizing his agreement, that his client will be unable to pay, and that the only recourse for collecting his compensation is a statute providing for fee-shifting, then for practical purposes, the attorney would have assumed the risk of nonrecovery if his client does not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The district court recognized this distinction in reasoning that \u201c[ajlthough adequate compensation was, as a practical matter, probably contingent upon a successful result, the case was not taken on a contingent fee basis . . . . [Cjounsel is not entitled to an enhancement bonus on this factor.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 385. This quotation is a finding of fact that there was no contingency fee agreement between Jones and his counsel. In addition, the court evidently reasoned that, although there was a \u201cpractical risk\u201d of nonpayment because of Jones\u2019 indigency, this risk did not justify a fee enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">We may overturn the district court\u2019s finding of fact only if it is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The facts in the record reflect considerable doubt about the fee arrangement between Jones and his attorney. At an initial meeting between Jones and his attorney in February, 1981, the fee was not discussed. Record, vol. 2, p. 393-7. Later, an hourly bill was sent to Jones. When Jones expressed his inability to pay it, his attorney told him they would \u201ccross that bridge later.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393-9. Several months then passed during which there was no further mention of the fee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 393-9 to 393-10. Jones later authorized his lawyer to settle the case for up to $40,000.00 of which a third would be retained as attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 393-12. However, no settlement ever materialized. <em>After </em>Jones prevailed at the jury trial, he agreed that his counsel would \u201clook exclusively to the Court for the fixing of a reasonable fee\u201d without disturbing the jury award. <em>Id. </em>at 393-13.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">At no point was it apparent that Jones\u2019 counsel agreed to forego compensation for his efforts in the event the action was unsuccessful. Accordingly, we are not left with the requisite \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court made a mistake in finding there was no contingency fee arrangement between Jones and his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">Moreover, the district court was correct in reasoning that the \u201cpractical risk\u201d assumed by Jones\u2019 counsel is not a basis for enhancing a fee award. Jones argues that one purpose of fee-shifting statutes is to attract competent counsel and that compensating for the \u201cpractical risk\u201d would encourage lawyers to take civil rights cases involving indigent clients. According to Jones, refusing to provide this compensation would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the willingness of attorneys to take such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">It is true that in passing statutes supporting the entitlement to attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>fees, Congress intended to encourage competent counsel to take on possibly undesirable cases by providing for adequate compensation for their successful efforts. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th CONG., 2d SESS. 6 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD.NEWS 5908, 5913 (Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act). This court has recognized that enhancement on the basis of a conventional contingency arrangement furthers this congressional purpose. <em>See, e.g., Yates, </em>719 F.2d at 1534.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We do not believe, however, that Congress intended that such advocates be paid for the financial risks they assume to a greater degree than other lawyers. As we stated in <em>Jones, </em>compensation for risk \u201cis neither less nor more appropriate in civil rights litigation than in personal injury cases.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>636 F.2d at 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In this case, counsel for Jones seek an amount compensating them for the risk of nonpayment by a client liable for fees, a risk that is assumed without special compensation by all attorneys in all cases. A lawyer may not preserve a right of recourse against his client for fees and still expect to be compensated as if he had sacrificed completely his right to payment in the event of an unsuccessful outcome. To justify a risk premium a lawyer must agree to hold his client unaccountable for his fees if he loses the case. Because the district court found that no such agreement existed, the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to enhance the fee award on the basis of contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Jones\u2019 last argument is that the district court abused its discretion by not awarding additional attorney\u2019s fees to compensate for delay in payment. This court has recognized that if the hourly rate for attorney\u2019s fees is based on historical rates, thus reflecting the reasonable attorney\u2019s fee at the time the work was performed, an adjustment may be necessary to compensate for inflation and interest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Johnson v. University College of the University of Alabama, </em>706 F.2d 1205, 1210-11 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 489, 78 L.Ed.2d 684 (1983); <em>Morgado v. Birmingham-Jefferson County Civil Defense Corps, </em>706 F.2d 1184, 1193-94 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 715, 79 L.Ed.2d 178 (1984). The district court did not discuss delay, and did not state whether the hourly rate it used to compute Jones\u2019 award was current or historical.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The evidence the court could have considered in arriving at the applied rate of $85.00 per hour contains information about both current and historical rates.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under these circumstances we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>cannot determine whether the district court abused its discretion by failing to increase the award to account for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">We decline, however, to remand this case for clarification or reconsideration because we hold that Jones waived the right to seek an enhancement of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of delay. He failed both at the district court hearing on attorney\u2019s fees and in his \u201cApplication for Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees,\u201d Record, vol. 1, pp. 291-306, to raise the issue of enhancement for delay.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In reaching our conclusion we are mindful of the general rule that the \u201cburden rests on the party seeking an attorney\u2019s fee award to file a fee application and proffer proof going to the <em>Johnson </em>guidelines before the trial court.\u201d <em>Carr v. Blazer Financial Services, Inc., </em>598 F.2d 1368, 1371 (5th Cir.1979). Because Jones did not advance any argument for delay until after the district court\u2019s order granting attorney\u2019s fees, we decline to consider it as a basis for overturning the award. <em>See Gates v. Collier, </em>616 F.2d 1268, 1278 n. 16 (5th Cir.1980) (suggesting waiver of claim for interest on award of attorney\u2019s fees when issue not raised until after the district court made the award), <em>modified on rehearing, </em>636 F.2d 942 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Finally, Central, as cross-appellant, urges that the district court abused its discretion by not reducing the award by the amount allocated for the allegedly duplica-tive work performed at trial by a second attorney for Jones. The district court considered the issue and concluded that it was not \u201cunreasonable for the plaintiff to have been represented at trial by two experienced attorneys. The defendant was represented at the trial by house counsel and trial counsel, although house counsel did not participate actively in the litigation.\u201d Record, vol. 1, p. 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">A reduction in a fee \u201cis warranted only if the attorneys are <em>unreasonably </em>doing the <em>same </em>work. An award for time spent by two or more attorneys is proper as long as it reflects the distinct contribution of each lawyer to the case and the customary practice of multiple-lawyer litigation.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>706 F.2d at 1208 (emphasis in original); <em>see Ward v. Kelly, </em>515 F.2d 908, 912 n. 11 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Except for the fact that both were present at trial, there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Jones\u2019 attorneys were doing identical work. Also, there is no indication in the record, aside from the fact that only one lawyer actively participated in the trial for Central, that it was unreasonable for Jones to retain two trial attorneys. Indeed, the record reflects that the lack of opportunity for pretrial preparation by Jones\u2019 attorney may have necessitated additional trial counsel. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 2, p. 393-5. At any rate, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we cannot conclude that the trial judge, who was in the best position to evaluate the reasonableness of the use of two trial at-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>in torneys by Jones, abused his discretion declining to reduce the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The judgment of the district court AFFIRMED. is</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-11\">.

In addition, we note that in an effort to justify the employment of two trial attorneys, Jones' counsel stated that two lawyers were necessary in light of the fact that Jones could not afford pretrial deposition discovery. Record, vol. 2, p. 393-5. The district court may have taken this to mean that Jones' ability to pay was so significant an issue before trial that cost-cutting measures were necessary. Such concern over Jones\u2019 ability to pay suggests that the parties expected, at least at that point, that Jones would ultimately be liable for his counsel's fees. This liability is inconsistent with a contingency fee arrangement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">. Vindication of the policy of the law depends to a significant degree on the willingness of highly skilled attorneys, such as those now before the court, to accept employment in discrimination cases on a wholly contingent basis. They will hardly be willing to do so if their potential compensation is limited to the hourly rate to which they would be entitled in noncontingent employment. Busy and successful attorneys simply could not afford to accept contingent employment if those were the rules that were applied. The enforcement of our civil rights acts would then be entrusted largely to less capable and less successful lawyers who lack sufficient employment. Such an arrangement would ill serve policies of enormous national importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\"><em>Yates v.

The relevant period of delay generally runs from the time payment for legal services rendered would normally be due to the time of the receipt of the payment.
