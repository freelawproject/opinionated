Wilson, a coal miner, appeals from a decision of the Benefits Review Board denying his claim for black lung disability payments under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-45 (1982) (the Black Lung Act). We reverse and direct an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">The Department of Labor initially ruled on August 1, 1979, finding that Wilson was eligible for benefits and that Valley Camp Coal Company was the responsible employer. At Valley Camp\u2019s request, the claim was referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for a formal hearing. The ALJ conducted a hearing and issued his decision on October 10, 1980 finding Wilson eligible for black lung benefits commencing April 1,1978. Valley Camp appealed to the Benefits Review Board, which reversed the award of benefits on November 30, 1983. The Board held that the medical evidence in the record established \u201cas a matter of law\u201d that Wilson suffered from no disabling respiratory impairment and was able to do his usual coal mine work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.-203(b)(2) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-20\">The issues on this appeal are whether there was substantial evidence to support the AU\u2019s decision and whether the Board reviewed the AU\u2019s decision under the proper standard. <em>Beavan v. Bethlehem Mines Corp., </em>741 F.2d 689 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Amigo Smokeless Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>642 F.2d 68 (4th Cir.1981); <em>see also Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. v. McCabe, </em>593 F.2d 234, 237 (3rd Cir.1979). The standard for Board review is set forth in the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cfindings of fact in the decision under review by the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). This provision of the LHWCA is incorporated into the Black Lung Act by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a). The ultimate issue thus is whether there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.301 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The evidence principally consists of testimony describing three medical examinations of Wilson. The first was conducted on July 19, 1975 by Dr. Ralph J. Jones in connection with Wilson\u2019s claim for State of West Virginia Occupational Pneumoconio-sis benefits. Dr. Jones diagnosed pneumo-coniosis \u201cwith no impairment for work therefrom,\u201d but he stated that Wilson had not been given an exercise tolerance test because of a severe back condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Wilson was next examined by Dr. Willard Pushkin on July 5, 1979, at the request of the United States Department of Labor. A chest x-ray and pulmonary function studies were performed. Dr. Pushkin concluded that Wilson suffered from pneumoconio-sis causally related to coal mine employment with \u201cminimal impairment.\u201d Dr. Pushkin also assessed Wilson\u2019s effort during the pulmonary function study tests as \u201csubmaximal,\u201d but did not explain the reasons for this conclusion. The chest x-ray performed on July 5,1979 was first read by Dr. James T. Smith who found \u201cfine bilateral nodulation consistant [sic] with occupational pneumoconiosis\u201d and concluded that Wilson indeed suffered from pneumoconio-sis, category 1/2 p. This x-ray was re-read on July 27, 1979 by Dr. Jeremy Attman who deemed the film \u201ccompletely negative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Wilson was then examined on September 12, 1979 by Dr. Anthony C. Daugherty at the request of the Valley Camp Coal Company. The results of the pulmonary function studies and arterial blood gas tests conducted at the direction of Dr. Daugherty were not equal to or less than the regulatory criteria of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">An x-ray ordered by Dr. Daugherty was performed and read by Dr. Jose Caringel. According to Dr. Caringel, this x-ray revealed \u201cfine fibronodular densities in the right mid lung field and in the bases.\u201d Dr. Daugherty interpreted the pulmonary function studies as indicating a \u201cmild amount of obstructive changes.\u201d He also stated that the arterial blood gas studies revealed \u201cmild hypoxemia.\u201d After reviewing Dr. Caringel\u2019s x-ray report describing fibrono-dular densities, Dr. Daugherty stated that he could not \u201cappreciate this pattern,\u201d mistakenly attributing those markings to Wilson\u2019s \u201cchronic cigarette smoking.\u201d The record, however, shows that Wilson is a lifetime non-smoker. Dr. Daugherty concluded that Wilson was capable of \u201cengaging in gainful employment with respect to his lungs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">The ALJ invoked a rebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment on the basis of x-ray evidence establishing the presence of the disease. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.-203(a)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He relied on the two x-rays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>taken at the request of Drs. Pushkin and Daugherty. He rejected Valley Camp\u2019s contention that the ventilatory and blood gas studies revealed that Wilson did not have pneumoconiosis and thus rebutted the presumption. Additionally, he found that Dr. Daugherty\u2019s recognition of a mild amount of distinctive changes was consistent with a finding of pneumoconiosis, emphasizing the erroneous statement that Wilson was a chronic smoker.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Valley Camp argued before the Board and here that the results of the blood gas studies and ventilatory function tests rebut the presumption of total disability pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(2). That section provides that the presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis can be rebutted by medical evidence demonstrating that the claimant is still capable of working in the mines. <em>Director, OWCP v. Beatrice Pocahontas Co., </em>698 F.2d 680, 682 (4th Cir.1983). The Benefits Review Board reversed the award of benefits, holding that the medical evidence established as a matter of law that Wilson was capable of doing his usual coal mine employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(2). The Board based its decision on the reports of Drs. Jones and Daugherty, and considered the blood gas studies and ventilatory function tests. The Board further found that the findings of Dr. Pushkin did not constitute a contrary medical judgment from which the administrative law judge could rationally arrive at a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We agree with the ALJ that the readings of the x-rays by Dr. Smith and Dr. Caringel were sufficient to establish a presumption of total disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(1). Once the interim presumption is established by a qualifying diagnosis from <em>either </em>x-rays, blood gas studies, or ventilatory function tests, \u201ca miner\u2019s failure to satisfy the remaining tests [for a qualifying diagnosis] does not rebut [it].\u201d <em>Hampton v. United States Dept. of Labor Benefits Review Board, </em>678 F.2d 506, 508 (4th Cir.1982). <em>See also Whicker v. United States Dept. of Labor Benefits Review Board, </em>733 F.2d 346 (4th Cir.1984) (specifically applying the <em>Hampton </em>holding to rebuttal under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.201(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">There was substantial evidence to support the AU\u2019s decision and the Board erred in reaching a contrary conclusion. Dr. Jones, who conducted an examination of Wilson nearly two years before Wilson filed his application with the Department of Labor, diagnosed pneumoconiosis although he felt there was \u201cno impairment for work therefrom.\u201d His report fails to support Valley Camp\u2019s position. The test was incomplete in that no exercise tolerance test, pulmonary function studies, or arterial blood gas studies were administered. To the extent that the examination was valid, it supported a finding of pneumoconiosis. Dr. Jones\u2019 conclusory statement that there was no impairment for work is insufficient to satisfy the specific regulatory requirement that the claimant be \u201cable to do his usual coal mine work or comparable and gainful work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">Dr. Daugherty\u2019s report, concluding that Wilson was \u201ccapable at this point of engaging in gainful employment with respect to his lungs,\u201d suffers from a similar deficiency. Such general statements have little probative value in arriving at the specific determinations mandated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">In contrast to these reports are the findings of Drs. Pushkin, Smith, and Caringel. Dr. Pushkin stated unequivocally that Wilson suffered from pneumoconiosis causally related to coal mine employment. Dr. Smith, who read the chest x-ray ordered by Dr. Pushkin, concluded that the condition of Wilson\u2019s lungs was consistent with occupational pneumoconiosis. The x-ray read by Dr. Caringel also revealed abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of pneumoconi-osis. Dr. Daugherty\u2019s rejection of Dr. Car-ingel\u2019s findings on the basis of Wilson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>chronic cigarette smoking is patently erroneous in light of the uncontroverted evidence that Wilson had never smoked. Additionally, Dr. Daugherty recognized that Wilson was suffering a \u201cmild amount of obstructive changes\u201d and \u201cmild hypoxe-mia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Although Valley Camp adduced some evidence to rebut the presumption of total disability, there is substantial unrebutted evidence to support the decision of the AU that Wilson was disabled by pneumoconio-sis. Consequently, the Benefits Review Board erred in setting aside his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The decision of the Benefits Review Board is reversed and it is directed to enter a judgment awarding Wilson benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-14\">.
