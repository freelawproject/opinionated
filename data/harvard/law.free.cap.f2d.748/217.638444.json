Schweiker, </em>715 F.2d 134 (4 Cir.1983) and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984). <em>See Heckler v. Starnes, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2673, 81 L.Ed.2d 870 (1984). We conclude that in the light of <em>Ringer </em>the judgment of the district court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-27\">In the instant ease the district court preliminarily enjoined the Secretary of Health and Human Services from implementing nationwide or regional caps on reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ment under Part B of the Medicare Program for computerized tomography (\u201cCT\u201d) scans until the Secretary had complied with the Administrative Procedure Act. It ruled that it had jurisdiction to grant such relief and that plaintiffs had made a prima facie showing that the caps were promulgated in violation of the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. It res\u00e9rved its judgment on the substantive and constitutional challenges to the validity of the caps.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In review of the jurisdictional question, we concluded that the district court had jurisdiction either under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 or under the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. We recognized that <em>United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. 201, 102 S.Ct. 1650, 72 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982), held that judicial review of Part B benefit amount determinations was barred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff, but we did not read <em>Erika </em>to construe \u00a7 1395ff to bar judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s administration of the Part B program, as distinguished from the correctness of benefit determinations thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>Ringer </em>establishes that we misread <em>Erika: Ringer </em>decides that Starnes\u2019 contention that there were procedural irregularities in the promulgation of the caps are so inextricably intertwined with a claim for benefits that any judicial review is barred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff. <em>See Ringer, </em>466 U.S. at \u2014 n. 4, and \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2018 n. 4, and 2021. It follows that the district court lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1361, and that the district court must dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
