The petition for review was filed on August 13, 1984, the sixty-third day after the filing of the Board\u2019s order. Petitioner suggests several reasons why we should hold that the petition was nevertheless timely. First, it is argued that the Board\u2019s decision was never \u201cissued\u201d within the meaning of the statute because the Board did not send a copy of its decision to \u201call parties\u201d as required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 804.403(b). The decision was not sent to all parties, <em>petit</em>ioner says, because he personally did not receive a copy of it from the Board. Instead, the Board sent a copy to petitioner\u2019s attorney, who in turn forwarded it to his client. We do not accept this argument. When a party is represented by counsel, notice to counsel is, absent exceptional circumstances, notice to the client.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the decision of the Board was in fact sent to \u201call parties,\u201d and this argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Petitioner points out that when his lawyer mailed him a copy of the Board\u2019s decision, the cover sheet, quoting the relevant provisions of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), which sets the sixty-day time limit for the filing of petitions for review, bore the stamped date June 15, 1984. The suggestion is that petitioner believed that June 15, 1984, was the operative date from which the sixty-day period would be computed. It seems that the June 15, 1984 date stamp was affixed to the cover sheet not by the Board, but by petitioner\u2019s attorney when the Board\u2019s decision was received in his office. Petitioner, it is argued, did not realize that his lawyer had put the June 15, 1984 date on the cover sheet, but thought this date was an official representation by the Board of the date of the filing of its decision. The argument cannot withstand analysis, because the Board\u2019s decision itself, to which the cover sheet was attached, clearly states in two different places that it was filed for record on June 11, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Finally, petitioner claims that the term \u201cissued\u201d in the controlling jurisdictional statute is not the equivalent of \u201cfiled.\u201d Thus, that the opinion may have been filed for record in the offices of the Board on June 11, 1984, should not be controlling for purposes of determining when it was \u201cissued.\u201d Rather, the argument runs, the \u201cissuance\u201d of the opinion should be held to take place on the date when the Board\u2019s decision was received by petitioner himself, or, perhaps, by his counsel. We disagree. The Board\u2019s regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.410(a), use the word \u201cfiled\u201d to describe the event from which the time for seeking review runs. Thus, the Board interprets the statutory term \u201cissued\u201d to mean \u201cfiled.\u201d We normally defer to the regulations of an administrative agency interpreting its own governing statute, when the interpretation adopted by the regulations is not unreasonable. Certainly a regulation equating the term \u201cissued\u201d with \u201cfiled\u201d is not unreasonable, and we therefore construe the statute in accordance with the regulation. It follows that the Board\u2019s decision was \u201cissued\u201d on June 11, 1984, not at some later time, and that the period for the filing of a petition for review expired on August 10, 1984, the sixtieth day after issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>We have no alternative but to dismiss the petition for review. This is a court of limited jurisdiction, exercising only those powers delegated to us by Congress. We can review decisions of the Benefits Review Board only when they are brought before us under the conditions and within the time specified by statute. Unfortunately, the present petition does not qualify when judged by this standard. We note that petitioner\u2019s present counsel, who has made an appealing plea in support of our jurisdiction, did not represent him at the time of the decision of the Benefits Review Board and is not responsible for the late filing of this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The motion to dismiss is granted, and the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">.
