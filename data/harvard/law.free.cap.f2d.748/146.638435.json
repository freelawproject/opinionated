From February 1965 through June 2, 1980, Tres-sler was employed at American Color and Chemical Corporation, Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, in various capacities including those of pipe fitter and arc welder. He testified that, while at work on May 31, 1980, he felt a terrible pain in his back and reported to the dispensary. The doctor in charge told Mr. Tressler to \u201ctake it easy.\u201d Tressler testified that he worked for the remainder of the week but while at home he again hurt his back, felt his leg go numb \u201cwith terrific pains,\u201d and fell down. He was taken to the emergency room of the Lock Haven State Hospital where the attending physician checked him for signs of stroke. Finding none, the physician told him to go home for a few days and to \u201ctake it easy.\u201d Tressler has not worked since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">On November 6, 1980, Tressler filed an application for disability insurance benefits claiming that he had become disabled on May 31, 1980 due to a disc syndrome; on February 23, 1981, he filed an application for SSI benefits based upon the same disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">On the basis of the medical evidence on the record and the testimony of Tressler at the hearing, an administrative law judge found that Tressler had suffered from a severe back impairment, variously categorized as degenerative disc disease L5-S1, disc syndrome, and possible ruptured lumbar disc; that the existence of this severe back impairment had been established by clinical findings, including absence of reflex in the right leg, numbness in leg and foot, paresthesia, and also by the results of objective diagnostic studies, consisting of x-ray examination, lumbar myelogram, and lumbar venogram; that Tressler\u2019s symptoms included severe back pain, radicular syndrome, pain and weakness in the leg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and foot, paresthesia, and greatly restricted capacity for physical activity; that his testimony with regard to symptomatology was fully credible and therefore he was disabled and entitled to disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration (hereinafter \u201cAC\u201d) elected to review this decision on its own motion and notified Tressler that it proposed to find that Tressler was not disabled. Tres-sler was given an opportunity to present written argument to the AC. No additional evidence was presented to the AC. The AC found that the medical evidence revealed that Tressler\u2019s back condition caused severe impairment which significantly restricted his ability to perform work activities. However, the AC also found that Tressler retained the capacity to perform sedentary work as defined by the regulations. In reaching its conclusion, the AC discounted the testimony of Tressler\u2019s physician, Dr. Dolan, whose opinion it was that Tressler was totally disabled. The AC did not identify any other expert opinion or other evidence supporting its rejection of Dr. Dolan\u2019s conclusion. The AC found that plaintiff was not disabled and reversed the decision of the administrative law judge. The decision of the AC represents, the final decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The final decision of the AC was appealed to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3). The Magistrate to whom the case was referred found no medical evidence to support the AC\u2019s conclusion that Tressler had residual functional capacity to perform work related activities. The Magistrate found that since there was substantial medical evidence to support the AU\u2019s findings as to the credibility of Tressler\u2019s reports of pain, and since there was no evidence to the contrary, the AC\u2019s decision to review this case on its own motion was contrary to its own regulations. The Magistrate also found that the decision adopted by the AC was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The district judge issued an Order and Judgment approving and adopting the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate, and accordingly, ordered that the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment be denied and that Tressler\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment be granted. The court entered summary judgment in favor of Tressler and against the defendant for a period of disability commencing on May 31, 1980 and awarding appropriate disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits pursuant to the Social Security Act as a result thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Tressler then filed a Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees pursuant to the EAJA, asserting that the action of the AC was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d The district court denied the motion noting that there was \u201csome reasonable basis in the record for the Appeals Council\u2019s reversal of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision . . . . \u201d, App. 24, and that \u201cthere was a reasonable basis for the Appeals Council to decide that the Plaintiff was capable of some sedentary work.\u201d App. 23. Tressler appeals the denial of this motion. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">It is settled law in this Circuit that the Equal Access to Justice Act applies to judicial review actions brought pursuant to the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). <em>Brown v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services of the United States, </em>747 F.2d 878 (3d Cir. 1984); <em>accord, Guthrie v. Schweiker, </em>718 F.2d 104, 107 (4th Cir.1983); <em>McGill v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>712 F.2d 28, 30 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1420, 79 L.Ed.2d 745 (1984). <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 12, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4953 at 4991.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">The EAJA provides that \u201ca court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States\u201d reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, in addition to costs, \u201cincurred by that party in any civil action ... brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The EAJA sets forth two important prerequisites to any award of attorney\u2019s fees. First, the court must determine that the claimant was a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Second, after the claimant has \u201cprevailed,\u201d the court must then make the further finding that the position of the government was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d and that no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d make an award of fees unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">We hold that the district court improperly applied the standard established in this Circuit by which fee awards against the government are to be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">First, the district court failed to address the initial prerequisite for an award of attorney\u2019s fees; that is, it failed to determine whether Tressler was a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d We hold that Tressler is clearly a \u201cprevailing party\u201d; the court awarded Tressler all the relief that he requested. <em>See Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S.E.P.A., </em>703 F.2d 700, 704 n. 5 (3d Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Second, the district court failed to apply properly the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d prerequisite as defined by this Circuit. In four successive opinions, this Circuit has set out the standard that must be applied by district courts on motions for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. <em>Goldhaber v. Foley, </em>698 F.2d 193 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S.E.P.A., </em>703 F.2d 700 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>711 F.2d 555 (3d Cir.1983); and <em>Brown v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services of the United States, </em>747 F.2d 878 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">The district court misunderstood the range of the discretion granted to it under the EAJA. The decision to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 2412(d) \u201cdirects that the district courts <em>\u2018shall award\u2019 </em>fees and expenses to a prevailing party unless the court finds that the position of the United States was \u2018substantially justified.\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (Supp.IV 1980).\u201d <em>Goldhaber, </em>698 F.2d at 195-96 (emphasis added). Despite the clarity of the statute, the district court incorrectly interpreted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 as <em>\u201callowing] </em>a court to award ... reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party other than the United States, unless the court finds that ... the position of the United States was substantially justified ...\u201d (Memorandum and Order, App. 23); a better interpretation would require that \u201cEAJA provides for <em>mandatory </em>award of counsel fees to a qualified prevailing party.\u201d <em>National Resources Defense Council, </em>703 F.2d at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">It is true that the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d standard does not promise an automatic award of fees. In this Circuit, the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d standard has been interpreted as \u201ca middle ground between an automatic award of fees to a prevailing party and an award made only when the government\u2019s position was frivolous.\u201d <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>711 F.2d at 563, <em>citing Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. U.S.E.P.A., </em>703 F.2d at 708, 711 (opinion announcing judgment of the court); <em>id. </em>at 714-15 (concurring opinion); <em>id. </em>at 719 (concurring and dissenting opinion). This Circuit has defined the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d standard as \u201cessentially one of reasonableness, not in terms of result, but in terms of whether the government\u2019s position, even though unsuccessfully taken, had a reasonable basis both in law and fact.\u201d <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>711 F.2d at 563; <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>703 F.2d at 700; <em>see S &amp; H Riggers &amp; Erectors v. O.S.H. R.C., </em>672 F.2d 426, 429-30 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Spencer v. N.L.R.B., </em>548 F.Supp. 256, 260-61 (D.D.C.1982); <em>Wolverton v. Schweiker, </em>533 F.Supp. 420, 425 (D.Idaho 1982); <em>Berman v. Schweiker, </em>531 F.Supp. 1149, 1154 (N.D.Ill.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">In <em>Dougherty </em>we set out a three part test that the government must satisfy in order to sustain its burden of proving substantial justification of both law and fact: \u201cFirst, ... that there is a reasonable basis in truth for the facts alleged in the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ings. ... Second, ... that there exists a reasonable basis in law for the theory which it propounds .... Finally, ... that the facts alleged will reasonably support the legal theory advanced.\u201d <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>711 F.2d at 564. \u201cThus, having met these requirements, if the government\u2019s legal theory as applied to the facts, reasonably supports the Secretary\u2019s position, even though the government may not have ultimately prevailed, then the government will have proven that the \u2018position of the United States was substantially justified.\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Applying this standard to the present controversy, we conclude that the district court erred in determining that the Secretary\u2019s position was substantially justified. A review of the entire record reveals that nowhere did the Secretary offer evidence that the facts found by the AC had a reasonable basis in truth, that the AC\u2019s interpretation of the law had a reasonable basis in theory, or that the facts found by the AC supported any legal theory for denying benefits. The district court failed to address whether the Secretary had made the tripartite showing of proof required by <em>Dougherty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Instead of requiring the Secretary to meet the tripartite <em>Dougherty </em>test, the district court concluded that the government\u2019s position was reasonable because \u201cthe medical testimony adduced, while recognizing Plaintiff\u2019s disc infirmity, contains some evidence to support a conclusion that Plaintiff was not totally precluded from doing any work.\u201d App. 23. Thus, it appears that the district court has read the standard so that the government will meet its burden if it is able to show \u201csome evidence\u201d to support a conclusion that the claimant could do some work. Numerous cases establish that this is not the legal standard for disability. Reliance on some evidence that a claimant can do some work is not \u201csubstantial justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Indeed, adherence to a strict standard of substantial justification is critically important when a case involves a plaintiff who succeeded on the first review, but because of governmental actions was forced through several more adjudications, at his own expense. As we stated in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S.E.P.A., </em>703 F.2d 700, 712 (3d Cir.1983): \u201cFor its action to be substantially justified, the government must make a \u2018strong showing\u2019 that its position was substantially justified.\u201d (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 16, 18 <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4953, 4984, 4995, 4997).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Tressler\u2019s Motion for an Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The judgment appealed from will be reversed and the case remanded for determination of the amount of an award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\">.
