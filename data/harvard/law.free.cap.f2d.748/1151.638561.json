Both parties appeal. We affirm. The basic facts are that defendant wished to replace plaintiff as an intermediary in selling defendant\u2019s polyvinylchloride pipe (PVCP) to contractors and to make direct sales to such customers: To accomplish this defendant (pursuant to its powers under its contract with plaintiff) obliged plaintiff to quote higher prices than defendant offered, after assuring plaintiff that it would be permitted to quote competitive prices. The trial judge moulded the verdict so as to award a single sum as compensatory damages, although separate claims had been submitted to the jury on breach of contract and fraud theories arising out of the same transactions. Defendant argues on appeal a variety of evidentiary and credibility issues, emphasizing inconsistencies in plaintiff\u2019s testimony, but we find that the jury\u2019s determination, under proper instructions, has resolved these questions and should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-19\">For a full explanation of the course of the litigation it will be necessary to follow \u201ca long, long trail a-winding\u201d into the history of the relations and negotiations between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-20\">Plaintiff had been a distributor for defendant from 1965 to 1972, but then got a better deal from Robintech, a competitor. Later defendant found it needed the market share controlled by plaintiff, and plaintiff was displeased by Robintech\u2019s actions. Negotiations for takeover of plaintiff by defendant proved abortive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-21\">Then on September 2, 1975, the parties at defendant\u2019s corporate headquarters at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, entered into the contract involved in the case at bar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Disharmony soon arose, however. In the fall of 1976 Ray Blankenship, a friend of plaintiff\u2019s president Roy Lance, left Certain-Teed for Robintech, and plaintiff clandestinely sold Robintech pipe. In May 1977 plaintiff held back over a million dollars it had collected as agent for defendant, and defendant terminated the 1975 contract with plaintiff on May 31, 1977. It would have expired by its own terms on December 31, 1978.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>The contract of September 2, 1975 contained the customary integration clause, and also (without making any reference to a duty to ensure the \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d of prices) gave defendant the power to set prices. Defendant argues vigorously that the written contract does not mention the topic of competitiveness. But it seems clear that such omission is naturally to be expected in order to conform with the requirements of <em>U.S. v. General Electric Co., </em>272 U.S. 476, 484, 47 S.Ct. 192, 194, 71 L.Ed. 362 (1926), regarding the establishment of a genuine agency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And the jury was expressly instructed that evidence of the oral promise that prices set by defendant would be competitive should be considered only with respect to the fraud and unfair dealing aspects of the ease, as distinguished from interpretation of the integrated written contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">The leading Pennsylvania case on the parol evidence rule (a doctrine strenuously argued by defendant) is <em>Gianni v. Russell &amp; Co. Inc., </em>281 Pa. 320, 323-24, 126 A. 791 (1924), which has been often cited and followed. See, <em>e.g., United Refining Co. v. Jenkins, </em>410 Pa. 126, 134, 189 A.2d 574 (1963); <em>Dunn v. Orloff </em>420 Pa. 492, 495-96, 218 A.2d 314 (1966). However, the integration rule yields to a properly established demonstration of fraud inducing and vitiating the execution of the written agreement. <em>Brentwater Homes v. Weibley, </em>471 Pa. 17, 23, 369 A.2d 1172 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">In order to establish fraud, Pennsylvania, as many States do; requires proof of (1) false or fraudulent representation; (2) which defendant knew, or ought to have known, was false; (3) which is intended to be acted upon by plaintiff; (4) which in fact was acted upon and justifiably relied upon by plaintiff; (5) to his detriment. <em>Emery v. Third National Bank, </em>314 Pa. 544, 548, 171 A. 881 (1934); <em>Neuman v. Corn Exchange Bank, </em>356 Pa. 442, 450 (1947); <em>Lake v. Thompson, </em>366 Pa. 352, 356, 77 A.2d 364 (1951); <em>Scaife Co. v. Rockwell-Standard Co., </em>446 Pa. 280, 285, 285 A.2d 451 (1971); <em>Weibley, supra, </em>471 Pa. at 23, 369 A.2d 1172; <em>Delehanty v. First Pennsylvania Bank, </em>318 Pa.Super. 90, 464 A.2d 1243, 1251-52 (1983). It is clear that under Pennsylvania law \u201cA statement of present intention which is false when uttered may constitute a fraudulent misrepresentation of a fact.\u201d 471 Pa. at 23, 369 A.2d 1172; <em>Watercolor Group v. Newbauer, </em>468 Pa. 103, 115-16, 360 A.2d 200 (1976). As Bowen, L.J. observed long ago in <em>Edgington v. Fitzmaurice, </em>29 Ch.Div. 459, 483 (1885): \u201cThe state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man\u2019s mind, at a particular time, is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man\u2019s mind is, therefore, a misrepresentation of a fact.\u201d Such is likewise the law of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">The jury in the case at bar was likewise instructed that proof of fraud must be \u201cclear, precise and convincing.\u201d This instruction comports with the law of Pennsylvania, where \u201cIt is well settled that fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Somerset Co. Memorial Park, </em>372 Pa. 338, 341, 93 A.2d 440 (1943); <em>Gerfin v. Colonial Smelting &amp; Refining Co., </em>374 Pa. 66, 67, 97 A.2d 71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>(1953).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This test was met by plaintiffs testimony at the first trial and also at the second. Issues as to inconsistencies, conflicts, and credibility are for resolution by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\">With respect to evidentiary rulings, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. \u201cWe will reverse the court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony only upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Spray-Rite Service Corp. v. Monsanto Co., </em>684 F.2d 1226, 1241 (7th Cir.1982). This court on the prior appeal left to .the trial court the question whether the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s expert Dr. Roger Kormendi was admissible to prove damages (638 F.2d at 1085 n. 32). Judge Baker had excluded it at the first trial as too speculative, and Judge Morgan at a pretrial on remand had reached the same conclusion. Judge Mihm adhered to that ruling, but permitted plaintiff, which would otherwise have had no proof of damages, to introduce calculations based on comparable sales by Robintech during the period of time involved. This type of evidence of sales in the same market of the same product, under the circumstances, seems acceptable as a reasonable approximation of the amount of damages when the fact of damage is established but the precise amount is not ascertainable with certainty. <em>Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., </em>273 U.S. 359, 379, 47 S.Ct. 400, 71 L.Ed. 684 (1927); <em>Spray-Rite Service Corp. v. Monsanto Co., </em>684 F.2d 1226, 1242 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Darlington v. Bucks Co. Pub. Svce. Co., </em>303 Pa. 288, 293, 154 A. 501 (1931); <em>Hahn v. Andrews, </em>182 Pa.Super. 338, 345, 126 A.2d 519 (1956); <em>Macan v. Scandinavia Belting Co., </em>264 Pa. 384, 392-93, 107 A. 750 (1919); <em>Scaife Co. v. Rockwell-Standard Corp., </em>446 Pa. 280, 291 n. 5, 285 A.2d 451 (1971). The liberal attitude of Pennsylvania courts on this issue is shown by a recent Superior Court case, <em>Delehanty v. First Pennsylvania Bank, </em>464 A.2d 1243, 1257-1261 (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This accords with decisions of this Court. <em>Canada Dry Corp. v. Nehi Beverage Co., Inc., </em>723 F.2d 512, 522-23 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Hannigan v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>410 F.2d 285, 293 (7th Cir.1969); <em>B. Constantino &amp; Sons Co. v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>234 F.2d 902, 903-904 (7th Cir.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">Plaintiff also assails the evidentiary rulings of the trial court, in excluding the expert\u2019s testimony and defendant\u2019s internal projections as speculative. But we are disinclined to overrule the discretion of the trial court in a matter where considerable uncertainty is inherent in the estimation of future probabilities, and the trial court can better assess the reliability of the witnesses and the data and procedures they employ. This is particularly true in the case at bar, where the volatile fluctuations of the pipe market are plainly shown by the price levels of PYC pipe in consecutive years, which varied widely in accordance with the vicissitudes of OPEC control over oil prices. We shall sustain the trial judge\u2019s rulings, which though assailed by both plaintiff and defendant, were fair and reasonable, and worked no injustice to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">The most troublesome questions presented on this appeal relate to the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>punitive damages and of \u201cpre-judgment interest\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">However, it is clear that punitive damages are not a mere automatic incident of victory in proving a defendant\u2019s wrongful action; there must be something aggravated and outrageous about the conduct, calling for a remedy which will both punish the wrongdoer and deter others from like transgressions. To ensure that the penalizing monetary exaction will have a' painful effect on the wrongdoer, it is permissible to show the financial condition or wealth of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Nevertheless it is clear that in Pennsylvania, contrary to the rule in Illinois <em>[Hannigan v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>410 F.2d 285, 294 (7th Cir.1969) ] punitive damages must be proportional to the compensatory damages, and bear a reasonable relation thereto. <em>Hughes v. Babcock, </em>349 Pa. 475, 481, 37 A.2d 551 (1944); <em>Givens v. W.J. Gilmore Drug Store, </em>337 Pa. 278, 285, 10 A.2d 12 (1940); <em>Chambers v. Montgomery, </em>411 Pa. 339, 344-45, 192 A.2d 355 (1963); <em>Delehanty v. First Pennsylvania Bank, </em>318 Pa.Super. 90, 464 A.2d 1243, 1262-66 (1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There can be no punitive damages if there are not compensatory damages. <em>Hilbert v. Roth, </em>395 Pa. 270, 276, 149 A.2d 648 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">In view of the familiar triple damages in anti-trust cases, there seemed some doubt as to whether the punitive damages here were excessive. In <em>Voltz v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, </em>332 Pa. 141, 145, 2 A.2d 697 (1938), an award of $2500 punitive damages was reduced to $1000 where the compensatory damages were $800. In <em>Givens, supra, </em>337 Pa. at 285, 10 A.2d 12, it was said that in <em>Voltz </em>\u201cpunitive damages more than treble the actual damages, were declared excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">But later cases indicate that there is no fixed ratio which must be maintained. In the <em>First Pennsylvania Bank </em>a proportion of 11 to 1 was sustained. In <em>Chuy v. Philadelphia Eagles, </em>595 F.2d 1265, 1279 (3rd Cir.1979) a ratio of 6 to 1 was upheld. In view of all the circumstances we are unable to say that the figures in the case at bar are not in conformity with current Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">We turn now to the question of pre-judgment interest. We begin by noting that \u201cit is now the settled law in this Commonwealth that interest, as such, is not allowed in tort actions when the damages sought to be recovered are unliquidated.\u201d However, an exception to this rule is made in cases where the tort remedy consists in compensation for the destruction of property (as by fire) and it is possible to measure the amount of compensation by market value, or other definite standards.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Marrazzo v. Scranton Nehi Bottling Co., </em>438 Pa. 72, 74, 263 A.2d 336 (1970). See also <em>Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank v. Brink\u2019s Inc., </em>422 Pa. 48, 57, 220 A.2d 827 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-14\">For breach of contract the rule <em>certum est quod reddi potest </em>set forth in Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 337(a) is also the law of Pennsylvania. <em>Penneys v. Penna. R.R. Co., </em>408 Pa. 276, 279, 183 A.2d 544 (1962). The legal rate of interest is allowed in contract cases. <em>Peterson v. Crown Financial Corp., </em>661 F.2d 287, 292-95 (3rd Cir.1981).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In that case the Third Circuit held that mere extortionate detention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>money by a financial institution did not fall within Restatement \u00a7 337(a) but that the remedy was in the nature of equitable restitution of money unjustly received and that the court has discretion to award interest at a rate higher than the legal rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">As Judge Aldisert explained in <em>American Enka Co. v. Wicaco Machine Corp., </em>686 F.2d 1050, 1056-57 (3rd Cir.1982), the award under \u00a7 337(a) is properly described as \u201cpre-judgment interest\u201d but the award under the <em>Marrazzo </em>rationale is \u201cdamages for delay.\u201d In personal injury cases no damages for delay are recoverable, since the damages are not assessed until the date of trial. <em>Ibid., </em>at 1056 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Since the rate of \u201cdamages for delay\u201d and \u201ctrue prejudgment interest\u201d are both measured at the legal rate of 6% it is immaterial whether the case at bar is treated as a tort or contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">It remains, however, to consider the effect of Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 238. If applicable by its terms, this rule must be followed by federal courts as \u201coutcome-determinative\u201d under the doctrine of <em>Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). This was decided in <em>Jarvis v. Johnson, </em>668 F.2d 740, 744-45 (3rd Cir.1982). Paradoxically, the constitutionality of the Supreme Court\u2019s power to enact the rule was justified on the basis that it was procedural rather than substantive, and that its purpose was to encourage early settlement of cases (thus depriving insurance companies of the \u201cfloat\u201d on reserves for pending litigation and getting the money sooner to the injured plaintiffs).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Under Rule 238 \u201cdamages for delay at ten (10) per cent per annum, not compounded\u201d shall be added \u201cto the amount of compensatory damages,\u201d but only in actions \u201cseeking monetary relief for bodily injury, death or property damage, or any combination thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">In light of the legislative purpose we do not feel justified, in the absence of Pennsylvania decisions on the point, to accept plaintiff\u2019s argument that the words \u201cproperty damage\u201d in the Rule include the decline of plaintiff\u2019s profits from sales of PVC pipe by reason of defendant\u2019s machinations. We consider it more probable that the rule contemplates motor vehicle collisions, where \u201cbodily injury, death or property damage\u201d are often likely to occur in the same tort litigation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that Rule 238 applies only to tort cases, not contract cases. <em>Reliance Universal Inc. v. Ernest Renda Contracting Co., </em>308 Pa.Super. 98, 107, 454 A.2d 39 (1982).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s interpretation would seem to be a novel form of the now discredited dogma of \u201cliberty of contract\u201d as a property right. Roscoe Pound, <em>Jurisprudence </em>(1959) I, 95-96, 425. As Justice Holmes remarked on this subject: \u201cBy calling a business \u2018property\u2019 you make it seem like land ... An established business no doubt may have pecuniary value and commonly is protected by law against various unjustified injuries. But you cannot give it definiteness of contour by calling it a thing. It is a course of conduct . . . .\u201d <em>Truax v. Cor-rigan, </em>257 U.S. 312, 342, 42 S.Ct. 124, 133, 66 L.Ed. 254 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-14\">We conclude that neither Rule 238 nor the <em>Marrazzo </em>exception to the general principle of denying prejudgment damages in case of unliquidated tort claims can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>applied to augment the compensatory damages awarded to plaintiff by the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Likewise we can discover no current Pennsylvania authority for translating the amounts of damages awarded for ancient torts into currently depreciated dollars. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-14\">. <em>Contractor Utility Sales Co. Inc. v. Certain-Teed Product Corp., </em>638 F.2d 1061 (7th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">. Executives of defendant reasoned: \u201cWhy buy the cow if we can get the milk for nothing\u201d by signing up plaintiff as an agent? The history of the parties\u2019 dealings and prior course of the litigation is fully described in 638 F.2d at 1067-71 and need be summarized only briefly here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1223-23\">. Hence Pennsylvania law is accepted as governing by the parties and this Court, 638 F.2d at 1080, n. 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1223-24\">. The trial court thus properly allowed damages up through December 31, 1978, as that date ended the period when plaintiff under the contract had the right to sell defendant\u2019s products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">. In Certain-Teed\u2019s \"Strategic Plan,\u201d developed by William Krifsky and dated July 22, 1975, to increase market share by direct selling at the expense of independent agents, it is said: \u201cThe key to transitioning to a more flexible marketing approach emphasizing direct Certain-Teed sales as opposed to 'agents\u2019 turns out to be, paradoxically, changing our so-called agents to true agent status.\u201d [Plaintiff\u2019s Appendix, 48-49]. In view of this situation the defendant\u2019s argument based upon the parol evidence rule and the integration clause loses strength, and plaintiffs case establishes \"fraud in the factum.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">. The theory of breach of an implied obligation to deal fairly and in good faith with the other contracting party (which remained in the case for retrial on remand, 638 F.2d at 1081) is in substance a metamorphosis of the fraud claim, and the trial judge appropriately eliminated duplication of damages in the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">. Another familiar formulation of the standard is that \"Evidence of fraud must be \u2018clear, precise, and indubitable\u2019 and the question of determining whether evidence presented is of that quality is a question of law.
