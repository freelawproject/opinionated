We vacate with instructions to remand to the Secretary for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On June 30, 1980, appellant Rita DeRien-zis filed a claim for disability benefits, alleging a June 6, 1980 onset of disability. The Secretary\u2019s initial denial, dated August 14, 1980, was based on the conclusion that the medical evidence did not reveal a severe impairment precluding appellant from engaging in work-related activities without restriction. Appellant\u2019s request for reconsideration was denied on October 14, 1981 on the grounds that there was no medical evidence of disability and appellant had returned to work in January of 1981 in a Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq., </em>earning approximately $569.75 a month. This was considered to be \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). At the request of appellant\u2019s counsel, a hearing was held on July 13, 1982, and, in a decision dated September 17,1982, appellant\u2019s claim for disability benefits again was denied. Appellant\u2019s request for review by the Appeals Council was denied on February 16, 1983, and appellant commenced her district court action on April 21, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The medical evidence of physical and mental disability introduced at the hearing was sufficiently conflicting that, standing alone, it arguably could support a finding either for or against appellant. However, the medical evidence did not stand alone. It is clear that, in rejecting appellant\u2019s claim of disability, the AU was strongly influenced by what he considered to be appellant\u2019s employment record. Although appellant claimed to have been disabled since June 6, 1980, the AU found that she had worked as a clerical aide for New York City\u2019s Department of Buildings from February through June 1981 under a federally sponsored CETA program and that she then worked until November 1981 under another CETA program. After that, appellant worked for the Girl Scouts until February 1982, when she was discharged because her work was unsatisfactory. The AU found that all of this work constituted substantial gainful activity for Social Security purposes, and that appellant\u2019s impairments did not preclude her performance of substantial gainful activity for a continuous period of 12 months at any time between June 1980 and September 17,1982, the date of the AU\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Placing heavy reliance on <em>City of New York v. Heckler, </em>578 F.Supp. 1109 (E.D.N.Y.1984), appellant asserts that she is a member of the class of mentally impaired claimants held entitled in that case to redetermination of their Social Security disability claims, or, in the alternative, that the case is persuasive support for her position by analogy. Appellant\u2019s reliance is misplaced. <em>City of New York v. Heckler </em>addressed the circumstances of those Social Security disability claimants who, although determined by the Secretary to be severely mentally impaired, were deemed capable of substantial gainful employment on the basis of what the court termed \u201cbureaucratic\u201d assessment methods. <em>Id. </em>at 1124. Since appellant has not been found to be severely mentally impaired, she is neither a class member nor a victim of the invalidated assessment procedure. Nonetheless, she is entitled to redetermination of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The Social Security regulations require AUs to follow a sequential procedure in evaluating disability claims. <em>Burkhalter v. Schweiker, </em>711 F.2d 841, 843 (8th Cir.1983). As a first step, the AU must determine whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity, and if he or she is, benefits must be denied regardless of the claimant\u2019s medical condition. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1520(b). As used in these sections, the term \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d means the performance of substantial services with reasonable regularity in some competitive employment. <em>Markham v. Califano, </em>601 F.2d 533, 534 (10th Cir.1979); <em>Cornett v. Califano, </em>590 F.2d 91, 94 (4th Cir.1978); <em>Zimbalist v. Richardson, </em>334 F.Supp. 1350, 1355 (E.D.N.Y.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The purpose of CETA was to establish a program for providing manpower services. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 811. The program was intended to include \u201cthe training, education, and other services needed to enable individuals to secure and retain employment at their maximum capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A letter from the director of the CETA training program in which appellant was enrolled states that she was a student, not an employee. Activities in the nature of therapy or school attendance generally are not considered to be substantial gainful activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1572(c). Moreover, earnings that are not directly related to a claimant\u2019s productivity generally are not treated as income for purposes of determining disability, nor are those portions of earnings that are in the nature of subsidies. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1574(a)(2). When work is subsidized, the AU must investigate to see how much the claimant\u2019s work is worth. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">A claimant working in a sheltered environment may or may not be earning what he or she is paid. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1574(a)(3). Although earnings in such an environment that average more than $300 a month ordinarily will be considered to show engagement in substantial gainful activity, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1574(b)(2)(vi), such evidence is not conclusive. <em>See Van Horn v. Heckler, </em>717 F.2d 1196, 1199-1200 (8th Cir. 1983). A knowledgeable decision as to whether appellant\u2019s activities in what appears to be a sheltered environment are the equivalent of services performed in a competitive environment requires a more searching inquiry than was made by the ALJ to determine to what extent, if any, claimant\u2019s earnings were related to her productivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The judgment of the district court is vacated. The district court is directed to remand the case to the Secretary for a more comprehensive investigation and more complete findings concerning whether appellant\u2019s participation in the CETA program constituted substantial gainful activity under the Act.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
