Heckler, Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, appeals from a June 27, 1983 judgment and subsequent order of the District of Connecticut, M. Joseph Blumenfeld, Judge, granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and directing the Secretary, subject to a phase-in period and certain exceptions primarily for delays caused by the claimants, to decide all appeals from Part A Medicare benefit denials within 165 days of their filing and to report periodically to the court on her progress in doing so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are a certified class of Connecticut residents who face or have faced lengthy delays in their appeals from denials of Part A Medicare benefits, and they seek to impose a time limit on the Secretary\u2019s resolution of such appeals. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2249, 81 L.Ed.2d 88 (1984), the Secretary alleges that the judgment below must be reversed because it conflicts with Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>gress\u2019 decision not to impose a time limit on her review. We agree and, accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Medicare Part A benefits, created under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395c <em>et seq. </em>(1982), pay, without consideration of financial need, certain health care costs of the aged and the disabled. The benefits are usually paid to the provider of the medical services through a fiscal intermediary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h (1982). If the intermediary determines that a claim is not covered by Part A Medicare benefits, it notifies the provider of the health care and the claimant by letter. A claimant who is dissatisfied with the intermediary\u2019s determination may seek a reconsideration, and, under \u00a7 1395ff(b), a claimant still dissatisfied after such reconsideration is entitled to a \u201chearing ... by the Secretary to the same extent as is provided in \u00a7 405(b) of this title.\u201d Section 405(b) provides rejected Social Security disability claimants with \u201creasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing\u201d before an administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>104 S.Ct. 2249 (1984), the Supreme Court struck down the imposition by the District Court for the District of Vermont of a 90-day time limit, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b), on the Secretary\u2019s resolution of appeals from denials of Social Security disability benefits. In overturning the judicially imposed time limit, the Court noted that Congress\u2019 failure to specify a time limit in \u00a7 405(b) must have been intentional because that section is part of a complex statute which sometimes imposes a time limit on administrative review, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(2) (Supplemental Security Income old age and survivor benefits), and sometimes, as in the case of \u00a7 405(b), does not. <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2257. More important to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was Congress\u2019 repeated rejection of statutory amendments that would have imposed such a time limit on review under \u00a7 405(b). <em>Id. </em>at 2254-55. In each instance, the Court noted, Congress rejected the time limit in order to insure that the Secretary had sufficient time to consider properly the many disability appeals filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Since, in granting claimants a right to administrative review of denials of Part A Medicare benefits, \u00a7 1395ff(b) incorporates the provisions of \u00a7 405(b), the same section at issue in <em>Day, </em>the imposition of a time limit by the district court cannot stand. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Day, </em>the courts must defer to Congress\u2019 explicit decision not to include in \u00a7 405(b) a time limit on the Secretary\u2019s review. Although much of Congress\u2019 discussion in declining to amend \u00a7 405(b) focused on disability claims, Congress must have intended that its decision also affect Part A Medicare claims. In addition, the argument that the harsh consequences of delay require a time limit despite Congress\u2019 failure to create one expressly is less persuasive here than it was in <em>Day </em>because, as the district court noted and as all parties concede, Part A Medicare benefit claimants, whose eligibility for benefits is not dependent on financial need, as a class are less likely to be harmed by delay than disability claimants whose financial need is likely to make delay particularly burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-16\">. In choosing a 165 day limit, the district court adopted a time limit that was first proposed by the Secretary when the Sixth Circuit, rather than imposing a judicially devised deadline, ordered the Department to promulgate a time limit for the disposition of appeals from denials of Old Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income benefits. <em>See Blankenship v. Secretary of HEW, </em>587 F.2d 329 (6th Cir.1978). The district court chose this time limit, rather than the 120 day limit that the plaintiffs sought and that other courts had applied to wage earner\u2019s disability appeals and Supplemental Security Income appeals, because it determined that Part A Medicare claimants, whose eligibility is not based on financial need, as a class suffer less from delay than the claimants to whom the 120 day limit had been applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
