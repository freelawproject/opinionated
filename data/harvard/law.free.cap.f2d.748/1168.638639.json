The order awarded attorneys\u2019 fees of $30,000 and directed that this allowance \u201cbe assessed against absent class members\u201d. This Court has jurisdiction of the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">The order below and the present appeal came about by reason of a proceeding in the District Court which followed the decision of this Court, made in this same action on March 2, 1981. <em>Holbrook v. Pitt, </em>643 F.2d 1261 (7th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">We now reverse the order from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">This litigation grew out of Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by Section 201(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, codified in part as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f and usually referred to as \u201cSection 8\u201d. This legislation is designed to help lower-income families to secure adequate housing; Section 8 provides a program of housing assistance payments by HUD under contracts with housing project owners on behalf of eligible lower-income tenants. \u201cRental assistance payments\u201d is sometimes used in place of housing assistance payments. The two terms are interchangeable and refer to the described payments by HUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">The Section 8 statute and the Regulations under it provide for the housing assistance payments to be made by HUD to the <em>owner </em>of the dwelling unit occupied by an eligible tenant, and <em>not </em>to the tenant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(b)(l). In the Regulations, under the heading \u201cHousing Assistance Payments to Owners\u201d, is this provision: \u201cHousing Assistance Payments shall be paid <em>to Owners </em>for units under lease by Eligible Families....\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.-109(a); (emphasis supplied). The object is that the owner of the project will receive from HUD the housing assistance payment (a rent subsidy) and will receive from the eligible tenant the difference between the agreed rent and the Section 8 subsidy. As this Court said on the earlier appeal (643 F.2d at 1268-69; emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-14\">Upon the completion of certification of eligible families by the owner, HUD makes housing assistance payments <em>to owners </em>on behalf of tenants in accordance with the provisions of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-15\">Plaintiff Holbrook was a tenant in Main Street Gardens, a housing development in Milwaukee owned by defendant Pitt. On June 10, 1976, HUD and Pitt made a contract under Section 8 by which HUD agreed to make housing assistance payments to Pitt, beginning in June 1976, on behalf of eligible tenants of Main Street Gardens; Holbrook was one of these. Pitt, the owner, did not mail promptly to such eligible tenants the necessary Section 8 forms; these were not mailed by Pitt until November 16, 1976. Thus it was that Hol-brook and others were not certified to HUD by Pitt until late November 1976. Between June and November 1976, no housing assistance payments were made by HUD to Pitt and for these months, therefore, Holbrook paid the full, total rent for her housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-16\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-17\">This action was commenced by plaintiff Holbrook in July 1977 as a small claims action for $660.18 in the Milwaukee County Court. The amount claimed was the amount of rental assistance payments which the owner (Pitt) failed to receive from HUD from June through November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>1976, because Pitt had delayed certification to HUD in this period. Holbrook had paid the entire rent for this period and sought reimbursement from Pitt for the amount of the rent subsidy which HUD had failed to pay. Pitt filed in the action a third-party complaint against HUD for failure of HUD to inform Pitt of his obligations under Section 8. HUD then removed the action on February 17, 1978, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">After the action had been removed to the District Court, Holbrook amended her complaint. The original complaint against Pitt was redesignated Count I. Two new counts, II and III, against HUD were added under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and (b)(2) on behalf of classes consisting of all families in Wisconsin who resided or who will reside in housing units when Section 8 contracts were or will be executed between HUD and the owner of those housing units but who have not received or will not receive the benefits of housing assistance payments as of the effective date of the Section 8 contracts. The effort was to secure for the class all rental assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the Section 8 contracts. The theory of Count II was that the Section 8 contracts were for the benefit of the class members as third-party beneficiaries of those contracts. The theory of Count III was that the procedures of HUD in respect of housing assistance payments in the period between the execution of Section 8 contracts and the commencement of housing assistance payments was a violation of the rights of class members to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">By order filed November 6, 1978, Counts II and III were determined by the District Court to be maintainable as a class action. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1). At the same time a decision was filed by the District Court permitting plaintiff Holbrook to represent a class of plaintiffs with respect to Counts II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">On stipulated facts, plaintiff Holbrook and HUD filed cross motions for summary judgment on July 30 and August 1, 1979 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">Pitt then certified Holbrook to HUD as eligible for retroactive rental assistance payments, HUD made the amount of these payments available to Pitt, and Pitt tendered the amount to Holbrook, by whom it was accepted. For all practical purposes, Pitt and Count I disappeared from the action at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">On October 31, 1979, the District Court filed an opinion, reported at 479 F.Supp. 990, granting the motion of HUD for summary judgment dismissing the action and denying the motion of plaintiff for summary judgment. Count I was dismissed as moot, the individual claim of Holbrook having been paid. The class claims in Counts II and III were dismissed on the ground that the tenants had no valid claim to retroactive housing assistance payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">There was then an appeal by plaintiff to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">On March 2, 1981, this Court filed its opinion (written by Judge Cudahy) reversing the judgment of the District Court. 643 F.2d 1261. The theory of Count II was sustained and it was held that the class could recover retroactive housing assistance payments as third-party beneficiaries of the Section 8 contracts between HUD and the housing development owners. The theory of Count III was sustained; it was held that the class members were entitled to retroactive housing assistance payments and to due process of law in respect of procedural protections for that entitlement; on remand, the District Court was directed to \u201cdetermine the precise contours of the requirements of procedural due process....\u201d (643 F.2d at 1281).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-13\">This action dealt with <em>retroactive </em>Section 8 housing assistance payments \u2014 that is, monthly payments due from the date of the Section 8 contract between project owner and HUD and the commencement of actual payments by HUD to the owner for eligible tenants. After the commencement of these payments to the owner by HUD, the amounts payable by the tenants for rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>were reduced by the amount of the HUD rent subsidy. But there was a period after the date of the Section 8 contract when HUD (because of delayed certification by the owner) had not made these subsidy payments and the tenants had been obliged to pay the full rent. This Court ruled that the subsidy payments should be made by HUD from the date of the Section 8 contract. Since, as has been seen, these payments must be made by HUD to the owner and since the owner had already received the full rent from the tenants, there had necessarily to be a reimbursement to the tenants for the excess rent paid by them during the interim period after the date of the Section 8 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">After reversal and remand, plaintiff Hol-brook, as class representative, and HUD made a stipulation of settlement of the action. On April 14, 1982, these parties filed a joint motion for approval by the Court of the stipulation of settlement and on April 29, 1982, the District Court filed an order approving it and dismissing the action with prejudice. So far as appears in the record, no \u201cnotice of the proposed dismissal or compromise\u201d (Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)) was given to members of the class. After the stipulation of settlement had been approved by the District Court, HUD gave notice to class members of the terms of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">In summary, the stipulation of settlement provides that HUD will (1) obtain from the project owners the names and addresses of all tenants eligible for retroactive housing assistance payments and all information necessary to calculate the amounts due to each tenant under the decision of this Court; (2) send by mail a notice in specified form to each eligible tenant \u201cthat HUD will pay retroactive housing assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of the tenant\u201d; (3) publish on two days in a specified Wisconsin newspaper the same notice; (4) provide retroactive housing assistance payments to the project owners on behalf of all eligible tenants \u201clocated through the mailed and published notice\u201d; (5) require the project owners to send to the eligible tenants their retroactive housing assistance payments provided by HUD; and (6) further make retroactive housing assistance payments to the project owners on behalf of eligible tenants not located by the mailed or published notice but who request the payments from HUD within a one year period. The result of the settlement is thus that HUD agreed to pay to the project owners, for sending to all eligible tenants located after the specified efforts, the retroactive housing assistance payments due in accordance with this Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">It should be noted that, by reason of the breadth of the classes, the settlement was applicable not simply to eligible tenants in the Main Street Gardens housing project, where plaintiff Holbrook lived, but to all eligible tenants in all housing projects in Wisconsin where Section 8 housing assistance payment contracts had been made. There were some fifty of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">On May 10, 1982, plaintiff Holbrook filed a motion in the District Court under \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2812 and the common fund doctrine\u201d for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The citation to \u201c\u00a7 2812\u201d must have been an error for \u201c\u00a7 2412\u201d, which contains a principal part of the Equal Access to Justice Act (sometimes hereafter \u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cEAJA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">On October 21, 1982, the District Court filed a decision and order that \u201con plaintiff\u2019s motion for an allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees the sum of $30,000 be and hereby is determined as such reasonable fee\u201d. Nothing was said in the motion nor in the decision and order about the source of the attorneys\u2019 fee, nor by whom it should be paid, nor to whom, nor when. It was presumably intended to be payable by HUD to counsel of record for plaintiff Holbrook when the order became final. It was stated in the decision and order: \u201cIn addition, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel ask the Court to rule that the full fee be assessed against absent class members. This request will be granted.\u201d How the \u201cfull fee\u201d of $30,000 allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>was to be \u201cassessed against absent class members\u201d was not mentioned. Presumably HUD was expected to write out a check in payment of the $30,000 and it would then be up to HUD to obtain reimbursement by assessing the \u201cabsent class members\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">The District Court made two statements of the grounds on which it allowed attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiff. The first was that, as the \u201cprevailing party\u201d, plaintiff was \u201centitled\u201d to attorneys\u2019 fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. The second was that such fees \u201cmay be recovered from the United States only \u2018to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b). I find that the non-statutory common fund doctrine is applicable in the circumstances of this case\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">The order of allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees, filed October 21, 1982, was then, by timely notice of appeal, brought here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">The argument for appellee to justify the award made below is, as we understand it, in two separate parts: (a) the award was proper under the Equal Access to Justice Act, specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b); and (b) the award was proper under the common fund doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">Before discussing these arguments, we must observe that they are based on what appears to be a serious misconception of some of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">In the Brief for Appellee (p. <em>5.) </em>the first argument is introduced under this heading: \u201cThe District Court was entitled to assess attorney\u2019s fees against the benefits of those class members who did not claim benefits under the judgment\u201d. We are not made aware in the record of any \u201cjudgment\u201d of the District Court conferring \u201cbenefits\u201d on class members. There was a \u201cstipulation of settlement\u201d and an order of approval, but no judgment. We cannot believe that the \u201cjudgment\u201d to which appellee directs attention is meant to refer to the earlier decision of this Court. That decision, while favorable to the class members, was not a judgment nor a \u201cdecree\u201d (as stated in the \u201cstipulation of settlement\u201d). The earlier decision of this Court did not end the action; the decision remanded the action \u201cfor further proceedings in accordance with this opinion\u201d. Because of the settlement there were no \u201cfurther proceedings\u201d except for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">There are a number of references by appellee in her Brief (e.g., pp. 3, 8, 10, 11, 20) to \u201cfiling of claims by class members\u201d, \u201cproving their individual claims\u201d, \u201cclass members who did not file a claim for benefits\u201d, \u201cclass members who claimed benefits\u201d, \u201cunclaiming class members\u201d, and the like. These expressions assume that the settlement procedure provided for the filing by class members of a claim and thus that class members had an option to make a claim or not. As we read the stipulation of settlement, there was no procedure for class members to file or otherwise to make a claim. The agreed payments (housing assistance payments retroactive to the date of the Section 8 contracts) were required by the settlement as well as by the Section 8 statute to be made by HUD to <em>the owners </em>and by the owners to \u201call tenants ... who have been located through the mailed and published notice\u201d. The mailed and published notice given to the tenant class members said nothing about any \u201cclaim\u201d by class members and the only action suggested to them was to \u201cmake sure that the owner of the Section 8 project where you lived has your present address and telephone number\u201d. The notice advised them that \u201cretroactive housing assistance payments are being provided\u201d for those eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">It is said for appellee (Brief, p. 8) that \u201cthe District Court assessed the entire fee against the shares of those class members who did not file a claim for benefits\u201d. This is not an accurate statement of the order of the District Court. That order stated: \u201c[T]he plaintiff\u2019s counsel ask the court to rule that the full fee be assessed against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number><em>absent </em>class members. This request will be granted\u201d, (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The Equal Access to Justice Act was enacted in 1980, as part of amendments to the Small Business Act. Pub.L. 96-481, Title II, \u00a7 204(a), 94 Stat. 2325. One of the declared purposes in the Act was \u201cto insure the applicability in actions by or against the United States of the common law and statutory exceptions to the \u2018American Rule\u2019 respecting the award of attorney fees\u201d. 94 Stat. 2325. The \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d has been thus described: \u201c... the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee from the loser.\u201d <em>Alyes-ka Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1616, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">The part of the Act on which plaintiff Holbrook relies (Brief, p. 5) to justify the attorneys\u2019 fee awarded below, and the part of the Act on which the District Court relied, is Section 2412(b), as follows (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-7\">Unless expressly prohibited by statute, a court may award reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, in addition to the costs which may be awarded pursuant to subsection (a), to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action. <em>The United States shall be liable for such fees </em>and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">This Court has described the change made by this part of the EAJA as follows <em>(Ber-man v. Schweiker, </em>713 F.2d 1290,1295 (7th Cir.1983); emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-9\">Before the EAJA, Section 2412 authorized an award of attorneys\u2019 fees <em>against the United States </em>only where specifically provided by statute. The EAJA amended this section to provide that if certain conditions are met any prevailing party may apply for attorneys\u2019 fees <em>against the government </em>unless such fees are expressly prohibited by another statute. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">The argument for plaintiff appellee here is that under the common fund doctrine \u201cany other party would be liable\u201d (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b)) for attorneys' fees and therefore the United States under the EAJA can be made liable. As expressed in the Brief for appellee (p. 6), \u201cthe EAJA removed the federal government\u2019s exemption from attorney\u2019s fees under the common fund doctrine\u201d. The District Court appears to have accepted this argument. We are not able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">The common fund doctrine, an historic remedy of equity, deals with the liability for attorneys\u2019 fees of a <em>fund </em>over which the Court has jurisdiction, and not with the liability of a losing <em>party </em>for attorneys\u2019 fees of a winning <em>party. </em>The EAJA deals with the liability of the United States as a <em>party </em>for attorneys\u2019 fees; the common fund doctrine deals with the liability of a <em>fund </em>for attorneys\u2019 fees. The two concepts are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">The difference in the two concepts was succinctly recognized in an opinion for the Ninth Circuit on attorneys\u2019 fees last year <em>(McQuiston v. Marsh, </em>707 F.2d 1082, 1085):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAdZ\">\u201cFirst, the common benefit theory fails because McQuiston is seeking an award from the opposing party, not from a common fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">The Supreme Court has explained the common fund doctrine in some detail in <em>Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, </em>444 U.S. 472, 478-481, 100 S.Ct. 745, 749-751, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980); (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-15\">[Tjhis Court has recognized consistently that a litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee <em>from the fund as a </em>whole . . . . The common-fund doctrine reflects the traditional practice in courts of equity, ... and it stands as a well-recognized exception to the general principle that requires every litigant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>bear his own attorney\u2019s fees, . . . . The doctrine rests on the perception that persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its cost are unjustly enriched at the successful litigant\u2019s expense . . . . Jurisdiction over the fund involved in the litigation allows a court to prevent this inequity by assessing attorney\u2019s fees <em>against the entire fund, </em>thus spreading fees proportionately among those benefited by the suit . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-5\">* * * * sk *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-6\">The common-fund doctrine, as applied in this case, is entirely consistent with the American rule against taxing the losing party with the victor's attorney\u2019s fees . . . . The District Court\u2019s judgment assesses attorney\u2019s fee <em>against a fund </em>awarded to the prevailing class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">The Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b), on which appellee relies, deals entirely with the liability of an adversary <em>party </em>for attorneys\u2019 fees. Section 2412(b) declares: \u201cThe United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law . . . .\u201d The common fund doctrine would, if applicable, make a <em>fund </em>liable, but not an adversary party, such as the United States through HUD. There are provisions of the EAJA other than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b) under which appellee might have sought attorneys\u2019 fees from the United States through HUD, but did not do so. For example, there is a provision of the EAJA that the court \u201cshall award\u201d an attorney\u2019s fee against the United States to a \u201cprevailing party ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified ...\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) Plaintiff Holbrook did not seek attorneys\u2019 fees under this section, undoubtedly because it is evident that the position of the United States in the litigation was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d inasmuch as summary judgment was granted to the United States in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">That the EAJA in Section 2412(b) does not authorize any award of attorneys\u2019 fees from a common fund appears from Section 2412(c)(2), which provides that (except where based on bad faith) any judgment \u201cfor fees and expenses of attorneys pursuant to subsection (b) shall be paid as provided in sections 2414 and 2517 of this title ... \u201d. It is Section 2414 which is applicable to judgments of a District Court and which provides in relevant part; \u201c[Pjayment of final judgments rendered by a district court ... against the United States shall be made on settlements by the General Accounting Office\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-14\">. We find nothing in the EAJA which would authorize the award of attorneys\u2019 fees made by the District Court in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-15\">8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-16\">Without regard to the EAJA, plaintiff Holbrook would be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the common fund doctrine standing alone, if that doctrine were applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-17\">In the circumstances of this case, the common fund doctrine cannot be applied because there is no \u201ccommon fund\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-18\">While the District Court found the doctrine \u201capplicable\u201d, the \u201cfund\u201d was not identified nor was there any direction for any payment from any \u201cfund\u201d or by anybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-19\">Nothing done by plaintiff Holbrook nor by her attorneys created any \u201cfund\u201d. There was never any judgment for plaintiff nor for the classes which created any fund. Nothing in the way of money or otherwise was transferred by HUD to any fund as a result of this action. There was simply a stipulation of settlement under which, as a matter of contract obligation, HUD agreed \u201cto provide retroactive housing assistance payments to the project owners on behalf of all tenants described in Paragraph Two who have been located through the mailed and published notice\u201d. HUD further agreed to \u201crequire the project owners to send the retroactive housing assistance payments to the named tenants\u201d. Nothing was said as to where HUD would obtain the funds from which to make its promised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>payments to the project owners; it was simply an obligation of HUD to provide the payments from any source it saw fit to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">At the time the Section 8 contract was made by HUD with Pitt, and of course long before this action was commenced, an account was set up on the books of HUD, under Regulations of the Secretary (24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.108(c)(1)), for the Main Street Gardens project, to which account were to be charged housing assistance payments and \u201cother costs\u201d authorized by the Secretary. This account is referred to in the Regulations as a \u201cProject Account\u201d to be established and maintained by HUD \u201cas a specifically identified and segregated account\u201d. This account was established on June 10, 1976, in the sum of $173,460. Presumably, similar accounts were set up by HUD on its books in respect of each Section 8 project in Wisconsin. What amounts were entered as credits and debits to these accounts does not appear in the record, nor the present balance from the book entries made to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">So far as we can tell from the record, these numerous accounts represent entries on the books of HUD, made under applicable regulations before the commencement of this action. It is not shown that they represent money balances in any earmarked accounts subject to the control of HUD at the United States Treasury nor at any other financial institution. The District Court made no order that the attorneys\u2019 fee award be paid from any designated fund. AH that appears is that HUD has a contract obligation to pay to project owners for transmittal to eligible tenants retroactive housing assistance payments in an amount to be calculated according to the formula set out in the settlement stipulation; HUD is then to assess the amount against \u201cabsent class members\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">We have taken note of the statement in a footnote to the earlier opinion of this Court (643 F.2d at 1275, n. 28) that HUD \u201chas created an identifiable <em>res </em>to which the tenants have a claim ...\u201d. This statement appears in a discussion of the obligation of HUD to make housing assistance payments from the date of the Section 8 contracts rather than from the date of the owner\u2019s certification. It is entirely remote from the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees from a fund under the jurisdiction of the Court created by one litigant for the benefit of a numerous class who would be unjustly enriched if they did not contribute to the cost of creating the fund. \u201cJurisdiction over the fund involved in the litigation allows a court to prevent this inequity by assessing attorney\u2019s fees against the entire fund, thus spreading fees proportionately among those benefited by the suit\u201d. <em>Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, </em>444 U.S. 472, 478, 100 S.Ct. 745, 749, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">It is not shown that there is any common fund created by the litigation from which attorneys' fees can be paid, and the District Court, while invoking the \u201ccommon fund doctrine,\u201d did not in fact order payment from any fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">The common fund doctrine does not authorize the order made below as to attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">Before ending consideration of the common fund doctrine, it may be well to indicate that, even if there were a common fund from which attorneys\u2019 fees could be paid, the manner of payment ordered by the District Court was entirely erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">, A basic principle of the common fund doctrine is that fees and expenses of attorneys shall be paid from the entire fund in order that <em>each person </em>benefited shall pay a proportionate part of those expenses. This principle led the Supreme Court to emphasize that the common fund doctrine requires that attorneys\u2019 fees be charged \"against the entire fund, thus spreading fees proportionately among those benefited by the suit\u201d. <em>Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, </em>444 U.S. 472, 478, 100 S.Ct. 745, 749, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980). The District Court order did not do this; it purported to assess all fees against \u201cabsent class members\u201d which would mean those class members not \u201clocated\u201d by the project owner. No payments could be sent to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>and they could never benefit from the suit. The order below ordered \u201cabsent class members\u201d, who did not benefit from the suit, to pay all the fees of attorneys and ordered that those class members who did benefit from the suit pay nothing toward the fees of attorneys. No such order can stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">As a last resort, appellee seeks to justify the order below under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fee Award Act of 1976). This point was not raised in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">The cited Act authorizes an award of counsel fees in actions under specific enumerated sections of the Civil Rights laws. The case at bar was not brought under any of these sections, but appellee relies on <em>Lauritzen v. Secretary of the Navy, </em>546 F.Supp. 1221 (C.D.Cal.1982) for an expansion of EAJA to include fee allowances in actions \u201cequivalent\u201d to those enumerated in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">There is a short answer to this argument for the order on appeal. This Court, in <em>Saxner v. Benson, </em>727 F.2d 669, 673 (1984) declined to accept a similar argument, that the EAJA be expanded to include fees in actions \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to an action enumerated in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Moreover, <em>Lauritzen v. Secretary </em>has been reversed on this point by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Lauritzen v. Lehman, </em>736 F.2d 550, 553\u2014 559 (July 5, 1984), citing the <em>Saxner </em>decision of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">The order appealed from is reversed and vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
