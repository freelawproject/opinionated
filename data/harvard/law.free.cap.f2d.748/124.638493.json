CBS, Inc., </em>743 F.2d 969 (2d Cir.1984). CBS opposes the motion, arguing .essentially that the relief requested is unnecessary and imprudent in light of the concluding paragraph of our opinion which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">The order of the district court is reversed and the action is remanded to the district court with a direction to dismiss the complaint. The judgment to be entered on this appeal shall be stayed until December 31, 1984. If prior to that date congress shall pass legislation affecting the authority of the plaintiff to maintain this action, the district court shall then conduct such further proceedings as may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">743 F.2d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We deny the motion. The panel\u2019s opinion and resulting judgment contemplated possible remedial action by congress, which has now occurred. As a result of our opinion and judgment, therefore, the case has been remanded to the district court for further proceedings as may be appropriate, including, if necessary, a trial on the merits of plaintiff\u2019s underlying ADEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
