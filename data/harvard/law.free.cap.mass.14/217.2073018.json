The judge ordered the cause to stand continued; that, if this direction to the jury should, in the opinion of the full Court, be deemed incorrect, the verdict might be set aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-6\"><em>Whitman, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACo\">argued that <em>Leonard </em>had no property in the ox. The general property was in <em>Olive Morse; </em>the special property in the deputy sheriff. Judgment upon this indictment would be no bar to a prosecution for stealing the same ox from the general owner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>The Solicitor-General</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALX\">said the indictment was pursuant to universal practice. He thought, too, that <em>Leonard, </em>having the lawful custody of the ox, and being answerable for its safe keeping, the verdict might be maintained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-8\">Parker, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahd\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The indictment alleges that the article stolen was of the goods and chattels of <em>Cromwell Leonard. </em>The evidence proved that the only interest which <em>Leonard </em>had in it was derived from the custody which he had undertaken for a deputy sheriff, who had attached the ox as the property of <em>Olive Morse. </em>The question presented by the motion for a new trial is, whether the allegation in the indictment, of property in <em>Leonard, </em>is sufficiently maintained by this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">That the allegation is material, has not been questioned ; and it appears by the books on criminal law, that in all indictments for larceny, the articles alleged to be stolen must be averred to be \u201c of the goods and chattels \u201d of the right owner, if known; or of the goods and chattels <em>cujusdam ignoti, </em>which form of indictment contains an implied averment that the owner is not known. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">By the same books, it will appear that the averment will be made out by proving that the goods stolen *were either the general or special property of the person averred to be the owner. But the averment, being material, must be proved in order to support the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The only question, then, is, whether the report of the case by the judge shows that the ox stolen was of the goods and chattels, or, in other words, was the property, of <em>Cromivell Leonard. </em>It was not his property absolutely, for he had nothing but the possession, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>claiming any title to it. The special property was in the deputy sheriff who made the attachment. There is no third species of property. <em>Leonard, </em>therefore, was the mere servant of the deputy sheriff, to keep the property attached for him; having no legal interest in it, and no right to maintain an action for it, if taken out of his custody, as was decided in the cases of <em>Ludden </em>vs. <em>Leavitt, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> and <em>Warren </em>vs. <em>Leland. </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">It follows that the evidence at the trial was not sufficient to support the indictment. The verdict must be set aside, and a new-trial granted, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b189-12\"> 2 H. <em>H. P. C. </em>182. \u2014 <em>Cro.
