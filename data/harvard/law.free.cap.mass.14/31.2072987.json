At the expiration of the year, the vessel was in a <em>British </em>port, whither she had been carried against the will of the master. A loss accuring afterwards in the further prosecution of the voyage, it was holden that, being absent on a voyage which had been commenced within the time of the original risk, the policy continued to protect the property after the expiration of the year, although not then literally at sea.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b33-9\">Where any loss arising from the violation of the <em>existing </em>laws or regulations of any of the belligerent powers, restricting neutral commerce, was excepted from the risks undertaken in a policy of insurance, it was holden that the underwriters were liable for a loss arising from the violation of a decree of one of the belligerents, made after the execution of the policy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-10\">Assumpsit upon a policy of insurance, underwritten by the defendants upon the brig <em>Sally-Ann, </em>on which the plaintiff declared for a total loss. The trial was had upon the general issue, before <em>the Chief Justice, </em>November term, 1815, when a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the follow ing statement of facts :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-11\">The defendants executed the policy declared upon, on the 24th of December, 1806 ; wherein is contained that the plaintiff caused 6000 dollars to be insured by the defendants on the said brig, valued at 8000 dollars, from <em>Newburyport </em>to every port or place to which she may proceed, (excepting the <em>West Indies,) </em>during the term of twelve calendar months, to commence on the day of departure from <em>Newburyport, </em>at noon. A part of the usual printed form was as follows: \u201c beginning the adventure upon the said vessel as aforesaid, and to continue and endure during the voyage, and until said vessel shall be arrived and moored twenty-four hours in safety,\u201d <em>or until the expiration of twelve months aforesaid. </em>At the foot of the policy, there follows this memorandum in writing: \u201c <em>Should this vessel be at sea at the expiration of the above period, the rislc is to be continued until her arrival at a port of discharge. It is understood the company are not liable for any loss or expense arising from the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>violation of the existing laws or regulations of any of the bellige-ent powers restricting neutral </em>commerce.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">The risk under this policy commenced on the 30th of December, 1806; and afterwards, and within twelve * months thereafter, <em>viz., </em>on the 14th of November, 1807, the said vessel sailed from <em>Beverly </em>for <em>Amsterdam, </em>and while proceeding on said voyage, under the protection of said policy, she was, on or about the 14th of December, 1807, captured by a <em>British </em>private armed ship, under pretence that she was bound to an enemy\u2019s port. The master and all the hands, except the mate, were taken out, and the vessel ordered to <em>Bristol, </em>where she arrived on the 25th of the same December. The letter of marque, on board of which was the master of the <em>Sally-Ann, </em>arrived on the 28th. On his arrival the vessel was restored to him by the prize agents, and his papers delivered to him. The master then applied to the custom-house for a clearance to <em>Amsterdam; </em>but the collector, being doubtful of his right to clear vessels for that port, wrote to the admiralty for instructions, and in the mean time the master went himself to <em>London, </em>to consult with the plaintiff\u2019s correspondent, to procure a clearance for the vessel. He remained there about twelve hours, and on his return to <em>Bristol, </em>he found that permission had arrived there to clear the vessel for <em>Amsterdam.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">Immediately on his return to <em>Bristol, </em>the vessel was cleared ou,, and he proceeded to sea about the 20th of January, 1808; but was obliged to put back on account of contrary winds, and returned inte the outer roads for a few days, until a fair wind, when he sailed direct for the <em>Texel, </em>not having been on shore' after thus putting back. On receiving his papers from the prize agents, there was an endorsement on them, warning them not to proceed to an enemy\u2019s port; against which he protested at the time. After sailing from <em>Bristol </em>for <em>Amsterdam, </em>he was boarded by an <em>English </em>frigate and a letter of marque, and permitted to proceed, after an examination of his papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-7\">After the vessel arrived off the <em>Texel, </em>and while about taking a pilot on board to go up to <em>Amsterdam, </em>she was captured by a French privateer, and sent into a place called <em>New Dieppe. </em>The vessel, and the cargo on board thereof, were shortly after libelled as prize, in * the prize court at <em>Baris, </em>for having been captured and carried into <em>England </em>by a <em>British </em>cruiser, and departing thence for <em>Holland, </em>and being spoken by <em>British </em>cruisers on her voyage from <em>Bristol </em>to <em>Holland. </em>The vessel and cargo were immediately claimed by the master, and the consignees, and also by the <em>Dutch </em>government. Immediately on his arrival at <em>Amsterdam, </em>and before the vessel was injured the master applied to the captors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>to release the vessel on bond, and to deliver her without the cargo; but they refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">After remaining a long time in <em>Holland </em>and at Paris, where the libel against the vessel and cargo was pending, and believing there was no chance for a successful termination to his claim, the master of the said vessel, with the approbation and aid of the consignees of the cargo, and by advice of their counsel, made a compromise with the captors, by which it was agreed that the vessel and cargo should be sold, that the captors should retain two thirds of the neat proceeds thereof, and should restore the residue to the master and consignees, and that each party should bear their own cost and expenses. The said compromise was made <em>bona fide, </em>and was a reasonable one ; and it was for the best interest of all the parties concerned, that such compromise should be made; and it was the best that could be obtained. In making it, the vessel was not sacrificed for the benefit of the cargo; but it was as favorable for one as the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">Neither the master, nor any of his crew, were permitted to go on board the vessel, while under detention. When the master returned from <em>Paris, </em>he found that the sails and rigging were cut and destroyed, her boats gone, and the vessel a mere wreck, of very little value, and she was sold for as much as she was worth. The cargo brought a good price at the time of the compromise. Many <em>American </em>vessels, captured under similar circumstances, were condemned ; and in no case was a better compromise made than this. The said master did not know of the existence of the <em>Milan </em>decree, until after he was so captured by the <em>French * </em>privateer; although it was published in the <em>London </em>papers of the 6th of January.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">The plaintiff was interested in the vessel to the amount insured; and he abandoned to the defendants his interest therein, immediately after he received notice of the said compromise; but never before, although he had seasonable information of the previous events; and he claimed a total loss, and also a general average for expenses incurred in <em>England, Holland </em>and <em>Paris, </em>in prosecuting his claims for the vessel, evidence of which was filed in the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">The foregoing facts were all agreed by the parties, except that the question, whether the master knew of the existence of the <em>Milan </em>decree at the time of his sailing from <em>England, </em>was submitted to the jury, who found that he was ignorant thereof, as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-9\">The verdict, in other respects, was taken <em>pro forma </em>only ; and if the plaintiff was entitled to recover any thing, it was agreed that the Court should direct the amount for which the verdict should</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>stand ; or might appoint assessors, for any purpose they might think necessary or convenient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The cause was argued at the last March term, by <em>Prescott </em>and <em>Hubbard </em>for the plaintiff, and by <em>Gorham </em>for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\">\n<em>For the plaintiff,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aac\">it was contended that the vessel must be considered as at sea, and in the prosecution of her voyage, when she was under detention in <em>England, </em>and until her final capture by the <em>French </em>privateer, and so under the protection of the policy. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">The loss in this case arose from mere illegal violence. It was not pretended to have been within the <em>Berlin </em>decree; and the <em>Milan </em>decree was not within the meaning of the exception of the policy, since it was not in existence at the time it was effected. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-8\">The abandonment was seasonably made, being immediately after the news of the compromise was received, by which a total loss was first ascertained to have taken place. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ah\">\n<em>For the defendant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIM\">it was said that the policy * expired on the 30th of December, 1807; that the loss occurred under the provisions of the <em>Milan </em>decree, and the defendants are excused from all loss from any of the decrees of the belligerents, which might exist during the policy. As to the seasonableness of the abandonment, <em>Gorham </em>observed, that the difference in this case between a partial and a total loss was so inconsiderable, that the point was not worth contending.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-10\">The cause stood over to this term for advisement; and now the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b36-13\"> 4 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>181, <em>Scott Al. </em>vs. <em>Thompson.\u20142 Johns. 89, Robinson </em>vs. <em>Marine </em>Ins. <em>Company.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b36-14\"><em> </em>8 <em>Johns. </em>277, <em>Corp </em>vs. <em>United Ins.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A82\">Several questions have presented themselves in this case, of somewhat difficult solution; but we are now ready to decide them.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">The first respects the duration of the risk; whether it continued to the time when the ship was captured by the <em>French </em>privateer. At that time the year, which was contemplated as the termination of the policy, had expired. But by the terms of the policy, if the ship was at sea when the year expired, the risk was to continue until the voyage should be completed; and an additional premium by the month was to be paid, until the termination of such voyage. At the expiration of the year, the ship was not literally at sea; but was in a <em>British </em>port, whither she had been carried against the will of the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Was she then, within a fair construction of the contract, within the intent of the parties, at sea? We think she was. She was absent on a voyage which had been commenced within the time of the original risk. She would have been protected, upon that voyage, to <em>Amsterdam </em>and back again; because within the common meaning of the term <em>at sea, </em>which was undoubtedly adopted by those parties. A vessel is considered in that condition, while on <em>her </em>voyage and pursuing the business of it, although during a part of the time she is necessarily within some port, in the prosecution of her voyage. The intention, in prolonging the risk beyond twelve months, was unquestionably to give the ship protection under the policy, in case * that time should expire, while the vessel should be employed in some unfinished voyage; and wdiether in a foreign port, or actually upon the high seas, we believe there was no difference in the contemplation of the parties, when the \"contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The policy being in operation at the time of the capture, the next question is, whether the loss happened within any peril insured against. And here we must ascertain what is the loss complained of. It is the capture by a <em>French </em>privateer, on the pretext that the ship had come from a <em>British </em>port, and had been spoken with by <em>British </em>cruisers. This certainly is within the general risks provided against in the policy ; for it was an arrest and detention, and final loss, by the force and violence of subjects of the then emperor of <em>France.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"><em>We </em>must therefore consider the exception in the memorandum at the foot of the policy, and see whether, by that, the underwriters are discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">This exception is from any loss or expense, arising from the violation of the <em>existing laws or regulations </em>of any of the belligerent powers restricting neutral commerce. At the time of executing the policy, the <em>Berlin </em>decree of the emperor of <em>France </em>was existing; but no other decrees, either of <em>France </em>or <em>Great Britain, </em>were in force, which restricted neutral commerce. Had the vessel been captured under that decree, the underwriters would have been discharged. But upon examination of that decree, we do not find any of its provisions, which would have subjected this vessel to capture. Ft does not appear that she had articles of <em>English </em>growth or manufacture on board, or those of her colonies. By the terms of that decree, vessels coming from a <em>British </em>port were prohibited from entry into a port of <em>France </em>or her dependencies; but they were not thereby made liable to confiscation, unless there had been a false declaration of the master or others on board, to evade this article of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>At the time of the capture, the <em>Milan </em>decree was in force, which subjected the ship to capture, if coming * from an <em>English </em>port, or if she had been spoken with by <em>British </em>cruisers. Now, although this vessel would probably have been taken under pretext of the <em>Berlin </em>decree, had the <em>Milan </em>decree not been passed, as the system of plunder was then in full operation, yet as another decree existed, which authorized <em>French </em>cruisers to capture vessels situated like this, we must suppose she was captured under the latter, and not under the former decree. <em>Causa propin</em>qua, <em>non remota spectatur. </em>And by the allegations of the libel, it appears that it was under the last-mentioned decree that the ship was claimed by the captors as prize.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">This narrows the question to the point, whether the term <em>existing decrees, </em>as used by the defendants in the exception to their liability under the policy, can by fair construction comprehend the <em>Milan </em>decree. And we should willingly yield to the construction urged for the defendants, if it were consistent with the most liberal use of terms, as they are commonly used by merchants. But it must be considered that the underwriters were, in this respect, making their own bargain, _and inserting their own phraseology; the object being to secure themselves, by the exception, against a risk, which in the body of the policy they had incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">What did they <em>intend </em>to provide against ? Surely against any decrees then in force, whether known or unknown. The ingenuity of the belligerent powers, and particularly of the <em>French </em>emperor, in manufacturing decrees against neutral commerce, was not fore seen, or at least not sufficiently provided .against. At any rate, it was thought enough to secure themselves against any decrees already in force. The <em>Berlin </em>decree had passed, and Was probably heard of, when the policy was effected. It might have been supposed, that a retaliatory or countervailing decree would immediately be made by <em>Great Britain. </em>It was thought sufficient to provide against such decrees as were in force on the twenty-fourth day of December, 1806. Had it been designed to secure against all such decrees * as should be made during the risk under the policy, surely more apt words would have been taken, than those made use of in their memorandum. At any rate, we cannot distort language, so as to make the term <em>existing </em>mean something which is to be made to exist afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">It is thought hard that the defendants should be made liable for a loss happening from means which neither party calculated upon, when the contract was made. But it does not differ from the case of the breaking out of a war, which occasions a capture; when at the making of a policy the most profound peace existed, and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>were no symptoms of approaching war. In such a case the underwriter loses, Because he did not guard himself in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">With respect to going into <em>England, </em>and thus exposing the ship to the rapacity of the <em>French, </em>under their monstrous decrees, this appears, hy the statement, to have been wholly involuntary on the part of the master ; and his sailing for <em>Amsterdam </em>was not a violation of duty, because he did not know of the <em>Milan </em>decree; and his permission to sail for <em>Amsterdam </em>from <em>Bristol </em>sufficiently exculpates him on account of the <em>British </em>orders in council. The <em>British </em>ports could not be considered as under blockade, by virtue of the <em>Berlin </em>decree, when there was notoriously no force there to carry it into execution; and a seizure and condemnation on that ground would have been considered a violence not justified by the law of nations. Indeed, the decree itself did not expose vessels to capture for coming from <em>English </em>ports, but only prevented their being received at <em>French </em>ports. It was therefore no breach of duty in the master to leave <em>Bristol </em>and sail for <em>Amsterdam. </em>Although, by the letter of the <em>Berlin </em>decree, his vessel might have been turned away on that account from <em>Amsterdam, </em>yet she was not made liable thereby to capture; and the master might well have supposed that, as he had been carried into the <em>English </em>port by force and constraint, the decree would not be enforced against him.</p>\n<p id=\"AOS\">* It has been said in argument, that the ignorance of the existence of the <em>Milan </em>decree, on the part of the master, does not the less expose the owners to the loss of their insurance; because he sailed from <em>England </em>in violation of the letter of that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">But we see it nowhere decided, that a vessel sailing from a neutral country to a blockaded port, or a neutral vessel sailing from the blockaded port of a belligerent, the owners and master having no knowledge of the blockade, thereby becomes liable to be made prize. There may be a presumption of knowledge where a blockade actually exists, which will defeat the excuse of ignorance. But in this case there was not, nor could there be, any blockade of the <em>English </em>ports; and there was nothing from which the knowledge of the master could be inferred, of the exposure of his ship under the <em>Milan </em>decree, except that it had been published in <em>England, </em>before he sailed from thence. But this inference is rebutted by the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Upon the whole, we think the loss in this case comes within the policy, according to the fair principles of construction, and not within the memorandum, under which the defendants would shelter themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">'Pile premium being stated in the policy at one per cent, per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>month daring the continuance of the risk, and it being agreed that the amount of it shall be deducted from the sum adjudged to the p'aintiff, it is necessary that we should decide the time for which the plaintiff is held to pay it, under the circumstances of the case; and it is our opinion that the same is recoverable, from the commencement of the risk until the time when the final compromise took place between the captors and the master.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
