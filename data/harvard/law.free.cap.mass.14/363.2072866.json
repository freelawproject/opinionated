The said <em>Peter </em>then went on a voyage to <em>Egg Harbor, </em>in the province of <em>New Jersey, </em>to make shingles. The said <em>Field, </em>in pursuance of said contract, on the 28th of January, 1766, removed the said <em>Peter\u2019s </em>wife and children to his said hired house in <em>Taunton. </em>The said <em>Peter, </em>while residing at <em>Egg Harbor, </em>addressed a letter to his wife in <em>Taunton, </em>and afterwards, in August or September, 1766, returned to his family, then residing in the said house ; and after-wards built a house in said <em>Taunton, </em>which belonged to his wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and continued to dwell therein for eight or ten years, until his death, neither himself nor his family having been at any time warned to depart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">If, upon the foregoing facts, the Court should be of opinion that the said <em>Peter Presho </em>gained a settlement * in the town of <em>Taunton, </em>the plaintiffs agreed to be- [ * 364 | come nonsuit; otherwise the defendants agreed to be defaulted, and that judgment should be rendered against them for a sum specified.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-6\"><em>Bigelow, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A33J\">By the laws in force prior to April, 1767, \u201c If any person or persons <em>came to sojourn or dwell </em>in any town, and remained three months, [afterwards extended to twelve months,] not being warned to depart, he or they thereby gained a settlement in such town.\u201d <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> <em>Peter Presho </em>did not go to <em>Taunton </em>to sojourn or dwell before August, 1766. There were not, then, twelve months in which he could be warned to depart. He could not be warned while residing at <em>Egg Harbor, </em>and a warning to his wife and children in his absence would have been without effect. The whole question of settlement resting in him, the warning must necessarily be to him personally. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> If left at the residence of his family, in a place where he had never dwelt, it could never have been truly said to be left at his last and usual place of abode.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AAr\"><em>Hastings, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABaM\">contended that within the equity of the provincial acts, the residence of <em>Peter Presho </em>in <em>Taunton </em>commenced on the removal of his family thither in January, 1766. From that time he had lost his habitancy in <em>Raynham, </em>was taxable in <em>Taunton, </em>and must have been named as of <em>Taunton </em>in any legal process. A warning left at the place of abode of his family would have been sufficiently executed. Had his family removed without his approbation or consent, the effect might have been different; but the removal in this case was his own act. He recognized <em>Taunton </em>as his home, by addressing a letter to his family there; and, indeed, it was to all intents his domicile or home. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\"> <em>Prov.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"APHk\">The question to be decided in this case is, whether <em>Peter Presho, </em>the grandfather of the pauper, had gained a settlement in <em>Taunton, </em>by having resided there one year before the 10th of April, 1767 ; it being agreed that neither he nor his family were warned to depart from that town.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">*It appears that, on the 28th of January, 1766, he had caused his family to be removed from <em>Raynham </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Taunton, </em>where he had some months before hired a house, with intent to remove and dwell therein ; that he himself, before the removal of his family, had left <em>Raynham, </em>without any intention to return thither, and having, in fact, no domicile there, after he commenced his excursion to <em>New Jersey; </em>that, when he returned, he came to <em>Taunton, </em>to his family, and not to <em>Raynham; </em>and that he continued to live in <em>Taunton </em>for eight or ten years, during which lime he built a house there, which he occupied with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that, within the intent and meaning of the law then in force, he came to reside in <em>Taunton </em>when he changed his domicile and removed his family to that place. He must be considered as having left <em>Raynham,, </em>and given up his settlement, when he went abroad ; having before that time provided a new habitation in <em>Taunton, </em>and intending to return to and to make his final home at that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Had legal process, for any cause, issued against him, it could not have been served by leaving a summons or a copy at his former dwelling-house in <em>Raynham, </em>as his last and usual place of abode; for where his family dwelt was his house, and his absence could not render it less his domicile. A warning by <em>Taunton, </em>left at the house occupied by his family in that town, would have been sufficient to prevent his acquiring a settlement there, and to exonerate them from the obligation to support him or his family, although he had not personally come to reside there.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The removal of his family was an act of notoriety sufficient to put <em>Taunton </em>on its guard; and not having warned him or his family, that town must be considered as having adopted him as an inhabitant. We think his residence commenced, constructively, at <em>Taunton </em>on the 28th of January, 1766, when the house he had hired began to be occupied, according to his views and inten tians when he contracted for it. The plaintiffs must * therefore be called, and the defendants have judgment for their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\"><em>Plaintiffs </em>nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
