In <em>Mowry </em>vs. <em>Todd, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> this Court sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>an action on a contract not in its nature negotiable, in the name of the party to whom it had been delivered over without the name of the assignor, the party bound having recognized the transaction, and promised to pay the contents to the holder. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> The word assigns in the bond amounts to a consent, on the * part of the obligor, that the bond should be transferred, and an engagement to pay to the assignee. Many cases in the books, prior to the statute of 4 <em>Anne, </em>c. 9, show actions maintained by assignees of <em>dioses in adion. </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\"><em>Reed </em>vs. <em>Ingraham. </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> was an action by the assignee of a stock contract, to recover the amount of the difference due on the con tract, and was maintained by the Supreme Court of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>notwithstanding it is said by the Court, that, on general principles of law, such contracts cannot be regarded as negotiable; yet <em>modus et conventio vincunt leges. </em>And on a motion afterwards for a new trial, the judges cited the case of <em>Fenner </em>vs. Mears, and the argument of <em>Butter, </em>J., in <em>Master </em>vs. Miller, <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> and adhered to the opinion before given. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark>- It is said, in <em>Bac. Air., Debt, C, </em>that there is no case where a thing may be transferred or assigned over, but the remedy shall go along with it. If the word <em>assigns </em>in this bond are not tantamount to <em>order, </em>it can have no force or meaning attached to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-6\"><em>Sohier </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b95-16\"> 8 <em>Johns. </em>152.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b95-17\"> 12 <em>Mass.

The word <em>assigns </em>has been for centuries inserted in bonds and obligations; but no one has conceived that it gave to them a negotiable property, so as to transfer the right of action upon them to the assignee. In <em>Fenner </em>vs. <em>Mears, </em>the action was <em>assumpsit </em>upon the promise of the obligor to pay to the assignee; and the assignment of a <em>chose in action </em>was always a good consideration for a promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We have gone as far in favor of assignments as the authorities or the reason of them would justify us. But to support the present action would be to disregard settled and established rules, founded on sound principles of law, and the highest reason, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\n<em>Declaration adjudged, bad.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b96-15\"><em> [Day </em>vs. Whitney, 1 <em>Pick. </em>503. \u2014 <em>Dunn </em>vs. <em>Snell </em>&amp; <em>Al. </em>15 M.481.\u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
