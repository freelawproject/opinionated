This latter will had been offered for probate by the present appellants, and disallowed, as not duly witnessed, within the requisition of the statute; <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> as to which it appeared that the latter will was attested, by three subscribing witnesses, but that one of them did not subscribe in the testator\u2019s presence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Orr, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A642\">argued that, although this instrument might not be duly witnessed as a last will, yet it might avail as a revocation of the former will now offered for probate. The three witnesses saw and heard the testator execute and publish it. They are competent and credible, and the facts are well established by their testimony.. The words of the statute, as to instruments of revocation, do not require that the witnesses subscribe in the presence of the testator.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-5\"><em>Mellen, </em>for the respondents,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_L\">contended that the instrument, offered as evidence of the revocation of the will now in question, could not have that operation. Our statute on this point is a literal copy from the <em>English </em>statute of wills, and it has been repeatedly decided, and is perfectly settled, in <em>England, </em>that a second * will, whereby lands are disposed of, as is the case here, to amount to a revocation of a former one, must be such a one as would be effectual to pass lands, within the devising clause of the statute; and must be witnessed, and otherwise qualified, as that clause requires. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b180-14\"> <em>Stat. </em>1783, c. 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> <em>Powell on Devises, </em>631, 646. \u2014 1 P. <em>Will. </em>343. \u2014 2 <em>Black.
