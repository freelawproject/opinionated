Afterwards the town of C was incorporated, and contained within its limits the tract of land in right of which the settlement was held, In the act incorporating C. it was provided that persons who had gained a settlement in the part of B which by the act was made a part of C, and who should thereafter need support, should be supported by C. This latter town was holden liable for the support of the pauper, although never, in fact, settled in B.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\">Assumpsit for expenses incurred in the relief and support of <em>John Bixby, </em>a pauper, whose legal settlement the plaintiffs aver to be in <em>Lancaster.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">* At the trial of the cause, which was had upon the general issue before <em>Jackson, </em>J., at the last May term in this county, the only question made in the case was, whether the said <em>Bixby </em>had his settlement in <em>Lancaster, </em>as the plaintiffs allege ; and the following facts were in evidence : \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-11\">The pauper was born in 1747, at <em>Lancaster, </em>where his father was then settled; and he had never acquired a new settlement within the commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-12\">Whilst the father was still living, <em>viz., </em>in February, 1781, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>part of the town of <em>Lancaster </em>in which he resided was taken off and annexed to the town of <em>Shrewsbury.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">In March, 1786, a part of <em>Shrewsbury, </em>including that part in which the pauper\u2019s father had resided, was erected into a separate town, by the name of <em>Boylston.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">In January, 1808, the town of <em>West Boylston </em>was incorporated, including a part of the towns of <em>Boylston, Sterling, </em>and <em>Holden; </em>and that part of <em>Boylston </em>which was included in <em>West Boylston </em>is the same in which the pauper\u2019s father had resided as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-7\">In the two first-mentioned acts, there is no special provision respecting paupers; but in the act for incorporating <em>West Boylston, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> it is enacted, \u201c that any person who may have gained an inhabitancy at any time before the first Monday of March [then] next within that part of either of the said towns which is by this act incorporated into the town of <em>West Boylston, </em>and who shall hereafter need to be supported as a poor person, shall be supported by the town of <em>West Boylston.\u2019\u2019</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-8\">Upon these facts the judge directed a verdict for the defendants, which was returned accordingly; and the plaintiffs moved for a new trial, on account of the said direction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-9\"><em>Whiting, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4V\">It is very clear that this * pauper has his settlement in <em>Lancaster, </em>unless it has been transferred to <em>M^est Boylston </em>by the act incorporating the latter town. The father\u2019s settlement in <em>Lancaster </em>was not transferred to <em>Shrewsbury </em>by the annexation of his land to the latter in 1781; as, before the statute of 1793, c. 34, the division of a \"town or the annexation of a part of one to another did not change the settlement of the inhabitants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-10\">\u2022 It cannot be inferred, fropi the act incorporating <em>West Boylston, </em>that the pauper\u2019s settlement was transferred to that town. The provision in that act extended only to the three towns named in it, and of parts of which the new town was to consist. It extends to persons who had gained a settlement in one of <em>the said towns. Lancaster </em>is not named in the act, and was no party to the convention which the statute was intended to ratify. The pauper had never had a settlement in either of the three towns. His father had died long before the incorporation of <em>West Boylston, </em>and the settlement of the son being merely derivative from his father, his case was not within the expression of the statute, which refers only to those who might have gained a settlement in their own right by inhabitancy. The construction contended for by the defendants would operate with great hardship upon <em>West Boylston.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Ashmun, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbgK\">contended that the settlement of the pauper\u2019s fa\u00b0ther was transferred, in 1781, from <em>Lancaster </em>to <em>Shrews-bury ; </em>which he argued to be the natural and necessary effect of the act of annexation, since it contained no provision to the contrary. The act of 1808, incorporating <em>West Boylston, </em>is so clear in its provision on this subject as to put it beyond a doubt that this pauper is chargeable to that town. The supposed hardship arising in cases of this kind has often been urged, and as often disregarded by this Court. Such suggestions can have no operation, when opposed to the will of the legislature; by a close adherence to which, upon questions relating to the settlement of paupers, all the hardships will probably in the course of time be equalized.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b220-12\"> <em>Stat. </em>1807, c. 48</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b221-5\">* Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aah\">The pauper\u2019s original settlement was in <em>Lancaster, </em>that being his father\u2019s settlement at the time of his birth. On the annexation of that part of <em>Lancaster </em>where the father dwelt to <em>Shrewsbury, his </em>settlement was transferred to the latter town; for although no express provision respecting paupers appears in the act providing for their annexation, yet it is a necessary effect of such annexation, that the town which acquires the new inhabitants and new territory should also incur such burdens as may be incident to the new relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">It does not appear, however, that the pauper was, in 1781, when the annexation took place, a member of his father\u2019s family. On the contrary, it was stated at the bar, and not denied, that, before that time he had removed without the commonwealth; and as he came of age long before that period, it is to be presumed that he was emancipated, and capable of gaining a settlement for himself; so that his settlement was not transferred with his father\u2019s ; nor did the annexation operate upon him personally to change his settlement, on account of his absence, as was settled in the case of <em>Windham </em>vs. <em>Portland. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The pauper\u2019s settlement therefore remained in <em>Lancaster, </em>but for the provisions in the statute incorporating <em>West Boylston. </em>By that act the part of <em>Lancaster </em>in which the pauper\u2019s father had resided, and which afterwards became a part of <em>Shrewsbury, </em>was constituted, with parts of other towns, the town of <em>West Boylston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">It has been contended that, to bring a pauper within the provision of this statute, he should literally have <em>gained </em>a settlement in one of the towns out of which <em>West Boylston </em>was created ; and so that this pauper, never having had a settlement in any town but <em>Lancaster, </em>which is not one of the component parts, cannot be charged to <em>West Boylston, </em>but belongs still to <em>Lancaster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The obvious meaning, however, of the legislature was to make <em>West Boylston </em>liable, in respect to the territory of which it had acquired the municipal jurisdiction ; in order that, as it acquired by its incorporation * all the rights and priv ileges, which the several towns that were dismembered had enjoyed, it should also succeed to all the duties and burdens to which they had before been liable, according to the reasonable maxim, <em>Qui sentit commodum, sentir\u00e9 debet et onus. Lancaster </em>there fore, which had, ever since the year 1781, lost the privilege of tax ing the lands and property of the inhabitants of that part of its former territory which had successively been transferred to <em>Shrews-bury, Boylston, </em>and <em>West Boylston, </em>is discharged from the burden of supporting any of those inhabitants, or others who derive a settlement under them, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\"> 4 <em>Mass.
