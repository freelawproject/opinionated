The plaintiff then alleges that the said <em>Azariah </em>has not performed any part of said order; and prays for a remedy by execution or warrant of distress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-10\">To this writ the said <em>Azariah </em>answers by a general demurrer, which is joined by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-11\"><em>Richardson, </em>of counsel for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADbp\">being called on to show that a writ of <em>sdre facias </em>lies in this case, * contended that this was, in fact, a judgment of a court of record ; and since the statute of <em>Westm. 2, scire facias </em>lies in many cases where it lay not at common law ; <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> a formal judgment not being in all cases a prerequisite. <em>Richardson </em>stated the fact to have been, in this case, that the defendant, after the verdict was returned against him, had avoided; and as the magistrate before whom he was first carried had taken a recognizance instead of a bond, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> if the plaintiff could not maintain the present process, she would be without remedy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-12\"><em>Chickering </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b330-14\"> 2 <em>Inst. </em>469. \u20141 Lord <em>Raym. </em>669\u2014469.

This was merely an order that the defendant should give security, &amp;c. The only mode of enforcing the performance of the order was to commit the defendant to prison until he should comply. The writ cannot be supported, and the defendant must take judgment for his costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
