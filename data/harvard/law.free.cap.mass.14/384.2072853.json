It was also proved that the said <em>Nathaniel </em>received the rents and profits of the said farm for three successive years; and he testified that he lived on the farm three years and seven days. But he afterwards testified, in another deposition, that he removed into <em>Lyman </em>November 1, 1798; and on the 28th of October, 1801, he sold the same farm; and he finally removed from <em>Lyman </em>November 12, 1801.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-14\">The plaintiffs insisted that the said <em>Nathaniel Webster </em>never gained a settlement in <em>Lyman, </em>as he sold his estate before he had resided there three years complete. But the judge instructed the jury that, if they were * satisfied that he had received all the rents and profits for throe complete years before he made sale of his farm, he thereby gained a settle-</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ment in <em>Lyman, </em>although he had not, at the time of the sale, resided the entire term of three years in said town ; and the jury accordingly returned a verdict for the defendants. If the said instruction was wrong, the verdict was to be set aside, and a new trial had ; otherwise judgment was to be rendered for the defendants for their costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-5\">An argument was had, at the last March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>by <em>Thatcher </em>for the plaintiffs, and <em>Richardson </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>Thatcher</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A63\">admitted that <em>Nathaniel Webster </em>was the owner of the \u00bbaid farm from the 19th of October, 1798; so that, in fact, he was the owner of the estate, and he resided in <em>Lyman </em>for more than three years. He contended, however, that, by a true construction of the statute, those three years should be coincident; otherwise a person may be acquiring a settlement in two towns at the same time, which could certainly never have been the intention of the legislature. The party must dwell in the town the same three years that he owns and takes the profits of the estate. When <em>Webster </em>purchased the farm, it was not certain that he would remove to <em>Lyman. </em>It may be presumed, too, that he chose to retain his settlement in <em>Wells, </em>and with that intent left <em>Lyman </em>before the three years expired. It is the right or privilege of a citizen to acquire a new settlement, or retain his former one, at his option. If three full years\u2019 residence and ownership, contemporary with each other, are once dispensed with, no fixed rule can be made, and it is peculiarly true, in questions of settlement, that it is of vastly more interest to the community that principles and rules should be fixed and settled, than what those principles and rules are.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> <em>Stat. </em>1793, c. 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\"><em> [Inhab.
