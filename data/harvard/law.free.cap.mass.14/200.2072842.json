But it appearing that such ancestor was disseised at the time of his conveyance, and that therefore nothing passed by his deed, and the action being avowed to be brought for the use of the grantees, the demandants recovered.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-10\">This was a writ of right, in which the demandants counted on the seisin of <em>Francis Waldo, </em>within sixty years from the 31st of December, 1811, being the date of the writ, and a descent to them from him as their ancestor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-11\">The cause was tried on the general issue, before <em>Thatcher, </em>J., at the last September term in this county, when it was proved, on the part of. the demandants, that <em>Samuel Waldo, </em>Esq., died seised of a tract of land called <em>Middle Neck, </em>of which the demanded premises are a part, in the year 1759; that the said <em>Francis Waldo, </em>one of the children and heirs of the said <em>Samuel, </em>in the year 1768, received a conveyance from the other heirs of the said tract, and became seised by virtue of the said conveyance. The pedigree of the demandants, as derived from the said <em>Francis, </em>was admitted as alleged by them in the count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-12\">On the part of the tenant, it was proved that, in the year 1764, <em>John Kellock, </em>father of the tenant, entered and took possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the demanded premises, and held the same until the year 1803, when he died seised thereof, leaving the tenant in possession, claiming the same as son and heir of his father. And, to show the title out of the ancestor of the demandants, the tenant * offered in evidence, although objected to by the demandants, two deeds from the said <em>Francis Waldo, </em>one dated July 1, 1771, to <em>Alexander Wedderburn, </em>conveying an undivided fourth part of said <em>Middle Neck, </em>and the other dated September 9, ] 770, to <em>John Skinner </em>and <em>Richard Jackson, </em>conveying an undivided moiety of the same tract; and it was admitted that the late General <em>Knox </em>was seised of the remaining fourth part. The said deeds were duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">On this evidence it was contended, for the tenant, that a title to the whole of the demanded premises was shown to be out of the ancestor of the demandants, and that no estate in the premises descended to them from him ; and that the jury ought to be instructed to find a verdict for the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">On the part of the demandants, it was contended that, inasmuch as the said <em>Francis Waldo, </em>at the time of executing the said deeds to <em>Wedderburn, Skinner, </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>was disseised by the said <em>John Kellock, </em>as aforesaid, nothing passed by said deeds; and as the action was brought for the benefit of the said grantees, the demand-ants were well entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">The judge instructed the jury to find for the demandants, and a verdict being so returned, the tenant filed exceptions to the said instruction, and moved for a new trial on that ground.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-8\"><em>Orr, </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1S\">In a writ of right, the seisin of the ancestor is material; and if disproved, this is fatal to the demandants\u2019 claim. For the tenant, it is sufficient to show that their ancestor in his lifetime parted with the fee to a stranger; because such evidence would falsify the count in a material point. In that case, there could be no descent to the heir, and the claim of the demand ants must fail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-9\">In the case at bar, <em>Francis Waldo, </em>the demandants\u2019 ancestor, conveyed the demanded premises to <em>Wedderburn </em>and others ; there could, therefore, be no descent to the heirs of <em>Waldo. </em>It is not for these heirs to allege that nothing passed by the deeds of their ancestor, nor * is it necessary that the tenant should derive a title from <em>Wedderburn. </em>After the lapse of more than forty years, it is to be presumed that the tenant\u2019s an cestor was confirmed in the estate by <em>Wedderburn.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-10\">It does not appear that <em>Waldo </em>was ever disturbed upon the coy enants in his deed to <em>Wedderburn. </em>Nor have his heirs suffered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>them, and they cannot now be held to answer. They have, therefore, no interest whatever in the demanded premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">It is suggested that the action is instituted by the demandants for the benefit of the grantees of their ancestor ; but nothing appears in the case to authorize the suggestion. It is merely assumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">A declaration on the demandants\u2019 own right is essentially different from one in right of his ancestor. In the case of <em>Wolcott &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Knight Al, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> it is held that the tenant may plead a deed of the demandant to a stranger, in bar of a writ of entry on his own seisin ; and that the demandant may avoid the bar by replying that nothing passed by the deed. But it is not in the mouth of the heir to allege that nothing passed by his ancestor\u2019s deed : he cannot maintain a writ of right for the imaginary benefit of others, who have made no claim, and who have no perceptible interest in the suit. The demandant must derive a right from the person whom he alleges to have been seised. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-7\">The seisin of the ancestor, as alleged, must be certain. The case of <em>Barre </em>vs. <em>Reynold, </em>cited in <em>Litt. </em>\u00a7 514, is in point, where justice <em>Herle </em>is represented to have said to the grand assize, <em>\u201c </em>If you find the ancestor of <em>John </em>[the demandant] was not seised in the time that the demandant hath pleaded, you shall inquire no further upon the right; but if you find that he was seised, then you shall inquire further,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">The issue, in the case at bar, is on the mere right, in which every thing may be given in evidence but collateral warranty. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-9\"><em>Mellen </em>for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b175-12\"> 6 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>418.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AP-\"> 3 <em>Black. Comm. </em>195.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b175-13\"> 3 <em>Wilson, </em>419, <em>Tyssen </em>vs. <em>Clarke.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-10\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AyG\">The title of the demandant's to the land in question is well made out, and, indeed, is acknowledged * on the part of the tenant, unless the conveyances to <em>Wedderburn </em>and others have defeated it. As there is nothing in the case on which to ground a presumption that the tenant derives any title under those grantees, it must be intended that he holds only under the title by disseisin acquired by his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Can, then, the demandants maintain their right in this action upon the evidence in the case ? In <em>Wolcott &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Knight &amp; Al., </em>referred to in the argument, which was a writ of entry, and where the facts were similar to those in the case before us, it was held that the deeds of the ancestor could in no view have defeated the right of action of the demandants. Nor does any distinction occur to us, as to this point, between a writ of entry and a writ o\u00ed right. If the tenant is permitted to show that the ancestor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>demandants had conveyed the land in question, it is competent to the demandants to show that nothing passed by those deeds of their ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict. .</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
