On her passage for the <em>United States, </em>she was captured and condemned, with the cargo on board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">It was admitted by the defendant that the plaintiff\u2019s agent, who procured the insurance, a credible witness, whose testimony could not be disproved, would testify, if admissible, that, at the time of effecting tbe insurance, he informed the defendant that the vessel on board of which the property was to be shipped was the brig <em>Stranger </em>aforesaid, and that her real <em>American </em>character was not to be changed; but that she was to be rendered ostensibly <em>Spanish, </em>for the sole purpose of avoiding capture by the enemy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\">Judgment by default or nonsuit was to be rendered in the action, as the opinion of the Court should be on the foregoing statement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-10\"><em>Whitman, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFOO\">contended that the policy contained a warranty that the vessel was <em>Spanish. </em>Such was the obvious meaning of the words used. Such a warranty is to be fully and rigidly complied with. The fact is confessedly otherwise here. If this was made known to the defendant at the time of effecting the insurance, it is not competent for the plaintiff to prove that fact by. paroi evidence. If the fact had been communicated in writing, it would still be incompetent to show it. It ought to have been inserted in the policy, if the assured intended to avail himself of it. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-11\"><em>Todd, for </em>the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aub\">The words relied on by the defendant, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>constituting a warranty, were nothing more than a description of the vessel. It is observable, too, that the insurance here being only upon a part * of the hiding, and not upon the vessel, this description becomes still less material. In the case of <em>Manly </em>vs. <em>The United Marine and Fire Insurance Company, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> the vessel not being at the place mentioned <em>at </em>the commencement of the risk, was held to be an immaterial circumstance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-5\">The paroi evidence was only to rebut the imputation of fraud, and not to explain, construe, or contradict the written contract. Its admission, therefore, would not oppose any of the established rules of evidence. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"AUg\"> 12 <em>Mass.
