Phelps, </em>clerk of a company of cavalry, charging the said <em>Fanning </em>with neglect of duty in not attending a muster of the company for the purpose of regimental inspection and review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>The </em>respondent relied, for his defence before <em>the </em>justice, on a cer tificate of the surgeon of the regiment, that he \u201c was unable to perform military duty, by reason of a lameness in his right knee,\u201d &amp;c. On the back of the certificate was a discharge from military duty for the term of twelve months, signed by the brigadier-general. The justice, notwithstanding the said certificate and endorsement, imposed a fine of four dollars on the respondent, on the ground that it was necessary for him to avail himself of the discharge produced, to show that he had applied to the captain of his company and the commander of the regiment or battalion before applying to the brigadier-general.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-5\">\n<em>Bates,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aiqn\">in support of the conviction, relied on the point taken before the justice, citing the 29th section of the statute of 1809, c. 108, and also the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Smith, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> where the same point was taken and sustained by the court. If the respondent had made the proper applications to the commanders of the company and the regiment respectively, it was for him to show it, in order to render the discharge available. Without such evidence it was a mere nullity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-6\"><em>Howe </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> 11 <em>Mass.

It is, however, to be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the brigadier-general would not grant the discharge until he had satisfactory evidence that the other officers had * been applied <em>to, </em>and had unreasonably refused the party a discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Smith, </em>it was ascertained that those previous steps had not been taken.
