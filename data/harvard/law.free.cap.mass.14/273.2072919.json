If the legislature had intended that defendants were in no case to be held to plead specially, the clause cited would have ended with the words <em>special plea.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-5\">A provision to the same effect, and quite as general in its expressions, is made by-the <em>Stat. </em>1783, c. 38, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 9, in favor of executors, administrators, and guardians ; yet, in the case of <em>Foster </em>vs. <em>Abbot, Adm. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> the court said that the statute extended to such facts only as went to the merits of the action, but not to statute bars; and instanced the statute of limitations, which, they say, \u201c must always be pleaded, and is <em>never </em>given in evidence under the general issue.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">The question, whether the evidence offered by the plaintiffs was sufficient to take the case out of the statute, should have been referred to the jury. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> Although the fact stated and offered in evidence may appear of very little weight, it might have satisfied the jury ; and it is well known that very trivial circumstances have been held sufficient to prevent the operation of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>Jarvis </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b236-13\"> <em>Stat. </em>1783, c 42, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b237-11\"> 1 <em>Mass.

The action was commenced before a justice of the peace ; and the construction of the provision in the statute describing the powers of justices, cited in the argument, and the practice under it, has uniformly been to admit every thing, not matter in * abatement merely, to be given in evidence. The words <em>justification or excuse </em>in that act mean every matter which may bar the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, whether requiring a special plea by the common law or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The evidence offered by the plaintiffs in the case before us, with a view to take it out of the statute, <em>viz., </em>that they made a demand to which the defendant would not agree, certainly had no tendency to produce the effect, and was therefore properly rejected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
