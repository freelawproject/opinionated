At that term the defendant pleaded the marriage of the plaintiff since the appeal in abatement of the suit. The plaintiff demurred to the plea, and the defendant joined in the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-8\"><em>Alvord, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKqv\">The administration was not extinguished by the marriage. Administration may be originally granted to a feme covert, who is next of kin to the intestate. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Quick &lt;$f Ux. </em>vs. <em>Staines, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> the executrix had married, and afterwards brought an action as executrix, in which her husband joined, and this point was not thought of, though the cause was sharply argued. By our statute of 1783, c. 24, &lt;\u00a7, 19, it is provided that, when a feme sole shall, jointly with one or more persons, be appointed executrix or administratrix, and after such appointment shall, during the life of the co-executor or co-administrator, marry, such marriage shall operate as an extinguishment or determination of such woman\u2019s power and authority. The inference from this provision is irresistible that the marriage of a feme sole executrix, when no other is united in the trust with her, does not determine the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">Though an action commenced by a feme sole in her own right abates by her marriage, it is not so when the action is <em>an outer droit, </em>as executrix or administratrix. Chattels which the wife has as executrix or administratrix * are not vested in the husband by the marriage. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> Of course the right of action in such capacity remains to her.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-10\"><em>Newcomb, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqv\">contended thpt the plaintiff, not being liable to an action as administratrix, could not be entitled to sue; and no process lying to compel the husband to become a party, the suit must abate. By the statute of 1808, c. .98, a feme sole guardian marrying, the trust is thereby extinguished. The same reason existing in the case of an executrix or administratrix,</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the sense of the legislature on the present question may be plainly inferred.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b254-11\"> <em>Com.

Her marriage pending the suit abates it in either case. The plaintiff\u2019s rights remain to her, but her husband must join her in an action in which she would vindicate those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>JDefendant\u2019s plea good, </em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>(a)</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"><em> [New </em>vs. <em>Muxcy, </em>17 <em>Mass.
