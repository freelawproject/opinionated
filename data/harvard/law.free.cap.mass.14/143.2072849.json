The extent was holden to be an eviction; and the appraised value of the land extended upon was made the measure of damages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-10\">In covenant broken, on a conveyance of land with a covenant that the premises granted were free of encumbrances, it was agreed that, prior to the conveyance, a creditor of the grantor had attached the same land on mesne process, and after the conveyance had extended his execution on a part thereof.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-11\"><em>Mellen, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGU\">objected to the service and return of the execution, that the appraisement was certified and subscribed by two only of the appraisers, although three were sworn, and the one who did not sign the certificate acknowledged the receipt of his fees as an appraiser. No reason was assigned for the omission of his subscription. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-12\"><em>But the Court </em>thought, on the ground that it appeared that three were duly appointed and sworn, and that there was evidence that the three had acted under their appointment, the return might be sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\n<em>Mellen</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJKk\">then contended that, as no actual eviction of the plaintiff was shown, and it did not appear that he.had removed the encumbrance, by redeeming the land, he was entitled to nominal damages only; and he cited, to this point, the case of <em>Prescott </em>vs. <em>Truer man. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b125-13\"> <em>Moffit </em>vs. <em>Jaquins Al. </em>2 <em>Pick.
