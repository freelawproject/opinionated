Webster <em>versus </em>Nathaniel Coffin.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-8\">Where one had received a ship from an officer, who had attached her on mesne process, and had promised to deliver her to the officer on demand, and he afterwards permitted the owner to continue possession, and to carry her to sea, he was hoi den liable to the officer upon his promise, although no demand was made on him within thirty days after judgment was rendered in the suit on which she had been attached; the officer having been held to answer to the attaching creditor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-9\">This action was <em>assumpsit </em>upon the receipt and undertaking of the defendant, which is recited in <em>the </em>report of <em>the </em>preceding case of <em>Bridge </em>vs. <em>Wyman 8f AL, </em>and was referred to the determination of the Court, upon certain facts agreed and stated by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-10\">The facts stated are substantially contained in the preceding case, <em>viz., </em>the attachment of the ship by the now plaintiff, then a deputy sheriff; his delivery of it to the defendant upon his said receipt, and undertaking to redeliver it on demand; the recovery of judgment and execution by <em>Phillips </em>and others against <em>Noyes; </em>the continuance of the ship in the hands of the former owners until her sailing, in November, 1808, when the said <em>Noyes </em>sailed in her; the situation of Mr. <em>Coffin\u2019s </em>place of business; the delivery of <em>Phillips\u2019s </em>execution to * <em>Wyman; </em>his return of the same in no part satisfied ; and a demand of the ship by <em>Webster </em>of <em>Coffin, </em>September 22, 1812. It is also agreed that the present defendant has paid no part of the judgment recovered by <em>Phillips </em>against <em>Jones; </em>that <em>Phillips </em>has recovered against the sheriff <em>Bridge </em>the sum of 2396 dollars, for the default of himself and his deputies in the discharge of their duty relative to the said action against <em>Jones, </em>and that <em>Bridge </em>has paid the same with additional expenses ; that <em>Bridge </em>has brought his actions against <em>Webster </em>and <em>Wyman </em>and their respective sureties for indemnity; that <em>Wyman </em>attached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>said ship at the several suits of <em>Barker </em>and <em>Clark, </em>as stated in the defendants\u2019 rejoinder in the said case of <em>Bridge </em>vs. <em>Wyman Al.; </em>that he delivered her to one <em>Webb, </em>taking his engagement in writing to deliver the same on demand ; that the actions of <em>Barker </em>and <em>Clark </em>were continued in court until long after January, 1809, when <em>Phillips </em>&amp;\u2022 <em>Al. </em>recovered their judgment against <em>Noyes; </em>that no other demand was ever made upon <em>Coffin </em>for the ship but that before stated; and that <em>Webster </em>had no property therein except by virtue of his attaching her at <em>Phillips\u2019s </em>suit, and that he never had any other writ against said <em>Jones </em>and <em>Noyes </em>than that sued by <em>Phillips, </em>as aforesaid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-5\">The cause was argued at the last June term by <em>Williams </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Orr </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>Orr</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1I\">contended that this was a void undertaking for want of a consideration. It was said by the Court, in the case of <em>Phillips &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Bridge, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> which arose out of this same transaction, that the object of such an interference is to send the vessel to sea, or, in other words, that the debtor may still have the full use of his property, notwithstanding the right of his creditors to hold it for theii security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">The defendant\u2019s engagement cannot be construed beyond a promise to indemnify the plaintiff against the rights of the attaching creditor. But those rights wholly ceased after thirty days from the judgment, the * execution not having been before delivered to the plaintiff. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> It is not unlike the liability of an endorser of a bill of exchange, or promissory note, which ceases to exist after a neglect of due diligence and notice by the holder. The sheriff neglecting to make his demand on the defendant, all his claim was gone. The authority or rights of the bailee to hold the property attached could not be greater than those of the sheriff who had made the bailment under the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-8\"><em>Williams, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANa\">contended that he was legally entitled to recover the value of the ship, which the defendant had explicitly engaged to keep until demanded by the plaintiff; or, at the least, the sum which the defendant\u2019s breach of his undertaking had been the occasion of the plaintiff\u2019s losing. The injury the plaintiff has sus tained, in being compelled to pay that sum, furnishes a sufficient consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise. It was perfectly immaterial to the defendant whether the execution was delivered to the plaintiff, or to any other officer able to serve it within the thirty days.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>In the case of <em>Phillips &amp;f Al. </em>vs. <em>Bridge, </em>the Court say that the injury to the plaintiffs there, and of consequence to the present plaintiff, accrued when the ship was restored to the debtors, which was long before judgment was rendered in the suit upon which the attachment was made. The ship being, at the time of the judgment rendered, out of the defendant\u2019s control, a demand at that time would have been nugatory. In short, the defendant, acting as the servant of the plaintiff, must be answerable over to him, so far as by his misconduct the plaintiff has been made to suffer. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-5\">The action was continued for advisement, and at this term the opinion of the Court was delivered by</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\"> 11 <em>Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANe\">The only question which this case presents is, whether Mr. <em>Coffin </em>is exonerated from his express promise in writing to deliver the ship, which was the subject of the contract</p>\n<p id=\"ApI\">to <em>Webster, </em>the plaintiff; * no demand having been made on him therefor, until more than thirty days had expired after the judgment, to secure which the attachment was made. \u00b0</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">It may be observed that, a demand having been made before the present suit was commenced, the defendant is liable, according to the terms of his contract, and can only be exonerated by showing that the plaintiff himself is not liable to the attaching creditors, and so has lost his right to enforce the contract with <em>Coffin. </em>But the facts agreed show clearly that the plaintiff is liable to the judgment creditors. Indeed, the investigation made by the Court in the case formerly decided between the judgment creditors and <em>Bridge, </em>the sheriff, as well as in the case of the sheriff against <em>Wyman </em>and his sureties, in which judgment has now been rendered, leave no doubt of the liability of <em>Webster </em>to the sheriff. It is enough to make him liable, that the ship was once attached by him, and that she was not in his possession, or within the commonwealth, when the execution was about to be levied; the execution having been sued out, and a demand having been made upon <em>Webster </em>by <em>Wyman, </em>who had possession of the execution, within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">To what purpose would it have been for <em>Webster </em>to have made a demand upon the defendant, when the ship was actually at sea before judgment was rendered, and this by permission of <em>Coffin, </em>who had the opportunity of seeing the owners of the ship preparing her for sea, and must be presumed to have consented that one of them should depart with her? Had he kept the control of her until the lien of the creditor had ceased, and then had surrendered her, he would have been acquitted, as would <em>Webster </em>also. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>Webster </em>made himself responsible to the creditors absolutely while the legal lien continued, and <em>Coffin\u2019s </em>responsibility to him was of equal duration. Having parted with the vessel, or perhaps never having had actual possession of her, a demand of <em>Webster </em>upon him would have been nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The case of <em>Knap </em>vs. <em>Sprague, </em>which was cited by * the defendant\u2019s counsel, in which the receipter of property attached was held not responsible to a constable, is altogether different in its merits from this. There the constable was not liable on account of the first attachment, because execution was not sued out within thirty days from the judgment, and the second attachment was void; so that he had no legal or equitable claim to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">If Mr. <em>Coffin </em>is not indemnified, we may lament his imprudence; but the law must have its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
