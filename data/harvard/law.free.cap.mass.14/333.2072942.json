Maccarty, </em>on his indemnifying or releasing the town from all charges and expenses which should be incurred for the repairs made thereon ; and that a deed was accordingly made by said committee, in pursuance of said vote, to said <em>Maccarty, </em>dated the 4th of March, 1765, wherein they release and sell the same, in behalf of the said town, to said <em>Maccarty, </em>to have and to hold the same to him, his heirs and assigns, in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">* It was also proved that, on the 13th of November, 1787, the second parish of <em>Worcester </em>was duly incorporated; and that, on the 29th of September, 1790, the demandant was duly ordained the minister of the first parish of said town, and regularly inducted into said office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-10\">The tenant read to the jury the last will and testament of the said <em>T. Maccarty, </em>empowering his executors, the said <em>Thaddeus </em>and <em>William G., </em>to make sale of the demanded premises; and a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ve vanee thereof bv them to the tenant, dated the 13th of October, 1789.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">Upon these facts, the tenant contended, at the trial, that the deed of <em>Samuel Breck </em>to <em>John Chandler, </em>treasurer, was not a grant or donation for the use of the ministry, or to pious and charitable purposes, of the kind contemplated and provided for by the provincial act of 1754; or, if it were, that the release from the town to said <em>Maccarty </em>was such a concurrent act of the town or parish and the minister thereof as was equivalent, in law, to an alienation- of the same premises by the minister, with the consent of the parish; or that it would operate as a disseisin or discontinuance, so as to bar the demandant\u2019s right of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">The judge, intending to reserve these questions for the consideration of the whole Court, instructed the jury that the said release was not such an act as was equivalent to an alienation of said land by the minister, with the consent of the parish, agreeably to the statute; and that it did not operate by way of disseisin, or otherwise, so as to bar the demandant\u2019s right of action; and that the demanded premises had been legally appropriated to pious and charitable purposes, according to the true meaning and intent of the statute in such cases made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">If this direction should be considered as correct by the whole Court, or if, upon the whole facts, the demandant was by law en- \u2019 titled to recover, then judgment was to be entered on the verdict, which was returned for *the demandant otherwise the demandant was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">The cause was argued here, at the last September term, by <em>Bigelow </em>and <em>Burnside </em>for the demandant, and <em>Lincoln </em>for the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-10\"><em>For the demandant, </em>it was said that the lands originally laid out as ministerial lands were, from such location, appropriated to pious and charitable uses; and the demanded premises, being purchased in lieu of those lands, must be considered as so appropriated also by the very purchase. The deed from the town to <em>Maccarty </em>could not operate a disseisin, because he continued seised under his former right, which was for his own use during his continuance in-office, and of his successors afterwards. In the case of <em>Weston </em>vs. <em>Hunt, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> the Court say expressly, that \u201c an alienation of the parsonage by the town, district, precinct, or vestry, is void ; for if there be a minister, the fee is in him; or if there be a vacancy, the fee is in abeyance.\u201d <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The minister and parish united cannot convey parsonage lands, even by the provincial act of 1754, unless the consideration or proceeds of such sale are appropriated to the same use. A sale foi any other object would be fraudulent. It is well known that the legislature never authorize such an alienation, but on the express condition that the proceeds shall be applied in the same manner as the estate to be alienated. But the conveyance by the town to Mr. <em>Maccarty </em>was to a use and purpose wholly foreign. It was in consideration of being discharged from certain claims or liabilities, a grant to him and his heirs; and the town or future ministers were to be deprived of all benefit from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">The deed was wholly inoperative, and Mr. <em>Maccarty </em>continued to hold under his elder and better title until his death, in July, 1784. The entry by his executors was an abatement, and being less than thirty years before the commencement of the action, the demand ant is within the legal term of limitation. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> Great and * manifest inconveniences would result from a contrary hypothesis.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-6\"><em>Lincoln, </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACXQ\">The conveyance of <em>Breck </em>to <em>Chandle </em>was but of an estate for life in him, and the <em>cestui que use </em>can take no greater estate than the grantee. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> The deed itself contains nothing which should constitute a gift to pious and charitable uses. On the contrary, it purports only an ordinary sale for a pecuniary consideration. The doings of the town, either before or after its execution, can have no operation on its construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">As this was but a conveyance to <em>Chandler </em>for life, at his death the estate reverted to <em>Breck </em>or his heirs. The use to the town, as an ecclesiastical body, could not vest for the statutes of mortmain. Nor would the provincial act of 1754 have made it good, if it had applied to it; for the use was limited to the town.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">The conveyance by the committee of the town to <em>Maccarty </em>may be considered as the joint act of the minister and the town, within the spirit and intent of the act of 1754. The object of the act plainly was, to prevent a conveyance by one party, to the injury of the other. Here was a concurrent act of both ; and it may operate as a conveyance by the town, with the assent of the minister.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\">The conveyance by <em>Maccarty\u2019s </em>executors was an alienation with the assent of the town, previously granted through their committee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-10\">But if there has been no alienation, there was clearly a disseisin by the conveyance to <em>Maccarty </em>in 1765. The town was then disseised by its own act, or by that of its committee; and the demon d-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ant is barred of his right to recover in this action by the statute oi 1807, c. 74.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">The cause stood continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, and at the last March term in <em>Suffolk </em>it was ordered by the Court that judgment be entered on the verdict.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b288-11\"> <em>2 Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ark\">The first question which arises in this case is, whether the land demanded was ever ministerial *land, properly so called, of which the minister for the time being was seised in right of his parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">This is denied by the counsel for the tenant, because the deed conveying the premises from <em>Breck </em>to <em>Chandler </em>was made to him as treasurer of the town of <em>Worcester; </em>so that the land became the property of the inhabitants of that town, in their civil and corporate capacity, but not as a parish or religious society.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">But the motive and intent of the parties to this conveyance are apparent from the deed itself, it being expressly stated that the land was to be appropriated as a parsonage; and this being conformable to the vote of the town authorizing <em>Chandler </em>to purchase. At the time of the execution and delivery of this deed, the town of <em>Worcester </em>constituted one parish ; and it was the usage of all our towns anciently, before they became divided into parishes, to transact their parochial concerns at town meetings; making. no difference in the forms of their proceedings, when acting upon those subjects, or upon matters of mere municipal or political concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The grant of <em>Breck </em>to <em>Chandler, </em>who was the appointed agent of the town, was therefore a grant to pious uses; so as to come within the provisions of the provincial act of 1754; and the ministers of the town were entitled to the use of the property, and became seised successively, in right of their parish, which in this instance was the town. And according to other- provisions of that act, the substance of which has been reenacted since the adoption of the constitution, <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> this land was unalienable, except by the minister, with the assent of the town or parish over which he was settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The next question, then, is, whether the tenant has shown such alienation as comes within the letter or the spirit of the act then in force. Upon the application of the minister, the town voted, in 1764, to grant the premises to him in fee simple, for a certain consideration' agreed upon between the parties; and pursuant to that vote, a committee, appointed for the purpose by the * town, in 1765, by deeds released and sold the same to Mr. <em>Maccarty, </em>in the manner determined by that vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Was this an alienation according to the true intent and moaning of\u2019 the act ?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The town had not the fee in them, and therefore could not convey it. The fee was before in the minister, and this act of the town did not enlarge his estate ; for no title being in the inhabitants, according to the principles of the act of 1754, as explained in the case of <em>Weston </em>vs. <em>Hunt, </em>nothing passed by the deed of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">This being the case, the subsequent conveyance, attempted by the immediate grantors of the tenant, under the will of their father, who had been the minister to whom the grant of the town was made, must be ineffectual; for their father was seised only during the continuance of hi\u00e1 ministerial office, which had ceased before this conveyance was made; and his executors derived no power, under his will, to make a title to this land.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">It has been suggested that the vote of the town, on which the deed of the committee was founded, might be considered as the assent of the town within the act; and that a subsequent alienation, made by the minister, might be coupled with this assent, and thus a perfect alienation be made, within the equity of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We should be glad to adopt this reasoning in support of the tenant\u2019s title ; because we cannot but lament that a religious society should endeavor in this manner to avoid a conveyance, made, as far as appears, fairly by their predecessors; they having received a valuable consideration therefor. But we must administer the law, and leave it to the consciences of those who carry on the suit to estimate the true character of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">If Mr. <em>Maccarty </em>had aliened the premises in his lifetime, with reference to the vote of the town, as expressive of their assent, we do not know but the alienation would have been valid. But his power over the estate ceased with his life ; and he could not, if it had been * his intention, communicate an authority to his executors to dispose of them. The deed of the executors, therefore, as it respects the conveyance of title, is void, and the tenant can claim no benefit under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The effect of this decision will probably be, that an action upon the covenant to warrant will be brought; and that the estate of the deceased pastor of the first parish will be taken from his innocent heirs, to indemnify the tenant for the loss of a title which this very parish assisted to create, and for which they have once received a valuable, and, in their estimation, an adequate, consideration. But we have no right to regard the consequences of decisions which arise from a necessary application of the law to the facts brought before us. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(5)\">\n<p id=\"b290-12\"> <em>Stat. </em>1785, c. 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
