For value received I promise to pay Mr. <em>Philip Bagley, </em>or order, on demand, one hundred dollars, provided <em>John Baptist </em>does not render himself on board the private-armed schooner <em>M\u2019Donough, </em>in the harbor of <em>Boston, </em>and proceed to sea, and perform his duty as a seaman on board said vessel. <em>Peter </em>Francis.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">The parties agreed that the said <em>Baptist </em>did render himself on board the said schooner <em>M\u2019Donough, </em>and proceeded to sea in the same ; but left the said schooner in <em>France, </em>before the termination of her cruise. The parties also agreed that the following facts should be considered as part of the case, so far as they were material, and could be admitted as legal evidence in this action, <em>viz. </em>On the day of the date of said note, the plaintiff purchased of the said <em>Baptist </em>one half of his share of the prize-money of the said cruise of the said schooner, for which he paid the sum of fifty dollars ; and the said <em>Baptist </em>made him a bill of sale thereof. The agents of the said schooner refused to pay the plaintiff any part of the prize-money gained in said cruise, on account of the said <em>Bap tist\u2019s </em>share thereof being forfeited by his leaving the said schooner in <em>France. </em>A seaman\u2019s share in the said cruise amounted to the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">Upon these facts judgment was to be entered by nonsuit or default, as in the opinion of the Court law and justice should require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-9\"><em>Banister, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVF\">The action of <em>Bainbridge </em>vs. <em>Downie </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> was like this ; and although there the plaintiff failed of recovering, because the <em>United' States </em>were the party in interest, yet the Court expressed no doubt that the action lay for them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AEV1\">* <em>Saltonstall, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjH3\">argued that the promise was void by the statute of frauds, and for this he cited the case of <em>Wain </em>vs. <em>Warlters. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> And he contended that, if the promise in thib case were valid, here was no breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>condition. The defendant engaged only in case <em>Baptist </em>should not render himself on board the privateer, and proceed to sea, and perform his duty as a seaman. All this he did.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b386-12\"> 6 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>253.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AqT\"> 5 <em>Eastt </em>10</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b387-5\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWA\">The only point in this case is, what is the true construction of the condition upon the performance of which the defendant was to avoid his promise. The defendant contends that, as <em>Baptist </em>rendered himself on board the ship, and proceeded to sea, he did all which he stipulated for him; and that he should have been coerced to the performance of his duty by the discipline of the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">' But we think the engagement of the defendant was, that <em>Baptist </em>should so perform his duty during the cruise as to entitle himself to his share of the prize-money. Now, it appears that he deserted in <em>France, </em>before the cruise was finished, and has been adjudged, by a competent tribunal, to have forfeited his prize-money.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">This seems to be the very act which the plaintiff undertook to secure himself against by this note.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We see no relation that this case has to the statute of frauds. If the promise be to pay the debt of another, it is in writing; and the consideration is legal and sufficient. The whole agreement seems also to have been in writing, and expresses the real consideration of the promise. These circumstances being the plaintiff\u2019s case within the most rigorous construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
