It was intended only for the relief of our own citizens. It contemplates their <em>return </em>to this country, which is considered as an impediment <em>removed. </em>Neither of these could be predicated of one who had never been in the country.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-12\"><em>S. E. Smith, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7t\">The statute has not excluded foreigners from the benefit of the provision, nor is there any reason, consistent with good policy and the comity of nations, why they should be excluded. . This was the point taken in the case of <em>Strithorst </em>vs. <em>Graeme, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> upon the <em>English </em>statute of limitations; and the court there say, \u201c If the plaintiff is a foreigner, and doth not come to <em>England </em>in fifty years, he still hath six years, after his coming to <em>England, </em>to bring his action; and if he never comes tc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>England </em>himself, he has always a right of action while he lives abroad, and so have his executors or administrators after his death.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b176-14\"> 3 <em>Wils. </em>145.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A52\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aev\">The provision of the act for the limitation of personal actions, &amp;e., <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> which is relied on by the plaintiff, is that the act \u201c shall not be understood to bar any infant, feme covert, person imprisoned, or beyond sea,, without any of the <em>United States, &amp;c., </em>from bringing either of the actions before mentioned within the term before set and limited for bringing such action, reckoning from the time that such impediment shall be removed.\u201d It is probably not an uncommon notion that this provision was not contemplated to extend to foreigners. But the authority cited from <em>Wilson's </em>Reports in the argument is conclusive on the construction of the <em>English </em>statute of limitations. The expressions of that statute are like those of ours ; and this latter must receive the same construction, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\n<em>Replication adjudged good.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> <em>Slat. </em>1786, c. 52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"><em> </em>[See <em>Revised Statutes, </em>c. 120, \u00a7 6. \u2014 <em>Bulger </em>vs. <em>Roche, </em>11 <em>Pick. </em>36.\u2014 <em>Wilson </em>vs. <em>Appleton, </em>17 <em>Mass.
