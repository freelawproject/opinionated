To maintain the issue on the part of the demandants, they gave in evidence a deed of mortgage, made to them of the demanded premises on the 9th of February, 1802, by one <em>Seth Ciarle, </em>conditioned to pay his bond to them of that date for 1000 dollars, with interest in one year, acknowledged and recorded on the day of its date. The said * bond was also produced. The interest appeared to have been paid to the 2d of September, 1807.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-12\">They also gave in evidence another mortgage deed for the same debt, made to them on the 6th of October, 1807, by one <em>Laban Thurber, </em>conditioned for the payment of 1000 dollars, on demand, with interest from the 2d of September preceding; and a bond of said <em>Thurber </em>for the said sum, payable to them as aforesaid. The said mortgage deed was acknowledged, and it was recorded on the 9th of April, 1808. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-13\">The tenant claimed under <em>J. H. Dwight, </em>mortgagees of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Thurber, </em>and produced a deed from <em>Thurber </em>to said <em>Dwights, </em>dated the 7th of April, 1808, acknowledged on the same day, and recorded on the 8th of the same April, conditioned for the payment of several promissory notes from the said <em>Thurber </em>to the said <em>Dwights, </em>which were also produced; also an assignment from them to the tenant in due form of law, dated the 15th of April, 1809, acknowledged and recorded; also a copy of a deed of release, from the demandants to said <em>Ciarle, </em>of their right in the premises, referring to the first mortgage. This release was dated the 6th of October, 1807, and acknowledged; and it was recorded on the 9th of April, 1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\">The demandants offered <em>A. Kingsbury, </em>Esq., the treasurer of the state of <em>Connecticut, </em>as a witness; and he was admitted, the tenant objecting. They also offered a letter from the said <em>Dwights </em>to the said <em>Kingsbury, </em>as evidence that the said <em>Dwights </em>knew of the mortgage of the said <em>Thurber </em>to the demandants before <em>Thurber\u2019s </em>deed was made to the said <em>Divights; </em>which letter was admitted, notwithstanding the objections of the counsel for the tenant. There was no evidence offered that this was an original letter, excepting the testimony of said <em>Kingsbury, </em>that it was the same which he received in answer to one which he had addressed to them ; and nc notice was proved to have been given to the said <em>Dwights, </em>or to the tenant, to produce the original letter from said <em>Kings-bury </em>to them ; but no fraud in respect to the letter was suggested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7MT\">* The judge instructed the jury that the tenant was in no better condition than the <em>Dwights, </em>his assignors; that if, from the evidence in the case, they were satisfied that the <em>Divights </em>knew of <em>Thurber\u2019s </em>mortgage to the demandants, before they took their mortgage from <em>Thurber, </em>the demandants were entitled to a priority, and to recover in this action ; otherwise that tjie tenant ought by law to prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-8\">A verdict was given for the demandants. But if the said <em>Kings-bury </em>ought not to have been admitted as a witness, or the letter of the said <em>Dwights </em>.to him ought to have been rejected, or the direction to the jury was wrong, a new trial was to be granted; otherwise judgment was to be rendered upon the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-9\">The cause was argued, at the last September term, by <em>Bliss </em>and <em>Strong </em>for the demandants, and <em>Ashmun </em>and <em>Mills </em>for the tenant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-10\">\n<em>For the tenant</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAxp\">it was contended that <em>Kingsbury </em>was an incompetent witness. He was directly interested in the event of the suit, and, indeed, was a party to it. It is of no importance that his interest was minute. One man\u2019s mind may be influenced by a motive that would be perfectly inoperative upon another\u2019s. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>therefore that the rule is absolute, that no person interested in a suit shall be a witness. A case in 2 <em>Lev. </em>231 seems opposed to this doctrine. But there the witness was admitted on account of the remoteness of his interest, not on account of the smallness of it; and <em>Butter </em>doubts whether that case be law. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">The practice of our own courts has conformed to this <em>principle; </em>members of corporations, parties to a suit, having always been rejected as witnesses, without any reference to the amount or value of their interest; and a statute was found necessary to change the law in this regard, as it related to inhabitants of towns and par ishes. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> In <em>England, </em>also, several statutes have been made, to alter this rule of the common law, and to permit corporators to be witnesses in certain cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">In the present case, there was no necessity for Mr. <em>Kings-bury </em>to testify, since, with the use of ordinary * diligence, other witnesses might have been obtained of the facts testified by him, if true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">The. letter of Messrs. <em>Dwights </em>was not admissible evidence, without other and better proof of its authenticity. The witness was not in the habit of corresponding with them, and, indeed, had, never seen their hand-writing: his testimony, then, on this point was of no effect. If the letter was genuine, there must have been other means of proving it, in the power of the demandants, less objectionable than the one they used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-8\">The tenant is not exactly in the place of the <em>Dwights. </em>He purchased <em>bona fide, </em>and for a valuable consideration. Their knowledge of the prior conveyance ought not to affect him. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> A fair purchaser of an absolute estate without notice is protected; and there appears no reason for a different principle in cases of mortgage.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-9\">\n<em>The counsel for the demandants</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6K\">(being informed by the Court: that they need not argue the competency of Mr. <em>Kingsbury </em>as a-witness) contended that the letter of the <em>Dwights </em>was competent evidence; and it was well left to the jury to judge of its genuineness and effect. Since it was received by mail, in answer to one written to them by <em>Kingsbury, </em>it furnished a legal presumption that <em>Kings-bury\u2019s </em>letter, giving notice of <em>Thurber\u2019s </em>mortgage, had been received by them. It was not necessary to prove their hand-writing, since, for the purpose for which the letter was introduced at the trial, a letter written by their order would have had the same effect. There</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>was no necessity of notice to produce <em>Kingsbury\u2019s </em>letter. It was not in the keeping of the tenant, and the <em>Dwights </em>were not parties nor witnesses. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">The tenant can be in no better plight than the <em>Dwights, </em>his assignors. He cannot be said to have purchased without notice of a prior encumbrance. <em>Thurber\u2019s </em>mortgage to the demandants was on record more than a year before the assignment of the <em>Dwights </em>to him : he ought to have seen this, and should have been put on his guard. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahz\">* The cause was continued <em>nisi, </em>and at the last April term here the opinion of the Court was pronounced by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\"> <em>Bull. </em>N. <em>P. </em>290.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"Aqb1\"> <em>Stat. </em>1792, c. 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\"> 1 <em>New. </em>Rep. 332, <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Martyn. </em>\u201410 Johns. 135, <em>Jackson </em>vs Henry.\u20142 <em>Mass.

The case of one sovereign becoming a party in the judicial courts of another is novel, and perhaps wholly unknown in the common law. But we constantly find the sovereign, both here and in <em>Great Britain, </em>a party in suits in their own courts; and it was never imagined that all the citizens or subjects of the government were incompetent witnesses in such suits because the government might be enriched by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">As to the letter of <em>J. &amp;f H. Dwight, </em>which was read in evidence, it is not very important to consider the question; because, on the new trial, which must be had in this case, one or the other of the parties can undoubtedly produce such evidence as will put it out of doubt. It appears, however, to us, that the letter was properly admitted at the trial, upon the evidence that was then offered of its authenticity.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The third is the most important point in this case; and upon that we are, on the whole, satisfied that there ought to be a new trial. A person who takes a conveyance of land, with knowledge that the grantor had previously conveyed it to another, cannot hold it against the first purchaser, even though the first conveyance is not recorded. It would be fraudulent in him to attempt thus to deprive the purchaser of the fruits of his contract. If the grantor can be considered as having any title or estate after the first conveyance, it is merely the legal estate which he holds in trust for the first purchaser; and the second, purchasing with knowledge of the trust, shall hold subject to the same trust. But if the second purchaser procures his deed to be recorded before the other, and then sells the land <em>bona fide, </em>and for a valuable consideration, to a person wholly ignorant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of those circumstances, the latter will hold the land against the first purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">If this were not so, our laws, which require the registering of deeds, would be useless, if not worse; because * a purchaser, after the most thorough examination in the registry of deeds, and finding a succession of conveyances, all in legal form and in perfect order, might still be evicted upon proof of a secret trust, or a fraud, on the part of some former owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We can see no difference in the application of these principles, when the conveyances are absolute, and when they are made as a pledge or security for a debt. A mortgage furnishes no security for a debt unless it enables the grantee to hold the land absolutely, if the debt is not paid, in the same manner as he would have held it if the original conveyance had been without condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The question in this case has no connection with the principles which regulate the assignment of a <em>chose in action. </em>If <em>Thurher </em>had given a bond to the <em>Dwights, </em>with a mortgage to secure it, and the <em>Dwights, </em>before their assignment to <em>Bradish, </em>had received payment of the bond, or had given a defeasance of it, <em>Bradish, </em>as assignee, would be bound by those acts, although they had been wholly unknown to him. This is the whole effect of the case of <em>Chite </em>vs. <em>Robison, </em>which was cited in the argument. It is true that, if by any such defence the assignee is prevented from recovering the money appearing to be due on the bond, he will also lose all benefit from the mortgage. But this arises, not from any defect in the title to the land, or in the manner of conveying it, considered by itself; but is only an incidental consequence of the discharge or avoidance of the bond for which the land is pledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">So, if the notes given by <em>Thurber </em>to the <em>Dwights </em>had been overdue at the time of the assignment, <em>Bradish </em>would have taken the notes, subject to any defence that could be made to them by <em>Thurber; </em>and if such a defence should prevail, it would virtually defeat and avoid the mortgage in the hands of <em>Bradish. </em>But if the money expressed in the notes is due, and payable to <em>Bradish, </em>by force of the assignment to him, the question whether he shall hold the land as security for that money must be decided like any other question relating to the same land.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">* The only case cited in the argument, which seems to militate with our opinion upon this point, is that of <em>Walley </em>vs. <em>Walley &amp; Al., </em>in 1 <em>Vern. </em>484. This case is cited by <em>Powell </em>on mortgages, as showing that the assignee of a mortgage will be affected by notice to the assignor of an outstanding title to the land mortgaged, and will take subject to that title. The case furnishes no authority to that point. It was proved that the assignee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>at the time of the assignment, had actual notice of the outstanding title, and therefore this question could not arise; and accordingly it is not noticed in the opinion of the court. It was, indeed, contended in that case, by the counsel for <em>Warner, </em>one of the defendants, that, although it was proved that he had notice of the outstanding title, yet that it did not appear that his assignor <em>{Gandy, </em>another defendant) had such notice. To this it was answered, by the counsel for the plaintiff, that, as <em>Warner </em>had purchased with full notice, he could not defend himself as an innocent purchaser; and that, if he would mend his case on the pretence that <em>Gandy, </em>his assignor, had no notice, he must stand in <em>Gandy\u2019s </em>place ; and then the confession of <em>Gandy, </em>(in his answer to the same bill,) that he had notice, would bind <em>Warner. </em>This argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, if it had been adopted by the court, would by no means prove that if <em>Warner </em>had had no notice himself, and was defending himself as an innocent purchaser, he would be affected by such notice to his assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">It was further said, in the argument of the case at bar, that the deed under which the demandants claim being registered before the assignment to <em>Bradish, </em>although after the conveyance to the <em>Dwights, Bradish </em>might and ought to have known that there was a prior conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">This is at most only evidence to show that <em>Bradish </em>did know the fact; and if, from this or any other legal evidence, the jury should find that he did know it, his title would be void as against the demandants; or rather his mortgage would be postponed to theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">But we certainly cannot say that he shall be presumed, * from this circumstance, to know of the prior conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">When a purchaser is examining his title in the registry of deeds, and finds a good conveyance to his grantor, he is not expected to look further. This case, it is true, presents the question in a very strong point of view for the demandants ; as <em>Bradish </em>had only to look to the registry for the next day, and perhaps only to the next page, to discover this prior conveyance to the demandants. But if he is required to look one day, or one page, beyond that which ex-nibits the title of 'his grantor, it will be impossible to say where the inquiry shall stop. The verdict is set aside, and a</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\n<em>New trial granted, </em>\n<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"><em> [Somes </em>vs. Brewer, 2 <em>Pick. </em>184 <em>\u2014Hall </em>vs. Bigelow, 16 <em>Mass.
