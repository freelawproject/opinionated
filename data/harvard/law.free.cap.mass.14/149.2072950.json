The judge overruled the objection. The defendant then contended that the tract of land granted to the plaintiff must be limited by the boundaries in the deed, and that by them the island in dispute was necessarily excluded from the land granted ; and that the boundaries, being definite, and fixed by monuments, could not be so extended, by any reference to said plan, as to include the island in the said grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">The judge directed the jury, that, as there was a direct reference in the deed to the survey taken by <em>Titcomb </em>and annexed to his deposition, the island should be considered as within the description of the land in the deed ; and as land granted as bounded by a river is held to extend to the thread or channel of the river, and as here were two channels, it might well be presumed the intent of the parties to the conveyance that the grant was intended to extend to that channel, which would include the island.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Af9\">*A verdict was returned for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the whole Court upon the direction of the judge, and the admission of the said deed, deposition, and plan.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-6\"><em>Fessenden, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaYG\">The land is described in the grant, and bounded by visible and known monuments, and by these the island in question is plainly excluded. There is no ambiguity in the language, and no construction <em>ah extra </em>should be admitted. <em>\"\u2022 </em>Bounding by the river,\u201d must intend that edge of the river or which the hemlock trees stood, or those trees cannot be any part of the boundary. But at the farthest, the land granted can be held to extend only to the thread of that branch of the river on which the trees were standing. The plan was improperly admitted. It was not an ancient one, and it was taken between other parties. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-7\"><em>Whitman </em>and <em>Greenleaf </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\"> 2 <em>Mass.

The grantee must take in conformity to that survey, and the island, being included within the land surveyed, must pass by the deed. Besides, land granted as bounded by a river extends to the thread of the river, unless, from prior grants on the other side of the river, such a construction is negatived ; and in this case the channel on the farther side of the island may well be considered as intended by the description in this grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
