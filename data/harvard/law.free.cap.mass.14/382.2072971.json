In the year 1773, <em>Nathaniel French, </em>who was the reputed father of the pauper\u2019s mother, and who had a legal settlement in that part of <em>Braintree </em>which is now <em>Randolph, </em>married the said <em>Sarah Blanchard </em>the elder, and she resided there with her husband until his death, in 1780, and she continued to reside on the estate owned by her husband in that place until her death, in 1787. From the marriage of the said <em>Sarah </em>the elder, her daughter <em>Sarah </em>(the mother of the pauper) continued to reside with her until 1785 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>since which time neither she nor the pauper have acquired any legal settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">If, on these facts, it should be the opinion of the Court that the pauper had a legal settlement in <em>Braintree, </em>judgment was to be rendered for the plaintiffs upon the default of the defendants, for a sum agreed by the parties; otherwise the plaintiffs were to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">No argument was had, and the opinion of the Court was delivered at the last July term in <em>Plymouth.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b327-7\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARRC\">In the case of <em>The Inhabitants of Petersham </em>vs. <em>The Inhabitants of Dana, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> it was decided that, by the statute <em>of </em>1789, c. 14, an illegitimate child, which had the settlement of its mother at the time of its birth, would acquire a new settlement with the mother, until it should acquire one in its own right. * In the case of <em>The Inhabitants of Boylston </em>vs. <em>The Inhabitants of Princeton, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> it was settled that, under the statute of 1793, c. 32, now in force, an illegitimate child retains the settlement derived from the mother at the time of its birth, without being affected by any settlement subsequently gained by the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The construction of these two statutes being thus judicially settled, we have only to inquire how the case stood with respect to the settlement of illegitimate children before they were passed ; the pauper in question having gained a settlement in some place before those statutes were in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Under the provincial act of 7 <em>Geo. </em>3, c. 3, illegitimate children acquired no settlement by birth, but had the settlement of their mother. At that period, the mother was capable of acquiring a new settlement by marriage; and the illegitimate child followed the settlement of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">By the act incorporating the town of <em>Randolph, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> the inhabitants of that town were held to support all such poor persons as, at the time of passing the act, were, or before had been, or thereafterwards should be, inhabitants of that part of <em>Braintree </em>incorporated as <em>Randolph, </em>who then were, or might afterwards become, chargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">The pauper in question acquired no settlement by her birth in <em>Newton, </em>but had the settlement of her mother. This latter originally had a settlement in <em>Braintree, </em>by virtue of the settlement of her mother, who was a native of, and had a settlement in, that town. But upon her intermarriage with <em>French, </em>she was subject to change her settlement with her husband. His settlement was in <em>Randolph, </em>by virtue of the provisions of the act incorporating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>town His wife\u2019s settlement was transferred with his; that of her illegitimate daughter followed ; and the pauper, who was the child of this daughter, has her legal settlement in the same place. So that this action cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b327-14\"> 12 <em>Mass Rep. </em>429.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b327-15\"> 13 <em>Mass.
