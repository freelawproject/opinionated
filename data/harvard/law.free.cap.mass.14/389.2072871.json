</em>and did, by said writing, covenant, among other things, with the said <em>Joseph, </em>that he would, when thereto required, within a reasonable time, make a further transfer of said <em>Hatch\u2019s </em>patent right to said <em>Joseph, </em>in as full a manner as said <em>Hatch </em>had engaged to do to said <em>Worthington. </em>Yet, though said <em>Erastus </em>has been often requested * and demanded, and particularly on the 18th day of July last, at <em>Dedham </em>aforesaid, which was within a reasonable time after the execution and delivery of his said writing, to perform his covenant aforesaid, the said <em>Erastus </em>has not made to the said <em>Joseph </em>a further transfer of said <em>Hatch\u2019s </em>patent right aforesaid, in as full a manner as the said <em>Hatch </em>had engaged to do to said Worthington, but wholly refused so to do; and so said <em>Joseph </em>says that said <em>Erastus </em>his covenant aforesaid has not kept, but has broken the same, to the damage of,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-11\">The defendant pleaded in bar, that, on the 31st of May last past, he procured from the said <em>Hatch </em>an assignment and further transfer of one sixteenth of the said patent right, (the said <em>Hatch </em>having previously obtained letters patent for the same,) in as full a manner as said <em>Hatch </em>had previously engaged to make the same to him, which is dated the day last mentioned, signed and sealed by <em>Hatch, </em>and in Court to be produced ; and that, on the same day, having the said assignment, &amp;c., in his possession, he wiote on the same anothei <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>and further transfer and assignment from him, the said <em>Erastus, </em>to said <em>Joseph, </em>and signed and sealed the same, and afterwards on, &amp;c., which was within a reasonable time, and at divers other times, offered to deliver, and is still ready and willing to deliver, the same to the said <em>Joseph ;

and afterwards on the 1st of * May, 1815, obtained the said letters patent, and while in possession thereof, <em>viz., </em>on the 31st of the same May, he executed and delivered to the defendant an assignment of one sixteenth part of the said patent <em>right, </em>as follows, <em>viz. : </em>\u201c Know all men, that I, <em>John Hatch, </em>of, &amp;c., in consideration of 200 dollars, to me paid by <em>Erastus Worthington, </em>of, &amp;c., have and do, by these presents, assign, transfer, and set over, to said <em>Worthington </em>one sixteenth part of all the right, title, and interest, I have in a cei tain patent right by me obtained on the 1st day of May present, which is called \u2018 a new and useful invention for cutting files.\u2019 And I do hereby convey and relinquish all the profits and benefit, of every kind, which might accrue to me from said sixteenth part; this assignment being made agreeably to a promise by me made to said <em>Worthington </em>on, &amp;c. In witnesses whereof,\u201d &amp;c. On the same 31st of May, the defendant, having possession of said assignment, but not having then or ever since recorded the same in the office of the secretary of state, executed the following instrument, under his hand and seal, on the same paper, <em>viz.: \u201c </em>Know all men, that I, <em>Erastus Worthington, </em>of, &amp;c., in consideration of 200 dollars, paid me by <em>Joseph Morrill, </em>of, &amp;c., have and do hereby transfer, assign, and set over, to said <em>Joseph, </em>and to his assigns, all the right, title, and interest, I have in the above assignment, which is one sixteenth part of <em>John Hatch\u2019s </em>patent file-machine for cutting files; this assignment being made according to an agreement which I have heretofore made with the said <em>Joseph,\u201d </em>as a further assignment and transfer of all his interest in the said patent right to the plaintiff ; and then offered to deliver the same to the plaintiff, as a performance of the covenant set forth in the declaration, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u2018n a reasonable time ; and has ever since been ready to deliver the same to the plaintiff; but the plaintiff refused to receive the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">If, on these facts, the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment, the jury were to assess his damages; otherwise the plaintiff was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-6\">* <em>Metcalf, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY30\">contended that the instrument tendered by the defendant was not a performance of his engagement, as it contained no covenant of warranty. <em>Hatch </em>may not have been the original inventor, in which case nothing would pass by the instrument, and the plaintiff would have paid his money without a consideration, and would still be without remedy. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">To have given a good title to the plaintiff, it was necessary that <em>Hatch\u2019s </em>assignment should first have been recorded in the office of the secretary of state, as required by the law of the <em>United States </em>on this subject. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-8\"><em>Fuller, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFqD\">In every transfer or conveyance of personal chattels, there is an implied warranty that the vendor has a property in the thing conveyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-9\">The statute of the <em>United States </em>does not require the recording of transfers of these patent rights until the whole right is assigned. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\"> 2 Johns. 613, <em>Clutete </em>vs. <em>Robinson </em>\u20145 <em>Mass.

The defendant covenanted that he would make a transfer to the plaintiff, in as full and ample a manner as <em>Hatch </em>had engaged to do to the defendant; and it appears that he has tendered a deed in which he has conveyed the title in as full and ample a manner as <em>Hatch </em>had in fact conveyed it to him. He did all that he was bound to do; all that <em>Hatch </em>had done or engaged to do to him. The case of <em>Lassels </em>vs. <em>Catterton, </em>which was cited for the plaintiff, stands on different grounds. That was a covenant to make such conveyance as counsel should advise ; and the allegation of the breach was, that the plaintiff had tendered such a conveyance, which was set forth at large ; and it is there said that in such case usual covenants may be put in; but there must not be a warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The other objection is, that, the defendant should first have recorded <em>Hatch\u2019s </em>transfer, before he could legally * assign it to the plaintiff. But we do not think the defendant was under such an obligation. It was for the plaintiff to register the transfer, as in cases of conveyance of real estate, which the purchaser always procures to be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
