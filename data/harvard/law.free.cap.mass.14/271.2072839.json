The said note, not long after the date of it, fell into the hands of the said <em>Brown, </em>with whom <em>Roys </em>treated for its payment. Whether <em>Wells </em>endorsed the note to <em>Brown, </em>or in what manner it became his property, <em>Roys </em>did not know. In May or June, 1816, <em>Brown </em>brought and delivered to <em>Roys </em>fifty hides to be tanned. At the time of the service of the summons in this case, the hides were in the vats, in the process of tanning. Before the said service, one <em>Jacob Spoor, </em>who said he was the agent of <em>Reuben Wilcox, </em>called on <em>Roys, </em>and notified him that said <em>Wilcox </em>was the owner of said hides and holder of said note ; but he did not show to <em>Roys </em>the note, or any instrument assigning the same or the leather. Afterwards, and after the ser vice of the summons, <em>Wilcox, </em>in presence of <em>Brown, </em>again notified him that he held, and was owner of, said note and hides ; that <em>Brown </em>had, in April, 1816, assigned the same to him; and he showed him the note, which <em>Roys </em>says he thinks contained an endorsement by <em>Brown, </em>transferring the same. Since the tanning of the hides was completed, and since the service of this process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>upon him, <em>Roys </em>delivered to <em>Wilcox </em>the greater part of the leather, for the tanning of which <em>Wilcox </em>gave him credit on his said note.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-5\"><em>Howe, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATco\">cited the cases of <em>Sebor </em>vs. <em>Armstrong &amp; Trustee, </em>4 <em>Mass.

But there is nothing to show that <em>Wilcox </em>was purchaser of the hides but his own declaration. There is no evidence that any consideration was paid for them ; nor is there any instrument of convey anee which might <em>prima facie </em>prove the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">This property, although not liable to attachment, because not removable without materially injuring it, is nevertheless subject to this process; because the trustee may, according to the statute, keep possession until the property is capable of removal without injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">It is true, as laid down in the case of <em>The Maine F. and M. Ins. Co. </em>vs. <em>Weeks &amp; Trustee, </em>cited in , the argument, that no one can be charged, unless he be liable in an action to the principal debtor, or have chattels in his possession, liable to be seized and sold on execution. This proposition is, however, applicable to the nature of the property, and not to the time or manner of the liability of the trustee. Thus one cannot be made trustee by reason of promissory notes deposited in his hands, because they cannot be taken in execution. Nor in the case referred to was there any breach of contract, by the supposed trustee, on which an action would lie. But where there is a debt actually due, although not payable, or where there is property deposited, which may after-wards be liable to be seized, it may be holden by this process; and provision is * made in the statute for a valuation of it, if it cannot be delivered on execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The equivocal manner in which the trustee in the case before us speaks of the endorsement of the note, when shown to him by <em>Wilcox, </em>forbids us from considering it as assigned; and even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>note for labor, <em>viz., </em>for tanning the hides, had been assigned, some further evidence would be wanted that the hides themselves had been fairly transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>Trustee charged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
