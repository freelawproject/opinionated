The indictment was accordingly read by a sentence at a time, and <em>Nelson, </em>having been sworn,' explained its purport to him, making signs with his fingers, &amp;c. After which the Court ordered the trial to proceed, as on a plea of not guilty.</summary>\n<opinion>[NO OPINION]</opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
