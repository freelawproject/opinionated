If this should be contested on the ground that <em>Abigail\u2019s </em>assent to the decree of the judge of probate may be considered as a conveyance of her purparty to the demandants, the answer is, that such a conveyance is void by the statute of frauds.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-10\"><em>Hoare, </em>for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY3i\">The decree was held to be void in the decision of the former action, as it respected the tenant, because he had no notice of the proceedings. But <em>Abigail Smith </em>not only had notice, but she certified her assent to the decree, and received the money awarded her as an equivalent for her share of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>land. As to her, then, the judge had jurisdiction; and if his judgment was wrong, her only mode of avoiding it was by appeal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZA3\">On the trial of the former action between these parties, it was not known, or at least it was not proved, that <em>Israel Smith </em>had a mother living at his death. If this fact had appeared at that trial, it might have saved the parties the expense of the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">It is now said that the partition or assignment in the Probate Court, being void in part, is void in the whole; * and that therefore <em>Abigail Smith\u2019s </em>right to one fifth part descended, at her decease, to all her children. If so, <em>Peter Smith </em>is entitled to one <em>fourth </em>part, which he formerly recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">But we are satisfied that the proceedings in the Probate Court were valid and effectual as to <em>Abigail\u2019s </em>share. The avoidance of it as to <em>Peter </em>has no effect whatever as between <em>Rice </em>and the other heirs. Their respective proportions, whether of land or money, remain the same ; and none of them are prejudiced in any manner by the mistake or error as to <em>Peter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\"><em>Abigail </em>received the money awarded to her, and certified her assent to the assignment. This is equivalent to direct evidence that she was notified of the proceedings; and is, indeed, stronger than such evidence; because, instead of an implied and tacit assent, it shows an express agreement, and a waiver of all objections to the proceedings. If the heirs had all joined in a deed for the conveyance of the premises to <em>Rice </em>and his wife, and afterwards the deed, as it respected <em>Peter, </em>had been avoided for duress or insanity, &amp;c., it might as well be said that this would avoid it also as to the other grantors, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> <em>[Newell </em>vs. Sadler, 16 <em>Mass.
