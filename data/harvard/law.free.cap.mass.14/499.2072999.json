To this plea the <em>Attorney-General </em>demurred, which demurrer was joined by the prisoners.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-5\"><em>Sumner, Hitchborn, </em>and' <em>Morton, </em>counsel for the prisoners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADh3\">cited <em>Vattcl, </em>b. 3, c. 8, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 137, 142. \u20147 <em>Rep. </em>6, <em>Calvin\u2019s </em>case. \u2014 1 <em>Black.

This has been the practice in <em>England; </em>and although they may perhaps be tried also by courts-martial, that cannot oust the courts of law of their general jurisdiction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AyE\">To which opinion <em>the Court </em>held, and, on deliberation, unanimously overruled the plea.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
