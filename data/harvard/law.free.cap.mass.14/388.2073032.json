If a prisoner, before being discharged, be beyond those limits, he has committed an escape, and is no longer a prisoner; nor can the oath be lawfully administered to him after such escape. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-9\"><em>Morton, </em>(Attorney-General,) for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtPG\">The ques tian depends wholly on the statute providing the oath. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> By the statute, the justices are authorized to appoint the time and place for administering the oath ; * and nothing therein requires it to be done within the prison. It is directed that the oath shall be administered at the time and place appointed. Further, if the party be not admitted to his oath by the justices, the statute directs that he shall be \u201c <em>remanded </em>back to prison ; \u201d implying, necessarily, that he had been taken out for the purpose of taking the oath. Nor is the provision without the highest reason to support it. A contagious and mortal disease may prevail within the limits of the prison; and no justices could be expected to put themselves in a situation so hazardous.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\"> 2 <em>Burr. </em>1125. \u2014 3 <em>Burr. </em>1697. \u2014 3 <em>P.

There seems to be no assignable reason for such a provision ; and there are several reasons opposed to it. It is wisely left to the discretion of the magistrates to appoint a suitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>time and place; and a prisoner commits no escape in rendering himself at the time and place so appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
