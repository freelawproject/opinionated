The facts in the case were as follows: \u2014 <em>Ebenezer Seaver, </em>deceased, made his last will on the 24th of December, 1784, appointing his wife and his son <em>Ebenezer, </em>the appellant, executors. After declaring it to be a disposition of his whole estate, he directs all his just debts and funeral charges to be paid by his executors, and then adds; \u201c And to enable them to discharge the same, if possible, without disposing of the stock on the farm, I do hereby will and empower my said executors to make sale of all my lots of wild and unimproved land in the county of <em>Hampshire, </em>and to give and execute a good deed or deeds thereof in the law.\u201d He then devises to his two sons, <em>Ebenezer </em>and <em>\u25a0Joshua </em>in fee, all his houses and lands in <em>Roxbury, </em>and all his wearing apparel, stock, and other personal estate, <em>except what is otherwise disposed of in the will, </em>to be equally divided between them. And after giving to his two daughters, <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Mar goret, </em>one hundred pounds lawful money each, he adds this pro vision : 11 And my will further is, that, in case there should be a surplusage of money arising from the sale of my unimproved lands in the county of <em>Hampshire, </em>after all my debts are paid, such surplusage shall be equally divided between my four children, <em>Ebenezer, Joshua, Hannah, </em>and Margaret.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">Upon an administration account rendered by the said <em>Ebenezer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>and allowed by the judge of probate, there remained in the said <em>Ebenezer\u2019s </em>hands, as executor, the *sum of \u00a3226 10s. <em>6d., </em>after the payment of all debts and legacies ; which sum included the proceeds of the sale of the said lands in <em>Hampshire, </em>they having produced a greater sum than the said balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">The respondents, in right of the wife, who is the testator's daughter <em>Hannah, </em>claimed one fourth of the said balance, alleging that it was due to her,.as the surplusage arising from the sales of the <em>Hampshire </em>lands after payment of the debts as directed in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">The appellant insisted that the said balance belonged to him and his brother <em>Joshua, </em>in virtue of the gift to them of the personal estate, alleging that the said lands ought to be first applied to the payment of debts in relief of the personal estate; and that, the said lands not having produced a sum sufficient for the payment of the debts, no surplusage had come to his hands for distribution, within the intent of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">The judge of probate having ordered the said <em>Ebenezer </em>to account to the respondents for the said fourth part of the said sum in his hands, he appealed from the said order to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-8\"><em>Morton, </em>(Attorney-General,) for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADm\">Although it is not in a testator\u2019s power to exempt his estate from the payment of his debts, and regularly the personal estate is first to be applied to that object, yet he may otherwise direct, and appropriate the whole or a part of his real estate, as a fund, out of which his debts shall be paid. The testator in this case did so. His desire plainly was to save his personal estate for his sons, so far as his wild lands would reach for that purpose ; constituting those lands a specific fund, out of which the debts should first be paid. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-9\"><em>Amory, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqz\">Had there been no particular bequest of the personal estate in this will, this question would never have been raised; but that gift was to take effect only after payment of the debts. A testator, charging his real estate with the payment of debts, does not thereby hinder the application of the personal estate first, unless such provision is expressly * made. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Here was no exemption of any part of the personal estate, except of the stock; although the specific personal legacies may fairly be exempted by implication.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b76-11\"> 2 <em>Black.

[Here his honor recited the several clauses of the will, as above.]</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">After the death of the testator, the lands in <em>Hampshire </em>were sold by the executors, in pursuance of the will, and the debts and legacies were paid; the executors still having in their hands a surplus of the aggregate fund, consisting of the proceeds of the sale of the lands, and of the value of the personal estate, excepting the stock on the farm and the testator\u2019s wearing apparel; one fourth part of which surplus the respondents claim, by virtue of the last provision in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">But the appellant contends that, by the true construction of the will, it must be understood that the intention of the testator was to charge the unimproved lands in <em>Hampshire </em>with the payment of his debts, in relief of his personal estate generally; and that the proceeds of the sale ought to be applied as the first fund for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">This position, however, cannot be maintained, unless it appears that such was the manifest intention of the testator. For by law the personal estate is the proper fund for the payment of debts and legacies ; and must be so applied, unless it be exempted, either by express words or by necessary implication. Such an implication is supposed to arise from the specific bequest of the personal estate to the sons; and if it were absolute, and were not controlled by any other clause in the will, the implication would appear plain and obvious. But the whole personal estate is not given to the sons ; there being an exception of such parts thereof as had * not been before disposed of. The disposition thus referred to is probably to be found in the first clause of the will; whereby the personal estate, with the exception of the stock on the farm, is made subject, as we understand the will, to the payment of debts and legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The reason given for charging the lands is, that the debts may be paid, <em>if possible, without disposing of the stock on the farm. </em>This plainly indicates an intention to exonerate the stock, and the stock only. No other reasonable construction can be given to this part of the will. For if the testator\u2019s meaning had been to charge the lands in the first place, and that the personal estate was to go to his sons, should the funds arising from the sale of the lands be sufficient to discharge the debts and legacies, there could have been no difficulty in expressing such an intention distinctly and clearly; as by expressly charging the lands to that extent, or by directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>them to be sold at all events for the payment of debts, or by substituting the words <em>personal estate </em>for <em>stock on the farm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">But no such intention is to be collected from any part of the will. The testator appears to have understood that his personal estate was liable for the payment of debts, and that it might be insufficient without including the stock, which he was desirous of preserving for the use of the farm. It being, however, uncertain what might be the amount of his debts, he provides for all probable contingencies. If the personal estate should be more than sufficient for the payment of debts and legacies, the surplus was to go to his sons; and if not sufficient, the fund arising from the sale of the land was to be applied, so far as might be necessary, to malee up the deficiency ; and the residue was to be divided between his four children. This seems to be the natural and obvious construction of the will, and the only one which can comport with the peculiai phraseology of the clause first cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">It has been argued that an intention inconsistent with this construction is manifested by other parts of the * will. For, as the testator intended to dispose of his whole estate, and as he made no disposition of his <em>Hampshire </em>lands, in case the personal estate should be sufficient to pay the debts, the inference drawn is, that it was his intention that those lands should be sold at all events, and applied to the payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">But it must be recollected that the testator seems to have apprehended that his personal estate would not be sufficient to discharge his debts; and even that the interposition of the sale of his <em>Hampshire </em>lands might possibly not save the stock. He might therefore well suppose that the sale of those lands would be necessary, on the construction we adopt; and, in fact, they were so. He accordingly disposed of the surplus of the proceeds of the sale, instead of devising the lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Supposing, however, that the construction of the will is doubtful; still the appellant ought not to prevail; it being a rule of law, that no doubtful words in a will shall have the operation of exempting the personal property from the payment of debts, and of charging them on the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">This principle alone is decisive ; and will warrant the affirmance of the decree of the judge of probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
