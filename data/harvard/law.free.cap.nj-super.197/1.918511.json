Here, as part of the plea agreement, the State agreed to remain silent at the time of sentence, and it did so. The present appeal not only would project issues not raised in the trial court but would contravene the State\u2019s commitment to remain silent as to sentence. The State may not invoke <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(f)(2) to challenge a sentence in violation of such a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
