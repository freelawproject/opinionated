Shapiro, </em>545 <em>F.Supp. </em>826 (D.N.J.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">We disagree with the Law Division judge and reverse. We conclude that plaintiff may resort to the judicial remedy created by our Legislature<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for any alleged violation of her rights as a patient and need not resort to the federal court or its mediator.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Plaintiff has been a voluntary patient and resident at the Essex County Hospital Center since 1956. She had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and suffers from a delusion that she is a physician. She receives occasional mail at the hospital addressed to her known aliases, \u201cDr. Babs Golden\u201d or \u201cDr. Barbara Smith\u201d. Her treatment team decided that she should not receive mail addressed to those names. The team thought receipt of this mail fostered her delusion and was poor for her therapy. This suit was brought in April 1983 to contest the legality of that decision. The suit claimed a right to relief under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 and also under State law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and \u201cbecause plaintiffs claims are <em>res judicata.\u201d </em>The Law Division judge dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust the administrative remedies contained in the <em>Goodwin v. Shapiro </em>settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\"><em>Goodwin </em>was brought pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 by 16 past and present patients, not including the present plaintiff, of the Essex County Hospital Center in 1980. In <em>Goodwin </em>the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction restraining defendants from maintaining conditions and pursuing policies which they alleged deprived them of their right to meaningful treatment; subjected them to inhumane and unsafe environmental factors, such as physical abuse and overcrowded ward conditions; deprived them of effective medical care; confined them in unduly restrictive ward settings; deprived them of their fundamental personal and civil rights; and denied them access to their own funds. <em>[Ibid. </em>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The action was certified as a class action pursuant to <em>Fed.R. Civ.P. </em>23(b)(2), \u201cwith the class consisting of all past, present and future patients at the Essex County Hospital Center.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>On July 20, 1981 the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement \u201cresolving all matters raised by the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Settlement set forth the \u201crights, standards and services\u201d, required by the Essex County Hospital Center in such areas of safety and maintenance of the physical plant, treatment, staffing, quality control, and nutritional standards. <em>Id. </em>at 827-848. As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that its terms would be monitored by a court-appointed master. <em>Id. </em>at 849-851.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In the case before us the judge reasoned that the plaintiffs allegations, even though \u201cnot specifically designated as a problem\u201d in <em>Goodwin, </em>should be handled by the <em>Goodwin </em>master under the authority to mediate \u201cany disputes that arise among or between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850, (Section XII(ll)(d) of the settlement agreement). Despite finding that \u201cthe [master] was not strictly an administrative agency under <em>R. </em>4:69-7... \u201d, the judge held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">This matter should first proceed through the mechanism of the agreement and if no resolution can be agreed upon or arrived at it should be handled by the federal court which retained jurisdiction over the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">He further stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">I have already indicated that I find that the agreement is controlling, that it encompasses although it doesn\u2019t specify the problem of mail even though that specific issue may not have been a part of the original complaint, I find as I said before that it certainly falls within the purview of the deprivation of fundamental personal and civil rights alluded to by Judge Stern in describing the nature of the action involved before him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In conclusion, the judge found that while the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel were inapplicable, the <em>\u201cGoodwin </em>agreement encompasses this kind of problem [and] as such this constitutes a failure to exhaust the remedies available under the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">The issue here is whether the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement may or should be interpreted as providing the exclusive avenue of redress for the alleged denial of plaintiffs statutory, and possible constitutional, right to receive mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>At the outset, we resolve an issue that is a \u201cred herring\u201d, argued vigorously by both parties in their briefs but not applicable to the present <em>dispute </em>\u2014 i.e., the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:69-5. Defendants contend that the monitoring section of the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement is an administrative remedy that must be exhausted before this action in lieu of prerogative writ can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>R. </em>4:69-5 provides in part</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">[E]xeept where it is manifest that the interest of justice requires otherwise, actions under <em>R. </em>4:69 shall not be maintainable as long as there is available a right of review before an administrative agency which has not been exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Defendants utilize much of their brief urging that <em>R. </em>4:69-5 required plaintiff to seek redress of her grievances through the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement before she could bring suit in state court. Defendants\u2019 allegations in this area are erroneous. The Law Division judge found that the monitoring mechanism of the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement was \u201cnot an administrative agency under <em>R. </em>4:69-5____\u201d This finding is not contested on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">A contrary finding by the Law Division judge would have been error. While a private agreement might create an administrative agency within the intendment of <em>R. </em>4:69-5, <em>see Garrow v. Elizabeth General Hospital, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>549, 560 (1979), that agreement first must meet certain prerequisites of an administrative agency. Generally, an administrative agency has the power to effect the rights of private parties through either adjudication or rule making. <em>See </em>N.J. Administrative Procedures Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(a); 1 <em>Davis, Treatise on Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7 1.2 at 9 (2d Ed.1978); <em>Final Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Commission on Administrative Procedure, </em>Senate Document No. 8, 77 Cong., 1st Session, 7 (1941) (defines administrative agency as possessing the \u201cpower to determine, either by rule or decision, private rights and obligations.\u201d). The master, pursuant to the monitoring agreement in <em>Goodwin, </em>has neither of these powers. <em>See </em>Monitoring Agreement, \u00a7 XII reprinted at <em>Goodwin, </em>545 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 849-851.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>In addition to the master\u2019s powers to monitor compliance with the agreement and submit reports to the court and the parties regarding the level of compliance, <em>id. </em>at 849-850, the master also serves</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">as the mediator <em>of any disputes </em>which may arise among or between the parties with regard to levels of compliance with any aspect of this Agreement. (Emphasis added). [/&lt;\u00a3 at 850 (Section XII(ll)(d) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Mediation, by its common meaning, does not envision binding adjudication or rule making, but rather it describes \u201cthe act of a third-party who interferes between two contending parties with a view to reconcile them or persuade them to adjust or settle their dispute____\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 4th ed. at 885 (1979). <em>See N.J.A. C. </em>19:12-3.3 which describes the function of a mediator in the context of the Public Employment Relations Committee \u201cto assist all parties to come to a voluntary agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Moreover, the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement further limits the power of the court-appointed master in \u00a7 XII(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">4. Notwithstanding the powers enumerated for masters pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 or related case law, the Master herein shall possess exclusively the powers set out in this Agreement. <em>[Goodwin, </em>545 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 849-850],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, a special master is given various powers which include the authority to conduct hearings in accordance with the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">The court-appointed master in <em>Goodwin </em>is not an administrative agency in any traditional sense as he lacks the authority to either adjudicate or to make rules. Absent the existence of an administrative agency, there is no requirement of \u201cexhaustion of administrative remedies\u201d under <em>R. </em>4-69-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Further, the Law Division judge\u2019s reliance.on federal Judge Stern\u2019s comment, contained in the preface of the <em>Goodwin </em>settlement agreement, was misplaced. Judge Stern\u2019s statement that \u201cplaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>restraining defendants from maintaining conditions and pursuing policies which ... <em>deprived them of their fundamental personal and civil rights ...\u201d </em>is a recitation of plaintiffs allegations, not an actual comment on the scope of the settlement agreement. 545 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 826. The settlement agreement itself was the binding document and recited that \u201cno determination or agreement is intended or reached [in the settlement] regarding the validity or invalidity of the allegations of the complaint in this action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828, par. 1. Nevertheless, the judge found that the present dispute falls \u201cwithin the umbrella of the allegations in <em>Goodwin </em>dealing with a deprivation of fundamental personal and civil rights because that is what the plaintiff is essentially saying here....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We disagree and conclude that the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement in no event was intended to govern plaintiffs claim. The <em>Goodwin </em>agreement, by its terms, dealt specifically with numerous areas of concern about the general maintenance of the hospital and the pursuance of certain institutional policies within the Essex County Hospital Center. For an index to the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement, <em>see </em>545 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 827. The agreement provided \u201crights, standards and services\u201d which must be followed with regard to the patient population as a class. The court-appointed master, through the power bestowed upon him in the monitoring agreement, was an official through whom the patients, as a class, could monitor defendants\u2019 compliance and meet and discuss allegations of noncompliance, 545 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 849-850, and, in the event that the master could not resolve the dispute, refer the matter to the federal District Court, which had retained jurisdiction for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The agreement does not lend itself to an interpretation that it was intended as the exclusive mechanism for all initial redress where a dispute involved any tension between an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>patient\u2019s personal and privacy rights and the clinical decision of the patient\u2019s treatment team. Rather, it apparently was intended to provide a mechanism by which certain general policies would be implemented, 545 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 849, \u00a7 XII(l), <em>i.e., </em>improvements of the physical conditions and institutional policies which would result in the overall guarantee of the patients\u2019 federal and state constitutional and statutory rights to humane treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 828, par. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We also conclude that the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement was not intended to restrict a patient\u2019s existing means of redress but was designed to augment or supplement existing remedies. The purpose of the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement was stated at 545 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 828, par. 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">1. This agreement is entered into in light of the parties\u2019 concern that requirements of the federal and state constitutions and of federal and state statutes regarding patients\u2019 treatment and patients\u2019 rights are satisfied, and in order to provide to patients other guarantees which the parties regard as important as a matter of public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Thus the agreement specifically reinforced existing state and federal constitutional and statutory rights while at the same time providing <em>\u201cother </em>guarantees.\u201d This language, along with other expressions throughout the agreement, <em>see e.g., id. </em>at 828, par. 4; <em>id. </em>at 849, XI(q), demonstrated that the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement was meant to strengthen existing remedies, not to supersede established rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">For instance, the agreement states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUq\">4. The rights, standards and services set forth herein shall be implemented within the context of the public policy declared in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-23, <em>et </em>seq. . . . <em>[Id. </em>at 828, par. 4].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The public policy expressed in this statute, commonly called the patients\u2019 \u201cBill of Rights,\u201d insures that patients may enforce their rights, \u201cby civil action or other remedies otherwise available by common law or statute.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2(h). <em>See In re Hospitalization of Patterson and Bohuk, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 98 (App.Div.), certif. den., 77 <em>N.J. </em>469 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>With regard to the issue of receiving mail, the patients\u2019 \u201cBill of Rights\u201d provides specific guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">e. Each patient receiving treatment pursuant to this Title, shall have the following rights, a list of which shall be prominently posted in all facilities providing such services and otherwise brought to his attention by such additional means as the commissioner may designate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">(7) To have ready access to letter writing materials, including stamps, and to mail and receive unopened correspondence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">This right to receive mail may be modified only in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2(g)(l) which says</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">A patient\u2019s rights designated under subsection e. of this section may be denied for good cause in any instance in which the director of the program in which the patient is receiving treatment feels it is imperative to deny any of these rights; provided, however, under no circumstances shall a patient\u2019s right to communicate with his attorney, physician or the courts be restricted. Any such denial of a patient\u2019s rights shall take effect only after a written notice of the denial has been filed in the patient\u2019s treatment record and shall include an explanation of the reason for denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">As noted, the \u201cBill of Rights\u201d confers jurisdiction upon our courts to enforce these rights. A patient is \u201centitled to enforce any of the rights herein stated by civil action.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">We cannot hold that the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement, even if in any sense applicable to this plaintiff and her predicament, explicitly or implicitly took away her right to bring an action to challenge the decision of the hospital\u2019s medical staff, no matter how well meaning, to deprive her of the right to receive certain mail. We hold that the <em>Goodwin </em>agreement was designed to augment and implement patients\u2019 rights. It was not designed to extinguish or to diminish all preexisting State statutory or constitutional rights to sue in our courts to correct individual grievances unrelated to that class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.2(h) says</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Any individual subject to this Title shall be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus upon proper petition by himself, by a relative, or a friend to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which he is detained and shall further be entitled to enforce any of the rights herein stated by civil action or other remedies otherwise available by common law or statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
