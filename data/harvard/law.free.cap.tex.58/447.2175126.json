Tried below before the Hon. Win. H. Burk-hart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-18\">An execution issued out of the district court of Waller county, April 27, 1880, in favor of plaintiffs in error and against E. P. Alsbury, which was on the 28th day of April, 1880, levied upon personal property found in the possession of E. P. Alsbury, a part of which was claimed by Thomas Aringdale through his agent, E. P. Alsbury, who filed his claim bond and affidavit, dated April 30, 1880, for the trial of the right of property. October 9th, claimant filed his motion to quash the execution for the following reasons: First, because at the time of the issuance of the execution more than one year had elapsed since the recovery of the judgment upon which the execution issued, and that no execution had issued thereon prior to the one now sought to be quashed; that the judgment, therefore, was, at the time of the issuance of execution, dormant, and there was no authority for the issuance of said execution. Second, because the execution was not authenticated by the seal of the court, as required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-19\">The motion was, on the 18th day of April, 1881, sustained for the reasons therein stated, and the cause dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-20\">The judgment recited that \u201c on this day came on this cause for trial, and came on defendant\u2019s motion to quash execution for reasons therein set forth; thereupon plaintiffs offered to prove by record evidence that the judgment has been revived, which ivas permitted by the court, to which defendant excepts; and upon hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, and having duly considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and understood the said motion,\u201d etc. The judgment proceeded then to adjudge the law upon the motion in favor of the 'defendant and to dismiss the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">The plaintiffs prosecuted their writ of error to the supreme court, and assigned as error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\">1st.

The burden of proof was on Thomas Aringdale to establish-his right to the property by evidence, and until he did so he was a stranger to the execution and judgment, and had no right to inquire \u2022 into the validity thereof. The property was personal property, and in the possession of defendant in execution at the time of the levy. Latham <em>v. </em>Selkirk, 11 Tex., 314; 14 Tex., 322 Sydnor <em>v. </em>Roberts, 13 Tex., 510; Herman on Executions, sec. 403, p. 619.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>T. J. </em>Reese, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-5\">I. The motion to quash the execution was in the nature of a special exception to pleadings, and was tiled at the earliest time it could have been, viz., at the first term of the court after the levy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-6\">II. The execution was void. The execution appeared on its face to be a first execution, issued on the 27th day of April, 1880, upon a judgment recovered on the 13th day of July, 1878. Defendant in error promptly made this objection, by motion to quash the execution on this ground, at the first term of the court. Rev. Civ. Stats;, art. 2281; Bennett <em>v. </em>Gamble, 1 Tex., 124; Scott &amp; Rose <em>v. </em>Allen, id., 508; Fessenden <em>v. </em>Barrett, 9 Tex., 477; Latham <em>v. </em>Selkirk, 11 Tex., 314.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-7\">III. The claimant had the right to object that the execution was issued upon a judgment dormant at the time, upon the authority of Latham <em>v. </em>Selkirk, 11 Tex., 314. The objection urged by the claimant ill that case was precisely the same as that urged in this case, and the court, in effect, decided that the objection would have been good, had it been made, as in this case, upon the trial of the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-8\">Walker, P. J. Com. App.</author>\n<p id=\"Ash\">The motion to quash the execution came too late, even though it had been made by the defendant in execution. The execution had been returned, and the motion was filed after the return day of the execution. The execution was, in fact, returned and actually filed in court before the motion was entered. Scott <em>&amp; </em>Rose <em>v. </em>Allen, 1 Tex., 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The claimant was not entitled to assert .the invalidity of the execution (it being against another person) unless it was void. Portis <em>v. </em>Parker, 22 Tex., 707; Hancock <em>v. </em>Hetz, 15 Tex., 205; Webb <em>\u2019v. </em>Mallard, 27 Tex., 80. Hpon its face it is not void for either of the reasons assigned in the motion. As copied in the record, it purported to have been issued under the seal of the court duly affixed; and so far as concerns the first ground of the motion, it has been repeatedly decided by the supreme court that an execution is not void because issued on a dormant judgment; that it is voidable merely. Boggess <em>v. </em>Howard, 40 Tex., 158, and several cases cited from our reports. See also Riddle <em>v. </em>Turner, 52 Tex., 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Defects only that are apparent on the face of the execution and records on which the questions presented under the motion arise can be reached by the motion to quash. Hill <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 25 Tex., 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">There is neither statement of facts nor bill of exceptions in the record to show anything more than the pleadings of the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Every presumption, therefore, will be indulged in favor of the judgment; and it will be intended that whatever evidence could have been adduced properly under the issue, was presented in support of the judgment, and that it was sufficient to maintain its correctness.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"ADF\">[Opinion approved January 29, 1883.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">It is clear that no evidence c,ould have been adduced on an issue like this \u2014 an issue which was required by its very nature to be determined upon the face of the record as a question of law \u2014 which could warrant a judgment of dismissal of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Our conclusion is that the court erred in sustaining the motion to quash the execution, or in holding, if it were obnoxious to the first ground urged in the motion against its validity, that such defect could be rendered available by the defendant in this action to dismiss the proceedings under the levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The proper mode of raising questions like those presented in the motion to quash is to do so by direct pleading, as by exceptions filed in the nature of a demurrer to the sufficiency of the execution, in case the supposed defect renders it void, or by tendering an issue of fact under the direction of the court as to the validity of the execution as against third persons. The record in this case suggests the idea that the parties and the court treated the motion as presenting an issue of fact, which was determined upon its merits upon a hearing by the judge, with evidence adduced upon the issues made by the motion. A motion to quash an execution for specified reasons of invalidity is not such a pleading or paper as furnishes a basis for such course of proceeding, and hence no intendment can be indulged to support the judgment upon facts proven, notwithstanding there is no statement of facts nor bill of exceptions. Under the motion the questions were triable only upon the face of the record, and it is apparent from it that the execution was issued under the seal of the court; and as a matter of law, so far as the objection is made on account of the dormancy of the judgment, we have seen that the defendant cannot invoke it in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The judgment ought to be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"A43\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
