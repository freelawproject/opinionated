Bastrop. Tried below before the Hon. J. P. Bichardson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-11\">Fitch and wife brought this suit against Boss July 14, 1874, to recover damages for slanderous words uttered and published by him of and concerning Mrs. Fitch. The words so charged to have been uttered and published imputed to Mrs. Fitch a want of chastity. The special damages alleged as resulting therefrom were, that Fitch and wife were poor, and dependent for a living upon their daily labor, and that by reason of the slander they had been refused employment, and polite and civil treatment; that they were keeping a boarding-house, and many of their boarders left them on account of \"the slander; that Mrs. Fitch was about taking up a school, and persons refused to send to her school on account of the slander, and that she was thereby forced to abandon the idea of teaching the school; that by reason of the slander her health was impaired, and that she was not fully able to perform her accustomed household labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-12\">Boss answered by special exceptions, general denial, and that, if the words were spoken by him, they were true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-13\">The case was tried \u00a1November 27, 1874, and resulted in a verdict and judgment against Boss for $1,000, -from which he appealed and assigned errors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-14\">The court charged the jury, \u201cWords spoken of another imputing the commission of an offense against law constitute slander, and a person so spoken of may maintain an action for such slander without any proof of actual injury; but if the words spoken do not impute the commission of an offense, they may constitute a slander, if the person of whom they are spoken is injured by the words. To charge a woman with a want of chastity is not to charge her with an offense against the law; and, therefore, to render such charge slander, it is necessary to prove not only that the words im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>puting such a charge were spoken of the plaintiff by the defendant, but that the plaintiff was actually injured by the charge thus made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">\u201c If you find, from the evidence, that the defendant spoke the words set forth in the petition of the plaintiff, Mrs. Bitch; meaning and intending to charge her with a want of chastity, and that in consequence of such words the plaintiffs have been injured in health, property, or reputation, then you should find a verdict for plaintiffs for such amount as you think a sufficient compensation for such injury; and in estimating damages you are not confined to the amount of damages actually proved, but you will take into consideration the degree of malice prompting the defendant to utter the words, the probable consequences to the plaintiffs, and all the circumstances of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">\u201c The burden of proof is upon the plaintiffs to establish the slander and the resulting damage by a preponderance of evidence. If they fail to prove that the words were spoken by the defendant as charged in the petition, and that plaintiffs were injured thereby, then you should return a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-8\"><em>Moore &amp; Organ, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4q\">We insist that the allegations of defendants in error, in their petition, were too general and indefinite. They should have given the names of those persons, or at least some of them, who had refused them employment; who of their neighbors had refused them civil or polite treatment; who of their boarders had left their boarding-house, or who had refused to send their children to school.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">Under the common law system of pleading, in this form of action, such particularity has been uniformly required, when, from the nature of the case, it was capable of such particularity. See Starkie on Slander, vol. 1, marg. p. 441; id., vol. 2, marg. p. 63; Ohitty\u2019s Pleading, vol. 1, p. 397; Hilliard on Torts, vol. 1, pp. 242, 243. The reason of this rule is obvious, and applies as well to our system of pleading as to that of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-10\">It was intended to prevent the defendant from being taken by surprise, and to give him an opportunity of meeting the charge, if it be false, with his evidence. The court, in disregarding this rule of pleading, as a natural consequence also ignored another rule of evidence, that is, the rule requiring the production of the parties as witnesses in connection with whom the injury is said to have resulted, because they are the only persons who could possibly know by what reasons they were influenced in their actions. If plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>are to be allowed to violate this salutary rule of pleading, the great injustice and hardship it will work to defendants is very apparent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-6\"><em>Jones &amp; Sayers, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-7\">Watts, J. Com. App.</author>\n<p id=\"AQd\">No indictable offense was imputed to Mrs. Fitch by the slanderous words charged to have been uttered and published by appellant of and concerning her. One of the essential elements of the offense of adultery, as defined by our criminal code, is that the parties must live together in a state of cohabitation. It cannot be deduced from the language imputed to appellant that he thereby charged that Mrs. Fitch and Marion Gilbert were or had been living together in a state of cohabitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">It is the recognized doctrine in this state, that ivords imputing a want of chastity to a female are not actionable <em>per se, </em>and special damages must be alleged as resulting therefrom. Any special damage, however slight, will suffice to sustain the action. McQueen <em>v. </em>Fulgham, 27 Tex., 463; Linney <em>v. </em>Mat\u00f3n, 13 Tex., 449. We do not think that the court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s exceptions to the original and amended petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">It was not necessary to give the names of the persons who had refused to employ appellees on account of the slander, or the names of those who had refused them polite and civil treatment, or the names of the boarders who left their boarding-house, or the names of those who refused to send their children to Mrs. Fitch\u2019s school.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">As was said in H. &amp; T. C. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Shafer, 54 Tex., 646, \u201c Conceding the rule of pleading applicable to the matter here involved to require with us, as it does at common law, that the facts which constitute the special damage shall be stated specifically and circumstantially, as held in Sutton <em>v. </em>Page and Wife, 4 Tex., 142, we are of opinion that the amended petition sufficiently conforms to it. The facts were not indefinitely stated, nor does there exist any uncertainty as to the cause of special damage complained of, nor the effect which it produced upon the plaintiff. It is neither necessary nor proper to set forth the evidence on which the pleader relies to sustain the facts which constitute his cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The charge asked by appellant and refused by the court was, in substance and effect, given in the charge of the court, and it was not necessary or proper that the same proposition should have been repeated in a separate charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Considering the charge of the court in its application to the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>made by the pleading and evidence, it is a correct exposition of the principles of law to guide the jury in their determination.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"ADBZ\">[Opinion approved December 5, 1882.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The use of the word \u201c injury,\u201d in place of \u201c damage,\u201d as found in the charge, could not have misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">While the evidence, as shown by the record, is meager, considering the whole case, we are not able to say that the verdict is not sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">We conclude, and so report, that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Aeeibmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
