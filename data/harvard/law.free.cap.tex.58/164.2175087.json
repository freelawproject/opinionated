Assignment.\u2014 A valid assignment for the benefit of creditors, under the act of March \"24, 1879, must convey all of the property, real and personal, of the debtor, except such as may be exempt from forced sale. If the assignment be by copartners, it must convey the firm property as well as the individual property of the members composing the firm.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b176-20\">2. Assignment.\u2014 \u00d1o title passes as against objecting creditors by a deed of assignment executed by copartners, which only purports to convey to the assignee the partnership property, and with the condition expressed that only such creditors shall receive benefit from the assignment as will join in a release of the debtors. A deed of assignment containing such a condition is only valid when it conveys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>all the property of the firm as well as that of the individuals composing it, except that which may be exempt under the constitution and laws from forced sale. If all the property, both of the firm and its individual members, be not conveyed, the deed presents no obstacle to an objecting creditor seeking to collect his debt by the usual process.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b177-6\">Appeal from Bed Biver. Tried below before the Hon. B. B. Graines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">On the 12th day of January, 1881, Hynes &amp; Sherry, hardware merchants at Clarksville, executed a deed of assignment to J. B. Donoho, assignee, for the benefit of their creditors. The deed was executed by M. J. Hynes, as the managing member of the firm, for Hynes &amp; Sherry, and contained a provision that it was for the benefit of such creditors only as would accept the assignment and discharge the debtors. There were a large number of creditors, and the estimated assets and liabilities were about equal. On the same day J. B. Donoho made bond as assignee, and took charge of the estate and proceeded to execute the trust. On the 25th of January, 1881, the appellees, as creditors, levied a writ of attachment on the assigned goods in the hands of the assignee of the assessed value of \u00a75,154.62. On the 26th day of January, 1881, the assignee filed his affidavit and claim bond under the statute for trial of the right of property, and the attached goods were returned to him. In May, 1882, the parties, under the directions of the court, made up and joined issue under the statute. On the 24th day of May, 1882, the cause was tried and a judgment rendered in favor of appellees for the assessed value of the goods, and from that judgment this appeal was taken. On the trial the court sustained objections made to the deed of assignment, which were made on the ground that the deed was fraudulent and void on its face, and this was assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-8\"><em>Taylor &lt;&amp; Chambers </em>and <em>Sims </em>c6 McDonald, for appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-9\">I.

The deed of assignment upon its face purports to be made under the act of March 2\u00e9, 1879, and contains a provision that only such creditors shall participate in the proceeds as release the debtors from all liability to them, and this clause is broad enough to require a release not only from partnership debts, but from such as the members may owe as individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The statute permits a debtor to make an assignment only when all of his property, by force of the deed or of the law, is passed by it, except such as is exempt, and when such a deed is made it may, by the express terms of the statute, contain a provision that only such creditors as discharge the debtor from their claims shall participate in the proceeds of the assignment. The third section of the act provides that <em>\u201c </em>any debtor, desiring so to do, may make an assignment for the benefit of such of his creditors only as will consent to accept their proportional share of his estate, and discharge him from their respective claims, and in such case the benefits of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>signment shall be limited and restricted to the creditors consenting thereto; the debtor shall thereupon be and stand discharged from all further liability to such consenting creditors on account of their respective claims, and when paid, they shall execute and deliver to the assignee for the debtor a release therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">These provisions of the statute are in harmony with the principles \u2022 laid down by the courts of the several states in which it has been held, in the absence of a statute, that such restrictions upon the rights of the creditors generally might be imposed by the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">These decisions have held, however, that deeds of assignment imposing such restrictions are void if' the assignment did not pass all of the debtor\u2019s property; and in case of a partnership assignment, it has been held' that a deed which did not pass the individual property of the members of the firm, as well as the partnership property, was void. Such was the case of <em>In re </em>Wilson, 4 Pa. St., 448, in which Rogers, J., said: \u201c The point on which the case principally turns, namely, the invalidity of the assignment, has been already decided in Thomas <em>v. </em>Jenks, 5 Rawle, 221, and Hennessy <em>v. </em>The Western Bank, 6 Watts <em>&amp; </em>Serg., 300; the latter was a decision on the assignment now in controversy. In those cases it is ruled that an assignment by an insolvent debtor, stipulating for a release, is invalid, unless it contains a transfer of all the debtor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u201c It has been regretted by some distinguished jurists, the late Mr. Justice Baldwin among the number, in Eustace <em>v. </em>Phillips, that the very fact of requiring a release fr\u00f3m the creditors of an insolvent debtor did not invalidate the assignment. This point, however, he considered settled in Brashear <em>v. </em>West, 7 Peters, 615; but he says the law is thus settled only when the assignment is of the whole of the debtor\u2019s property and effects, and that it is otherwise if any portion is fraudulently kept back from the \u2022 assignment. In the latter case the assignment is void by the execution of a release from the creditors, according to the opinion of the supreme court of this state, in 5 Rawle, 221, as well as the soundest principles of law. In Thomas <em>v, </em>Jenks, and Hennessy <em>v. </em>The Western Bank, we ruled that such an assignment was against the policy of the law; that the condition was oppressive, without the color of justice, and evinced on the face of the instrument a fraudulent design; that it was taking an unfair advantage of the situation of the creditors to impose the condition of a release, unless on the terms of the surrender of all the debtor\u2019s property.\u201d To the same effect are the following cases: Searing <em>v. </em>Brinkerhoff, 5 Johns. Ch., 333; Sangston <em>v. </em>Gai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ther, 3 Md., 48; Wiler <em>v. </em>Samuel, 7 Barr, 500; Henderson <em>v. </em>Bliss, 8 Ind., 101.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AjY\">[Opinion delivered December 5, 1882.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">An assignment by partners of the common property only is but a partial assignment, and the great current of authority holds that all such assignments, which contain a requirement that the creditors shall release the debtor, are void. Burrill on Assignments, section 197, where the authorities upon this subject are largely collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Parties who claim under assignments made under the act of March 24, 1879, cannot claim for it a more favorable construction for a partial assignment than is given to partial assignments in the states in which assignments, with restrictions requiring consenting creditors to release the debtor, are held to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">He who wants the benefit of the act by which he seeks to be released from his just debt, without full payment, must comply with the act by conveying to the assignee all of the property required to be conveyed, whether the same be owned by him individually or as a member of a firm, and if he does not do so by the terms of his deed aided by the law, his assignment is void and interposes no obstacle to creditors in collecting their debts by usual process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Before an assignment, any creditor may enforce the payment of his debt, through the courts, against all of the property of a debtor, whether partnership or individual property, except such as is exempt from forced sale, and this right cannot be restricted under the act of March 24,1879, unless that property which was subject before the assignment, be subjected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">If it be deemed necessary that copartners should be permitted to make an assignment of copartnership property only, for the benefit of copartnership creditors, and that upon such assignment they shall have the right to provide for release from such creditors, the legislature will no doubt so provide; but until it does so provide, assignments made by copartners must convey all their property, whether partnership or individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">There was no error in excluding the deed of assignment in this case from the jury, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
