On the trial plaintiff failed to prove a complete chain of title, but did establish title under W. B. Middleton, who conveyed the land September 2, 1867. For the purpose of showing that the defendant claimed title from -W. B. Middleton as a common source, plaintiff introduced a deed from S. 0. Anderson, constable of precinct Ho. 1, Havarro county, to J. B. Loughridge, dated March 2, s 1869, recorded' July 26, 1869, conveying all the interest of W. B.

The evidence of defendant was that he claimed the land under the deed from Loughridge, had for some five or six years paid taxes on it, used fire wood from it, and kept people from trespassing on it; had built hog pens on it, and used it as a ranche for his cattle and horses, but had made no inclosure except the hog pens, nor had he ever lived on the land nor occupied it by a tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-18\">The case was submitted to the court, and a judgment rendered for plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-19\"><em>Read &amp; </em>Beal, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-20\">. . .
