Yanow, against Teal Industries, Inc. (Teal), a Connecticut corporation, and Martin B. Gentry, Jr., who, at relevant times, was an officer and director of Teal, seeking an accounting, damages and nullification of a merger between Teal and Mallard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Manufacturing Company (Mallard), of which Yanow was a 10 percent shareholder. The complaint, discussed more fully infra, alleged in four counts that Teal and Gentry had committed a series of corporate wrongs resulting in damage to Yanow individually and to Mallard.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The defendants, in addition to denying the substantive allegations of the complaint, pleaded nine special defenses directed to the capacity and standing of the plaintiff to initiate and maintain the action. Insofar as they are pertinent to this appeal, those defenses alleged that (1) Yanow\u2019s exclusive remedy upon the merger of Teal and Mallard as a dissatisfied former stockholder of Mallard was to be paid the value of his shares, following an appraisal of their value as provided in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 33-373 and 33-374, which exclusive remedy Yanow was alleged to have waived; (2) Yanow\u2019s complaint failed to state any nonderivative causes of action on which relief could be granted and the wrongs he alleged the defendants had committed could properly be remedied only in a derivative suit; and (3) Yanow had no standing to bring suit on the derivative causes of action alleged because derivative actions may be brought only by shareholders of the corporation that is injured, and Yanow was not, at the time the action was brought, a shareholder of Mallard, as Mallard no longer existed. These three special defenses were denied by Yanow, and the defendants then moved for summary judgment on each of the special defenses, addressed to the four counts of the complaint, on the grounds that the affidavits and other documentary proof submitted by them demonstrated that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the plaintiff\u2019s lack of standing and capacity to bring the action and as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the exclusivity of the plaintiff\u2019s appraisal remedy, and that the defendants were, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment based on the special defenses, and the plaintiff has appealed to this court from the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The allegations of the complaint, as made more specific, which are, for the purposes of a summary judgment, assumed to be true; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Southern Connecticut Gas Co., </em>172 Conn. 362, 379, 374 A.2d 1051 (1977); together with the affidavits and exhibits filed in connection with the summary judgment motions, and the defendants\u2019 answer, reveal the following: For some time prior to October 31, 1971, the effective date of the Teal-Mallard merger, the plaintiff was the owner of 350 shares of stock of Mallard, representing almost 10 percent ownership of Mallard. During this period, Gentry was an officer of Teal and Mallard, and Teal owned and controlled the operations and activities of Mallard. Through Teal, Gentry dominated and controlled the business operations of Mallard. Gentry and Teal caused unfair transactions among Mallard, Teal, Gentry and others controlled by Gentry, depressing the value of the plaintiff\u2019s shares of Mallard so that the defendants could purchase the stock for less than its fair market value, depriving the plaintiff of the value of his Mallard stock, and depriving Mallard of valuable assets, income and corporate opportunities. More specifically, in count one of the complaint, it was alleged that, through their control and domination of Mallard, the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties and obligations to the plaintiff, individually, by causing nineteen unfair trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>actions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> between themselves and others controlled by Gentry to their benefit only and without disclosure to the plaintiff of the details of the transactions. It was further alleged that Teal benefited by paying little or no salary to its officers and employees which were, in effect, Mallard\u2019s and that its profits were made essentially on goods manufactured by Mallard which could have been sold by Mallard. In count two, a breach of duty to Mallard arising out of most of the above transactions was alleged. The plaintiff again claimed that the merger was effectuated without corporate purpose and with the sole intention of freezing him out. Count three alleged that the defendants caused the merger without a business purpose, without full disclosure to the plaintiff, and with the intent to deprive the plaintiff of his shareholding in Mallard in order to benefit the defendants. In count four, the plaintiff alleged that Gentry, in his capacity as director and officer of Mallard, knew of special facts concerning Mallard\u2019s financial condition and affecting the value of the plaintiff\u2019s stock, which were not disclosed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the plaintiff, and that Gentry caused the merger to deprive the plaintiff of his shares and to avoid paying the plaintiff the fair market value of his shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">During the period from 1966 to 1971, Gentry offered to the plaintiff increasing amounts for the purchase of his shares, which offers were not accepted by the plaintiff. The shares were valued, for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1971, at $9221.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">On October 31, 1971, Mallard completed a \u201cshort form\u201d merger into Teal under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 33-364 et seq. of the General Statutes. In accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 33-370, 33-373 and 33-374, Gentry timely notified the plaintiff of the merger, sent him a copy of the merger agreement, notified him of the statutory procedures for dissenting shareholders, and informed him that the fair market value of his stock would be determined within sixty days of the effective date of the merger. The plaintiff dissented from the merger, demanding an appraisal of the fair market value of his shares, but did not complete the appraisal remedy prescribed by statute, and never retired and exchanged his Mallard shares for cash. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 33-373, 33-374.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In sustaining the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the court found that (1) as to the merger, the remedy of the plaintiff was terminated by his failure to follow the exclusive share appraisal remedy set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 33-373 (c); (2) as to counts one, three and four, the complaint stated only derivative causes of action that could be pursued only by a nominal plaintiff who was a shareholder of Mallard, and, as the plaintiff was not a shareholder of Mallard at the time the action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>commenced, he lacked standing and capacity to sue; and (3) as to count two, the claim was only derivative, and could not be sued upon by one not a shareholder at the time of the institution of the action, invoking the same \u201ccontinuous ownership\u201d requirement relied upon to sustain the summary judgment as to the other counts of the complaint. The plaintiff has assigned error in the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 three motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u201cThe party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to judgment as a matter of law. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>161 Conn. 248, 250, 287 A.2d 382 (1971); see <em>Town Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>176 Conn. 304, 306, 407 A.2d 971 (1978). If appropriate, a judgment shall be rendered if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is thus entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 384; see <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 260 A.2d 596 (1969). A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d is simply a fact which will make a difference in the result of the case; id., 379; and a summary disposition should be rendered in the limited instances where the evidence is such that no room for disbelief could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>exist in the minds of the jury and in circumstances which would require a directed verdict for the moving party. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Good Earth Restaurant Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 194, 198, 319 A.2d 403 (1972). As, generally speaking, summary judgment is an attempt to dispose of eases in a manner which is speedier and less expensive for all concerned than a full-dress trial; <em>Town Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>supra; the function of the trial court is only to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact, but not to decide that issue if it does exist until the parties are afforded a full hearing. Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 384; <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>168 Conn; 431, 433, 362 A.2d 857 (1975). Issue finding, rather than issue determination, is the key to the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">With these considerations in mind, we turn to the present controversy. The court rendered no finding and, although we may consult its memorandum of decision to ascertain the legal conclusions upon which the court based its judgment; <em>Treat </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 136, 140, 139 A.2d 601 (1958); we are confined to an examination of the pleadings and affidavits to determine whether they show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 384; <em>Pine Point Corporation </em>v. <em>Westport Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>164 Conn. 54, 55, 316 A.2d 765 (1972); <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>161 Conn. 248, 250, 287 A.2d 382 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We first address the issue whether the court was correct in holding that the appraisal right given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>plaintiff by \u00a7\u00a7 33-373<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 33-374<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the General Statutes, of which the plaintiff concededly did not avail himself, was his exclusive remedy to attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the Teal-Mallard merger. Under \u00a7 33-370 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the General Statutes, a domestic corporation which, like Teal, owns 90 percent of the outstanding shares of a subsidiary domestic corporation may, unless its certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, merge with its subsidiary, without a vote of approval, and indeed over the disapproval, of the shareholders of the subsidiary corporation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>form of merger is a statutory \u201cshort-form\u201d merger; cf. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 33-364-33-367; and, if effectuated in adherence to statutory procedure, considerations of whether such a transaction is good or bad, enlightened or ill-advised, selfish or generous, are beside the point.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 33-370 authorizes a parent-subsidiary merger and any kind of judicial consideration of this variety of fundamental change in the corporate entity must proceed from that premise. \u201cThis side of state policy is based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>recognition that a substantial majority of the corporation\u2019s share voting power has endorsed the transaction. In fairness to the majority, and to the business itself, the transaction should be allowed to proceed, unimpeded by the collateral condemnation of the interests of a minority of dissenting shareholders.\u201d Cross, Corporation Law in Connecticut \u00a7 8.6, p. 436 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff presses no procedural claim that the defendants did not correctly adhere to all of the requirements imposed by the merger and related statutes. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 33-370-33-374. The plaintiff does argue, however, that the court erred in sustaining the first of the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions, asserting that his remedy for a claimed breach of fiduciary duty is not barred by the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 33-373 and 33-374. The plaintiff\u2019s view is that the statutory provision allowing a dissenting shareholder to compel an appraisal of the value of his minority stock interest is not an exclusive remedy as to the merger itself. Although the plaintiff is supported in this view by some authority of consequence, we do not share it.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">This state\u2019s policy with respect to fundamental changes in a stock corporation is reflected in the extent to which shareholders may inject their views into such transactions. Our corporation legislation allows the interested parties considerable freedom to operate in the corporate form without statutory restraint. As we have initially indicated; see footnote 5, supra; the nineteenth-century view that \u201cthe corporation\u201d meant \u201cthe shareholders\u201d led to the unworkable result that changes of a fundamental nature could not be brought about unless <em>all </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>shareholders agreed. Twentieth-century statutes have given relief from this state of affairs by allowing a substantial majority of the corporation to direct and control the operations and activities of the business. This \u201cimplied contract\u201d idea of corporate management; see <em>Klopot </em>v. <em>Northrup, </em>131 Conn. 14, 24, 37 A.2d 700 (1944); has led to a recognition that there is a point of organic change at which a minority shareholder should be able to say: \u201cI want out.\u201d The dissenter\u2019s rights provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 33-373 and 33-374 serve this purpose by giving an objecting shareholder the statutory right to have his share appraised and to be paid for the shares in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Our statutes have long provided an appraisal remedy for dissenting shareholders of a corporation that has gone through a merger, consolidation, or the sale of all of its assets.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although we have decided no interpretative or explanatory case on the precise subject, and the matter thus arises as one of first impression, we by no means write on a blank slate concerning the issue of the exclusiveness of the appraisal rights remedy. Section 33-374 (f) explicitly makes appraisal the exclusive remedy of the objecting shareholder. See Cross, Corporation Law in Connecticut \u00a78.6 (1972). Professor Bayless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Manning, the principal author of Connecticut\u2019s current statute, describes the statutory appraisal as \u201cunusually explicit in making the remedy exclusive\u201d; Manning, \u201cThe Shareholder\u2019s Appraisal Remedy,\u201d 72 Yale L.J. 223, 246n (1962); and other commentators have concurred in Manning\u2019s view. See Model Bus. Corp. Act annot. 2d \u00a7 81 \u00b6 3 (stating that Connecticut\u2019s appraisal remedy is almost identical to the exclusive appraisal remedy in the model act); Gordon, \u201cThe Connecticut Stock Corporation Law,\u201d 16 Conn. Gen. Stat. annot. 29, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Despite this background, the plaintiff mounts a two-pronged argument in support of his claim that the right of share appraisal is not his exclusive remedy as to the merger, relying on a purported \u201csavings clause\u201d in the statute; General Statutes \u00a7 33-369 (e); and upon cases from other jurisdictions holding that a particular appraisal statute is not a dissenting shareholder\u2019s exclusive remedy upon a parent-subsidiary merger. The short answer to this claim is that neither the statutory savings provision, nor cases from other jurisdictions speak to or alter the specific exclusivity of the appraisal remedy envisioned by the Connecticut statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 33-369 (e) provides for the transfer liability of the merged corporation in a merger, making the surviving corporation responsible for \u201call the liabilities . . . including liabilities] to dissenting shareholders, of each of the merging . . . corporations; and any claim existing or action or proceeding, civil or criminal, pending by or against such corporation.\u201d Although this statute is relevant to the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claims of breach of fiduciary duty antecedent to the merger; see discussion part II; it is not the case, as the plaintiff argues, that the merger itself, and claims relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ing thereto, should be regarded as an \u201cexisting claim\u201d permitted to survive the merger under the savings provision of \u00a7 33-369 (e). Claims with respect to the merger itself are preempted by the specific, exclusive tight of share appraisal extended to a dissenting shareholder in \u00a7\u00a7 33-373 and 33-374. Our statute, in unequivocal terms, contemplates a \u201ccash payout\u201d by which the interests of minority stockholders may be extinguished and their continued participation in the corporate entity terminated. <em>Beloff </em>v. <em>Consolidated Edison Co., </em>300 N.Y. 11, 19, 87 N.E.2d 561 (1949); <em>Willcox </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>18 N.Y.2d 195, 201, 219 N.E.2d 401 (1966) (under comparable New York statute which, prior to amendment, made appraisal exclusive dissenting shareholder\u2019s remedy, held: the merged corporation\u2019s shareholder has only one right \u2014 to have the value of his holding protected, and that protection is given him by his right of appraisal); cf. N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7 623 (McKinney) (specifically amending statute to include shareholder rights in addition to appraisal); <em>Stauffer </em>v. <em>Standard Brands, Inc., </em>41 Del. Ch. 7,187 A.2d 78 (1962) (Delaware short-form merger statute allows majority stockholder to eliminate the minority interest without any corporate purpose and subject only to an appraisal remedy); see <em>Voeller </em>v. <em>Neilston Warehouse Co., </em>311 U.S. 531, 535, 61 S. Ct. 376, 85 L. Ed. 322 (1941); <em>Lessler </em>v. <em>Dominion Textile Ltd., </em>411 F. Sup. 40 (S.D. N.Y. 1975) (existence of appraisal remedy eliminates risk of injury to shareholders and mitigates any hardship to them); annot., 79 A.L.R. 624, 645-50 (collecting cases holding appraisal remedy to be exclusive). Thus, the flat restriction to appraisal rights for a dissenting shareholder in relation to a short-form merger; General Statutes \u00a7 33-373; dictates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>savings provision of \u00a7 33-369 (e) does not include claims as to the merger itself. We cannot search out some intent in a statute which is clear and unambiguous, which we may believe the legislature actually had, and give effect to it; we are confined to effectuating the intention which is expressed in the words used by the legislature. <em>Madison Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>174 Conn. 189, 192, 384 A.2d 361 (1978); <em>Kulis </em>v. <em>Moll, </em>172 Conn. 104, 110, 374 A.2d 133 (1976); <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>Fusari, </em>163 Conn. 401, 410-11, 311 A.2d 65 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Reference to the statutes and interpretative cases of other jurisdictions, moreover, must proceed, if at all, with caution, circumspection and restraint. Appraisal remedy statutes differ greatly among jurisdictions, and the extent to which the availability of a right of appraisal precludes a dissenting shareholder from pursuing, as to the merger, other relief, depends upon the precise wording of the appraisal remedy statute. For example, California provides that, other than appraisal rights, a dissenting shareholder has no statutory vehicle for assailing a short-form merger. See Cal. Corp. Code annot. \u00a7\u00a7 4300-4312 (Deering). In Georgia and Kentucky, a shareholder must elect between claiming payment and bringing suit for fraud or illegality in the corporate action; see Ga. Code annot. \u00a722-1202; Ky. Rev. Stat. annot. \u00a7\u00a7271.415 (4), 271.490; see <em>E.I.F.C., Inc. </em>v. <em>Atnip, </em>454 S.W.2d 351 (Ky. 1970); while Massachusetts, Texas and Wisconsin make appraisal the exclusive remedy unless there are charges of fraud or illegality. See Mass. Gen. Laws annot. c. 156B, \u00a7\u00a7 76, 86-98 (West); 3A Tex. Civ. Stat. art. 5.12 (Vernon); Wis. Stat. annot. \u00a7 180.69 (West); see <em>Hochberg </em>v. <em>Schick Investment Co., </em>469 S.W.2d 474 (Tex. Civ. App. 1971). New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>York\u2019s statute, after stating that the remedy of appraisal is exclusive, tempers that language by providing for a shareholder action if the corporate action taken is \u201cillegal or fraudulent as to him.\u201d N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7623 (k) (McKinney). Indiana provides that its statutory appraisal remedy is not intended to cut off any rights that a shareholder might otherwise have to attack an illegal merger. Ind. Code annot. \u00a7\u00a723-1-5-7, 23-1-6-5 (Burns). In North Carolina, the appraisal right is given, with the addition of \u201cany other right, in the law or equity.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a755-113 (b). See, generally, Model Bus. Corp. Act annot. 2d \u00a7 81; 19 Am. Jur. 2d, Corporations, \u00a7\u00a7 1541-45; Lattin, \u201cMinority and Dissenting Shareholders\u2019 Bights in Fundamental Changes,\u201d 23 Law and Contemp. Prob. 307 (1958). Our legislature, in passing the current short-form merger statute; 1969 Public Acts, No. 729, \u00a7 19; and in modifying the appraisal right statute; 1969 Public Acts, No. 729, \u00a720; obviously had the benefit of the statutes previously enacted by other jurisdictions, yet chose to make appraisal rights upon the elimination of the minority shareholder interest the shareholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The court decisions of other jurisdictions have reached differing results. Some have interpreted the exclusivity of the appraisal remedy narrowly; see <em>Lessler </em>v. <em>Dominion Textile Ltd., </em>411 F. Sup. 40 (S.D. N.Y. 1975); and others have held that appraisal was the exclusive remedy, even though the statutes did not so provide. <em>Geiger </em>v. <em>American Seeding Machine Co., </em>124 Ohio St. 222, 177 N.E. 594 (1931); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States Distributing Corporation, </em>184 Va. 134, 34 S.E.2d 244 (1945). Delaware has held that, in a long-form merger pursuant to its statute; Del. Code, annot. tit. 8, \u00a7 251 (1974); if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>sole purpose is to freeze out a minority shareholder, the merger is improper. <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Magnavox Co., </em>380 A.2d 969 (Del. 1977).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Although these eases are relevant, they cannot, in view of the language of \u00a7\u00a7 33-373 and 33-374 of the General Statutes, be regarded as dispositive. The other cases relied upon by the plaintiff; <em>Tanzer </em>v. <em>International General Industries, Inc., </em>379 A.2d 1121 (Del. 1977); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Valhi, Inc., </em>382 A.2d 1372 (Del. Ch. 1978); <em>Gabhart </em>v. <em>Gabhart, </em>370 N.E.2d 345 (Ind. 1977); and <em>Berkowits </em>v. <em>Power Mate Corporation, </em>135 N.J. Super. 36, 342 A.2d 566 (1975); are not persuasive. <em>Tanser </em>involved the Delaware statute, which provides for shareholder remedies in addition to stock appraisal rights; <em>Young </em>involved a long-form Delaware corporate merger, enjoined on the basis that the method used had improperly circumvented a charter provision of the corporation; <em>Gabhart </em>was an action attacking a merger brought under the Indiana statute which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>that the appraisal remedy is merely an alternative and not an exclusive remedy; and <em>Berko wits </em>similarly was an action brought pursuant to a statute; N.J. Stat. annot. \u00a7 14A:10-1 (West); which does not provide that appraisal is an exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We find ourselves in agreement with the views of those courts and commentators who have interpreted an exclusive appraisal remedy to mean exactly what it says: that, as to the fact of the merger and claims addressed to it, a shareholder is entitled only to payment of the value of his shares in accordance with the procedures established by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 33-373 and 33-374. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, </em>42 F.

We thus hold that, with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s claims relating to the merger itself, the trial court did not err in concluding that the plaintiff was limited to a statutory right of appraisal, and, accordingly, in sustaining the defendants\u2019 first motion for summary judgment. The claims relating to the merger itself, stated in count three of the complaint, i.e., that the merger was effectuated without corporate purpose and with the intent to deprive the plaintiff of his shares, did not, in view of the exclusivity of the appraisal rights statute, state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We next address the issue whether the trial court was correct in sustaining the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to counts one, three and four of the complaint, on the ground that these counts stated only derivative claims and could only be brought by one who, unlike the plaintiff, was a shareholder of Mallard acting on behalf of Mallard at the time of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">A distinction must be made between the right of a shareholder to bring suit in an individual capacity as the sole party injured, and his right to sue derivatively on behalf of the corporation alleged to be injured. See 13 Fletcher, op. cit. (Rev. Perm. Ed. 1970) \u00a7\u00a7 5908, 5911. Generally, individual stockholders cannot sue the officers at law for damages on the theory that they are entitled to damages because mismanagement has rendered their stock of less value, since the injury is generally not to the shareholder individually, but to the corporation\u2014 to the shareholders collectively. 3A Fletcher, op. cit. (Rev. Perm. Ed. 1975) \u00a71282; see 13 Fletcher, op. cit. (Rev. Perm. Ed. 1970) \u00a7\u00a7 5907-38. In this regard, it is axiomatic that a claim of injury, the basis of which is a wrong to the corporation, must be brought in a derivative suit, with the plaintiff proceeding \u201csecondarily,\u201d deriving his rights from the corporation which is alleged to have been wronged. Id. \u00a7 5908; 19 Am.

It is, however, well settled that if the injury is one to the plaintiff as a stockholder, and to him individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ally, and not to the corporation, as where an alleged fraud perpetrated by the corporation has affected the plaintiff directly, the cause of action is personal and individual. 13 Fletcher, op. cit. \u00a7 5911; 19 Am.

We cannot agree. Count one, as noted earlier, states nineteen individual transactions which the plaintiff alleged to be unfair and undisclosed to him, which put into issue the looting of Mallard by Gentry. Such claims \u2014 of looting the corporation and of failure of the directors to disclose important facts concerning corporate transactions \u2014 state personal, as opposed to derivative, causes of action. <em>Traylor </em>v. <em>Marine Corporation, </em>328 F. Sup. 382 (E.D. Wis. 1971); <em>Heit </em>v. <em>Tenneco, Inc., </em>319 P. Sup. 884 (D. Del. 1970); <em>Braasch </em>v. <em>Goldschmidt, </em>199 A.2d 760 (Del. Ch. 1964). In count four, the plaintiff alleged that Gentry, in his capacity as officer and director of Mallard and Teal, took advantage of special facts concerning Mallard\u2019s financial condition, which he failed to disclose to the plaintiff, and that Gentry caused the merger to deprive the plaintiff of his shares and to avoid paying the plaintiff their full fair market value. The plaintiff, in effect, via counts one and four, alleged that both defendants dismantled Mallard step-by-step, transaction-by-transaction, depriving Mallard <em>and </em>the plaintiff of income and assets. These allegations claim a pervasive breach of the fiduciary duty owed by the corporate majority to the sole minority stockholder. The rule of corporation law and of equity invoked is well-settled: the majority has the right to control, but when it does so, it occupies a fiduciary relationship toward the minority, as much as the corporation itself or its officers and directors. <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 311, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281 (1939); 13 Fletcher, Corporations (Rev. Perm. Ed. 1970) \u00a7 5810; see <em>Katz Corporation </em>v. <em>T. H.

As pleaded, these causes of action are based upon alleged unlawful acts relating solely to the stock owned by the plaintiff, in violation of the fiduciary duty owed the plaintiff by the defendants, and they thus state individual, and not derivative, claims. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>H. F. Ahmanson do Co., </em>supra; <em>Crain </em>v. <em>Electronic Memories &amp; Magnetics Corporation, </em>50 Cal. App. 3d 509,123 Cal.

The provisions of \u00a7 33-369 (e) of the General Statutes clearly state that the post-merger, surviving corporation shall be responsible for the liabilities, including liability to dissenting shareholders, of each of the merging corporations, and that any claim existing at the time of merger against one of the corporations' may be prosecuted as if the merger had not taken place. Put another way, the merger does not destroy the existing liabilities and obligations of the individual corporations; to hold otherwise would depart from the clear mandate of the statute and allow for perpetration of a fraud upon corporation creditors or others who, like the plaintiff, possess outstanding claims against the merged corporation. See <em>Connecticut Co. </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>94 Conn. 13, 24, 107 A. 646 (1919); Cross, Corporation Law in Connecticut \u00a7 8.6 (1972) (shareholder not prevented from attacking directors for breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>of fiduciary duty antecedent to the transaction). We thus conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining the defendants\u2019 second motion for summary judgment. There exist key issues of material fact as to the liability of both defendants in the plaintiff\u2019s personal cause of action against them, as stated in counts one and four of the complaint, which demand fuller treatment upon remand.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ardoline </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>140 Conn. 552, 555, 102 A.2d 352 (1954); see <em>Town Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>176 Conn. 304, 309, 407 A.2d 971 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Little remains for discussion with respect to count two of the complaint. In this count, the plaintiff alleged a breach of duty by the defendants to Mallard, as opposed to himself, on account of most of the transactions described as unfair in count one, and additionally claimed that the merger was without purpose and intended to exclude the plaintiff. So much of the count as attacks the merger itself is foreclosed by our disposition in part I in regard to count three. As to the allegations concerning the purported injury to Mallard occasioned by the merger, however, additional comment is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The trial court held that the allegations contained in count two stated a derivative cause of action, and could only be pursued by one who was a stockholder in Mallard both at the time of the alleged corporate delict and at the time of the filing of suit. We agree. Count two alleged as its primary claim an injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Mallard, pursued by the plaintiff on behalf of Mallard. To establish his right to bring an action on behalf of Mallard, the plaintiff was required to allege and prove that he had maintained his status as a shareholder in the corporation for whose benefit he purported to sue, from the time the alleged improper acts occurred, continuously and uninterruptedly until after the judgment in the case was rendered. <em>Braasch </em>v. <em>Goldschmidt, </em>199 A.2d 760 (Del. Ch. 1964); <em>Gresov </em>v. <em>Shattuck Denn Mining Corporation, </em>40 Misc. 2d 569, 243 N.Y.S.2d 760 (1963); <em>Sorin </em>v. <em>Shahmoon Industries, Inc., </em>20 Misc. 2d 149, 191 N.Y.S.2d 14 (1959); Ballantine, Corporations \u00a7 148 (1946); see annots., 172 A.L.R. 512, 168 A.L.R. 906. The logic of this \u201ccontinuous ownership\u201d requirement is apparent: a plaintiff may not seek to vindicate the rights of a corporation of which he is not a shareholder, or, as in the present case, which has ceased to exist. Although the issue is not one entirely free from doubt; see <em>Smallwood </em>v. <em>Pearl Brewing Co., </em>489 F.2d 579, 591 n.12 (5th Cir. 1974); we are persuaded that the court was correct in characterizing count two as derivative in nature, and in sustaining the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment addressed to that count on the ground that the plaintiff lacked capacity to pursue the derivative cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">There is no error as to counts two and three; as to counts one and four there is error, the judgment as to those counts is set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\"> The nineteen transactions referred to involve, inter alia, corporate opportunity usurped by both defendants, intercorporate transactions by both defendants, including, but not limited to, loans, rentals, pledges of assets between corporations owned or controlled by Gentry, using Teal as a shell, undisclosed depression of earnings, acquiring Mallard\u2019s stock without offering it to the plaintiff, offering to buy the plaintiff\u2019s stock at various times at increasing prices without disclosing to the plaintiff special facts affecting the share\u2019s value on account of merger discussions, in that the assets of Mallard and Teal were alleged to have been sold approximately one year after the merger to the Alkaline Battery Corporation; causing Mallard to be merged into Teal without corporate purpose and for the purpose of excluding Yanow as a shareholder of Mallard and for the purpose of depriving Mallard of an opportunity to profit by the sale of its assets to a third party; Gentry\u2019s causing Mallard to become a Teal sales agent, and Teal\u2019s purchasing and selling products of other companies, which deprived Mallard of the opportunity to manufacture and sell those products itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 33-373 provides in relevant part: \u201cEights of objecting shareholders. ...

We cannot agree. <em>Singer </em>dealt with a two-step, long-form merger, finding the merger improper because of a lack of business purpose. The case did not address the issue of the exclusiveness of the appraisal remedy in a short-form merger, and was a marked departure from the view Delaware courts have taken as to short-form mergers in regard to the exclusivity of the appraisal remedy. See <em>Stauffer </em>v. <em>Standard Brands, Inc., </em>41 Del. Ch. 7, 187 A.2d 78 (1962); <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>E. L. Bruce Co., </em>40 Del. Ch. 80, 174 A.2d 29 (1961). Policy considerations presented by short-form mergers are substantially different from those presented by long-form mergers. It is reasonable to treat the two situations differently, as in a short-form merger minority shareholders are never more than 10 percent of the aggregate, while in the long-form merger minority shareholders can own as mueh as one-third and in some cases 49 percent of the company stock. The <em>Singer </em>ease, moreover, has not gone without substantial criticism. See Borden, \u201cSome Comments on <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Magnavox,\u201d </em>178 N.Y.
