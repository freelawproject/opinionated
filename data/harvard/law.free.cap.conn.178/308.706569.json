The process consisted only of a writ of summons and a complaint; there was no direction to the officer to make either an attachment or a garnishment. The writ of summons described the address of the husband as 1504 Sheridan Avenue, Bronx, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The officer made no attachment, no garnishment, and no manual or abode service of the process. Instead, pursuant to an order of notice issued by a clerk of the Superior Court under General Statutes \u00a746-17 (now, as amended, \u00a746b-46 [a]), the officer mailed to the husband \u201ca true and attested copy\u201d of the \u201cwrit, summons, and complaint\u201d and the order of notice, by registered mail addressed to the husband\u2019s Bronx, New York, address.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The complaint contained allegations concerning the date and place of the marriage of the parties, the residence of the wife, the grounds for the divorce, and the names, and dates of birth, of the children of the marriage. In the complaint, there was no metes-and-bounds description of any real property allegedly owned by the husband, nor any general allegation, such as the one suggested by Practice Book, 1963, Form 396 (now Practice Book, 1978, Form 504.1), that the husband owned real estate. The prayer for relief, with respect to alimony, was a general claim for \u201calimony\u201d; there was no prayer that the court assign to, or vest in, the wife the husband\u2019s interest in property in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The husband filed no appearance in the action. On August 7, 1973, the court <em>(Wright, J.) </em>found that the husband had received actual notice \u201cthat said complaint is pending\u201d and that the allegations of the complaint are \u201cproved and true.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court rendered judgment granting a divorce to the wife, awarding custody of the minor children to the wife, ordering the husband to pay $15 per week for the support of the minor children, and ordering that \u201cin lieu of all other alimony,\u201d the husband\u2019s right, title, and interest in a designated tract of land in Connecticut \u201cis hereby transferred and vested in the . . . [wife].\u201d The husband did not file an appeal from any of the provisions of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>On December 27, 1977, the husband filed a motion for modification of the court\u2019s judgment. Thereafter, he filed an amended motion for modification, in which he petitioned the court to \u201cmodify the orders of support and to eliminate the provision re alimony in the August 7, 1973 judgment of divorce.\u201d On April 10, 1978, on the ground that there had been no in personam jurisdiction over the husband, the court <em>(Jacobs, J.) </em>modified the judgment by vacating the order for support. The husband has appealed from the court\u2019s refusal to modify the judgment by also eliminating the provision concerning the transfer to the wife of the husband\u2019s interest in Connecticut land.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The parties have used the court\u2019s memorandum of decision on the motion to modify for the purpose of determining the conclusions of the court. In the absence of a finding, we may use that memorandum of decision for the same purpose. <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>138 Conn. 1, 5, 81 A.2d 450 (1951). The court, in that memorandum of decision, concluded that a Connecticut court, on the basis of the notice by registered mail to the husband, may issue a decree \u201cthat is effective to the extent that it can be satisfied out of husband\u2019s in-state property.\u201d The court also concluded that, accordingly, the transfer to the wife of the husband\u2019s interest in his Connecticut property is \u201cbinding\u201d on the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">In this appeal, the husband makes two claims: the first is that, without in personam jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>over the husband, the court did not have the power to transfer the husband\u2019s property because the property had not been brought under the control of the court by an attachment; the second is that mailing the summons, complaint, and order of notice to the husband did not constitute adequate notice to him that the wife intended to claim an order vesting title in her. The wife claims that, under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 52-22<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the decision of this court in <em>Mendrochowicz </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>139 Conn. 506, 95 A.2d 260 (1953), the court had the power to pass title to the husband\u2019s Connecticut property, although there was neither in personam jurisdiction nor an attachment. The wife also disputes the husband\u2019s claim concerning the adequacy of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">As the wife contends, in <em>Mendrochowicz </em>this court held that the trial court had the power to enter a valid judgment there even though there was no attachment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and no in personam jurisdiction. <em>Mendrochowicz </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>supra, 511. <em>Mendrochowicz, </em>however, is a different kind of case from the present case; <em>Mendrochowicz </em>is an action in rem, whereas the present case is an action quasi in rem.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>There is no statement of the difference between an action in rem and an action quasi in rem that will serve all purposes. For the purpose, however, of determining the essential characteristics of the type of case that the holding in <em>Mendrochowies </em>applies to, we can state the difference between the two types of actions in the following way: an action in rem is an action brought to enforce or protect \u201ca pre-existing interest in particular property\u201d ;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an action quasi in rem is an action brought to \u201capply the property to satisfy a personal claim.\u201d See note, \u201cThe Requirement of Seizure in the Exercise of Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction: <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff </em>Re-Examined,\u201d 63 Harv. L. Rev. 657, 659 (1950) (hereinafter cited as note, \u201cThe Requirement of Seizure\u201d). In <em>Mendrochowics, </em>the principal prayer for relief<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was a prayer to set deeds aside and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>have the plaintiff declared the owner of the property described in the deeds. The action was an action in rem because the plaintiff was not seeking to apply that property to the payment of a personal claim but to enforce her preexisting equitable interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In the present case, the wife\u2019s claim for alimony was not a claim concerning a preexisting interest in her husband\u2019s property. \u201cIn this state neither a husband nor a wife acquires, by virtue of marriage, any interest in the real or personal property of the other during the other\u2019s lifetime. General Statutes \u00a7 46-9;[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] <em>Cherniack </em>v. <em>Home National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>151 Conn. 367, 370, 198 A.2d 58; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>5 Conn. 317, 321.\u201d <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>165 Conn. 742, 748, 345 A.2d 21 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Further, contrary to the wife\u2019s claim, the present action did not become an action in rem merely because the judgment operated in rem. See <em>Failing </em>v. <em>Failing, </em>4 Ill. 2d 11, 122 N.E.2d 167 (1954). Whether the holding in <em>Mendrochowicz </em>applies to a given case is determined by the allegations of the complaint and the prayer for relief, not by the judgment that is rendered on the merits. Indeed, in <em>Mendrochowicz </em>no judgment on the merits had been rendered. It was from the allegations of the complaint and the prayer for relief that this court determined whether the action was one in rem. A judgment that operates in rem does not make the action an action in rem if the allegations of the complaint and prayer for relief requisite for an action in rem are not present, and they were not present in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>case. Accordingly, the present action was not an action in rem, and the wife\u2019s claim that the decree awarding the property to her was a valid decree under the in-rem rule of <em>Mendrochowicz </em>is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The conflicting claims of the parties with respect to the adequacy of the notice in this case are not concerned with the adequacy of notice that the action was pending, but with the adequacy of notice that the court might adjudicate the issue whether the husband should be deprived of his property by a decree under General Statutes \u00a7 52-22. We have recognized the right of a litigant to \u201cfair notice\u201d that a court may render a judgment with respect to a given issue. <em>Winick </em>v. <em>Winick, </em>153 Conn. 294, 298, 216 A.2d 185 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">In determining what the husband ought to have had \u201cfair notice\u201d of from the copy of the complaint that he received, this court has to charge him with knowledge of the relevant Connecticut statutes, and their interpretation, even though he may have been totally unfamiliar with them. See <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Neligon, </em>116 Conn. 307, 311, 164 A. 661 (1933). A relevant statute, General Statutes \u00a746-21 (now, as amended, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82), reads, in part: \u201cThe superior court may assign to any woman divorced by such court a part of the estate of her husband and, in addition thereto or in lieu thereof, may order alimony to be paid from the husband\u2019s income.\u201d This statute empowers the court, as an incident to a divorce, to decree that the husband pay alimony to the wife \u201cin terms of money or property.\u201d <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>93 Conn. 296, 300, 105 A. 684 (1919). Although the word \u201calimony\u201d does not appear in that part of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ute dealing with an \u201cassignment\u201d of the husband\u2019s property to the wife, \u201cthe idea of . . . [alimony] is clearly embraced\u201d in that part of the statute. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>21 Conn. 185, 197 (1851). The wife\u2019s claim for alimony, therefore, gave the husband \u201cfair notice\u201d that the court might \u201cassign\u201d to the wife some of his property if she was granted a divorce. If we charge the husband with notice of the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 52-22, as we must, the \u201cfair notice\u201d that the court might \u201cassign\u201d some of his property to the wife, also was \u201cfair notice\u201d that the court might elect to make the \u201cassignment\u201d effective by a decree transferring property to the wife, under the provisions of that statute. The husband\u2019s claim of lack of notice that a decree might be entered under General Statutes \u00a7 52-22 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">As noted previously, the husband also claims that the decree under General Statutes \u00a7 52-22 is not valid as a decree quasi in rem because the husband\u2019s property was not attached prior to judgment. In maldng this claim, the husband relies on <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>147 Conn. 238, 159 A.2d 173 (1960). In that case, the defendant was a nonresident over whom the court did not have in personam jurisdiction. He owned property in Connecticut, but an attempted attachment of it was defective. This court held that the trial court could not render a valid quasi in rem judgment for alimony, because the defendant\u2019s property had not been effectively attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The principle that procedural due process for quasi in rem judgments requires an attachment of the defendant\u2019s property was originally enunciated in <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 24 L. Ed. 565 (1877) and was reiterated in <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Fourth National Bank, </em>243 U.S. 269, 37 S. Ct. 282, 61 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>713 (1917). If those cases still retained their vitality as establishing constitutional imperatives, we would, of course, be bound by them. In matrimonial actions particularly, however, the distinct trend of the decisions has been in derogation of the authority of those cases. \u201cIn a line of cases involving alimony awards against nonresident husbands who own land within the state, some courts have omitted the requirement of seizure and have been satisfied with an assertion in the complaint that relief was being sought out of specific, described property.\u201d Note, \u201cThe Requirement of Seizure,\u201d supra, 660. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s language in the <em>Pennoyer </em>Case as to bringing the property within the court\u2019s control by attachment or an equivalent act \u2018in the first instance,\u2019 and its statement in the <em>Pennington </em>Case that one essential of due process is \u2018seizure at the commencement of the proceedings,\u2019 have not been literally followed by any court .... A number of courts have stated that there must be a legal seizure of the defendant\u2019s property before the final judgment in order to subject it to claims for alimony, support, or maintenance on only substituted or constructive service. . . . An even greater number of courts, however, have stated that there need not be a prejudgment seizure in order to subject the property to claims for alimony, maintenance, or support on constructive or substituted service, and these statements are supported by many decisions upholding decrees reaching the property although there was no prejudgment legal seizure.\u201d Annot., \u201cJurisdiction on Constructive or Substituted Service, In Divorce or Alimony Action, to Reach Property Within State,\u201d 10 A.L.R.3d 212, 216-17 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Although those \u201cmany decisions\u201d did not recognize the authority of <em>Pennoyer </em>and <em>Pennington </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>actions quasi in rem, they did not develop any generally-accepted new rule to replace that authority. The Supreme Court of the United States, however, in <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977), enunciated both a new rule and its rationale, superseding both the rule and rationale in <em>Pennington </em>and <em>Pennoyer. </em>That new rule is that \u201call assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in <em>[International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945)] and its progeny.\u201d <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>supra, 212. Those standards require, in brief, that, for a court to have power to render a valid judgment in a civil suit, if the defendant is not present \u201cwithin the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend Traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' \u201d <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 316. Those standards apply to judgments in rem or quasi in rem, as well as to judgments in personam, and to judgments against a natural person, as well as to judgments against a corporation. <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>supra, 204 n.19, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The rationale of <em>Shaffer </em>is that, contrary to the rationale in <em>Pennoyer, </em>the object of an action in rem or quasi in rem is not a judgment that affects a thing; rather, the object of an action in rem or quasi in rem is a judgment that affects the defendant\u2019s interests in that thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u201cThe case for applying to jurisdiction in rem[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] the same test of \u2018fair play and substantial justice\u2019 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>governs assertions of jurisdiction in personam is simple and straight-forward. It is premised on recognition that [t]he phrase, \u201cjudicial jurisdiction over a thing,\u201d is a customary elliptical way of referring to jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.\u2019 Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws (1971) \u00a7 56. This recognition leads to the conclusion that in order to justify an exercise of jurisdiction in rem, the basis for jurisdiction must he sufficient to justify exercising \u2018jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.\u2019 The standard for determining whether an exercise of jurisdiction over the interests of persons is consistent with the Due Process Clause is the minimum-contacts standard elucidated in <em>International Shoe.\u201d Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>supra, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The rationale of the decision in <em>Garter, </em>like the rationale of the decision in <em>Pennoyer, </em>was that a judgment quasi in rem is a judgment affecting a thing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consistently with that rationale, <em>Carter </em>held (p. 241) that the trial court had jurisdiction to enter a valid quasi in rem judgment affecting the defendant\u2019s property, only if the \u201cproperty [was brought] within the jurisdiction of the court\u201d by a prejudgment attachment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The rationale for the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>in <em>Carter </em>was repudiated by <em>Shaffer\u2019s </em>repudiation of the <em>Pennoyer </em>fiction that an action quasi in rem is an action against property.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Under <em>Shaffer, </em>supra, 209, there is now a single standard for determining whether jurisdiction exists in personam, or in rem, or quasi in rem.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That standard, \u201cminimum contacts,\u201d having now been established by the Supreme Court of the United States as a requirement of the federal constitution, is \u201cabsolutely binding on us.\u201d See <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>143 Conn. 624, 629, 124 A.2d 886 (1956). Under that standard, bringing the defendant\u2019s property \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the court\u201d by a prejudgment attachment is not a due-process prerequisite for jurisdiction quasi in rem. Accordingly, we overrule <em>Carter </em>to the extent that that case holds that a state court has no jurisdiction to render a judgment quasi in rem if there has been no prejudgment attachment. <em>Leszczymski </em>v. <em>Radel Oyster Co., </em>102 Conn. 511, 528, 129 A. 539 (1925) <em>(Kennerson </em>v. <em>Thames Towboat Co., </em>89 Conn. 367, 94 A. 372 [1915] overruled because later decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on constitutional grounds enunciated rule inconsistent with Kennerson).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The underlying substantive question in this case is: does <em>Carter </em>make the 1973 judgment concerning the defendant\u2019s in-state property a nullity, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the husband claims. To answer that question, we have to decide whether our present decision overruling <em>Carter </em>applies retroactively to the 1973 judgment. If our present decision overruling <em>Carter </em>does not apply to a judgment rendered in 1973, we must treat <em>Carter </em>as being in force in 1973 and, in that event, under <em>Carter, </em>the 1973 judgment is a nullity. If our decision overruling <em>Carter </em>applies retroactively, and we do not treat <em>Carter </em>as controlling, even in 1973, then, on the present record, the 1973 judgment is effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The extent to which an overruling decision will be applied retroactively is now generally held to be a matter for the overruling court to determine. \u201cAs a matter of constitutional law, retroactive operation of an overruling decision is neither required nor prohibited. Accordingly, most courts now treat the question of how an overruling decision should operate as one of judicial policy rather than of judicial power, and recognize that varying results may be reached, depending on the particular circumstances presented and the particular rule affected.\u201d Annot., \u201cProspective or Retroactive Operation of Overruling Decision,\u201d 10 A.L.R.3d 1371, 1378 (1966).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">For purposes of the present litigation, two \u201cjudicial policy\u201d considerations are paramount. The first is the principle of the finality of judgments. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>modern law of civil procedure suggests that even litigation about subject matter jurisdiction should take into account the importance of the principle of the finality of judgments, particularly when the parties have had a full opportunity originally to contest the jurisdiction of the adjudicatory tribunal.\u201d <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 178, 413 A.2d 819 (1979). The unappealed 1973 judgment was more than four years old when the present motion was filed, as noted previously. As between nonretroactivity, which will cause that judgment to be a nullity, and retroactivity, which will not cause that judgment to be a nullity, the principle of the finality of judgments persuades us to elect retro-activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The second consideration arises from the circumstance that the 1973 judgment is a judgment affecting the title to real estate. A state has \u201cstrong interests in assuring the marketability of property within its borders.\u201d <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Meitner, </em>supra, 208. Here a link in the chain of title is a judgment that, on the basis of the recitations in the judgment file, was a valid judgment. Further, it is a judgment that is presumed to have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 15. The marketability of the title depends on the validity of that judgment. As between nonretroactivity, which will impair the marketability of that title by invalidating that judgment, and retroactivity, which will not invalidate that judgment, the state\u2019s interest in marketability persuades us to elect retro-activity. We hold that our decision overruling <em>Carter </em>applies retroactively to the 1973 judgment, and we do not sustain the claim of the husband that <em>Carter </em>makes the 1973 judgment a nullity. There is no basis, in the record, for us to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>whether the 1973 judgment is vulnerable on grounds other than those urged by the husband. Because no other grounds of vulnerability have been established, and the grounds urged by the husband have not been sustained, the judgment has not been successfully attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> The judgment file also contains a finding by the court \u201cthat said writ and complaint\u201d were \u201cduly served on the defendant.\u201d Because relevant portions of the return of the officer refer only to the order of notice, that finding may logically be construed only as a finding that the officer complied with the order of notice. The parties to the present action agree that the court did not have in personam jurisdiction over the husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Because neither party requested a finding and none was made, our statement of the facts is based on undisputed facts set forth in the briefs of the parties; Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 3040 (b), 3041 (b); and on facts appearing on the record. <em>Robertson </em>v.

This amendment does not affect the issues in this ease, because the statute, as worded in 1973, applied to the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> The attempted attachment was \u201cabortive.\u201d <em>Mendrochowicz </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>139 Conn. 506, 512, 95 A.2d 260 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> Restatement, Judgments (1942) \u00a7 32 comment a, defines an \u201cin rem\u201d proceeding as a proceeding \u201cbrought to affect the interests in the thing not merely of particular persons but of all persons in the world.\u201d This definition follows the view expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes (then Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court) in <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Judges of the Court of Registration, </em>175 Mass. 71, 76, 55 N.E. 812, appeal dismissed, 179 U.S. 405, 21 S.

Ed. 252 (1900) : \u201cIf . . . the object [of a suit] is to bar indifferently all who might be minded to make on objection of any sort against the right sought to be established, and if any one in the world has a right to bo heard on the strength of alleging facts which, if true, show an inconsistent interest, the proceeding is in rem.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201c[a]ctions which seek \u2018to affect the interests of particular persons in a thing,\u2019 which are called \u2018quasi in rem\u2019 by the Restatement, are almost universally included as \u2018in rem\u2019 actions by general usage today.\u201d James, Civil Procedure p. 612 n.5 (1965). The usage in Connecticut follows the \u201cgeneral usage.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Atlas Garage &amp; Custom Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>167 Conn. 248, 252, 355 A.2d 286 (1974); <em>Mendrochowicz </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>139 Conn. 506, 511, 95 A.2d 260 <em>(1953); </em>1 Stephenson, Conn.

For example, quasi in rem judgments generally are not within the scope of the full-faith-and-credit clause of the federal constitution, may not be enforced by contempt proceedings, may be satisfied only out of in-state property, and are not res judicata.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\"> That annotation cites numerous decisions in support of the quotation.
