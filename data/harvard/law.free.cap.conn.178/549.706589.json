J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATU\">The defendant was convicted after a jury trial of the crime of kidnapping in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-94 of the General Statutes. He has appealed from the judgment rendered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The defendant in this appeal claims that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a photographic array containing a \u201cmug shot\u201d of the defendant and in permitting testimony that one of the individuals in the array was the brother of the defendant. Additionally, he requests that this court remand the ease for a full evidentiary hearing because of an allegedly improper, untranscribed remark made by the state\u2019s attorney during summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The jury could have found the following facts from the evidence submitted at trial. On November 9, 1975, at approximately 4:09 - 4:11 p.m., the victim, a nurse at Hartford Hospital, was abducted in her car from a parking lot near the hospital. As she put her keys in the ignition, the assailant, who was later described by the victim as a short young man with blond, shoulder-length hair, blue eyes, white complexion, and an acne-marked face, ordered her at knife-point to move to the passenger\u2019s side. Before driving off, he told the victim to keep her hands on the dashboard and warned her that he would kill her if she did not keep quiet. She succeeded in escaping by leaping from the car at an intersection approximately five minutes traveling time from the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">At trial the primary issue in contention was identification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to the victim\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>identifying the defendant as her abductor on November 9, 1975, a security guard at Hartford Hospital, Anthony Ruggiero, also testified. Ruggiero asserted that he had seen the defendant in the lobby of Hartford Hospital sometime after 3 p.m. on November 9, 1975, and again in a hospital parking lot at 3:40 p.m. Ruggiero made an in-court identification and stated that four days after the incident he had identified the defendant from a photographic grouping of eight persons, which the state offered in evidence. The security officer further testified that the same photographic identification procedure took place at the hospital within a week after his initial viewing of the photographs. Police detective Mildred Wertz attested to the second identification procedure, and at trial she testified that one of the photographs in the group shown to Ruggiero was a picture of the defendant\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">On four occasions within the last three years we have been confronted with the issue whether a trial court erred in admitting police photographs into evidence for the purpose of identification. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion in admitting such evidence we have held that such photographs are admissible if they are relevant and material and if their probative value outweighs their prejudicial tendency. <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>176 Conn. 170, 175, 405 A.2d 626, cert. denied, 441 U.S. 966, 99 S. Ct. 2417, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1072; <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Crowe, </em>174 Conn. 129, 131, 384 A.2d 340; <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>172 Conn. 9, 10, 372 A.2d 128; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>171 Conn. 610, 612, 370 A.2d 1080; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 134-35, 422 A.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Here, the state\u2019s proof on the issue of identification rested solely on the testimony of two witnesses: the victim and the security guard, Ruggiero. Although Ruggiero had already made a positive in-court identification of the defendant, we cannot conclude that the probative value of calling the jury\u2019s attention to Ruggiero\u2019s previous out-of-court identification was minimal. Since the witness\u2019 identification of the defendant rested on two brief observations of the defendant in the lobby and in the parking lot of the hospital before he was aware of the commission of the crime; compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>supra, 175; the state\u2019s introduction of the photographs represents a logical offer to demonstrate that the reliability of its witness\u2019 identification did not rest solely upon what might be construed as a pro forma in-court identification from the witness\u2019 chair. As the defendant\u2019s brief states: \u201cCredibility of the witnesses was the key to both the State\u2019s case and defendant\u2019s defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The defendant contends nevertheless that the probative value of the photographs was outweighed by their prejudicial effect in that their introduction would impermissibly suggest to the jury that the defendant had engaged in prior criminal misconduct. In each of the quartet of recent cases previously mentioned, we considered similar claims; as is true in this case, we could find nothing to indicate that the trial court had abused its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>supra, 175-76; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowe, </em>supra, 131; <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>supra, 10; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>supra, 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In the present case, considerable prophylactic measures were taken to insure that the manner in which the photographs were introduced mitigated any possible prejudicial effect. The jury was excused during the extensive discussions among the trial court and both trial counsel about the manner in which the photographs were to be introduced. Second, the trial court admonished the jury not to draw any inferences from their absence during discussion of questions of law. Third, the photographic array of pictures of eight persons was taped to a single cardboard placard. All markings had been cut from the front of the pictures and they were taped to the placard so that notations on their reverse sides would be hidden.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While we reiterate the admonition in <em>State </em>v. Peary, supra, 176, against indiscriminate use of \u201cmug shots\u201d for identification, in light of the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the trial court erred in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error concerns the admission into evidence of the testimony of Detective Wertz that among the photographs security officer Euggiero viewed during his pretrial photographic identification was a picture of the defendant\u2019s brother. The defendant contends that the prejudicial tendency of Detective Wertz\u2019s testimony as to the identity of one of the pictures outweighed its probative value. The reliability and credibility of witness Euggiero\u2019s identification was necessarily augmented by testimony showing his ability to distinguish between the defendant and a person who resembled the defendant closely enough to be, in fact, his brother. To be sure, as the defendant points out, the probative value of this testimony may be limited because the jury did have the opportunity to review the photographs and to ascertain on its own the reliability of an identification based on the photographic array. Nonetheless, whatever probative value attaches to the testimony of Detective Wertz must be balanced against the nugatory prejudicial effect of that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The defendant\u2019s brother did not testify, and the defendant\u2019s argument \u2014 for which he cites no authority \u2014 that such evidence would undermine the credibility of the defendant and his parents, all of whom were witnesses for the defendant\u2019s alibi, proves far too much. To assume that the jury would infer from Detective Wertz\u2019s testimony that the testimony of the defendant and his parents was unworthy of credibility because, at some point, a \u201cmug shot\u201d was taken of the defendant\u2019s brother is to tar the jury\u2019s reasoning with a stain that would taint any evidence from which specious inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>could possibly be drawn. In light of these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court erred in admitting Detective Wertz\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The defendant\u2019s final contention involves the alleged impropriety of a statement made by the state in its closing argument. He maintains that the state\u2019s attorney remarked that the defendant\u2019s parents were confused about whether they were to attend a basketball game on the afternoon of November 9, 1975, because that time of year was football season. The defendant\u2019s claim is that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments were improper and calculated to undermine the credibility of the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 alibi testimony and consequently denied the defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial, a mistrial, and to release the jurors from their oath of secrecy to ask them for their recollections of the closing argument. Although the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was couched in terms of newly discovered evidence, it is clear that the basis of all his motions concerned solely the propriety and effect of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment. The defendant, while not specifically claiming error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions, now requests that this court remand the case for a full evidentiary hearing on the issue of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">As the defendant\u2019s request reveals, the procedural posture by which this petition for remand comes to us is problematic. No transcript was made of the closing argument, and neither the record nor the transcript offers any indication of an objection, exception, or timely motion for mistrial on the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>of the propriety and effect of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s alleged comment so as to afford the trial court the opportunity to cure any impropriety at the time of trial. Cf. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>178 Conn. 156, 160-61, 422 A.2d 287; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeGennaro, </em>147 Conn. 296, 304, 160 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 873, 81 S. Ct. 116, 5 L. Ed. 2d 95. Only some seven weeks after the trial concluded did the defendant make his motions relating to this issue and present an affidavit from his attorney as to what he claims the state\u2019s attorney said.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">It is unclear what the defendant expects a hearing to accomplish. He asserts that \u201cthe request is not to inquire into anything which only the jurors experienced, hut simply to verify a statement made in open court.\u201d However, to reiterate, in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motions the trial court had before it the defense attorney\u2019s affidavit as to what was allegedly said, and the defendant does not claim that the trial court erred in denying his motions on the basis of the affidavit. In light of these circumstances, his unusual and extreme request cannot now attempt to take advantage of as well as obscure his failure to develop an appropriate record for the presentation of his claims on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paluga, </em>171 Conn. 586, 598-99, 370 A.2d 1049; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>163 Conn. 304, 308, 306 A.2d 855; <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>124 Conn. 554, 567, 1 A.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> The fact of abduction itself and the time sequence of the incident were corroborated by substantial evidence. In addition to the victim\u2019s testimony, there was evidence from the victim\u2019s time card, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the phone call received by the police, and the discovery of the victim\u2019s abandoned, still running ear mired in a cemetery near the intersection where the victim escaped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> The parties have referred to the photographs as \u201cmug shots,\u201d which typically involve pictures of the subject showing both a front and profile view. See generally, annot., 30 A.L.R.3d 908.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-4\"> The defendant claims that the remarks made by Ruggiero prior to the introduction of the photographic array in evidence alerted the jury to the origin and possibly prejudicial nature of the exhibit. Ruggiero\u2019s remarks were brief and gratuitous; they consisted of noting that the photographs were altered by cutting from the original state in which they were shown to him after the abduction. At trial the defendant did not make any specific objection to the remarks or request that the jury be told to disregard them. Hor does the defendant specifically claim on appeal that the admission of those remarks was error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bartee, </em>167 Conn. 309, 313, 355 A.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In any event, witness Ruggiero\u2019s unresponsive and isolated remarks cannot be considered to have added significantly, if at all, to whatever prejudicial tendency may have been inherent in the array itself. His comments could serve only to bring the jury\u2019s attention to the obvious \u2014 that the photographs had been cut was apparent on their face. Moreover, the jury, in light of Ruggiero\u2019s remark about the loose form in which he originally viewed the photographs, could reasonably have inferred that they were cut to fit conveniently on the cardboard placard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> By means of his request, the defendant seeks to avoid explicitly advocating either of two positions, both untenable under the facts of this case: that the affidavit in this context represents an adequate record to claim that the trial court erred in denying his motions or, in the alternative, that the record created by him is inadequate even with the affidavit, and therefore, we should remand to afford him another opportunity to create an adequate record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
