J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aee\">The plaintiff, William Grega, was indicted by a grand jury and charged with the murder of Kenneth Hill. Following a plea of not guilty and trial to a jury of twelve, he was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree. On July 27, 1977, the Superior Court dismissed Grega\u2019s amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking his release from confinement, and, upon certification pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470, the plaintiff appealed to this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The plaintiff was arrested pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-43 then in effect,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by virtue of a bench warrant issued by a judge of the Superior Court upon application of the state\u2019s attorney that there was probable cause to believe that William Grega shot and killed Kenneth Hill. An affidavit consisting of three legal size pages signed by the county detective for Fairfield County, subscribed and sworn to before a notary public, was attached to the application for the bench warrant. The affidavit set forth in elaborate detail all the events and circumstances leading up to the charge of murder which implicated the accused. On the basis of the foregoing, the judge found that probable cause existed for the issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>of the bench warrant. The plaintiff does not contest the fact that probable cause existed in the case; rather, the plaintiff questions the constitutional validity of General Statutes \u00a7 54-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s primary claim in this appeal is that General Statutes \u00a7 54-43, which authorized the issuance of bench warrants, was unconstitutional on its face, thereby failing to confer jurisdiction on the trial court over his person. That contention is based upon the fact that the language of \u00a7 54-43 provided for the issuance of a bench warrant \u201c[u]pon the representation of any state\u2019s attorney that he has reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been committed . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that the statute must explicitly provide for the issuance of such warrant \u201cupon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d Consequently, the plaintiff claims that, since the statute under which he was arrested was constitutionally infirm, the trial court failed to obtain jurisdiction over his person, thus rendering his present detention illegal and requiring his immediate release. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The plaintiff does not seriously dispute that the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard as used in the bench warrant statute and the \u201cprobable cause\u201d requirement of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution are \u201csubstantial equivalents of the same meaning.\u201d <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>35S U.S. 307, 310n, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327. Bather, he contends that the statute is constitutionally deficient in that it fails to particularize expressly the method or procedure of submitting facts, supported by oath or affirmation, from which an independent determination of probable cause can be made. Reference to our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 214 A.2d 900, is dispositive of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The state\u2019s attorney in this ease specifically followed <em>Licari </em>where we held (p. 132) that the fourth amendment requires \u201ca state\u2019s attorifey applying for a bench warrant [to] submit facts, supported by oath or affirmation, from which the judge or court can make an independent determination that probable cause exists for the issuance of the bench warrant under General Statutes \u00a7 54-43. See cases such as <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>. . . [374 U.S. 23, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726]; <em>Albrecht </em>v. <em>United States, 213 </em>U.S. 1, 47 S. Ct. 250, 71 L. Ed. 505.\u201d Simply stated, procedures governing arrest must conform to fourth amendment requirements. <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>supra, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In <em>Licari, </em>we didnot conclude that the above principles rendered \u00a7 54-43 unconstitutional; and in the present case, we explicitly reject such a claim. It is a fundamental rule that, if its language permits, a statute will be construed so as to render it constitutionally valid. <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678; <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 295 A.2d 547; <em>Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works </em>v. <em>Nu-Enamel Corporation, </em>305 U.S. 315, 333, 59 S. Ct. 191, 83 L. Ed. 195, rehearing denied, 305 U.S. 675, 59 S. Ct. 356, 83 L. Ed. 437. Thus, a court is justified in holding that a statute was intended to be subject to constitutional requirements, and that those requirements are to be considered as embodied in the statute, if its terms do not exclude such requirements. <em>People </em>v. <em>Amor, </em>12 Cal. 3d 20, 29-30, 523 P.2d 1173; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>256 Ala. 478, 482, 55 So. 2d 511; 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7 45.12; 16 Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law \u00a7 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The <em>Licari </em>case \u201camounted merely to a recognition and acceptance, and, indeed, an application by Connecticut of settled law as laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in cases such as <em>Giordenello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 480, 78 S. Ct. 1245, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1503.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>155 Conn. 367, 378, 232 A.2d 907. The \u201crepresentation\u201d which must be made by a state\u2019s attorney under \u00a7 54-43 was, in <em>Licari, </em>properly characterized in view of the requirements of the fourth amendment and was not, as the plaintiff appears to argue, rendered invalid in the abstract. Indeed, in the present case, the plaintiff does not deny that the procedures mandated by <em>Licari </em>were, in fact, scrupulously followed. The state\u2019s attorney, in proceeding as he did, acted \u201cconsistently with the essential demands of due process.\u201d <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 57, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Consequently, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s conviction is not invalid due to the trial court\u2019s claimed lack of jurisdiction over his person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\"> Although Grega is the sole appellant in this appeal, the record indicates that the petitioners in a number of other eases which present the same questions of law raised herein have, by stipulation, agreed to the rendition of judgment in their cases consistent with our disposition of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\"> In legislation dealing with the reorganization of our courts, General Statutes \u00a7 54-43 was repealed effective July 1, 1978. Public Acts 1977, No. 77-576, \u00a7 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> In view of our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to address the plaintiff's claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. That claim has been phrased in the following terms: \u201cIf the merit of the plaintiff\u2019s claim [of lack of jurisdiction] was obvious at the time of plea, was plaintiff\u2019s counsel acting competently when he neglected to raise it?\u201d Since we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s underlying jurisdictional claim is without merit and we do not rest that determination upon a waiver theory, the plaintiff\u2019s sixth amendment claim, as framed, is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
