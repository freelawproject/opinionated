James argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt misled the jury and lowered the government\u2019s burden of proof by including a subjective standard of proof. Next, James argues that the district court did not comply with the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) requirements in sentencing him because the court failed to conduct the required colloquy regarding his prior convictions. James also argues that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by enhancing his sentence based on prior convictions not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, James argues that the written judgment contains a clerical error, listing the incorrect statute of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-10\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-11\">In March 2009, Samuel Thamar James was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii). On July 17, 2009, the government filed an information and notice of prior convictions, pursuant to \u00a7 21 U.S.C. 851(a), alleging that James had two prior convictions, one for delivery and possession of cocaine and the other for possession of cocaine with-intent to distribute. James did not contest either of the convictions alleged in the government\u2019s information. A jury found James guilty of the lesser-included offense of possession with the intent to distribute less than five grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-17\">The facts presented at trial were that on February 9, 2009, while in the process of attempting to stop a car that had an illegal window tint, an officer of the Tampa Police Department observed a black man with medium-length dreadlocks, wearing a black shirt, lean out the driver\u2019s side door and drop a plastic bag containing a white substance in a driveway. After the car came to a permanent stop, the officer identified James as both the driver of the vehicle and the person who dropped the plastic bag, based on his black shirt and dreadlocks. Testing revealed that the plastic bag contained 5.8 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-18\">Before trial, Defendant and the government submitted proposed jury instructions to the district court. The government\u2019s instructions included a definition of reasonable doubt identical to this Circuit\u2019s Pattern Jury Instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> James submitted two possible definitions of reasonable doubt. The first was an excerpt from the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>tions, reading \u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof of such a convincing character that you would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of your own affairs.\u201d James\u2019s alternative definition of reasonable doubt was the same Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction submitted by the government, which also included the above quoted language. The district court, after reviewing the parties\u2019 proposed instructions, prepared preliminary draft instructions. James\u2019s counsel reviewed the draft instructions and stated that he had no objections. The district court instructed the jury using the reasonable doubt standard from the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, which had been both proposed and approved by James. Those instructions read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-4\">Now, the United States has the burden of proof, of proving a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And if it fails to do so, you must find that defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-5\">But while the United States\u2019 burden of proof is a strict or heavy burden, it is not necessary that a defendant\u2019s guilt be proved beyond all possible doubt. It is only required that the United States\u2019 prove [sic] \u2014 proof exclude any reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-9\">A reasonable doubt is a real doubt based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-10\">Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof of such a convincing character that you would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of your own affairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-11\">If you are convinced that the defendant has been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, then during your deliberations you should say so. If you are not sufficiently convinced by the evidence, then during your deliberations you should say so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1394-12\">After the court instructed the jury, the court called counsel to sidebar and asked, \u201cDid I give an instruction that I said I would omit or otherwise err in the instructions?\u201d James\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d James\u2019s counsel later relied upon the phrase \u201cproof of such a convincing character that you would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of your own affairs,\u201d in closing argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-13\">During deliberations, the jury sent back a note with the question, \u201cIf we have, believe [sic], there is a possible doubt, should we return a verdict of guilty?,\u201d and the court responded with a supplemental instruction, reiterating its original reasonable doubt instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> James objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>the court\u2019s response to the jury, essentially requesting that the court repeat its original reasonable doubt instruction exactly, including the last paragraph of the pattern instructions, the \u201csubjective component.\u201d The court overruled this objection because the jury had requested an instruction on \u201cpossible doubt,\u201d rather than a mere repetition of the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">The jury found James guilty of possession with intent to distribute less than five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). The written judgment, filed in the case erroneously, indicated that James was convicted of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the judge asked whether James had any objections to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), and his counsel responded that James did not stipulate to the facts presented as to the instant case but that they had no objections in any other respects to the PSI. The judge then asked Mr. James, \u201cDo you understand that it\u2019s these drug trafficking offenses that are hurting you here today, not the one you got convicted for, and the two \u2014 the trial in my court and then the two other convictions you have for selling?,\u201d and Mr. James responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">\n<em>II. Reasonable Doubt Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">\u201cWe review jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1248 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (internal quotations omitted). However, where the defendant has failed to object to the instruction in the district court, we will review for plain error only. <em>Id. </em>at 1248. Furthermore, \u201c[u]nder the invited error doctrine, we will generally not review an error induced or invited by a party through the submission of an incorrect jury instruction to the judge which passed on to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the response of the district court to questions from the jury for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1107 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">Pursuant to the invited-error doctrine, because James not only failed to object to the reasonable doubt instruction in the district court but also submitted the very instruction he now challenges, we need not review his argument on appeal. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, his argument is without merit because we have repeatedly approved of the definition of reasonable doubt provided in the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions. <em>See, e.g., Hansen, </em>262 F.3d at 1249-50 (affirming jury instructions that defined proof beyond a reasonable doubt as \u201cproof of such a convincing character that you would be willing to rely or act upon it without hesitation in a decision involving the most important of your affairs\u201d and stated that \u201cit is not necessary that a Defendant\u2019s guilt be proved beyond all possible doubt. It is only required that the Government\u2019s proof exclude any \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 concerning a Defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d); <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>986 F.2d 451, 457-58, <em>opinion readopted on reh\u2019g, </em>5 F.3d 495, 496 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (rejecting a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>dant\u2019s argument that the \u201cwilling to act\u201d language in this Circuit\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction impermissibly lowers the government\u2019s burden of proof); <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>643 F.2d 1071, 1074-75 (5th Cir.1981) (finding no error in the jury instruction, \u201c[pjroof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that you would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of your own affairs\u201d). Thus, the district court\u2019s jury instructions were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">Furthermore, James\u2019s challenge to the supplemental instructions provided in response to the jury\u2019s question about \u201cpossible doubt\u201d is vague and wholly without merit. The district court\u2019s supplemental instructions were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">\n<em>III. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">James next argues that his sentence must be vacated because the district court failed to follow the proper procedure dictated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b). Appellant argues that strict compliance with the mandatory language of \u00a7 851(a) and (b) is required by our circuit precedent. James acknowledges that this Court does not automatically reverse a district court for failure to conduct the \u00a7 851(b) colloquy, but argues that despite the holding of <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>905 F.2d 1466 (11th Cir. 1990), his sentence must be reversed because, unlike the defendant in <em>Weaver, </em>his convictions were less than five years old and thus were not barred from challenge under \u00a7 851(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">\u201c[F]or the court to exercise jurisdiction to impose an enhanced sentence based on prior convictions ... the government must comply with the procedural requirements of Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.\u201d <em>United States v. Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998). Under \u00a7 851, the government is required to file and serve an information, stating the prior convictions on which it seeks to rely to enhance the sentence. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a). Once the information is filed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-9\">the [district] court shall after conviction but before pronouncement of sentence inquire of the person with respect to whom the information was filed whether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information, and shall inform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 851(b). If the defendant denies any allegation contained in the information or claims that any conviction alleged is invalid, he must file a written response to the information. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 851(c)(1). The district court then must \u201chold a hearing to determine any issues raised by the response which would except the person from increased punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the defendant does not respond to the information, the court will proceed to sentencing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 851(d)(1). Finally, under \u00a7 851(e): \u201cNo person who stands convicted of an offense under this part may challenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-11\">In <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>905 F.2d 1466, 1480 (11th Cir.1990), a consolidated case with two appellants, one of the two appellants, Sikes, appealed the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, based on a prior drug conviction. Sikes contended that the government failed to give adequate and timely notice of its intent to rely on a prior conviction as required by \u00a7 851(a), and that the district court failed to comply with \u00a7 851(b) because it did not inform him that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>required to challenge the validity of any prior convictions underlying the enhancement of his sentence and failed to inquire whether he affirmed or denied the prior drug conviction alleged in the information. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">The <em>Weaver </em>Court first stated that \u201c[t]his circuit has insisted upon <em>strict compliance </em>with the mandatory language of the procedural requirements of section 851(a) and (b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1481 (emphasis added) (citing <em>United States v. Noland, </em>495 F.2d 529, 533 (5th Cir.1974); <em>United States v. Cevallos, </em>538 F.2d 1122, 1126-27 (5th Cir.1976)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the Court immediately followed this statement by explaining that \u201c[t]his is particularly true with respect to the timing of the government\u2019s filing with the court and service on the defendant of an information signifying the government\u2019s intent to rely on a prior drug conviction,\u201d <em>id., </em>thus referring solely to \u00a7 851(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">Within that same paragraph, <em>Weaver </em>stated that the doctrine of harmless error does not apply to failures to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 851. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cSignificantly, \u2018[t]he doctrine of harmless error does not apply\u2019 with respect to failures to follow the statutory scheme of \u00a7 851.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Olson, </em>716 F.2d 850, 852 (11th Cir.1983))). It is clear that this statement was referring to \u00a7 851(a), not \u00a7 851(b). For the reasons set forth below, we hold that this quotation from <em>Weaver </em>applies only to \u00a7 851(a), and not to \u00a7 851(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">After concluding that the district court had complied with the strict compliance standard of \u00a7 851(a), the Weaker Court moved to the \u00a7 851(b) challenge, the most relevant part of <em>Weaver </em>for the instant case. Sikes argued that his sentence was improper because the district court failed to inquire whether he affirmed or denied the prior drug conviction alleged in the information filed by the government, as required by \u00a7 851(b). <em>Id. </em>at 1481-82. The sentencing transcript revealed that \u201cthe district court did not specifically ask Sikes whether he had been previously convicted,\u201d but that this omission was \u201cunderstandable when considered in context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1482. The Court outlined a series of instances in which Sikes and his counsel implicitly affirmed the prior conviction: Sikes\u2019 counsel admitted that Sikes had a prior drug conviction during opening statement; when the court reviewed the PSI during the sentencing proceeding, which discussed both the prior arrests and the prior convictions alleged in the government\u2019s information, Sikes\u2019 counsel stated that the \u201ccourt should not take into consideration anything other than convictions\u201d; during the sentencing proceeding, Sikes\u2019 counsel argued that the prior arrests should be stricken and that the PSI should state only \u201cthe number of convictions\u201d; and the court discussed doubling Sikes\u2019 sentence as a result of a conviction that occurred while Sikes was out on bond and his counsel did not object. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Weaver </em>court ultimately concluded that \u201c[n]ot only did Sikes fail to object to the prior convictions contained in the PSI, but, by implication, he agreed that the prior convictions stated in the PSI were correct. Thus, far from challenging the prior convictions, Sikes\u2019 counsel all but affirmed Sikes\u2019 previous drug convictions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">Additionally, because Sikes\u2019 prior convictions were more than five years old, any challenge to their validity was barred by \u00a7 851(e). <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that \u201c[a] trial court is not required \u2018to adhere to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>the rituals of \u00a7 851(b) where a defendant, as a matter of law, is precluded from attacking the conviction forming the basis of the enhancement information/ \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Nanez, </em>694 F.2d 405, 413 (5th Cir.1982)). Thus, we also upheld Sikes\u2019 enhanced sentence because it would not \u201cbe subject to successful attack in this appeal <em>even if that court had not done all it was required to do under the statute.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">We believe that <em>Weaver </em>has two separate and independent holdings. <em>Weaver </em>first held that where \u00a7 851(a) is complied with and a defendant is properly apprised of the underlying convictions considered to enhance his sentence, substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) is sufficient. Second, <em>Weaver </em>held that where \u00a7 851(e) bars any challenge to the validity of a conviction, a trial court is not required to conduct the \u00a7 851(b) colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">While it is true that this Circuit\u2019s precedent had indicated that substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) might be insufficient, that precedent did not preclude <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>holding that substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) is in fact sufficient, or that use of the harmless error standard in relation to such challenges is appropriate. The cases which indicated that substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) might not be suffi<em>cient </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. Garcia, </em>526 F.2d 958, 961 (5th Cir.1976), and <em>United States v. Cevallos, </em>538 F.2d 1122, 1126-27 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.1976) \u2014 both made these statements in dicta only. <em>Garcia </em>merely expressed doubt that substantial compliance would be sufficient, rather than issuing a holding about substantial compliance. <em>See Garcia, </em>526 F.2d at 961 (\u201c[I]t is doubtful that a substantial compliance [with \u00a7 851(b)] would suffice.\u201d). Moreover, the Court indicated that there had not even been substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) because Garcia never admitted to having been convicted of the offense identified in the \u00a7 851(a) notice. <em>See id. </em>at 961 (\u201cIf Garcia\u2019s admission of a narcotics conviction identified it as the offense set forth in the information it could be plausibly urged that there was a substantial compliance with the statute. But there was no identity of offenses.\u201d). Then, in <em>Cevallos </em>the district court failed to comply with \u00a7 851(b) completely. <em>Cevallos, </em>538 F.2d at 1127. Cevallos also asserted that the conviction relied on to enhance his sentence was invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 1125. While the Court noted that <em>Garcia </em>had indicated that it was doubtful whether substantial compliance would suffice, <em>Cevallos </em>also issued no holding on the issue, instead holding that there had not been substantial compliance at all. <em>Id. </em>at 1126-27 (\u201cIn <em>Garcia </em>the non-compliance with \u00a7 851(b) was much less egregious than the complete failure to comply with \u00a7 851(b) in the case before us. On the doubtful possibility that substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) would suffice, there was no such compliance here. In sentencing petitioner the District Court completely failed to comply with \u00a7 851(b), which is a prerequisite to the imposition of an enhanced sentence.\u201d) (footnote omitted). Thus, both <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Cevallos </em>involve fact situations that the Court perceived as not rising to the level of substantial compliance. Accordingly, neither case precludes <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>alternative holding that substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) is sufficient where \u00a7 851(a) has been fully complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\">In an opinion issued just two years after <em>Weaver, </em>the Fifth Circuit, which issued both the <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Cevallos </em>opinions, made clear that the statements regarding substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) in each of those two opinions were dicta. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>954 F.2d 273, 277 (5th Cir.1992). In that case, the defendant appealed his enhanced sentence, arguing that the district court failed to strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>comply with \u00a7 851(b), as required by <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Cevallos. Id. </em>at 276. The court responded: \u201cAlthough the two Fifth Circuit cases upon which Garcia relies suggest that substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) is insufficient, <em>the statements in both cases are no more than dicta.\u201d Id. </em>at 277 (emphasis added). The court \u201cconsider[ed] more significant in th[e] case the fact that Garcia never revealed ... the basis for any challenge to his prior convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He did not utilize \u00a7 851(c) procedures available to him to notify the court and the government of the substance of any challenge, nor did he argue that he would have raised any challenge to the prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 277-78. The court addressed the exact issue that Appellant in this case raises and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-5\">While \u00a7 851(e) would not bar a challenge to either of the prior convictions alleged in the information in this case, we find that Garcia\u2019s conduct has the same effect as the \u00a7 851(e) bar in <em>Nanez. </em>Garcia\u2019s failure to comply with the procedures of \u00a7 851(c), when coupled with the absence of any suggestion by Garcia (to this court or the district court) that the judge\u2019s omission precluded him from presenting a specific challenge to one or both of the prior convictions, renders harmless the judge\u2019s failure to comply with the warning component of \u00a7 851(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">In addition to the fact that the statements regarding substantial compliance were dicta, both <em>Cevallos </em>and the 1976 <em>Garcia </em>decision occurred prior to the enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines, and, thus, the defendants did not have PSIs specifically identifying their prior offenses. Now, following the enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines, a PSI is prepared for each defendant, which is reviewed both prior to and during the sentencing proceeding. Although we have not specifically stated that the advent of PSIs alone impacts what is required of a court under \u00a7 851(b), we have recognized the role of the PSI in making clear to a defendant what, if any, prior convictions have been attributed to him. <em>See Weaver, </em>905 F.2d at 1482.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-9\">In the years since <em>Weaver </em>was published in 1990, we have published opinions following the second of the two separate and independent <em>Weaver </em>holdings mentioned above \u2014 i.e., that a trial court\u2019s failure to conduct the \u00a7 851(b) colloquy is not reversible where \u00a7 851(e) bars any challenge to the conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cBecause this provision precluded Williams from challenging the prior convictions \u2018as a matter of law,\u2019 the district court was \u2018not required to adhere to the rituals of \u00a7 851(b).\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Weaver, </em>905 F.2d at 1482)); <em>United States v. Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d 1329, 1334 n. 2 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cAlthough the district court failed to so inquire of the Defendant at the sentencing hearing, Cespedes made no claim regarding this omission on appeal, nor could he do so since his prior conviction occurred more than five years before the date of the information. \u2018A trial court is not required to adhere to the rituals of \u00a7 851(b) where a defendant, as a matter of law, is precluded from attacking the conviction forming the basis of the enhancement information.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citation omitted) (quoting <em>Weaver, </em>905 F.2d at 1482).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-10\">Although we have not published an opinion following the other <em>Weaver </em>holding \u2014 i.e., that substantial compliance with \u00a7 851(b) is sufficient where \u00a7 851(a) is fully complied with and a defendant is timely apprised of the underlying convictions to be considered to enhance his sentence \u2014 we do so today. This holding is not only sufficiently clear in <em>Weaver </em>itself, but a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>number of our sister circuits have also held that failure to comply strictly with \u00a7 851(b) is harmless error, even where a defendant could have challenged their pri- or convictions under \u00a7 851(e). <em>United States v. Severino, </em>316 F.3d 939, 948 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cSeverino admitted \u2014 more than once \u2014 that he had no way to challenge the validity of the prior conviction....

Flowers, </em>464 F.3d 1127 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Harwood, </em>998 F.2d 91, 100-01 (2nd Cir.1993) (holding that where the government filed an information identifying the conviction relied upon to enhance defendant\u2019s sentence and counsel told the court that the defendant did not dispute the conviction, \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s sentencing ritual here complied with the requirements of \u00a7 851(b)\u201d); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>980 F.2d 245, 252 (4th Cir.1992) (\u201cAlthough the trial record does not contain a colloquy in which the district court specifically addressed each of the issues in section 851(b), we nevertheless conclude that the substantive protections underlying that subsection were provided to Campbell in this ease.\u201d) (footnotes omitted); <em>Garcia, </em>954 F.2d 273, 278 (5th Cir.1992) (district court\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 851(b) is harmless although \u00a7 851(e) would not bar challenge of the prior convictions because defendant did not comply with \u00a7 851(c) and did not suggest that he had a valid challenge to the prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-6\">James has never claimed that his prior convictions listed in the information and PSI are in any way invalid, nor has he ever disputed that the two convictions cited by the government are in fact his. James did not file a written response under \u00a7 851(c) contesting the United States\u2019 properly filed information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After conviction, James did not object to the PSI\u2019s description of his prior convictions or to the enhancement of his sentence based on those prior convictions. At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked James, \u201cDo you understand that it\u2019s these drug trafficking offenses that are hurting you here today, not the one you got convicted for, and the two \u2014 the trial in my court and then the two other convictions you have for selling?,\u201d referring to the prior convictions listed in the PSI. James replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>As James\u2019s convictions were fewer than five years old, he was not barred from challenging them under \u00a7 851(e), unlike the defendant in <em>Weaver. </em>However, the district court enhanced James\u2019s sentence based on prior convictions clearly delineated and described in the \u00a7 851 notice (in full compliance with \u00a7 851(a)) and also in the PSI, to which the court specifically directed James\u2019s attention during the sentencing hearing. Thus, like the defendant in <em>Weaver, </em>James \u201call but affirmed\u201d his prior convictions by failing to object to their use in the PSI\u2019s sentence calculation and by confirming their existence at sentencing when the district court referenced them as the reason for the severity of his sentence. Our review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court adequately discussed with James and his counsel the underlying convictions that were the basis of his enhanced sentence and gave ample opportunity for any objection. Rather than object, James indicated that the convictions were accurate throughout pre-trial, trial, and sentencing proceedings. Any error in not specifically asking whether he affirmed or denied the convictions was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">\n<em>TV. Prior Convictions Were Properly Considered for Sentence Enhancement Purposes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">Binding precedent forecloses James\u2019s argument that the district court erred by enhancing his statutory maximum based on prior convictions not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1223-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that prior convictions \u201crelevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime\u201d do not need to be charged in an indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt). James concedes this point but contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is wrongly decided. However, <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding precedent. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that \u201cother than the fact of a prior conviction\u201d any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and explicitly stating that the Court\u2019s holding did not affect the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres). </em>We have stated that \u201cwe are bound by <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-8\">The district court followed binding precedent and did not err in enhancing James\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-9\">\n<em>V.
