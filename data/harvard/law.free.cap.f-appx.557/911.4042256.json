On November 17, 2006, the District Court, finding that Taylor qualified as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) \u2014 because he had three pri- or convictions of a violent felony, i.e., two burglary convictions and a conviction for injury to child \u2014 sentenced him to prison for a term of 260 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taylor appealed his sentence. He argued that the District Court improperly enhanced his sentence under the ACCA. In doing so, he conceded (by not raising the issue) that the three convictions on which the District Court based its armed career criminal finding qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA. The Fifth Circuit rejected his argument and affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>263 FedAppx. 402, 2008 WL 189986 (C.A.5 (Tex.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">On June 1, 2009, Taylor moved the sentencing court to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, presenting an argument that he had not presented on direct appeal; he claimed that neither of his burglary convictions qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA. Although he had been charged with burglary of habitation, a' crime of violence, he had pled guilty to burglary of a building, which was not a crime of violence according to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584 (5th Cir.2008). The court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that he had procedurally defaulted his claim and had not established cause for failing to raise it on direct appeal. Taylor attempted to appeal the ruling, but both the sentencing court and the Court of Appeals denied his application for a certificate of appealability. Taylor then returned to the sentencing court with a \u201cmotion to correct illegal sentence.\u201d The court treated it as a second \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">On August 20, 2010, Taylor, invoking the savings claims of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>tioned the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing that he was actually and legally innocent of his ACCA sentencing enhancement. Citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>609 F.3d 1159 (11th Cir. 2010), <em>rev\u2019d by Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), Taylor argued that his two burglary convictions, which were obtained under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), though violent felonies at the time of the convictions, <em>see United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 161\u2014 62 (5th Cir.1992) (holding that a conviction under \u00a7 30.02 was a violent felony), no longer constituted violent felonies; the <em>Constante </em>decision had so declared. The District Court, relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Williams v. Warden, Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir. 2013), denied Taylor\u2019s petition because Taylor had presented his argument to his sentencing court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and they had rejected it. <em>Taylor v. Augustine, </em>2013 WL 3214971 (N.D.Fla.). Taylor now appeals the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">On appeal, Taylor argues that he was entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because, at the time of his conviction and his direct appeal, <em>United States v. Silva </em>foreclosed his argument that a conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) was not a violent felony. Taylor contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), was retroactively applicable and required the overturning <em>Silva, </em>as the Fifth Circuit recognized in <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 584. Therefore, since his prior convictions under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) were no longer violent felonies, he should be resentenced without the ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause. <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337. Pursuant to \u00a7 2255(a), a federal prisoner may move his sentencing court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence on the ground Taylor asserts \u2014 that the sentence was in excess of the statutory maximum. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Although a prisoner may not file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion without permission from the court of appeals, 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2255(h), a prisoner who is otherwise barred from filing a second or successive motion to vacate may challenge his custody in a \u00a7 2241 petition if it \u201cappears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">We have emphasized that a federal prisoner may not rely on the savings clause in order to escape the ban on second and successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1323 (concluding that the savings clause did not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2441 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by the rule respecting second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, that the Sentencing Guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence that did not exceed the statutory maximum). However, in <em>Gilbert, </em>we left open the possibility that a claim involving a \u201cpure <em>Begay </em>error,\u201d defined as an error in the application of the \u201cviolent felony\u201d enhancement in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), could be brought under the savings clause, noting that the ACCA enhancement raised the defendant\u2019s statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>ry minimum and maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1319 n. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">In <em>Williams, </em>we stated that a claim under the savings clause (1) must be based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, and (2) the decision must have overturned a circuit precedent that squarely barred the claim so that the petitioner had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343 (citing <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir. 1999)). The prisoner in <em>Williams </em>could not avail himself of the savings clause because he was unable to identify a case that squarely foreclosed him from objecting on direct appeal or collateral attack to the classification of his prior burglary convictions as violent felonies. <em>Id. </em>at 1343-45. In so holding, we concluded that, to succeed on a <em>Begay </em>claim, the prisoner was required to show that <em>Begay </em>had overturned circuit precedent that specifically addressed the conviction at issue, not just that <em>Begay </em>had altered the relevant legal analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 1346-47. Moreover, we emphasized that <em>Begay </em>did not abrogate all of our <em>gre-Begay </em>holdings as to what constitutes a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1347. We also held that the availability of the savings clause was a jurisdictional issue, such that claims that do not meet the requirements of the savings clause must be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1337-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Under the ACCA, a defendant receives an enhanced sentence if he is (1) convicted under \u00a7 922(g); and (2) has three prior convictions for a violent felony, a serious drug offense, or both, that were committed on occasions different from one another. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The statute defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as either (1) a crime that has as an element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (2) burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime that otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, (ii). <em>Begay </em>involved the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of this definition, as it determined whether the crime of driving under the influence involved conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 141-45, 128 S.Ct. at 1584-86 (indicating that, to fall under the residual clause, the crime must be purposeful, violent, and aggressive).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Under \u00a7 30.02 of the Texas Penal Code, a person commits the offense of burglary if the person (1) enters a habitation or a building not then open to the public with the intent to commit a felony, theft, or assault; (2) remains concealed in a building or habitation with the intent to commit a felony, theft, or assault; or (3) enters a building or habitation and commits or attempts to commit a felony, theft, or assault. Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a). In <em>Silva, </em>the Fifth Circuit upheld the ACCA enhancement where the defendant previously had been convicted of two counts of burglary of a habitation and one count of burglary of a building, all under \u00a7 30.02, but the court did not indicate the subsection under which the defendant had been convicted. <em>Silva, </em>957 F.2d at 161-62. The court relied on <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599,110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (defining a generic burglary that constitutes a predicate ACCA offense), to conclude that \u00a7 30.02 was a generic burglary statute that punished nonconsensual entry into a building with the intent to commit a crime, such that all of Silva\u2019s prior burglary convictions were predicate convictions justifying the ACCA enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">In <em>Constante, </em>the Fifth Circuit stated that it had never determined whether a conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) constituted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>generic burglary that would sustain the ACCA enhancement. <em>Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 585. Acknowledging that <em>Silva </em>had determined that a conviction under \u00a7 30.02 constituted a violent felony for ACCA purposes, the court stated that <em>Silva, </em>by necessity, had to refer only to \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) because that is the only section of the statute with a specific intent requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 585-86. The court determined that a conviction under \u00a7 30.03(a)(3) could not support the ACCA enhancement because it was not a generic burglary under <em>Taylor. Id. </em>at 586-87. Notably, the <em>Constante </em>panel did not rely on <em>Begay </em>or its progeny. <em>See Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 585-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">We conclude that Taylor has failed to establish on appeal that binding circuit precedent \u201csquarely foreclosed\u201d him from raising his claim on direct appeal or in his previous \u00a7 2255 motion, or that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturned the relevant precedent. Accordingly, Taylor has not satisfied the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-10\">. The ACCA subjects a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) to a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if he has three prior convictions for \"a violent felony or a serious drug offense, of both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). In addition to the convictions noted in the text, Taylor had been convicted of possession of cocaine. The court concluded that such was not a serious drug offense; hence, that conviction is not relevant here. The sentence range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines in the instant case was 235-293 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-15\">.
