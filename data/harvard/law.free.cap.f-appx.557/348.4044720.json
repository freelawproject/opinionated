Pena argues that the district court prevented him from arguing that he was entitled to a safety-valve adjustment and a minor-role adjustment. This argument is factually incorrect because the district court allowed him to make these arguments at the sentencing hearing. In any event, Pena has not shown that, given his admitted lies in court, the denials of the safety-valve adjustment and minor-role adjustment were clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
