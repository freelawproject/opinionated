Simmons raises multiple claims of error. First, he contends the evidence was insufficient to show that he believed he was communicating with a minor or that he attempted to entice her to in engage in sexual activity. Simmons also argues the Government entrapped him and otherwise engaged in \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d throughout its investigation. Finally, Simmons also challenges the district court\u2019s admission of certain evidence. Upon review, we reject Simmons\u2019 arguments and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\"><em>A. Sufficiency of the </em>Evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">In arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, Simmons points to a number of facts he contends undermine the Government\u2019s case. For example, Simmons argues a text message he sent on his way to meet \u201cRebecca,\u201d the fictitious \u201cvictim\u201d invented by the Government as part of its investigation, demonstrates that he did not believe she was a minor. Specifically, Simmons set \u201cRebecca\u201d a text that read, \u201cI\u2019m just sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>prised that you\u2019re 18 and you still haven\u2019t had sex.\u201d He also points to an adults-only notice posted on the website through which he communicated with \u201cRebecca.\u201d However, in their second communication, \u201cRebecca\u201d told Simmons that she was 14 years old and asked whether that was okay. Simmons responded that it was and that he \u201ceonnect[ed] better with younger people.\u201d On various occasions, Simmons also asked \u201cRebecca\u201d why she was not in school at a given time, what grade she was in,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or why she was up so late. These facts provided a sufficient basis for the jury\u2019s finding that Simmons believed \u201cRebecca\u201d was a minor. The countervailing facts Simmons emphasizes show merely that the jury might have reached other reasonable results. They do not show that no reasonable jury could have convicted Simmons, which is the standard required for a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 840-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Similar reasoning applies to Simmons argument that the evidence was insufficient to show that he attempted to entice \u201cRebecca.\u201d Simmons suggests that evidence shows that \u201cRebecca\u201d was, in fact, enticing him rather than the other way around. However, early in their communications, \u201cRebecca\u201d expressed concern about her age and sexual inexperience. Simmons assured \u201cRebecca\u201d that her age was not a problem and that he would \u201clove to help teach\u201d her about sex. These sorts of assurances are a sufficient form of enticement under \u00a7 2422(b). <em>See United States v. Yost, </em>479 F.3d 815, 819-20 (11th Cir.2007). Accordingly, even if other reasonable interpretations of the evidence were impossible, Simmons has not shown that a reasonable jury could not have convicted him beyond a reasonable doubt, and his sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">\n<em>B. Entrapment &amp; Outrageous Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">An entrapment defense requires (1) government inducement of the crime and (2) the defendant\u2019s lack of predisposition to commit the crime before the inducement. <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1178 (11th Cir.2007). Because Simmons did not present entrapment or outrageous-conduct arguments to the district court or rely them his motion for a judgment of acquittal, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Hunerlach, </em>197 F.3d 1059, 1068 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Simmons\u2019 entrapment arguments fail because he has done no more than show \u201cthe government\u2019s mere suggestion of a crime or initiation of contacts which] is not enough.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>43 F.3d 618, 623 (11th Cir.1995). Simmons\u2019 Internet posting advertised his desire to participate in someone\u2019s first sexual experience, and when the Government responded as \u201cRebecca\u201d and asked at the outset whether it was okay that she was only 14 years old, Simmons responded that he was \u201cnot concerned over age.\u201d Simmons expressed enthusiasm at the prospect of \u201cteaching]\u201d \u201cRebecca,\u201d a fourteen year old, about sex in response to her concerns about her inexperience. Thus, while the Government provided the opportunity for Simmons to commit a crime, the evidence nevertheless demonstrated Simmons\u2019 own criminal predisposition, and Simmons cannot show that this predisposition was the product of anything amount<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>ing to \u201cexcessive pressure or manipulation of a non-criminal motive.\u201d <em>See id.; see also Jacobson v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 540, 549-50, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992) (\u201c[W]here the defendant is simply provided with the opportunity to commit a crime, the entrapment defense is of little use because the ready commission of the criminal act amply demonstrates the defendant\u2019s predisposition.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Simmons\u2019 claim of \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d is similarly unavailing. As a preliminary matter, we have \u201cnever acknowledged the existence of the outrageous government conduct doctrine,\u201d <em>United States v. Jayyousi, </em>657 F.3d 1085, 1111 (11th Cir. 2011), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 29, 183 L.Ed.2d 694 (2012), so it is doubtful that the district court\u2019s failure to overturn Simmons\u2019 conviction based on outrageous government conduct could constitute plain error. More fundamentally, Simmons has not shown that the Government\u2019s conduct was outrageous. Simmons\u2019 argument that the Government acted outrageously, which largely echoes his entrapment argument, does not show any conduct that violates \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d or is \u201cshocking to [a] universal sense of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, this argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">\n<em>C. Evidentiary Objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">Last, Simmons argues the district court\u2019s admission of an exhibit consisting of six-pages of notes of the police\u2019s post-arrest interview with Simmons was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Simmons argues the interview notes, taken on a prepared form, prejudiced him because they (1) suggested that Simmons spoke with an actual child, (2) implied that Simmons lied because some of the answers written contradicted each other, and (3) contained references to child pornography even though there was no evidentiary connection between Simmons and any pornographic material.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Assuming the district court admitted the interview notes in error, this error was harmless. The notes contained no incriminating evidence beyond the otherwise-admissible answers Simmons gave in his post-arrest interview. The notes\u2019 reference to \u201cRebecca\u201d as a \u201cchild\u201d was not prejudicial because, given the overall evidence, there was little chance the notes would cause the jury to believe an actual child was involved in the case. Similarly, the references to child pornography were likely not prejudicial, because the notes specifically indicate that Simmons said he did not possess any child pornography. Last, there is no indication that the unspecified contradictions the notes attributed to Simmons undermined his credibility and thereby substantially influenced the outcome of the case. Consequently, nothing about the admission the exhibit calls the verdict into grave doubt, and any error in its admission was harmless. <em>See Henderson, </em>409 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\">.
