Migliaccio, formerly federal prisoner # 21219-013, was convicted in the District of Colorado of several felony drug offenses and was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, in which he raised claims attacking those convictions. Migli-accio has recently been released from prison, but he remains subject to the remainder of his term of supervised release. His appeal is not moot. <em>See United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 355 (5th Cir. 2006). Because Migliaccio is proceeding under \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>a certif\u00edcate of appealability in order to appeal. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Migliaccio argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. He contends that \u00a7 2241 does not provide an independent source of jurisdiction and that, on the face of the record, there is a want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). \u201cWrits of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions.\u201d \u00a7 2241(a). Section 2241 \u201cprovides the general jurisdictional basis for federal courts to consider challenges to both state and federal judgments.\u201d <em>Story v. Collins, </em>920 F.2d 1247, 1250 (5th Cir.1991). In view of the foregoing, Migliaccio\u2019s assertion that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Migliaccio does not address the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to meet the requirements for challenging his convictions and sentences in a habeas petition under \u00a7 2241. Although we liberally construe pro se briefs, <em>see Haines v. Ker-ner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), arguments must be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to identify error in the district court\u2019s basis for dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition, Magliaccio has abandoned any challenge he might have raised regarding the dismissal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dali. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
