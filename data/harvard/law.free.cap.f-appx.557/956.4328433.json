United States, </em>112 Fed. Cl. 187 (Fed.Cl.2013), ECF No. 12. For the reasons set out below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b830-18\">Mr. Michelotti is the owner and inventor of U.S. Patent No. 6,023,221, entitled \u201cSystem to Activate Automobile Hazard Warning Lights.\u201d The '221 patent claims a system that automatically activates an automobile\u2019s hazard-warning lights when the system detects rapid deceleration indicative of sudden braking. The stated aim of the invention is to alert other drivers that there is an emergency situation (rather than normal, slow braking), thereby reducing rear-end collisions. <em>See, e.g., </em>'221 patent at col. 1, lines 6-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-19\">Mr. Michelotti states that embodiments of his invention\u2014known as Automatic Hazard Warning Lights, Emergency Stop Signals, or Adaptive Brakelights\u2014have been marketed by car manufacturers worldwide and have been endorsed by organizations such as the United Nations World Forum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>for Vehicle Harmonization. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1-2. Nevertheless, the system is prohibited in the United States under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, which requires stop lamps (brake lights) to be steady-burning rather than flashing, and which requires hazard-warning lights to be \u201cdriver controlled.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.108. In a letter to Mr. Michelotti dated February 15, 2001, the Acting Chief Counsel of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) advised Mr. Michelotti that the NHTSA \u201cinterprets \u2018driver controlled\u2019 as meaning that the hazard warning signal unit must be activated and deactivated by the driver and not by automatic means.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 7, <em>Michelotti v. United States, </em>Case No. 13-29 C (Fed.Cl. Jan. 14, 2013), ECF No. 1; Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 4, <em>Michelotti v. United States, </em>Case No. 13-29 C (Fed.Cl. Apr. 5, 2013), ECF No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Approximately ten years later, Mr. Michelotti contacted the NHTSA to ask that it reconsider Standard 108, and there apparently was some communication to the NHTSA showing the interest of Senator Bill Nelson in the idea. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The NHTSA responded to Senator Nelson in a letter dated April 6, 2012, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2h\">Mr. Michelotti stated that automatic hazard warning systems that are marketed outside of the United States are preventing accidents; however, NHTSA is not aware of any data to support this statement. NHTSA continues to be concerned that the \u201csignal message\u201d of lamps operating in this method may be confusing to some drivers, and therefore may increase crash risk. Without data to support Mr. Michelotti\u2019s safety benefit assertion, NHTSA is not currently pursuing a modification to our standard with respect to this pr[o]vision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Compl. \u00b6 11; Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 4. Mr. Michelotti contests the NHTSA\u2019s statement regarding lack of data, alleging that the agency\u2019s own internal studies support his safety claims. Compl. \u00b6 15; Appellant\u2019s Reply at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">On January 14, 2013, Mr. Michelotti brought this suit against the United States, claiming jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1491 and 1361 and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156. Compl. \u00b6 1. Mr. Michelotti alleged that the NHTSA was improperly \u201cdenying a potentially life-saving automobile safety system to the American People,\u201d was \u201cdenying to Plaintiff the rights and benefits of intellectual property ownership,\u201d and was \u201cexceeding the authority granted to it under the Highway Safety Act of 1970.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3,16. In his prayer for relief, Mr. Michelotti requested (a) an order requiring the NHTSA to provide proof that enhanced brake lighting systems may increase crash risk \u201cor, in the absence of such evidence or proof, to rescind the NHTSA prohibition against enhanced brake lighting systems\u201d; (b) if the prohibition is rescinded, an \u201corder requiring the United States Patent and Trademark Office to extend the term of U.S. Patent 6,023,221 for a period of time commensurate with time lost as a result of the NHTSA prohibition\u201d; and (c) \u201c[s]uch other and further relief to which the Plaintiff is entitled.\u201d Compl. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">The United States moved to dismiss Mr. Michelotti\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that Mr. Michelotti was not seeking money damages and, in any event, had not identified any \u201cprovision of law conferring a substantive right for money damages against the United States.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 5, 8. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Michelotti moved to amend his complaint to add a claim of patent infringement against the United States, for which he sought a monetary award of $10,100 \u201cor such greater amount as deemed appropriate by the Court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Pl.\u2019s Mot. to Am. Compl. \u00b6 4, <em>Michelotti v. United States, </em>Case No. 13-29 C (Fed.Cl. May 15, 2013), ECF No. 10. Mr. Michelotti based his infringement allegation on the NHTSA\u2019s January 30, 2006 grant of a temporary exemption from Standard 108 to Mercedes-Benz, allowing the company to sell up to 5,000 vehicles with flashing brake lights in the United States. PL\u2019s Mot. to Am. Compl. \u00b6 3; Mercedes-Benz, U.S.A. LLC, 71 Fed.Reg. 4961-01 (Dep\u2019t of Transp. Jan. 30, 2006) (grant of temp, exemption). In support of his motion, Mr. Michelotti cited a portion of the '221 patent stating that \u201c[although the invention has been described with respect to controlling the standard hazard warning lights on an automobile it is understood that it may control any vehicle light system for warning following vehicles.\u201d PL\u2019s Mot. to Am. Compl. \u00b6 4; '221 patent, col. 3, lines 63-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">On August 7, 2013, the Court of Federal Claims denied Mr. Michelotti\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. ECF No. 12 at 4-6. The court determined that \u201c[w]ith respect to a patent infringement claim against the government,\u201d the only even arguably relevant waiver of sovereign immunity \u201cis provided in money-mandating 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498,\u201d which allows compensation for the unlicensed use or manufacture of a patented invention by or for the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 5. But the court ruled that Mr. Michelotti neither invoked \u00a7 1498 nor alleged that the United States used or manufactured his invention, concluding that the alleged NHTSA grant of an exemption from Standard 108 to Mercedes-Benz was not within the scope of \u00a7 1498(a). <em>Id. </em>at 6. In addition, the court found the action barred by the court\u2019s six-year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, because Mr. Michelotti filed his complaint nearly seven years after the NHTSA granted the exemption in question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">After denying Mr. Michelotti\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, the Court of Federal Claims determined that none of his remaining allegations provided a basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court explained: jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, requires a separate money-mandating source of substantive law, but Mr. Michelotti had not identified any; jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 exists only in district courts; and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156, concerning patent term extensions, does not provide for judicial review and does not apply to the type of product covered by Mr. Michelotti\u2019s patent. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The court further held that the Highway Safety Act of 1970 (also cited in Mr. Michelotti\u2019s complaint) does not contain a provision for judicial review, much less in the Court of Federal Claims, and is not money-mandating. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The court stated that it need not address the United States\u2019s characterization of Mr. Michelotti\u2019s claims against the NHTSA as seeking \u201cessentially ... an Administrative Procedure Act (APA)-type review\u201d outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Finally, after concluding that it was without jurisdiction to hear Mr. Miehelotti\u2019s case, the Court of Federal Claims considered whether transfer to another court that might have jurisdiction over the claims would be appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 8; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. The court determined that transfer of Mr. Michelotti\u2019s claims to another court would not be in the interest of justice, as the court could not identify any basis to conclude that either the NHTSA or the PTO owed any duty of performance to Mr. Michelotti. ECF No. 12 at 8-9. Accordingly, the Court of Federal Claims entered judgment for the United States. Mr. Michelotti appeals, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s denial of Mr. Michelotti\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>for leave to amend his complaint for an abuse of discretion. <em>Renda Marine, Inc. v. United States, </em>509 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We agree with the Court of Federal Claims that the allegations in Mr. Miehelotti\u2019s amended complaint do not make out a claim of patent infringement against the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a). Even if Mr. Michelotti is correct that the brake lighting system installed in certain Mercedes-Benz vehicles infringes his patent, the NHTSA\u2019s grant of an exemption from Standard 108 so that Mercedes-Benz could sell such vehicles does not equate to use or manufacture of Mr. Michelotti\u2019s invention \u201cby or for the United States,\u201d as is required to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In his reply on appeal, Mr. Michelotti advances a new allegation that the United States used his invention in the course of conducting eleven studies on enhanced brake lighting systems. Appellant\u2019s Reply at 4. We need not consider whether such an allegation would have been sufficient to make out a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a), as Mr. Michelotti did not present this theory to the Court of Federal Claims. While Mr. Michelotti did refer to the NHTSA studies in his response to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, Pl.\u2019s Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 3, <em>Michelotti v. United States, </em>Case No. 13-29 C (Fed.Cl. Apr. 23, 2013), ECF No. 8, he never tied those studies to his patent infringement claim or alleged how the studies showed infringement when he mentioned them indirectly and in passing in his motion to amend. Thus, the Court of Federal Claims had no fair opportunity to consider Mr. Michelotti\u2019s new allegation. We note that the single document from the studies that he attached to his response to the motion to dismiss describes only government simulations of enhanced brake lighting systems, not any actual systems used or manufactured by or for the United States. <em>See </em>App. to PL\u2019s Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Because we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Mr. Michelotti\u2019s motion to amend, we affirm that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Michelotti\u2019s case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>709 F.3d 1114, 1115 (Fed.Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Mr. Michelotti invokes the Tucker Act. That statute confers jurisdiction, in a non-contract case, only where a separate constitutional provision, statute, or regulation creates a substantive right to recover money damages from the United States. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). The Act does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">Mr. Michelotti\u2019s first argument is that the NHTSA has \u201cden[ied] a potentially life-saving automobile safety system to the American People,\u201d Compl. \u00b62, which on appeal he contends implicates a constitutional \u201cright to life and protection from injury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3. This contention evidently invokes due process rights, but that is insufficient. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not money-mandating. <em>LeBlanc v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1995) (Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment was insufficient for jurisdiction because it does not mandate the payment of money by the government). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which Mr. Michelotti invokes on reply, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply at 8, does not apply to the federal government and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>is not money-mandating. <em>LeBlanc, </em>50 F.3d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Mr. Michelotti also contends that the NHTSA has \u201cdenfied] to Plaintiff the rights and benefits of intellectual property ownership.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 3. Although Mr. Michelotti\u2019s complaint does not specify a constitutional provision, statute, or regulation he believes was violated, to the extent he intended to make out a claim under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, he would have had to allege \u201cthat the government, by some specific action, took a private property interest for a public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>Adams v. United States, </em>391 F.3d 1212, 1218 (Fed.Cir.2004). Here, the United States has not taken any property interest belonging to Mr. Michelotti. Mr. Michelotti continues to hold the rights to the subject matter covered by the '221 patent. But a patent grants only exclusionary rights\u2014 that is, the right to preclude another from making, using, or selling the patented invention. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271. It does not provide a property right against independent statutory or regulatory safety-based prohibitions on making, using, or selling the invention. Thus, the NHTSA\u2019s promulgation of Standard 108, which bars automobiles in the United States from using a system like that claimed in the '221 patent, does not take Mr. Michelotti\u2019s patent rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Mr. Michelotti further alleges that the NHTSA \u201cexceed[ed] the authority granted to it under the Highway Safety Act of 1970.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 16. He states that the \u201cNHTSA is prohibiting the vehicle safety system in the United States based on little more than an unsupported assumption,\u201d and that the \u201cAdministrative Procedure Act requires the agency to base its rulings on facts and evidence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply at 2-3. These allegations also fail to establish any basis for jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims, because \u201cthe APA does not authorize an award of money damages.\u201d <em>Wopsock v. Natchees, </em>454 F.3d 1327, 1333 (Fed.Cir.2006). Thus, none of Mr. Michelotti\u2019s claims against the NHTSA provides a basis for Tucker Act jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">There is no other basis for jurisdiction. Mr. Michelotti\u2019s complaint invokes 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 as a basis for jurisdiction over his request to compel the NHTSA to comply with his demands. Compl. \u00b6 1. But, by its plain language, \u00a7 1361 grants jurisdiction only to \u201cdistrict courts\u201d (and is not money-mandating, so cannot indirectly support Tucker Act jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Jurisdiction can no more rest on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156, which provides for patent term extensions in certain cases. Mr. Michelotti requests an \u201corder requiring the United States Patent and Trademark Office to extend the term of U.S. Patent 6,023,221 for a period of time commensurate with time lost as a result of the NHTSA prohibition.\u201d Compl. at 1, 5. But \u00a7 156\u2014which applies only to drug products and certain medical device, food additive, or color additive products, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156(f)\u2014does not contain any provision for judicial review, much less in the Court of Federal Claims (and is not money-mandating, so cannot indirectly support Tucker Act jurisdiction).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Mr. Michelotti requests that, if we find his case beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims (as we do), we order his case \u201ctransferred to another court that is not so limited.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681, \u201cif it is in the interest of justice,\u201d a court may transfer an action or appeal \u201cto any other ... court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed.\u201d At bottom, Mr. Michelotti wishes to challenge the NHTSA\u2019s Standard 108. But, as to the order promulgating the relevant aspect of Standard 108, he makes no claim that he filed this suit within 59 days of that order, as required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30161(a). And as to any NHTSA decision regarding modifying the Standard, there is no final agency action subject to judicial review. <em>Air Brake Sys., Inc. v. Mineta, </em>357 F.3d 632, 646 (6th Cir.2004) (opinion letters from the NHTSA\u2019s Acting Chief Counsel did not constitute final agency action). Accordingly, transfer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Although we cannot, as Mr. Michelotti requests, \u201cremand this matter to the United States Department of Transportation for administrative review,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply at 9, Mr. Michelotti is still free to file a petition with the NHTSA requesting that Standard 108 be amended. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30162(a)(1); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 552.3. Should that petition be denied, judicial review in a designated court other than the Court of Federal Claims may then be available. <em>See, e.g., Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., </em>489 F.3d 1279, 1287 (D.C.Cir.2007); <em>Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC, </em>280 F.3d 1027, 1037 (D.C.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">No costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\">. Although Mr. Michelotti does not invoke it, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(b) also covers patent term extensions (for patents relating to all subject matters). But \u00a7 154(b) is limited to three narrow circumstances not present here; and it requires an application to the PTO before pursuing an appeal, which would not go to the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(b)(1), (3)-(4). The provision, moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>is not money-mandating, so would not indirectly support Tucker Act jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
