The IJ found Ruiz Ochoa removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), for being an alien who was convicted of acts which constituted the essential elements of a crimes involving moral turpitude. In petitioning this court for review, Ruiz Ochoa argues that the BIA, in determining whether he warranted a \u00a7 212(h) waiver as a matter of discretion, employed an incorrect legal standard by failing to articulate any \u201cmetric\u201d for comparing and weighing the positive and negative factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions about our subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 2007). We also review questions of law <em>de novo. De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006). In pertinent part, INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under\u201d certain immigration statutes, including 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), which provides for waivers of inadmissibility. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. This court does have jurisdiction, though, to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Ruiz Ochoa claims that the BIA applied an incorrect legal standard in evaluating whether he should be granted a waiver of inadmissibility; the standard was incorrect, he says, because the BIA failed to set forth a \u201cmetric\u201d for weighing the factors relevant to a determination under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). This presents a question of law; hence, we have jurisdiction to entertain Ruiz Ochoa\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">Section 212(a)(2) of the INA provides that individuals who have committed crimes of moral turpitude are inadmissible. INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)\u00ae\u00a9, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae\u00a9. Section 212(h)(1)(B) of the INA gives the Attorney General discretion to waive the application of \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse or parent of a U.S. citizen if the immigrant establishes that the denial of his admission will result in extreme hardship to the citizen. INA \u00a7 212(h)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">\u201c[T]he immigration judge is not bound by an inflexible test in determining whether to grant a ... waiver as a matter of discretion.\u201d <em>Coboume v. I.N.S., </em>779 F.2d 1564, 1566 (11th Cir.1986) (referring to the now-repealed INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>\u00a7 1182(c), which addressed a waiver of inadmissibility for lawful permanent residents returning to the United States after temporarily traveling abroad) (citing <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581, 584 (BIA 1978), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Matter of Edwards, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 191 (BIA 1990) (identifying the various positive and negative factors that should be balanced in determining whether an alien is eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver)); <em>see also Matter of Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 299-300 (applying the Marin factors to an application for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver). Instead, the IJ, and thus the BIA, \u201cmust balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien\u2019s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether\u201d granting a waiver is in the best interests of the United States. <em>Coboume, </em>779 F.2d at 1566-67 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">The BIA did not err by failing to articulate a metric for considering whether Ruiz Ochoa warranted a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. The BIA, like the IJ, balanced balanced the adverse factors against the positive equities Ruiz Ochoa presented in determining whether discretionary relief is warranted. <em>See Coboume, </em>779 F.2d at 1566-67 (citing <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 584). In its decision, the BIA cited to its prece-dential authority and identified the positive and negative factors to be weighed in determining whether Ruiz Ochoa was entitled to the relief he sought. The BIA recognized Ruiz Ochoa\u2019s \u201cpositive equities.\u201d BIA decision at 2. He had \u201ca long residence in this country,\u201d \u201cstrong family ties to this country, including his United States citizen wife, and three United States citizen children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He is a \u201cdevoted father,\u201d \u201cregularly paid his taxes and own[ed] a business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>His \u201cremoval would result in significant hardship to [his] wife and children.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">On the other side of the ledger, the BIA found that Ruiz Ochoa\u2019s case presented \u201csome significant negative factors, including [his] lengthy and troubling criminal history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He was arrested in 1996 for involvement with a forged check. <em>Id. </em>Over the course of 10 years, he [had] been arrested four times and convicted three times for driving under the influence of alcohol ... the fourth resulting] in a conviction for reckless driving and the revocation of his driver\u2019s license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. He had two arrests for \u201cfamily violence involving his wife.\u201d \u201cThese arrests resulted in a conviction for battery and a conviction for interference with a 911 emergency call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA agreed with the IJ that his \u201cuse of physical force against his wife constitute[d] a significant negative factor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The BIA concluded its balancing by saying that it was a \u201cclose case.\u201d It nonetheless agreed with the IJ \u201cthat the positive factors presented [were] insufficient to overcome the negative discretionary factors,\u201d <em>id., </em>and concluded that Ruiz Ochoa failed to establish eligibility for a section 212(h) waiver as a matter of discretion. <em>See Matter of Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; N. </em>Dec. at 299-301.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by Ruiz Ochoa\u2019s argument that BIA applied an incorrect standard in reaching this decision. His petition for review is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">.
