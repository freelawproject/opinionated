He claims, without citing anything in the record before us, that the IJ erroneously concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not exercise its prosecutorial discretion to terminate or defer his removal until he was ordered removed. Although he concedes that \u201cDHS never indicated that it intended to exercise [its] discretion\u201d in his case, Garcia nonetheless contends that he was denied due process because his circumstances warranted the exercise of prosecutorial discretion pursuant to a memorandum from John Morton, Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), that authorizes ICE attorneys to exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">We review the decision of the BIA unless the IJ\u2019s decision influenced the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). Since the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions, the IJ\u2019s findings are reviewable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Garcia\u2019s challenge to the exercise of DHS\u2019s prose-cutorial discretion to terminate or defer his removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). We have jurisdiction to review the denial of Garcia\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Nolos v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2010). However, Garcia does not address the IJ\u2019s finding that his motion to reopen was untimely, thereby waiving consideration of the issue. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). To the extent that Garcia argues that the IJ should have reopened the removal proceeding via his sua sponte authority, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s wholly discretionary refusal to do so. <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). Finally, Garcia cannot establish a due process violation related to his motion to reopen because \u201cthere is no liberty interest at stake in a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Garcia\u2019s petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
