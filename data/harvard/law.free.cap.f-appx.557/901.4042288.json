Ferrer, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Marlon Delano Moffett, Miami-Dade County Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Defendants-Appellees.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b924-8\">Before MARTIN, FAY, and EDMONDSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b924-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Christopher Troy Myles appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against Defendants Anthony Green, Jeptha Jackson, and Alexander Pi\u00f1ion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court determined that Myles failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">In his amended complaint, Myles alleged that, while he was confined at a Miami-Dade County correctional facility, correctional officers beat him for refusing to surrender a piece of clothing during a routine clothing purge. Myles asserted claims against Defendants for excessive force and for failure to intervene. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, concluding (among other things) that Myles failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">In Myles\u2019s first appeal, this Court determined that the district court analyzed the exhaustion issue under an incorrect standard. We vacated the district court\u2019s order and remanded for the district court to reconsider the exhaustion issue using the analytical framework established in <em>Bryant v. Rich, </em>530 F.3d 1368 (11th Cir. 2008), and <em>Turner v. Burnside, </em>541 F.3d 1077 (11th Cir.2008). <em>See Myles v. Miami-Dade Cnty. Corr. &amp; Rehab. Dep\u2019t, </em>476 Fed.Appx. 364 (11th Cir.2012) (unpublished). On remand, the district court dismissed Myles\u2019s complaint, determining that Myles failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPLRA\u201d), inmates are required to exhaust all available administrative remedies before filing a section 1983 action alleging excessive force. <em>Bryant, </em>530 F.3d at 1372 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)). This requirement is one that we cannot waive. <em>Id. </em>at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">Deciding a motion to dismiss<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>two-step inquiry. See <em>Turner, </em>541 F.Bd at 1082. \u201cFirst, the court looks to the factual allegations in the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and those in the plaintiffs response, and if they conflict, takes the plaintiffs version of the facts as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If, under the plaintiffs version of the facts, the defendant is entitled to have the complaint dismissed, the complaint must be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>If not, \u201cthe court then proceeds to make specific findings in order to resolve the disputed factual issues related to exhaustion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the light of the record, the court then decides, based on its factual findings, whether the inmate has exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 1088. Defendants bear the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. <em>Higgin-bottom v. Carter, </em>228 F.3d 1259, 1260 (11th Cir.2000). And we review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error. <em>Bryant, </em>530 F.3d at 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">That Myles never filed a grievance about the alleged beating pursuant to the prison\u2019s Inmate Grievance Procedure is undisputed. Myles argues, instead, that no grievance procedure was \u201cavailable\u201d for him to exhaust because prison staff members refused to provide him with the necessary grievance forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">According to Myles, he was placed on administrative confinement immediately following the beating. Although Myles made repeated requests for a grievance form to complain about the beating, various unnamed prison staff members denied his requests and told Myles incorrectly that he was not allowed to file a grievance while on administrative confinement. Myles contends that, because the time for filing a grievance expired while he was on administrative confinement, no grievance process was available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Accepting Myles\u2019s allegations as true, the district court concluded that Defendants had not yet shown that Myles\u2019s complaint was subject to dismissal. Following our guidance in <em>Bryant </em>and <em>Turner, </em>the district court looked at the record and then made specific findings about whether Myles was in fact prevented from using the inmate grievance process and determined that he was not. We are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d and, thus, see no clear error. <em>See Bryant, </em>530 F.3d at 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">The Metro Dade Department of Corrections has established a multi-step grievance procedure \u2014 applicable to all inmates, regardless of their status \u2014 that allows inmates to complain about the conditions of confinement. That Myles received a copy of the Inmate Grievance Procedure and was familiar with the grievance procedure before the beating occurred is undisputed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record also evidences that Myles filed successfully an unrelated grievance only a couple of weeks after the alleged beating incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Myles contends that, although he was able to file grievances after being released from administrative confinement, a grievance filed about the beating would have been denied as untimely because the time limit had already expired.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But \u201cthe ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>haustion requirement cannot be waived based upon the prisoner\u2019s belief that pursuing administrative procedures would be futile.\u201d <em>Higginbottom, </em>223 F.3d at 1261. The Inmate Grievance Procedure provides expressly that \u201c[o]n a case by case basis, the time limit at each level of the grievance procedure may be extended and the inmate informed.\u201d Nothing evidences that Myles attempted to file an out-of-time grievance or that he sought an extension of the time limit as provided for by the Inmate Grievance Procedure. Thus, Myles failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies and dismissal was proper. <em>See Harper v. Jenkin, </em>179 F.3d 1311, 1312 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\">. Myles also named Officers Angel Rivera, Luis Figueroa, and Eric McKnight as defendants. Because Myles does not challenge the dismissal of these three defendants on appeal, he has abandoned his claims against them. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-20\">. Although Defendants raised their failure-to-exhaust defense in motions for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>ment, we treat the issue as if it were raised in a motion to dismiss. <em>See Bryant, </em>530 F.3d at 1374-75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">. The record demonstrates that Myles filed successfully over 250 grievances between 2003 and 2008, both before and after the complained-of beating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b925-15\">. Myles does not contend either that he requested grievance forms to complain about the beating <em>after </em>he was released from admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>istrative custody or that such requests were denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b926-26\">. Because Myles\u2019s complaint was dismissed properly for failure to exhaust his available administrative remedies, we need not consider Myles's other arguments on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
