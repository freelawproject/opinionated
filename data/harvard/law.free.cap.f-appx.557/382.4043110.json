Tiner was convicted after he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. He argues that the district court erred when it upwardly departed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.S because the prior convictions on which the district court based its above-guidelines sentence were not similar to the instant conviction; nor were, they serious offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The record reflects, however, that the district court did not impose a sentence based on an upward departure as allowed by the Sentencing Guidelines but imposed a non-guidelines sentence, or variance, that was outside the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, Tiner\u2019s arguments about the district court\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 4A1.2 are inapposite. Moreover, Tiner has not adequately briefed a challenge to the upward variance. <em>Cf. Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 706-07; <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(8). Therefore, whether the district court\u2019s 120-month upward variance sentence was reasonable is arguably not properly before us. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 936 n. 2 (5th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Notwithstanding Tiner\u2019s inadequate briefing, we defer to the district court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and find that the sentence imposed was procedurally sound and substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 337 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The district court emphasized Tiner\u2019s recidivism, noting that when he was 18 years old he was given the benefit of the doubt and received deferred adjudication, yet he continued to offend, and ultimately received sentences. After serving a prison sentence, he was charged with more offenses for which he received no criminal history points. The district court referenced \u00a7 3553(a) and stated that in light of this history, it considered Tiner \u201ca very dangerous person\u201d and found that a \u201csignificant sentence\u201d was necessary to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Thus, the district court made an individualized assessment and concluded that the guidelines range gave insufficient weight to some of the sentencing factors. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708; \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s reasons for imposing a variance adequately reflect the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; the court addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and cited fact-specific reasons for imposing a non-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006). In light of the district court\u2019s explanations, the extent of the variance was reasonable. <em>See McElwee, </em>646 F.3d at 338; <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
