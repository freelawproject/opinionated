Goulas brought this suit charging his former employer, defendant-appellees LaGreca Services, Inc. (d/b/a LaGreca Transportation) and Charles P. LaGreca, Jr., with underpaying him in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act\u2019s (\u201cFLSA\u201d) overtime pay requirements. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). On summary judgment, the district court held that the FLSA\u2019s two-year, rather than three-year, statute of limitations applied because Goulas had not presented evidence sufficient to create a factual dispute as to whether there was a \u201cwillful violation\u201d of the FLSA. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 255(a). Then, after a bench trial, the district court held that there was no FLSA violation at all because Goulas was paid all of the overtime compensation that was due to him. Goulas appeals both determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">As for the statute-of-limitations issue, we agree with the district court that Gou-las failed to present evidence creating a factual dispute regarding whether there was a \u201cwillful violation\u201d of the FLSA. Gou-las presented evidence that he was paid $10 per hour for forty hours of work and $30 per hour for additional hours of work each week and he contended that such pay constitutes the sort of \u201csplit-day\u201d pay plan forbidden by the FLSA under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.501 and <em>Walling v. Helmerich &amp; Payne, </em>323 U.S. 37, 65 S.Ct. 11, 89 L.Ed. 29 (1944). The district court determined correctly that Goulas\u2019s evidence did not show such an impermissible \u201csplit-day\u201d pay plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">After the bench trial, the district court found that Goulas was paid \u201can hourly rate for hours up to 40 and a triple-time hourly rate for hours above 40,\u201d and the district court \u201c[saw] no reason to doubt the honesty of that scheme.\u201d The district court further found that, based on such rate, Goulas was paid all of the overtime compensation that was due. Goulas has shown no error, neither legal nor factual, with the district court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">. Goulas also contends that the district court erred in failing to determine whether he was exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime pay requirement because he was a \"bona fide executive\u201d at the company. 29 U.SC. \u00a7 213(a)(1). Because the district court determined that Goulas was paid all of the overtime pay that was due, there was no need to also determine whether Goulas was exempt from the overtime pay entitlement to begin with. The district court did not err.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
