United States, </em>113 Fed.Cl. 204 (2013). Because the Court of Federal Claims did not err in dismissing Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s complaint, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Ms. Trevi\u00f1o filed her complaint on May 29, 2013, both individually and as next friend for her brother, Robert Trevi\u00f1o. Mr. Trevi\u00f1o was convicted on August 25, 1995 of one count of aggravated sexual assault of a child, four counts of sexual assault of a child, and one count of indecency with a child. Mr. Trevi\u00f1o is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in a Texas prison. Ms. Trevi\u00f1o alleges that Mr. Trevi\u00f1o is unlawfully incarcerated, that he is a veteran, and that he has been mistreated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. She also alleges that other federal agencies, state and federal courts, and court officials have conspired to deny Mr. Trevi\u00f1o medical benefits and treatment to which he is entitled. Ms. Trevi\u00f1o alleges that she is also a veteran, that she suffers from service-connected injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and that she has not received appropriate medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Ms. Trevi\u00f1o alleges that the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346 and 1491, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5901 and 7101 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. She also alleges \u201cCivil and Human Rights Violations,\u201d \u201cViolations of RICO\u201d and \u201cMafia-Related Activities.\u201d She seeks $350,000,000 in monetary damages, along with various other forms of equitable and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">The Court of Federal Claims dismissed her complaint on October 29, 2013, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court held that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s (1) claims against parties other than the United States and its agencies, including claims against states, localities, state and local government officials, United States Senate Committees, various state and federal courts, and state and federal employees; (2) claims related to the grant or denial of veteran\u2019s benefits; (3) tort claims and civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; (4) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claims and constitutional claims; and (5) claims seeking equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and punitive damages. Ms. Trevi\u00f1o appeals this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">This court possesses jurisdiction to review a final decision of the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). Whether the Court of Federal Claims possesses subject matter jurisdiction over a claim is a question of law this court reviews de novo. <em>W. Co. of N. Am. v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1024, 1029 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, limits the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims to claims for money damages against the United States based on sources of substantive law that \u201ccan fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Navajo Nation, </em>556 U.S. 287, 290, 129 S.Ct. 1547, 173 L.Ed.2d 429 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The trial court correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s claims. First, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over claims against any party other than the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (2012); <em>see also United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 588, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941). Thus, the court lacks jurisdiction over Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s claims against states, localities, state and local government officials, state courts, state prisons, or state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Second, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s claims that she and her brother are entitled to veterans benefits. These claims must first be brought to the Department of Veterans Affairs and may only be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and then to this court. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7252, 7292 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Third, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s tort claims or her \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>Brown v. United States, </em>105 F.3d 621, 623 (Fed.Cir.1997) (holding that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over tort claims); <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>22 Cl.Ct. 178, 179 n. 2 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>937 F.2d 623 (Fed.Cir.1991) (holding that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over \u00a7 1983 claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Fourth, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s RICO claims or her claims under the due process, equal protection or supremacy clauses of the United States Constitution. These claims do not fall within the court\u2019s jurisdiction as defined by the Tucker Act because none of those statutes or constitutional provisions mandate the payment of money. <em>See Hufford v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Cl. 696, 702 (2009) (holding that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over RICO claims); <em>United States v. Connolly, </em>716 F.2d 882, 887 (Fed.Cir.1983) (en banc) (holding that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over claims based on constitutional provisions that do not obligate the government to pay money).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Finally, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s claims for injunctive relief and punitive damages. The trial court cannot grant the requested equitable relief. <em>United States v. Tohono O\u2018Odham Nation, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1723, 1729, 179 L.Ed.2d 723 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">In addition, the trial court did not err in dismissing Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s complaint without first giving her the opportunity to amend. The court gives pro se petitioners more latitude in their pleadings than parties represented by counsel. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). But the court need not give a pro se petitioner leave to amend her complaint where it is clear that such an amendment would be futile. <em>See, e.g., Bradley v. Chiron Corp., </em>136 F.3d 1317, 1327 (Fed.Cir.1998). Here, none of Ms. Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s claims fall within the defined jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. Allowing her to amend her complaint would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
