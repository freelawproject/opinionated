(\u201cCitiMortgage\u201d) to enjoin foreclosure on their property. The Myers now appeal the district court\u2019s March 7, 2013 order denying their motion to alter or amend judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). For the reasons set forth below, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">On February 13, 2013, the Myers filed a motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e). In their motion, the Myers asked the district court to reconsider (1) the court\u2019s prior denial of the Myers\u2019s motion to amend the complaint and (2) the court\u2019s prior denial of the parties\u2019 motion for a continuance. On March 7, 2013, the district court denied the Myers\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. The Myers timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Ross v. Marshall, </em>426 F.3d 745, 763 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cHowever, to the extent that a ruling was a reconsideration of a question of law ... the standard of review is <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For relief under Rule 59(e), the movant must \u201cclearly establish either a manifest error of law or fact or must present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Myers have not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\n<em>a. Reconsideration of Motion to Amend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">On November 14, 2012, the Myers filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. CitiMortgage opposed the motion on the grounds that (1) the motion to amend was untimely and the Myers had not shown good cause for the late filing, and (2) the proposed amended complaint failed to state a claim and therefore amendment would be futile. On January 16, 2013, the court denied the Myers\u2019s motion to amend on the ground that the proposed amended complaint failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The court stated that it need not address the timeliness of the Myers\u2019s motion to amend because the \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d In their Rule 59(e) motion, the Myers moved for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend. The district court denied reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">A district court may deny leave to amend a complaint if amendment would be futile. <em>See Rio Grande Royalty Co., Inc. v. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., </em>620 F.3d 465, 468 (5th Cir.2010). Amendment would be futile if the proposed amended complaint fails to state a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See Briggs v. Mississippi, </em>331 F.3d 499, 508 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Sinay v. Lamson &amp; Sessions Co., </em>948 F.2d 1037, 1041 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201c[A]n amendment may not be allowed if the complaint as amended could not withstand a Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">On appeal, the Myers contend that the district court erred in denying reconsideration of its prior denial of leave to amend. In particular, the Myers assert that they had \u201cgood cause\u201d for filing their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>motion to amend after the amendment deadline. As stated above, the district court did not deny amendment on the ground of untimeliness. Rather, the court denied amendment on the independent ground of futility. The Myers do not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that that the proposed amended complaint fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). As a result, they have abandoned any challenge to this finding on appeal. <em>See In re Cao, </em>619 F.3d 410, 420 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Brinlc-mann v. Dali. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cWe will not raise and discuss legal issues that [the appellant] failed to assert.\u201d); <em>Davis v. Maggio, </em>706 F.2d 568, 571 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201c[C]laims not pressed on appeal are deemed abandoned.\u201d). Accordingly, the Myers have not shown that the district court erred in denying relief under Rule 59(e) on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\n<em>b. Reconsideration of Motion for a Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On January 7, 2013, the parties filed a motion to continue the May 13, 2013 trial date and the deadlines for pretrial filings for ninety days so that the parties could explore the \u201cpotential resolution of the dispute\u201d through a possible loan modification. At the time of the motion for a continuance, CitiMortgage\u2019s motion to dismiss had been pending for ten months and the Myers\u2019s motion to amend had been pending for almost two months. On January 11, 2013, the district court denied the parties\u2019 motion for a continuance. Five days later, the court granted CitiMort-gage\u2019s motion to dismiss and denied the Myers\u2019s motion to amend. In their Rule 59(e) motion, the Myers moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s denial of a continuance. The court denied reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">District courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in deciding motions for continuances. <em>See United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439 (5th Cir.2009); <em>HC Gun &amp; Knife Shows, Inc. v. City of Houston, </em>201 F.3d 544, 549 (5th Cir.2000) (noting that district courts\u2019 discretion in making scheduling decisions is \u201cexceedingly wide\u201d). When making scheduling decisions, the district court \u201cmust consider not only the facts of the particular case but also all of the demands on counsel\u2019s time and the court\u2019s [time].\u201d <em>HC Gun &amp; Knife Shows, </em>201 F.3d at 549-50. \u201cWe will <em>not </em>substitute our judgment concerning the necessity of a continuance for that of the district court, unless the complaining party demonstrates that it was prejudiced by the denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">On appeal, the Myers contend that the district court erred in denying reconsideration of its prior denial of a continuance. The district court gave several reason for denying a continuance and denying reconsideration, including: (1) the case is a \u201csimple foreclosure case\u201d that had been pending over a year; (2) the court had already granted continuances of two deadlines in the scheduling order; (3) the court had set the May 13, 2013 trial date a year prior, in May 2012; (4) the court had time in May 2013 to try the case, but the court calendar was later occupied with cases in four different divisions; and (5) \u201cthe parties had plenty of time to pursue a potential resolution.\u201d The Myers have not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying a continuance or that they were prejudiced by the ruling. In their motion to continue the trial date and deadlines for pretrial filings, the parties did not ask the court to refrain from ruling on the pending motion to dismiss or motion to amend. As a result, the court\u2019s denial of the motion for a continuance did not affect the court\u2019s subsequent dismissal of the case. The Myers have not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>that the district court erred in denying relief under Rule 59(e) on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s March 7, 2013 order denying the Myers\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\">. Although the Myers's motion mentions both Rules 59(e) and 60(b), the district court interpreted the motion as a motion under Rule 59(e) because it was filed within twenty-eight days of the court\u2019s order of dismissal. The Myers do not dispute this interpretation on appeal. The motion also asked the court to amend its order of dismissal to be \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d The district court denied this request. The Myers similarly do not raise this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
