Jefferson argues that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs, a claim we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">Jefferson asserts that Nurse Lee was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when she treated his injuries, which resulted from a fall from the top bunk in his cell, with only tape stitches. The record shows that Jefferson received treatment for his injuries, including four visits to the prison infirmary, one visit to an external hospital, stitches, a scan, and pain medication. Jefferson\u2019s assertions concerning Nurse Lee and the defendants indicate only his disagreement with the prescribed treatment; these assertions are not sufficient to establish that Nurse Lee or the other defendants acted with deliberate indifference to Jefferson\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). Even if these facts show that his treatment was negligent, negligent medical care does not constitute a valid \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">The appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. Jefferson\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is denied. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212, 213 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-19\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jefferson\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Jefferson is hereby cautioned that if he accumu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>lates three strikes he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
