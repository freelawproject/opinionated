Grencorp Management, Inc. (\u201cGrencorp\u201d) obtained liens on the disputed property via two deeds of trust, which the company recorded in 2007. Liberty Bankers Life Insurance Co. (\u201cLiberty Bankers\u201d) claims an interest in the property, in the form of an equitable lien, but acknowledges that the deed of trust it recorded in 2006 did not include a description of the disputed property. Each party sought a declaratory judgment that its lien had priority, and both parties filed competing summary-judgment motions. On <em>de novo </em>review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the district court accepted the findings and conclusions and granted summary judgment in favor of Grencorp and denied summary judgment to Liberty Bankers. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">In December 2005, Grencorp obtained liens on the disputed property by an assignment of deeds of trust, which were made to secure two promissory notes. Pioneer Austin East Development IC, Ltd. (\u201cPioneer Austin\u201d) initially gave the deeds of trust to TOM 2003-1 Master Limited Partnership (\u201cTOM LP\u201d) in October 2003. In December 2005, TOM LP assigned the deeds of trust and related notes to Gren-corp. In August 2007, Grencorp recorded the deeds of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">Liberty Bankers claims that it holds an equitable lien on the property as a successor to American Reserve Life Insurance Co. (\u201cARLIC\u201d). In June 2006, ARLIC made a loan to Pioneer Austin. Liberty Bankers asserts that ARLIC and Pioneer Austin intended to secure the loan with the disputed property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the deed of trust for that transaction, recorded also in June 2006, did not include a description of that property and instead described a different parcel of land located in Travis County, distinct from the disputed property. In October 2007, Liberty Bankers attempted to fix the allegedly faulty description by filing a corrected deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">Before the bankruptcy court, both parties moved for summary judgment, and, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the bankruptcy court made proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Specifically, the bankruptcy court concluded that Grencorp\u2019s recorded lien was superior to any equitable lien that Liberty Bankers may hold. On October 5, 2011, Liberty Bankers moved the district court for <em>de novo </em>review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusion of law. The district court accepted the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings and granted Gren-corp\u2019s motion for summary judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>denied Liberty Banker\u2019s competing motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">\u201cThis court reviews the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same standard employed by the district court.\u201d <em>Shcolnik v. Rapid Settlements Ltd. (In re Shcolnik), </em>670 F.3d 624, 627 (5th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). When determining whether a fact issue exists, we view \u201cthe facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Reaves Brokerage Co. v. Sunbelt Fruit &amp; Vegetable Co., </em>386 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">\u201cThe general rule is that in a contest over rights or interests in property, the party that is first in time is first in right.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l City Bank v. Tex. Capital Bank, N.A., </em>353 S.W.3d 581, 585 (Tex.App.2011). Section 13.001 of the Texas Property Code, however, has supplanted this common law rule in certain instances. That section provides that \u201c[a] conveyance of ... an interest in real property or a mortgage or deed of trust is void as to a creditor or to a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration without notice unless the instrument has been acknowledged, sworn to, or proved and filed for record as required by law.\u201d Tex. Prop. Code \u00a7 13.001(a). \u201cAlthough the statute by its terms renders void the unrecorded deed as against \u2018creditors,\u2019 courts interpret this to mean specifically creditors who have acquired liens without notice of the competing deed.\u201d <em>Omohundro v. Jackson, </em>36 S.W.3d 677, 682 (Tex.App.2001). Moreover, \u201ca creditor\u2019s lien takes precedence over a prior unrecorded deed, unless the creditor has notice of the deed at or before the time his lien is fixed upon the land.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">In the present case, it is undisputed that Grencorp acquired a lien in the disputed property and did so without notice of any prior recorded deed. After all, Liberty Bankers acknowledges that the deed of trust recorded in June 2006 \u2014 six months after Grencorp obtained the liens on the disputed property, but more than a year before Grencorp recorded the deeds of trust \u2014 did not include a description of the disputed parcel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, it is undisputed that Grencorp, by filing the deeds of trust in August 2007, perfected its lien on the property and did so two months <em>before </em>Liberty Bankers filed a corrected deed of trust in an attempt to fix the allegedly faulty description contained in the deed of trust recorded in June 2006. Consequently, Grencorp is the only party to have both received a security interest in the disputed property and properly recorded that interest. Grencorp is therefore entitled to section 13.001(a)\u2019s protection, which renders void as to Grencorp any conveyance, mortgage, or deed of trust \u2014 such as the equitable lien Liberty Bankers now claims \u2014 that was not recorded. <em>See </em>Tex. Prop. Code \u00a7 13.001(a). And because Liberty Bankers failed to record its claimed conveyance, under Texas law, Grencorp\u2019s recorded lien takes priority over any interest that Liberty Bankers possesses. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>was therefore correct to award summary judgment in Grencorp\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1074-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">. Liberty Bankers explained that the purportedly faulty description was the result of an oversight by the title company that handled the closing of the ARLIC-Pioneer Austin transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-13\">A bankruptcy judge may hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title 11. In such proceeding, the bankruptcy judge shall submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court, and any final order or judgment shall be entered by the district judge after considering the bankruptcy judge\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions and after reviewing de novo those matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">. Consequently, <em>Liberty Bankers </em>may not take advantage of section 13.001(a)\u2019s protections. Because the deed of trust recorded in June 2006 did not describe the disputed property, Pioneer Austin never conveyed an interest in that land to ARLIC. Accordingly, Liberty Bankers may not be considered \u201ca creditor or ... a subsequent purchaser.\u201d Tex. Prop.Code \u00a7 13.001(a); <em>Omohundro, </em>36 S.W.3d at 682.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
