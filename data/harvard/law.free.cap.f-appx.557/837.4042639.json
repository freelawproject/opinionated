To obtain full memberships, they paid a sizeable deposit. The members also signed a Proprietary Golf Membership Agreement (the Purchase Contract) and agreed to be bound by the Club\u2019s Bylaws. The Bylaws provided that, if a member later resigned, his membership would be placed on a transfer list containing all resigned members in the order of their resignations. Then, for every four or five new memberships sold, one membership from the list would be transferred from a resigned member to a new member. When that happened, the resigned member would receive a percentage refund of his deposit. Although the Purchase Contract provided that resigning members who reached the top of the transfer list would receive a 70% refund of their membership deposits, the Club\u2019s subsequent \u201cUpgrade Offer,\u201d which the members accepted, increased that amount to 90%.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Each of the members ultimately resigned from membership at the Club\u2014 Murphy, Oinonen, Femminella, and Brus-sard in 2004, and Gardiner in 2008. Each member was placed on the transfer list. When they resigned, Murphy was 199th, Oinonen was 162nd, Fimminella was 214th, Brussard was 216th, and Gardiner was 454th on the transfer list. To this date, no member has received a return of his deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">In November 2010, the members filed suit against the Club\u2019s owners and operators \u2014 American Golf Corporation of California and Golf Enterprises, Inc., (the owners) \u2014 for breach of contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In their complaint, the members alleged the owners were obligated to refund the membership deposits. They alleged they had already performed all conditions precedent to receiving the refunds, and that, by failing to return the money, the owners were in breach of their obligations under the agreements. Upon the owners\u2019 motion, the district court rendered summary judgment against the members. This is the members\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Robinson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number><em>Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWe draw all factual inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[B]ut an inference based on speculation and conjecture is not reasonable.\u201d <em>Avenue CLO Fund, Ltd. v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>723 F.3d 1287, 1294 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). And \u201cthe mere existence of <em>some </em>alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <em>genuine </em>issue of <em>material </em>fact.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All </em>U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">On appeal, the members contend that a genuine issue of material fact remains regarding whether the owners breached the Purchase Contract, Bylaws, and Upgrade Offer by failing to: (1) provide the members with exclusive access to the Club\u2019s amenities; (2) build a hotel and a total of 81 holes at the various golf courses at the Club; (3) refund the members\u2019 deposits; and (4) advance them on the transfer list in accordance with the Bylaws. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">First, because the members\u2019 exclusive-use allegations were not made in the complaint and were, instead, raised for the first time in response to the owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment, that claim is not properly before us. <em>See Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cAt the summary judgment stage, the proper procedure for plaintiffs to assert a new claim is to amend the complaint.... A plaintiff may not amend her complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Second, neither the alleged promise to construct a hotel nor the guarantee of 81 holes of golf appears in the Purchase Contract, Bylaws, or Upgrade Offer. And, to the extent the members complain these apparently oral promises were somehow incorporated into the owners\u2019 contractual obligations, they provide no basis for circumventing the Bylaws\u2019 \u201cEntire Agreement\u201d clause, which states in no uncertain terms that none of the \u201crights and obligations\u201d in the Bylaws and Purchase contract \u201cmay be modified, amended, enlarged, or revised\u201d in any way other than by written agreement (as in the case of the Upgrade Offer). To the extent the members originally contended these alleged misrepresentations caused them to enter into their agreements in the first place, they have not pursued their fraudulent inducement claim on appeal and so have abandoned it. <em>Little v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., </em>691 F.3d 1302, 1306 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Third, as the district court detailed, the members have not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether they are now entitled to a refund of their membership deposits. The Club\u2019s Bylaws clearly provide that resigning members are placed on the transfer list in their order of resignation and that refunds will be issued as those memberships are transferred to new members. Generally, the Bylaws provide that only 1 transfer occurs for every 4 or 5 new memberships. None of the members were close to the top of the transfer list when they filed suit. And no member has presented any evidence that he has since reached the top. The members contend the new-member-to-transfer ratio was, for a period, 1:1, which could <em>possibly </em>have placed them at the top of the list. This, however, is mere speculation, even if that ratio applied for a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>of time. We have said repeatedly that speculation about a fact or result is insufficient to survive summary judgment. <em>See Avenue CLO Fund, Ltd., </em>723 F.3d at 1294 (\u201c[A]n inference based on speculation and conjecture is not reasonable.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Finally, the members contend \u2014 for the first time on appeal \u2014 that they are entitled to be placed higher on the transfer list than they are currently positioned. They contend this argument was presented to the district court because, in their breach-of-contract claim, they requested \u201csuch further relief as the Court deems proper.\u201d We disagree. The members\u2019 complaint mentioned only a request for damages for the alleged breach of contract. It made no mention of a prayer for the injunctive relief (advancement on the transfer list) they now seek. Even if we construed the complaint\u2019s \u201cfurther relief\u2019 request to include injunctive relief, the members failed entirely to argue the issue in response to the owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment before the district court. As a result, because the district court never had an opportunity to rule on the issue, we will not consider it in the first instance. <em>See San Francisco Residence Club, Inc. v. 7027 Old Madison Pike, LLC, </em>583 F.3d 750, 755 (11th Cir.2009) (declining to address plaintiffs request for relief, made for the first time before the court of appeals, because the district court did not \u201chave the opportunity to pass upon the issue\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-11\">. After a review of the district court\u2019s jurisdictional order on remand, we conclude subject matter jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-19\">. The members lodged additional claims against the owners, none of which are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
