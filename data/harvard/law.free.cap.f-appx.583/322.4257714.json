This court granted Strickland a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue of whether his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to object to Terry Moore\u2019s assertion of his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Strickland\u2019s motion to strike the respondent\u2019s brief as untimely is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-22\">On appeal, Strickland argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to Moore\u2019s assertion of his Fifth Amendment right not to testify was unreasonable because counsel knew that Moore possessed exculpatory evidence. He contends that the state ha-beas court\u2019s reliance on counsel\u2019s affidavit stating that his actions were trial strategy was an unreasonable determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>facts and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced him because it precluded him from eliciting at least some exculpatory evidence and deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process. We do not address Strickland\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to request an adverse inference instruction because that issue is outside the scope of the COA granted to Strickland. <em>See Simmons v. Epps, </em>654 F.3d 526, 535 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo, applying the same standard of review that the district court applied to the state court decision. <em>Roberts v. Thaler, </em>681 F.3d 597, 603-04 (5th Cir.2012). Strickland is not entitled to habeas relief on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits by a state court unless the state court\u2019s decision (1) was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence in the state court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; (2). The state court\u2019s determination of a factual issue must be presumed correct, unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The state court\u2019s denial of relief on a claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance is measured against the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which requires that Strickland show both deficient performance by counsel and resulting prejudice. <em>Williams v. Thaler, </em>684 F.3d 597, 604 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cSurmounting <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>high bar is never an easy task.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 788, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cEstablishing that a state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d) is all the more difficult. The standards created by <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are. both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cWhen \u00a7 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">A witness\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege exists when the witness has \u201creasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer.\u201d <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). \u201cIt is for the court to say whether his silence is justified ... and to require him to answer if it clearly appears to the court that he is mistaken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cTo sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 71 S.Ct. 814. Thus, when appraising the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege, the trial judge \u201cmust be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 71 S.Ct. 814 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In this case, the trial judge was already familiar with Moore as a witness as Moore had testified at Strickland\u2019s first trial. Had Moore testified in favor of Strickland in a manner that rendered his testimony at Strickland\u2019s first trial false, Moore could have been prosecuted for perjury. <em>See Butterfield v. State, </em>992 S.W.2d 448, 459 (Tex.Crim.App.1999); Tex. Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ANN. \u00a7 37.02. Although the questions asked of Moore did not per se risk perjury, they served to demonstrate that Moore intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege. Moreover, the prospect of being prosecuted for perjury is a legitimate basis for asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege. <em>United States v. Balsys, </em>524 U.S. 666, 713, 118 S.Ct. 2218, 141 L.Ed.2d 575 (1998). Thus, counsel arguably had no reason to object to Moore\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment. Further, insofar as Moore was a witness for the prosecution, his invocation of the Fifth Amendment during the State\u2019s presentation of evidence ostensibly inured to Strickland\u2019s benefit. Counsel attested that for this reason he strategized not to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Given the context in which Moore invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, counsel\u2019s attestations as to trial strategy, and the doubly deferential standard of review that we must apply, we conclude that Strickland has not met his burden of showing that the state habeas court unreasonably determined the facts surrounding his claim or that it unreasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>when it denied his claim that counsel was ineffective. <em>See Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-88; <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-91, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 486, 71 S.Ct. 814. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
