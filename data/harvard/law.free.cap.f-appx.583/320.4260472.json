He argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend a sentence in the lower 25 percent of the guidelines range and he challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Whether the Government has breached a plea agreement is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). As Culley did not object to the alleged breach of the plea agreement in the district court, the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>Id. </em>Because the Government\u2019s recommendation was incorporated into the presentence report, the Government did not breach the plea agreement by not explicitly requesting a sentence in the lower 25% of the guidelines range at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>286 F.3d 217, 221 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, the district court indicated that it was aware of the Government\u2019s sentencing recommendation regarding the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In response to Culley\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, the Government argues, inter alia, that this court should dismiss Culley\u2019s appeal based upon the plea agreement\u2019s appeal waiver. The record indicates that Culley entered into the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily and that he understood the clear, explicit terms of the waiver. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to the terms of the waiver, Culley waived the right to appeal his sentence on any ground, which includes his substantive reasonableness challenge. Because the appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and because the Government seeks the enforcement of the appeal waiver, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>732 F.3d 489, 491 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1349, 188 L.Ed.2d 352 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
