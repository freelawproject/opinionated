Thereafter, Lavergne filed a civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>complaint against the Office of the Public Defender for the Fifteenth Judicial District, its supervisor, and two public defenders who represented him on the murder charges. The district court dismissed Lavergne\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and, in the alternative, as frivolous and for failure to state a claim because the public defenders were not state actors within the meaning of '\u00a7 1983 and the Public Defender\u2019s Office was not an entity capable of being sued under \u00a7 1983. Lavergne\u2019s state law claims were dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">This court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo applying the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Lavergne argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint under <em>Heck </em>because some of his claims against his defense attorneys fall outside the reach of <em>Heck. </em>We disagree. It is disingenuous of Lavergne to attempt to carve out portions of the attorneys\u2019 representation as exempt from the <em>Heck </em>bar. If the district court were to award him damages as to any of his claims, it would implicitly call into question the validity of his murder convictions. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Penley v. Collin County, Tex., </em>446 F.3d 572, 573 (5th Cir.2006). In this same vein, any error in denying his motions to amend was harmless because the amendments were futile in light of the <em>Heck </em>bar. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>592 F.3d 675, 681 (5th Cir.2009). The district court did not err in dismissing Lavergne\u2019s Heck-barred claims with prejudice. <em>See Johnson v. McElveen, </em>101 F.3d 423, 424 (5th Cir.1996). In light of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion 'in denying Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982). To the extent Lavergne raises new claims on appeal, we do not address them. <em>See Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006). Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
