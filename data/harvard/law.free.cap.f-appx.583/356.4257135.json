He argues that the district court improperly sentenced him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and failed to consider adequately, as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), the disparity between his sentence and those likely to be imposed against his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">As Snowden raised his arguments in the district court, we will review his sentence' for procedural and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United </em>States, 552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We will review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Zuniga, </em>720 F.3d 587, 590 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">The district court did not procedurally err by sentencing Snowden as a career offender. Snowden argues that his 1989 felony conviction for delivery of cocaine should not have counted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e) as a predicate offense for the career-offender enhancement because the Government failed to prove that his sentence for the offense was imposed within the 15 years preceding his commencement in 2012 of the instant offense or resulted in his incarceration during that 15-year period. However, the Government submitted documents indicating that Snowden\u2019s parole for his 1989 offense was revoked in 1993 and that Snowden\u2019s revocation sentence was not discharged until 1999. Thus, the Government made that showing. <em>See United States v. Ybarra, </em>70 F.3d 362, 366-67 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-23\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Snowden\u2019s sentence. The district court heard Snow-den\u2019s sentencing-disparity arguments, but concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. There is no unwarranted disparity between Snowden\u2019s sentence and those of his three co-defendants because they, among other things, were not sentenced as career offenders. Snowden has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
