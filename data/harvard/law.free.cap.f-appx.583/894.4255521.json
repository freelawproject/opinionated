See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 <em>et seq. </em>The bankruptcy court dismissed Hill\u2019s case. He appealed that dismissal to the district court, which affirmed it. Proceeding pro se, he now appeals the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-22\">In 2007 the Suwannee River Water Management District (the District) brought a lawsuit in Florida state court against El Rancho No Tengo, Inc., of which Hill is the president. The District claimed that El Rancho had modified a dam on El Rancho\u2019s property without obtaining the proper permits. In its first \u201cfinal\u201d order, the Florida court entered an injunction allowing the District to go onto El Rancho\u2019s property and inspect the dam. That final order retained jurisdiction to award civil penalties and attorney\u2019s fees. In a second \u201cfinal\u201d order, the Florida court entered a $100,000 judgment against El Rancho as a civil penalty for violations of state law. That second final order retained jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees. About six months later, before that court could enter a third final order, El Rancho filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 12. The bankruptcy court dismissed that action. Afterwards, the Florida court entered its third final order, which awarded the District another judgment against El Rancho, this time for an additional $280,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-24\">To satisfy the District\u2019s judgments against El Rancho, the Florida court issued two writs of execution on September 16, 2010, commanding the sheriff to levy on El Rancho\u2019s property. A week later, acting as El Rancho\u2019s president, Hill deeded about 71 acres of El Rancho\u2019s land to himself in exchange for $1.00. On March 28, 2011, the sheriff issued a notice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>those same 71 acres were going-to be sold at public auction on May 3, 2011, at 10:00 a.m. On the day of the sheriffs sale, at 9:38 a.m., Hill filed this bankruptcy action.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The District moved to dismiss this action under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1208, and the bankruptcy court granted its motion. In making its ruling, the bankruptcy court rejected Hill\u2019s proposed plan for adjusting his debts. It found that the plan was not feasible in light of Hill\u2019s tax returns and did not satisfy the District\u2019s liens on the 71 acres. Indeed, Hill had not defended his plan in opposing the District\u2019s motion except to argue that the Florida judgments against El Rancho were improper. The bankruptcy court found that Hill had filed for bankruptcy not to adjust his debts but to stay the sheriffs sale and to void the judgment liens encumbering his 71 acres. Concluding that it had no power to rule on the merits of those Florida judgments, the bankruptcy court dismissed this action. Cf. <em>In re Roloff, </em>598 F.2d 783, 785-87 (3d Cir.1979) (holding under a previous version of the Bankruptcy Code that the bankruptcy court\u2019s broad equitable powers do not include a power \u201cto adjudicate once more, in a full trial, the merits and amount of each lien already determined to be owed\u201d). The district court affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Hill\u2019s opening brief does not challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s characterization of his filing as an attempt to relitigate the judgments against El Rancho instead of to adjust Hill\u2019s debts under Chapter 12. The brief does not even cite Chapter 12, much less discuss its relevance to his claims. All Hill\u2019s brief does is argue yet again that the Florida judgments against El Rancho were incorrect. As a result, Hill has abandoned any challenge to the bankruptcy court\u2019s characterization of this action. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014) (holding that an appellant abandons an argument he fails to raise it in his opening brief); <em>see also Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that even a <em>pro se </em>appellant abandons an issue that is not raised in his opening brief) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The bankruptcy court premised its dismissal on its characterization of this action as an unsubtle attempt to relitigate state court judgments. By abandoning any challenge to that premise, Hill has failed to challenge one of the independent ground's supporting the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment. The bankruptcy court is thus due to be affirmed. <em>See Sapuppo, </em>739 F.3d at 680 (affirming the dismissal of a claim where the appellants had abandoned all of their challenges to one of the independent grounds for that dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\">.
