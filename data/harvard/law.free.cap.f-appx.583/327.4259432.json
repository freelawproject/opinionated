Now, he argues that the district court erred by concluding that his prior conviction for aggravated battery under Louisiana Revised Statutes \u00a7 14:34 was a crime of violence (COV) pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-25\">Appellate courts review sentences for reasonableness by engaging in a bifurcated analysis. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, the reviewing court ensures that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error, including improperly calculating the guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If there is no such error, the appellate court reviews the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s characterization of a prior offense as a crime of violence is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Our review of pertinent jurisprudence and the record shows no error in connection with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Cortes-Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 14:34 conviction was a COV for sentencing purposes. The record contains the charging instrument for Cortes-Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 14:34 offense. This document shows that this offense involved a \u201cmetal pipe\u201d and thus excludes the possibility that Cortes-Ramirez committed the aggravated battery with poison or other noxious substance. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s conclusion that this offense was a COV was proper. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Alvarez, </em>753 F.3d 132, 141-42 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
