Alvarez-Ruiz was sentenced to a prison term of 30 months. That sentence represented the low end of the Guidelines range, which included an eight-level enhancement based on a finding that the deportation followed an aggravated felony conviction. That conviction is a 1993 Texas conviction for theft of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">Although he did not challenge the classification of his theft conviction in the trial court, Alvarez-Ruiz contends on appeal that because the Texas Penal Code defines \u201ctheft\u201d to encompass theft induced by deception,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it categorically falls outside the generic definition of theft, which requires taking property without consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (explaining the categorical approach). Alvarez therefore maintains that he should have only received a four-level enhancement for \u201cany other felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">We review AIvarez-Ruiz\u2019s appeal for plain error because he faded to raise the issue below. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>690 F.3d 613, 620 (5th Cir.2012). But we need not decide the case on that basis because we recently rejected the underlying merits of the argument. In <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>No. 13-40939, 768 F.3d 437, 2014 WL 4920197 (5th Cir. Sept. 30, 2014), we held that the Texas theft statute does qualify as an aggravated felony under the same Guideline applied in this case. In response to the argument that the Texas statute does not require consent because it allows for theft by deception, <em>Rodriguez-Salazar </em>explained that \u201cthe definition of theft we have followed does not limit the crime to consent withheld when a guilty person takes possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of the property from the owner. The withholding of consent is expressly extended to the time the thief or embezzler exercises control of the property,\u201d during which time no consent exists when the victim transferred the property under fraudulent pretenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Rodriguez-Salazar </em>controls this case, so Alvarez-Ruiz\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-14\">.
