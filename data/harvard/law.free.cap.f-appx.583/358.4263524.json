He argues that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not provide sufficient reasons for its selection and substantively unreasonable because it does not account for two factors that should have received significant weight, i.e., the disparity between his and his code-fendants\u2019 sentences and that he committed the offense shortly after losing a second adult son to accidental death in less than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">Although Hargrove filed written motions requesting a departure or a variance based on these facts, Hargrove did not object when the district court overruled his arguments and imposed a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range. Accordingly, our review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>732 F.3d 361, 381 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1326, 188 L.Ed.2d 338 (2014); <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"A4m\">On plain error review, a defendant who argues that his within-guidelines sentence is procedurally unreasonable due to insufficient explanation must show that a more detailed explanation by the district court would have resulted in its imposing a lower sentence. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365 (5th Cir.2009). Hargrove has not made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">Before selecting Hargrove\u2019s sentence, the district court reviewed the presentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>report and written submissions of both parties, and it heard further argument at the sentencing hearing. The district court expressly found that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors were adequately reflected by the guidelines calculations and did not support a variance. We will not disturb a within guidelines sentence on plain error review \u201cmerely because an appellant disagrees with the sentence and the balancing of factors conducted by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>732 F.3d 361, 382 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1326, 188 L.Ed.2d 338 (2014). As Hargrove has not rebutted the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence is reasonable, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
