She was ordered to pay, jointly and severally with a co-defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>dant, restitution in the amount of $1,497.07. Hall argues that the amount of restitution ordered was plainly erroneous because it was not limited to the $381.55 counterfeit check for which she was convicted and that the error affected her substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">As the Government concedes, despite the fact that it was agreed to in Hall\u2019s factual resume, the amount of restitution ordered in this case is clear and obvious error because Hall was ordered to pay restitution based upon conduct beyond her offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Benns, </em>740 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir.2014); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). The error affects Hall\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Benns, </em>740 F.3d at 378; <em>see also Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Moreover, contrary to the Government\u2019s arguments that the error fails the fourth prong of our plain error review, we have stated that \u201c[w]hen a defendant is ordered to pay restitution in an amount greater than the loss caused, the error affects ... the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>479 F.3d 363, 373 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A). Inasmuch as the Government concedes that the correct amount of Hall\u2019s restitution should have been $381.55, we modify the judgment to reflect restitution ordered in that amount and affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
