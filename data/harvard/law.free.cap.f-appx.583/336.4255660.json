Garcia was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and was sentenced to the statutory minimum of 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\">Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and the corresponding amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. Because Garcia was sentenced on November 17, 2009, before the FSA\u2019s effective date of August B, 2010, the FSA is not retroactively applicable to him. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>716 F.3d 180, 180-82 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 439, 187 L.Ed.2d 295 (2013). Therefore, he remains subject to the pre-FSA statutory minimum sentence of 120 months and is thus ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Garcia\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Garcia\u2019s incorporated motion to appoint counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
