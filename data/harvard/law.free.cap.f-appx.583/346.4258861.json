He argues that the above-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Guerra asserts that the district court gave too much weight to his prior crime of violence convictions, which were remote in time, and not enough weight to his personal circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">Guerra has not shown that his sentence' was substantively unreasonable. The record reflects that the district court had an adequate basis for the sentence imposed and was guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding that an upward variance was merited. The district court concluded that the guidelines range did not adequately take into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Guerra\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the United States, the need to provide a just punishment, and the need to deter future crimes. To the extent that Guerra disagrees with his sentence and the district court\u2019s evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, he has not shown that the district court abused its discretion on that basis. <em>See Gall v.
