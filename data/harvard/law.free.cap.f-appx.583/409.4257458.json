Thereafter, Lavergne filed a civil rights complaint against Holly Bergeran. The district court treated Lavergne\u2019s complaint as arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and dismissed his claims for failure to state a claim because Bergeran was not a state actor and, in the alternative, as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Additionally, the district court dismissed Lavergne\u2019s Louisiana state law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">This court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, applying the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). Questions of federal jurisdiction are likewise reviewed de novo. <em>Davoodi v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>755 F.3d 307, 309 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Lavergne\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental brief is GRANTED. In the briefs, Lavergne disavows any intent to file a Section 1983 complaint against Bergeran. Still, he contends that his claims invoke federal jurisdiction. Federal question jurisdiction extends only to \u201ccivil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; <em>see Vaden v. Discover Bank, </em>556 U.S. 49, 60, 129 S.Ct. 1262, 173 L.Ed.2d 206 (2009). With the benefit of liberal construction, Lavergne seems to allege that his claims of libel and slander raise a federal question because Bergeran\u2019s false statements reached across state lines. Lavergne\u2019s argument is unavailing. Claims of libel and slander are quintessentially state law claims. <em>Cf. Phelan v. Norville, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 376 (5th Cir.2012) (upholding the district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims of libel and slander). The fact that Bergeran\u2019s alleged statements crossed state lines does not support federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Absent federal question jurisdiction, the district court did not have jurisdiction over Lavergne\u2019s' state law claims of libel and slander unless the federal diversity requirements were satisfied. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Under Section 1332, a district court has jurisdiction over civil matters \u201cwhere the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between ... citizens of different States.\u201d As Lavergne concedes, complete diversity is lacking in the case because both Lavergne and Bergeran are citizens of Louisiana. <em>See Stiftung v. Plains Mktg., L.P., </em>603 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir.2010) (diversity action requires complete diversity).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Accordingly, the district court did not err when it dismissed Lavergne\u2019s claims against Bergeran. The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying his motions to amend his complaint because the amendments were futile. <em>See Leal v. McHugh, </em>731 F.3d 405, 417 (5th Cir.2013). In light of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982). To the extent Lavergne raises new claims on appeal, we do not address them. <em>See Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
