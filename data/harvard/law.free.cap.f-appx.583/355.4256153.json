On appeal, Klinefelter contends that the Government failed to show that he was required to register under SORNA. In particular, he maintains that his Maryland conviction for second degree rape did not qualify as a \u201csex offense\u201d because the state statute permits a conviction for consensual sexual conduct if the victim is at least 13 years old and the offender was not more than four years older than the victim, because such conduct is considered an exception to the definition of a \u201csex offense.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(5)(C) (statutory exception). Klinefelter asserts that under the categorical approach, the Government is unable to prove that his conviction did not fall under the exception. We have rejected the argument that the categorical approach should be used in these circumstances and have instead applied a \u201ccircumstance-specific\u201d approach. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Medina, 757 </em>F.3d 425, 428-32 (5th Cir.2014). The stipulation of facts submitted at the bench trial established that Klinefel-ter was more than four years older than the victim. Klinefelter concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Gonzalez-Medina, </em>but he seeks to preserve the issue for further review, under SORNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-22\">In addition, Klinefelter asserts that the SORNA intrastate registration requirement is unconstitutional because it exceeds Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause. He maintains that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not authorize the enactment of SORNA because the statute improperly expands federal power. Klinefelter concedes, however, that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Whaley, 577 </em>F.3d 254 (5th Cir.2009); he wishes to raise his challenges to preserve them for further review. Accordingly, Klinefelter\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
