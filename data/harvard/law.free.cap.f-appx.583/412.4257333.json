Guevara argues that his guilty plea was involuntary because the magistrate judge (MJ) erred under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 by failing to advise him that he would be denied naturalization if he pleaded guilty. He further argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court: (1) improperly relied on prior criminal encounters that did not lead to convictions and (2) did not fully consider his mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-21\">Guevara did not raise the Rule 11 issue before the district court. We therefore review for plain error only. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 63, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Guevara\u2019s rearraignment hearing occurred prior to the December 2013 amendments to Rule 11, which required district courts to inform a defendant that if he is not a United States citizen, a conviction could result in his removal from the United States as well as denial of citizenship and denial of admission. Fed.R.CrimP. 111(b)(1)(0). Despite not being required to do so, the MJ admonished Guevara about the possible immigration consequences of pleading guilty, namely that he could be deported, removed, or excluded and would not be allowed to legally reenter the United States. Given these advisements and Guevara\u2019s \u201csolemn declarations in open court\u201d that he understood the charges against him and the consequences of pleading guilty, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>cannot demonstrate that but for the MJ\u2019s failure to specifically note that he could be denied naturalization, he would likely not have pleaded guilty. <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>570 F.3d 641, 649 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Because Guevara also did not challenge the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Guevara\u2019s argument that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable is frivolous because the record makes clear that, contrary to Guevara\u2019s assertion, the district court did not consider any dismissed or no-billed charges in determining the sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Montgomery v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 348, 350 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Moreover, the record also reflects that the district court considered the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Guevara\u2019s arguments for mitigating his sentence but implicitly overruled those arguments and concluded that a within-Guidelines sentence was adequate and appropriate. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we decline Guevara\u2019s invitation to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superi- or position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Guevara\u2019s general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Guevara has not demonstrated that the district court committed error, plain or otherwise, by sentencing him to a within-Guidelines, 57-month prison term and, thus, has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
