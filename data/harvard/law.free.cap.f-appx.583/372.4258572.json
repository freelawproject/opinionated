He -contends that the above guidelines sentence is procedurally unreasonable and plainly erroneous because the district court improperly considered his lack of respect for the law under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Because Johnson did not object to the alleged procedural error in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">Even if the district court relied on an improper factor, <em>see United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.2011), Johnson cannot show that his substantial rights were affected, <em>see Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). The district court considered the recommended imprisonment range of 8 to 14 months, the 36-month statutory maximum term of imprisonment, the nature and circumstances of Johnson\u2019s supervised release violations, Johnson\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d nature, and the probation officer\u2019s prior efforts to help Johnson during the supervised release term. Because the district court relied upon permissible \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(4)(B); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), the record does not unambiguously indicate that, but for the district court\u2019s possible consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ation of the one improper factor, there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence, <em>see United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Johnson cannot demonstrate reversible plain error. <em>See Puckett, 556 </em>U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Johnson also contends that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable and plainly erroneous because, aside from the recommended guidelines range, the district court failed to consider any of the permissible \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because he did not object to the alleged procedural error in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The district court did not expressly state that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in selecting Johnson\u2019s revocation sentence. However, the record reflects that the district court at least implicitly considered the permissible \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65 (recognizing that the district court\u2019s implicit consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 3553(c)\u2019s requirement that it provide reasons for an above guidelines sentence). Specifically, the district court\u2019s comments demonstrate that it considered the applicable policy statements, the nature and circumstances of Johnson\u2019s supervised release violations, and Johnson\u2019s history and characteristics. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(4)(B); \u00a7 3583(e). Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that a more thorough explanation would have resulted in a lesser sentence or that the district court would impose a lesser sentence on remand. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65. Accordingly, Johnson cannot demonstrate reversible plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
