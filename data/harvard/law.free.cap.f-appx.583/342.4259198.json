The district court indicated that the sentence, which was above the advisory guideline range of 18 to 24 months, was a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-21\">In his sole issue on appeal, Sotelo-Ra-mirez does not question the substantive reasonableness of the sentence but contends it is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court misinterpreted U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3 and 5K2.0 in determining that an above-guideline sentence was warranted. To the extent that Sotelo-Ramirez challenges the sentence as an upward departure under the Guidelines, his argument is without merit. The court did not impose a departure but instead specifically stated that the sentence constituted a variance in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">Sotelo-Ramirez contends that although the district court cited the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it was influenced by an erroneous departure standard regarding underrepre-sentation of criminal history. Sotelo-Ra-mirez maintains that courts must consider and correctly apply the guidelines, including the departure provisions, before imposing a variance under \u00a7 3553(a). The case on which he relies, however, says nothing about consideration of the guidelines-departure provisions in relation to imposing a variance or non-guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Hernandez, </em>581 F.3d 251, 256 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cWithout the correct guideline <em>range, </em>the court varies from the wrong point.\u201d (emphasis added)). The record demonstrates that the sentence was an upward variance from the guideline range based on the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), as thoroughly articulated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-23\">Sotelo-Ramirez has not shown any error in the determination that an above-guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>line sentence was warranted. Accordingly, the judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
