As part of the fraudulent scheme, which spanned many years, Sand-ford convinced two victims with whom he had been friends to give him approximately $489,000. Sandford\u2019s advisory-Sentencing Guidelines imprisonment range was 41-51 months, but the district court varied upward and sentenced him to concurrent 120-month terms and concurrent three-year supervised-release periods. The court also imposed a special supervised-release condition: the probation officer, upon reasonable suspicion Sandford had violated a term of his supervised release, could search Sandford\u2019s \u201cperson, property, house, residence, vehicle, papers, computers ..., other electronic communications or data storage devices or media, or office\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-19\">Sandford claims procedural error and substantive unreasonableness for his sentence, including challenging the special condition. Along that line, although post-<em>Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-20\">In claiming procedural error, Sandford maintains the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence. Because Sandford did not raise this issue in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 262 (5th Cir.2009). Under that standard, Sandford must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Based on our review of the record, the district court carefully considered the evidence before it, evaluated the parties\u2019 sentencing claims, and had a reasoned basis for exercising its decisionmaking authority. <em>E.g., Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>714 F.3d 289, 293-95 (5th Cir.2013). Sandford has not shown the requisite clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In claiming his 120-month sentence is substantively unreasonable, Sandford asserts the court: improperly found his victims were vulnerable during the course of the fraudulent scheme; gave too much weight to his demonstrated propensity for fraudulent behavior; and did not give enough weight to all of the good deeds he had done. The district court acknowledged the imposed sentence was severe, but nevertheless determined it was appropriate and necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). It goes without saying that the sentencing court is in a better position to make such a determination. <em>Diaz, </em>714 F.3d at 295 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Considering the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 332-33 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">For Sandford\u2019s challenge to the special condition as it relates to \u201ccomputers, electronic communications devices, and data storage devices or media\u201d, review is for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>743 F.3d 445, 447 (5th Cir.2014). Because nothing in the record indicates Sand-ford used a computer or other electronic device to commit his offenses, he maintains the condition does not reasonably relate to the nature and circumstances of his offense or his personal history and characteristics, and is thus impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The condition is, however, reasonably related to the sentencing goals of deterring future criminal conduct and protecting the public from Sandford\u2019s future crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(d)(1); 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C). Sandford has not established the district court abused its discretion in imposing this condition. <em>E.g., United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 225-27 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 681, 187 L.Ed.2d 555 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
