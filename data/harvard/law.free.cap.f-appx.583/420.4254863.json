California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Macedo has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Macedo\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The thrust of Macedo\u2019s response is that the Government breached the plea agreement by \u201csupporting] information inconsistent with the plea agreement.\u201d According to Macedo, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">entered into an agreement which stipulated to a particular set of facts that stated that Macedo was engaged in a conspiracy. And that [he] was involved in a large methamphetamine organization. Although there is mention of large quantities of methamphetamines the factual basis only reveals that two people drove cars containing five kilograms of methamphetamines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Specifically, Macedo avers that the Government breached the terms of the agreement \u201cwhen it introduced evidence through the presentence report that attributed a larger amount of methamphetamine contrary to that stipulated in the plea agreement.\u201d In this regard, he contends that the plea agreement only stipulated to 10 kilograms of methamphetamine, whereas the PSR recommended that 11,670.82 grams of methamphetamine mixture could be attributed to him, in addition to 3,661.05 grams of methamphetamine actual.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Macdeo\u2019s breach argument lacks merit. As an initial matter, there is no provision in the plea agreement stipulating that Ma-cedo will be sentenced based on a specified quantity of drugs. Indeed, under the agreement, the Government explicitly reserved the right to \u201cinform the U.S. Probation Office and the Court of all information relevant to determining sentence.\u201d Moreover, there is no indication in the record that the Government actually informed the court of additional drug quantities. Finally, contrary to Macedo\u2019s contentions, the factual stipulation in the plea agreement nowhere indicates that only 10 kilograms could be attributed to Macedo. Rather, the plea agreement notes that Ma-cedo was engaged in a conspiracy, in which he received and distributed \u201clarge quantities of methamphetamines.\u201d While the agreement does contain a factual stipulation that Macedo was present at a scene \u201cwhere cars containing 5 kilograms of methamphetamine\u201d were being delivered, the agreement nowhere indicates that this was the exclusive episode involving Mace-do.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Following our review of counsel\u2019s brief, Macedo\u2019s response, and the record, we concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, and counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein. Macedo\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998). The APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
