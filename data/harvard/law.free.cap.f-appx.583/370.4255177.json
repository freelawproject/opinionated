As in the district court, Sierra contends that he was entitled to a mitigating role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because his role in the offense was limited to driving a tractor-trailer containing marijuana. Additionally, Sierra contends that, in denying a role reduction, the district court improperly considered his prior criminal convictions as relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The role adjustments of \u00a7 3B1.2 are not available to defendants sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Cashaw, </em>625 F.3d 271, 274 (5th Cir.2010). Because Sierra\u2019s offense level was calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1, we find no error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
