During his sentencing hearing, Wilson admitted to possession of approximately 42 grams of crack cocaine. In light of Wilson\u2019s prior felony drug conviction, the district court sentenced him to 120 months in prison pursuant to the statutory minimum then in effect. <em>See </em>Anti-Drug Abuse Act, Pub.L. No. 99-570, 100 Stat. 8207 (1986). The Fair Sentencing Act, effective on August 3, 2010, raised the threshold for violation of this Act to 28 grams. Pub.L. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a)(2), 124 Stat 2372. At the time of Wilson\u2019s initial sentencing, this Circuit did not apply the FSA to conduct committed before the new law became effective. <em>See United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In <em>Dorsey v. United </em>States, the Supreme Court held categorically that the FSA applied to all sentences imposed after the law\u2019s passage, regardless of when the charged conduct occurred. \u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2336, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). Wilson accordingly filed a motion for resentencing pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The Government agreed that he was entitled to a new hearing but argued that he should receive the same sentence, a request the district court eventually granted. Wilson now appeals the imposition of that sentence, arguing that the Government was required to indict and prove beyond a reasonable doubt the facts determining his sentence. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435); <em>see also Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Wilson, however, failed to raise any objection to his sentence on this basis in the trial court. His pre-sentencing memorandum makes no argument on this point other than stating that, \u201cBased on a change in the law, [defendant] is no longer subject to a statutory minimum sentence.\u201d At his sentencing hearing, Wilson\u2019s attorney argued only that Wilson should receive the benefit of <em>Dorsey </em>or the increase in the drug calculation tables. Immediately after he imposed the sentence, the district judge asked defense counsel if he had anything further. Counsel stated \u201cEverything was set forth in my sentencing memorandum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Because Wilson did not preserve his objection, we review it for plain error under Rule 52(b). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). We will exercise our discretion to correct an unpreserved plain error only \u201cif the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)) (alteration in original). If the error complained of presents a \u201ctiny risk\u201d that the sentence would have been different, reversal \u201cis most unlikely.\u201d <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>560 U.S. 258, 267, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 2167, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Here, the defendant admitted possession of a quantity of crack sufficient to sustain the sentence. Forty-two grams of crack, taken together with an enhancement for his prior conviction, well exceeds the revised standard for a 10-year minimum sentence. Thus, any error could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>affected Wilson s substantial rights. Further, in the words of a unanimous Court, \u201cThe real threat then to the \u201cfairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d would be if respondents, despite the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence that they were [guilty], were to receive a sentence prescribed for those committing less substantial drug offenses because of an error that was never objected to at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 684, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1787, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>see also Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (conducting a similar \u2018causal\u2019 plain-error analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In the absence of plain error that mandates reversal, we AFFIRM the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
