The district court sentenced him to serve 480 months in prison and a five-year term of supervised release, and he was also ordered to pay $323,613 in restitution. On appeal, Harris argues that his plea was involuntary because the district court neglected to inform him about restitution at rearraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">When, as here, no objection is made to a Rule 11 error, our review is for plain error only. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Under that standard, we will not correct an alleged error unless (1) the complained-of ruling is indeed wrong, (2) the error is \u201cclear or obvious,\u201d and (3) the error \u201caffects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If all of these conditions are met, we may, in our discretion, correct the forfeited error, but we will do so only if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>A review of the rearraignment transcript confirms that the district court did not admonish Harris regarding the imposition of a restitution order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(K). Nevertheless, the plea agreement and the district court\u2019s rearraignment colloquy informed Harris that he faced a maximum fine of $1,000,000. As the amount of restitution imposed was less than the maximum potential fine cited by the district court, Harris cannot show that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s omission. <em>See United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 395 (5th Cir.2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
