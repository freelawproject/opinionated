Correa and Gomes argue that their sentences are unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. Correa and Gomes, citizens of Brazil, entered the United States on the same day. Within one month, the two men established a residence in Miami, Florida; twice installed skimming devices and a camera on an automatic teller machine used by 87 debit cardholders; and used the account information stolen from some of those cardholders to rent videotapes and withdraw $500 from a customer of JP Morgan Chase Bank. The district court reasonably determined that the statutory purposes of sentencing, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, were best served by imposing a sentence at the high end of Correa\u2019s and Gomes\u2019s advisory guideline range of 10 to 16 months of imprisonment for their roles in the conspiracy that would run consecutive to a mandatory term of 24 months of imprisonment for stealing personal identification information, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1028A(a)(l), (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-18\">Correa and Gomes argue that the district court failed to consider any mitigating factors other than their acceptance of responsibility, but the district court found their arguments in mitigation unpersuasive. The district court rejected Correa\u2019s arguments that he had been gainfully employed in Brazil and had been influenced by Gomes and Gomes\u2019s argument that he had not transferred the identity information to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-19\">Correa and Gomes also argue that the district court based the sentence exclusively on its finding that they entered the United States intending to steal identity information, but the district court took into account the \u201cegregious\u201d nature of the crimes; Correa\u2019s and Gomes\u2019s admissions that the total intended loss was $43,040.13; and the agreement of the government to dismiss five additional counts of identity theft. And Correa invited any error by admitting during his sentencing hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>that a strong inference could be drawn that he and Gomes entered the country to steal other persons\u2019 identities. <em>See United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009). Correa\u2019s and Gomes\u2019s sentences to a term within the advisory guideline range are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We AFFIRM Correa\u2019s and Gomes\u2019s sentences.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
