He argues that the district court erred in denying a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction for his minor role in the offense. Sanchez-Ensaldo contends that he was entitled to the reduction because he acted merely as a courier.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The district court\u2019s refusal to grant Sanchez-Ensaldo a two-level reduction for being a minor participant was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Sanchez-Ensaldo\u2019s courier status did not entitle him to a role adjustment because a defendant may be a courier without being \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, </em>885 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir.1989). Sanchez-Ensaldo\u2019s attempt to import a gross weight of 66.92 kilograms of marijuana provided an indispensable service to the drug-trafficking offense and was essential to its success. <em>See Brown, </em>54 F.3d at 241; <em>see also United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). Moreover, Sanchez-Ensaldo was to be paid a large sum of money for his role in the activity and was solely responsible for transporting the marijuana to its final destination in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Based on the foregoing, it cannot be said that Sanchez-Ensaldo was peripheral to the advancement of the criminal activity and thus a minor participant. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Pursuant to 5th Cir.
