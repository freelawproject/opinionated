He argues that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>court plainly erred in failing to advise him of his right to plead not guilty and to persist in a not-guilty plea, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">As Brown concedes, he did not raise this issue in the district court and, therefore, review is limited to plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To show plain error, Brown must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To demonstrate an effect on his substantial rights based on the district court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 11, Brown \u201cmust show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">At rearraignment, the district court did not advise Brown that he had the right to plead not guilty or to persist in a not-guilty plea.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, such admonishment was implicit in the court\u2019s inquiry whether Brown understood the consequences of choosing to plead guilty, whether he wished to waive his constitutional rights and enter a guilty plea, and whether, after being advised of the factual basis, he wished to plead guilty or not guilty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in the record indicates that the district court\u2019s omission was a factor that affected Brown\u2019s decision to plead guilty. On appeal, Brown does not argue that he would not have pleaded guilty if the district court had advised him that he had the right to plead not guilty and to persist in a not-guilty plea. Because Brown has not shown that the district court\u2019s failure to advise him of his right to plead not guilty affected his decision to plead guilty, Brown has not shown that the omission affected his substantial rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Brown\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Neal, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 302 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 183, 187 L.Ed.2d 125 (2013), is misplaced as it is distinguishable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, Brown has not shown plain error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
