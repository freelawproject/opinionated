He contends that the BIA erred in concluding that his conviction for sexual assault in violation of Tex. PeNal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.011(a)(1) was a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) and, thus, an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">Whether an offense is an aggravated felony is a purely legal question that we review de novo. <em>Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir.2013). Our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent the IJ\u2019s decision affected the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-22\">Unlike <em>Rodriguez, </em>Orihuela\u2019s indictment alleged that the victim\u2019s lack of consent occurred because she was unconscious and physically unable to resist, as set forth in \u00a7 22.011(b)(3). We have held that when the lack of consent is achieved because the victim is unconscious, the offense \u201ccarries with it the ever-present possibility that the victim may .figure out what\u2019s really going on and decide to resist, in turn requiring the perpetrator to resort to actual physical restraint.\u201d <em>Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Rodriguez, </em>705 F.3d at 214. Thus, pursuant to the modified categorical approach, Orihue-la\u2019s conviction for sexual assault was a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) because it inherently involved a substantial risk that intentional physical force would be used in the commission of the offense. <em>Cf. Rodriguez, </em>705 F.3d at 212-15. Because the BIA did not err in concluding that Orihue-la\u2019s sexual assault conviction was an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), we do not reach Orihuela\u2019s contention that the IJ erred in concluding that his sexual assault conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Accordingly, Orihuela\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
