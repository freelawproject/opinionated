Thereafter, Lavergne filed a civil rights complaint against John Faulk. The district court dismissed Lavergne\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims for failure to state a claim because Faulk was not a state actor for Section 1983 purposes and, in the alternative, as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Additionally, the district court dismissed Lavergne\u2019s Louisiana state law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">This court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, applying the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-21\">Lavergne argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim because Faulk assumed the role of a state actor by investigating and reporting information to the police. For a private citizen, such as Faulk, to be held liable under Section 1983, \u201cthe plaintiff must allege and prove that the citizen conspired with or acted in concert with state actors.\u201d <em>Mylett v. Jeane, </em>879 F.2d 1272, 1275 (5th Cir.1989). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>plaintiff satisfies this burden by alleging and proving: \u201c(1) an agreement between the private and public defendants to commit an illegal act and (2) a deprivation of constitutional rights. Allegations that are merely conclusory, without reference to specific facts, will not suffice.\u201d <em>Priester v. Lowndes Cnty., </em>354 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Here, the district court correctly determined that Lavergne\u2019s complaint failed to allege that Faulk conspired with a state actor. Although Lavergne alleged in his complaint that Faulk lied to the police and possibly to the grand jury, he failed to allege an agreement between Faulk and the police, or any other state actor, to commit an illegal act. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it dismissed Lavergne\u2019s claims against Faulk for failure to state a claim. <em>See id. </em>In this same vein, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lavergne\u2019s motions to amend his complaint because the amendments were futile in light of his failure to state a claim. <em>See Leal v. McHugh, </em>731 F.3d 405, 417 (5th Cir.2013). In light of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982). To the extent Lavergne raises new claims on appeal, we do not address them. <em>See Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
