He does not challenge the BIA\u2019s holding that his motion to reopen was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) but, rather, argues only that the BIA abused its discretion by holding that (1) the departure bar set forth in \u00a7 1003.2(d) prevented it from exercising its sua sponte authority to reopen and (2) even if the departure bar did not apply, sua sponte reopening pursuant to \u00a7 1003.2(a) was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">Contrary to Martinez\u2019s assertions, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider his challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). As Martinez\u2019s motion to reopen was time barred, we need not address his arguments regarding the BIA\u2019s application of the departure bar. <em>See id. </em>His petitions for review are DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
