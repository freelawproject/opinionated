BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Appellee Celia E. Corrad is a Chapter 7 debtor. She owns real property in Yal-aha, Florida that is encumbered by two mortgages. The balance of the first hen exceeds the fair market value of the property, rendering the second lien, which appellant Bank of America, N.A. holds, completely \u201cunderwater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">On November 26, 2013, Corrad moved the bankruptcy court to declare Bank of America\u2019s interest in her property to be unsecured and void under \u00a7 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d). Relying on <em>In re McNeal, </em>735 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir.2012), the bankruptcy court granted Corrad\u2019s motion on May 12, 2014. Bank of America appealed that order to the district court, where it moved for a summary affirmance. The district court granted Bank of America\u2019s motion on July 21, 2014, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">When the district court affirms an order of the bankruptcy court, we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision independently of the district court. <em>In re TOUSA, Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir.2012). We review <em>de novo </em>the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">III.ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Section 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]o the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d). In <em>Folendore v. United States Small Business Administration, </em>we interpreted the above statutory language to hold that even an allowed claim can be deemed voidable if it is wholly unsecured. 862 F.2d 1537, 1538-40 (11th Cir.1989). Thus, under <em>Folendore, </em>a debtor can move a bankruptcy court to strip off an underwater lien. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">Three years after the <em>Folendore </em>decision, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992), which Bank of America argues \u201csquarely repudiated <em>Folendore\u2019s </em>interpretation of section 506(d).\u201d Bank of America claims that <em>\u201cFolendore </em>[ ] could not have survived <em>Dewsnup.\u201d </em>Unfortunately for Bank of America, we considered and rejected this same argument in our 2012 <em>McNeal </em>decision. 735 F.3d at 1265-66. There, although we acknowledged <em>Dewsnup\u2019s </em>seeming disavowal of <em>Folendore\u2019s </em>\u201cplain language analysis\u201d of \u00a7 506(d), we declined to deviate from that opinion because <em>Dewsnup </em>was \u201cnot \u2018clearly on point,\u2019 \u201d as it \u201cdisallowed only a \u2018strip down\u2019 of a partially secured mortgage lien and did not address a \u2018strip off of a wholly unsecured lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265. Consequently, <em>McNeal </em>held that <em>Folendore </em>remained the controlling precedent within this Circuit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">Under our prior precedent rule, we are bound by this Court\u2019s prior decisions \u201cunless and until [they are] overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>1246 (11th Cir.2003). Bank of America argues that <em>Folendore </em>was wrongly decided, but concedes that it and <em>McNeal </em>remain binding precedent and control this case. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court did not err by permitting Corrad to strip off Bank of America\u2019s underwater lien, and the decision of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
