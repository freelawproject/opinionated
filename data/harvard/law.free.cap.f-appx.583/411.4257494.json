Thereafter, Lavergne filed a civil rights complaint against Kent Kloster. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous, for failure to state a claim, as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-23\">This court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, applying the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-24\">In his brief, Lavergne contends that his claims were not untimely filed and that <em>Heck </em>does not apply because his claims for libel and slander are not grounds to overturn his convictions and because Kloster\u2019s false statements were not used in the factual basis for his guilty plea convictions. Even if his claims were not all time barred, Lavergne cannot overcome the <em>Heck </em>bar. Lavergne\u2019s claims arise out of the Shunick and Pate murder prosecutions, and they reflect his view that the prosecutions and his resulting guilty pleas were tainted by Kloster\u2019s false statements. If the district court were to award Lavergne damages as to any of these claims, it would implicitly call into question the validity of his convictions. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Penley v. Collin Cnty., Tex., </em>446 F.3d 572, 573 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Lavergne v. Sanford, </em>570 Fed.Appx. 385 (5th Cir.2014). Nor was it error for the district court to dismiss the Heck-barred claims with prejudice. <em>See Johnson v. McElveen, </em>101 F.3d 423, 424 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-25\">Neither did the district court abuse its discretion in denying his motion to appoint counsel or his motion to amend his complaint because the amendments were futile in light of the <em>Heck </em>bar. <em>See Leal v. McHugh, </em>731 F.3d 405, 417 (5th Cir.2013); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982). To the extent Lavergne raises new claims on appeal, we do not address them. <em>See Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
