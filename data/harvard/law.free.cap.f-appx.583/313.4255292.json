The district court imposed a sentence of 84 months of imprisonment, which was within the applicable sentencing guidelines range. On appeal, Ramirez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed on Ramirez under an abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A sentence imposed within the guidelines range is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On appeal, Ramirez contends that his sentence is unreasonable because he is less culpable than the ordinary immigration offender given his cultural assimilation to the United States. The record shows that the district court received Ramirez\u2019s statements and his counsel\u2019s arguments on cultural assimilation. The district court also stated that it considered Ramirez\u2019s criminal history and the factors outlined in Section 3553(a) when determining his sentence; in particular, the need for deterrence, protection of the public, and the need to avoid sentencing disparities. Although Ramirez urges that the district court erred by assigning insufficient weight to his cultural assimilation, his disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the Section 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness we accord to a sentence imposed within the guidelines range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Pursuant to 5th Cir.
