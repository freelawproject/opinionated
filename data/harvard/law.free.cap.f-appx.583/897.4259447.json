Following a review of the record and Mr. Marts\u2019 brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Mr. Marts stated in his complaint that he was not challenging his 2008 state felony conviction, but all of his claims were based on alleged errors committed during or related to his criminal case (e.g., the improper grant of a mistrial, a \u201cfabricated competency hearing,\u201d the lack of a transcript for the competency hearing, his commitment to a mental health facility, the state appellate court\u2019s issuance of a per curiam affirmance), and he maintained that he was in custody due to \u201cfraudulent documentation.\u201d He alleged denial of access to the courts in his sole claim and sought unspecified declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissed the complaint with prejudice as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The district court reasoned that the judges and lawyers were immune from liability given the allegations of the complaint. With respect to the other court personnel named as defendants, Mr. Marts failed to provide any factual allegations suggesting he had non-frivolous claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">In his appellate brief, Mr. Marts does not address the district court\u2019s bases for dismissal. Instead, he argues in concluso-ry fashion that the mistrial voided his conviction, that the district court was required to address the merits of his claim, and that he was denied a meaningful right of redress, which resulted in a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">We have held that when \u201can appellant fails to challenge properly on appeal one of the grounds on which the district court based its judgment, he is deemed to have abandoned any challenge of that ground, and it follows that the judgment is due to be affirmed.\u201d <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014). As in <em>Sapuppo, </em>\u201c[t]hat is the situation here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Marts has not challenged the district court\u2019s federal immunity analysis with respect to the judges and lawyers he sued. Nor has he explained how he has non-frivolous federal claims against the court personnel he named as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Marts\u2019 complaint is affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">. Mr. Marts does briefly address the immunity issue, but he focusses on state sovereign immunity, not the immunity given to judges, prosecutors, and public defenders by federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-18\">. To the extent that Mr. Marts is challenging his conviction in his brief, his remedy is habe-as corpus, not a \u00a7 1983 suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
