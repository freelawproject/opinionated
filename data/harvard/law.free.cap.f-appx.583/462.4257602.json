Relying on <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), Preston argues that the district court erroneously determined that one of his prior convictions was a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), resulting in a higher advisory sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The district court determined that because Preston was raising a claim of sentencing error rather than a challenge to the manner in which his sentence was being carried out, his claim was outside the scope of \u00a7 2241. The court also determined that Preston had not met the criteria for proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which allows a federal prisoner to attack the legality of his conviction or sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can show that the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">A prisoner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective must make a claim (i) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). <em>Descamps </em>has no effect on whether the facts of Preston\u2019s case would support his conviction for the substantive offense; therefore, it is not a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision indicating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See, e.g., Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, Tex., </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Moreover, claims relating to sentencing determinations do not fall within the savings clause and are not cognizable under \u00a7 2241, even where the petitioner asserts a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d or actual innocence relating to the alleged sentencing errors. <em>See, e.g., Torres v. Young, </em>457 Fed.Appx. 427, 429 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam); <em>Bey v. Tamez, </em>453 Fed.Appx. 445, 446 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
