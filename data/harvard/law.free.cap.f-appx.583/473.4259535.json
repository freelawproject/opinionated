Applying the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement, the district court sentenced Davis to 180 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-25\">Davis argues on appeal that he is not subject to the ACCA enhancement because the Louisiana offense of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling is not a violent felony as defined by the ACCA, and that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is constitutionally void for vagueness. The Government has filed a motion for a summary affirmance, or, alternatively, for an extension of time within which to file a brief, contending that Davis\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent. The Government correctly concedes that Davis\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar his appeal. <em>See United States v. House, </em>394 Fed.Appx. 122, 124 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>434 F.3d 767, 770 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-26\">With respect to Davis\u2019s first argument, we have held that the crime of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling under Louisiana law involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>632 F.3d 894, 898 (5th Cir.2011). Although <em>O\u2019Connor </em>addressed whether unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling was a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, <em>id., </em>we have \u201cpreviously applied our holdings under the residual clause of the ACCA to analyze the definition of crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2, and vice versa.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>602 F.3d 669, 673 n. 1 (5th Cir.2010). In a recent unpublished decision, we concluded that an intervening Supreme Court decision did not overrule <em>O\u2019Connor </em>and held that the Louisiana unauthorized entry offense was a violent felony under the ACCA <em>United States v. Arteaga, </em>436 Fed.Appx. 343, 350-51 (5th Cir.2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>While the parties contend that <em>Arteaga </em>forecloses Davis\u2019s argument, that decision is not precedent. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.4. Nevertheless, given the holding of <em>O\u2019Connor </em>and the persuasive analysis in <em>Arteaga, </em>we agree with the parties that Davis\u2019s argument fails. Davis\u2019s constitutional challenge to the ACCA is foreclosed, as he concedes. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007); <em>United States v. Gore, </em>636 F.3d 728, 742 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
