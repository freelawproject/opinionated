For the reasons explained, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">Appellants worked for the Bexar County Constables\u2019 office. After $1,000 disappeared from a safe in a precinct office, they were charged with stealing the funds. The charges were later dismissed. Appellants filed a state-law malicious prosecution claim (\u201cstate-law claim\u201d) against the County in Texas court. After the court dismissed the state-law claim on state sovereign immunity grounds, Appellants amended their complaint to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The County removed the case to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-24\">The County moved for summary judgment, arguing that Appellants failed to adduce evidence that a County custom or policy caused their alleged injuries. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (holding that local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 unless government\u2019s custom or policy leads to alleged injury). The County also maintained that Appellants had alleged a freestanding malicious prosecution action, which cannot serve as the basis for a \u00a7 1983 claim. Appellants contended that they did not have to allege the existence of a custom or policy in order to state a claim for malicious prosecution under \u00a7 1983, and that the Fifth Circuit recognizes a freestanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>malicious prosecution action. The district court found that Appellants had failed to adduce any evidence of a County custom or policy and granted the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>City of Alexandria v. Brown, </em>740 F.3d 339, 350 (5th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure material on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>No genuine dispute of fact exists if the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>We view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>We may affirm summary judgment on any basis raised below and supported by the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">Appellants argue that after <em>Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939 (5th Cir.2003) (en banc), they are not required to show that a County custom or policy caused their alleged injuries. Thus they argue that the district court erred by requiring them to adduce evidence of a custom or policy to avoid summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">We reject this argument. Appellants misread <em>Castellano, </em>which makes it clear that there is no such thing as a freestanding malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See id. </em>at 942 (\u201cWe decide that \u2018malicious prosecution\u2019 standing alone is no violation of the United States Constitution, and that to proceed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 such a claim must rest upon a denial of rights secured under federal and not state law.\u201d). More importantly, this court does not have the authority to ignore either Congress\u2019s or the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that municipalities are not liable under \u00a7 1983 unless \u201cofficial policy [i]s the moving force of the constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018. Until Congress amends \u00a7 1983 or the Supreme Court overturns <em>Monell, </em>every plaintiff who seeks to hold a municipality hable under \u00a7 1983 must show that the municipality\u2019s <em>\u201cown </em>illegal acts\u201d caused the alleged injury. <em>Connick v. Thompson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1350, 1359, 179 L.Ed.2d 417 (2011) (quoting <em>Pembaur v. Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 479, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Appellants also contend that the district court improperly dismissed their state-law claim and urge the court to remand for trial on this claim. Appellants fail to adduce any evidence that they pressed a state-law claim before the district court. Appellants also fail to respond to the County\u2019s record citations, which suggest that Appellants did not press the state-law claim below. Because Appellants raise the state-law claim for the first time on appeal, we will not consider it here. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">For the reasons explained, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-16\">. Appellants also filed a motion for a new trial, which the district court construed as a motion to \u2022 alter or amend judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). The court once again held that Appellants failed to adduce any evidence of a County custom or policy and denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
