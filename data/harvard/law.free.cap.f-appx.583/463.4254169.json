We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Applying the harmless error doctrine, we reject Felts\u2019s contention that it was reversible error to enhance his base offense level by seven levels \u2014 for maintaining a premises for drug manufacture or distribution, managing or supervising a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, and obstructing justice \u2014 and to decline to reduce the base offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 713-14 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009). Even if the district court erred as to every sentencing enhancement that Felts challenges and as to the issue of acceptance of responsibility, his guidelines sentencing range would be 360 months to 480 months after considering the statutory maximum limitation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(viii). The record makes clear that the district court would have imposed the same sentence without the enhancements. The record establishes that the district court believed that the maximum sentence, 480 months, was the appropriate sentence in light of Felts\u2019s history and characteristics. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(viii). Under these circumstances, it was harmless error to omit any offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and to apply the enhancements of which Felts now complains. <em>See Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d at 713-14; <em>Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 752-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">We review for plain error Felts\u2019s claim that, under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), the drug quantity found by the district court based on the presentence report was a fact that should have been found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Hinojosa, </em>749 F.3d 407, 411 (5th Cir.2014). Felts contends that the district court\u2019s factfinding effectively raised his statutory minimum sentence from five years to ten and violated the holding in <em>Alleyne. </em>Felts does not allege and the record does not indicate that the district court concluded that a 10-year statutory minimum sentence applied to him. Rather, the district court imposed a guidelines sentence based dn relevant conduct, and the facts did not have to be admitted by Felts or found by a jury. <em>See Hinojosa, </em>749 F.3d at 412-13. Felts\u2019s inability to \u201cdemonstrate any error at all\u201d means that he cannot prevail on this issue on plain error review. <em>United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.2012); see <em>Hinojosa, </em>749 F.3d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">Finally, we find no merit in Felts\u2019s contention that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because a guidelines sentence was too severe to satisfy statutory sentencing requirements. The district court believed that a 480-month sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>was the appropriate sentence in light of Felts\u2019s history and characteristics. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Felts\u2019s suggestion that this court reweigh those factors is unavailing. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, Felts\u2019s guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Felts offers insufficient bases for forgoing application of that presumption and supplanting the sentence selected by the district court. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
