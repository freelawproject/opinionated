California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Lara has filed responses and moves for the appointment of new counsel or, alternatively, resentenc-ing or a sentence reduction. Although Lara\u2019s responses also raise claims of inef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>fective assistance of counsel, those claims were not presented before the district court. We therefore decline to consider the claims without prejudice to Lara\u2019s raising these claims on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Foy, </em>28 F.3d 464, 476 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he general rule in this circuit is that a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>959 F.2d 1297, 1301 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1007, 113 S.Ct. 621, 121 L.Ed.2d 554 (1992))).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the record presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. We have also reviewed Lara\u2019s responses, which also do not raise a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Specifically, Lara contends that the district court erred in applying the drug trafficking enhancement because his 2010 Texas conviction was for possession, rather than delivery, of a controlled substance. Lara relies on a state court order, which seems to strike the words \u201cwith intent to deliver\u201d from his indictment. That order is dated March 8, 2008. Inconsistent with that order, Lara\u2019s plea agreement and final judgment, which are both dated January 25, 2010, reflect that Lara was convicted of \u201cunlawful delivery of a controlled substance.\u201d Accepting Lara\u2019s argument would require us to invalidate the state court judgment. Accordingly, Lara\u2019s challenge is properly charaterized as a collateral attack on the prior judgment, which should be brought through a postconvietion proceeding in Texas or federal habeas review. <em>See United States v. Longstreet, </em>603 F.3d 273, 276-77 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201c[Ajbsent an allegation that the defendant was denied counsel in the prior proceeding, a district court sentencing a defendant may not entertain a collateral attack on a prior conviction used to enhance the sentence unless such an attack is otherwise recognized by law.\u201d); <em>see also Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 497, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994). Because we find no nonfrivolous issue for appeal, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Lara\u2019s motions for the appointment of new counsel or, alternatively, resentencing or a sentence reduction are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
