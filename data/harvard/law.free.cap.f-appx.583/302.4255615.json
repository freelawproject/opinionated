He argues that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-22\">It is unclear whether Resendez\u2019s failure to formally object to the reasonableness of the sentence after it was imposed results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008) (reviewing under the abuse of discretion standard of review where the arguments were presented to the district court). We need not decide the issue because Resendez is not entitled to relief even if his sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The record reflects that the district court considered the advisory guidelines range of imprisonment, Resendez-Rodriguez\u2019s arguments for a more lenient sentence, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before determining that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Resendez-Rodriguez has not shown that the district court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or to any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554-55; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
