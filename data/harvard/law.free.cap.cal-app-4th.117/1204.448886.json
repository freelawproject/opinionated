The juvenile corn! took custody of appellant from his parents, placed appellant in the custody and control of the probation officer, ordered appellant committed to the Camp Community Placement Program for a minimum of 120 days, and specified the maximum period of physical confinement as four years nine months. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude the 120-day minimum period of confinement in camp is authorized by Welfare and Institutions Code section 730. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we address appellant\u2019s remaining contentions concerning sufficiency of the evidence, discretion to declare the offenses to be misdemeanors, and the camp placement order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">i.-m.*</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">IV. <em>Authority To Order Minimum Period of Camp Confinement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-15\">Appellant contends the juvenile court exceeded its statutory authority when it imposed a minimum period of confinement in camp.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>the probation officer, not the juvenile court, is authorized to determine a minor\u2019s minimum period of confinement in camp. He argues further that a minimum period of confinement in camp set at the outset by the juvenile court undermines the rehabilitative objectives of the juvenile law, in that it diminishes the juvenile\u2019s incentive to progress toward rehabilitation. Although a minimum period of confinement in camp is not expressly authorized by statute, we conclude that such an order is authorized by the broad discretion afforded to juvenile courts to make dispositional orders and impose conditions under Welfare and Institutions Code section 730. <em>(In re Bernardino S. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 613, 622 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Section 730 of the Welfare and Institutions Code authorizes the juvenile court to place a delinquent ward under the care, custody, and control of the probation officer by a camp placement order. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 897, &amp; fn. 20 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].) \u201cWhen a minor is adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described by Section 602 [of the Welfare and Institutions Code], the court. . . may commit the minor to a juvenile . . . camp.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 730, subd. (a).) \u201cWhen a ward described in subdivision (a) is . . . committed to the care, custody, and control of the probation officer, the court may make any and all reasonable orders for the conduct of the ward. . . . The court may impose and require any and all reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 730 does not expressly authorize the imposition of any minimum period of confinement in camp.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Welfare and Institutions Code section 730 has been broadly interpreted to authorize a juvenile court to order a juvenile confined to juvenile hall for a period of time as a condition of probation. <em>(In re Lance W., supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 896-899; <em>In re Ricardo M. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 744, 750-751 [125 Cal.Rptr. 291].) The purpose of such a confinement order is to impress upon the juvenile the seriousness of the misconduct, without the imposition of a more serious commitment. <em>(In re Ricardo M., supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d at p. 749.) The confinement order informs the juvenile that continued misconduct will lead to even more serious consequences and thus encourages rehabilitation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In our view, a similar rationale supports an order for a minimum period of camp confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>A juvenile court does not lose direct supervision over a juvenile committed to the care, custody, and control of the probation officer by a camp placement. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 880, 881.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The juvenile court\u2019s continuing authority to supervise a juvenile committed to camp is evidenced by its statutory authority to make reasonable conduct orders and impose reasonable conditions in connection with a camp placement order. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 730, subd. (b).) In this respect, a camp placement order is to be distinguished from a commitment to the Youth Authority, which deprives the juvenile court of any authority to directly supervise the juvenile. <em>(In re Owen E. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 398, 404-405 [154 Cal.Rptr. 204, 592 P.2d 720]; <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 237-238 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345]; <em>In re Allen N. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 513, 515-516 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 902].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the juvenile court did not exceed its authority when it ordered a minimum period of confinement as part of its camp placement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">The orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">Turner, P.
