J .</author>\n<p id=\"AlJ\">For his nine-day crime spree a jury convicted appellant, Tom Blake, of 10 counts of robbery, one count of attempted robbery, one count of catjacking, one count of burglary, one count of petty theft with a prior and one count of vehicle theft. The jury also found true numerous enhancement allegations of personal use of a dangerous or deadly weapon and of personally inflicting great bodily injury. The trial court sentenced appellant to a total term of 51 years and eight months as a second \u201cstrike\u201d offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Appellant contends the evidence does not support the finding he used a noxious or caustic chemical spray as a dangerous or deadly weapon and thus the enhancements must be reversed on three of the counts. He also argues evidence he pushed one of his victims is insufficient evidence of force to sustain one of the robbery convictions. Regarding the same count, appellant argues the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury with a definition of the quantum of force required to sustain a robbery conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Appellant next claims the enhancement imposed for having inflicted great bodily injury must be reversed because the information failed to provide adequate notice of the enhancement allegation in connection with the robbery count on which it was imposed. Finally, appellant argues the trial court improperly used the fact of his prior conviction to both impose a five-year sentence enhancement under Penal Code section 667 and a one-year enhancement for having served a prior prison term. The People concede the latter error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We will modify the judgment to strike the one-year enhancement imposed for having served a prior prison term. As so modified, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>La Tiendita Santa Barbara\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Counts 1 and 2:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">In the evening of November 16, 2001, appellant entered a women\u2019s clothing store called La Tiendita Santa Barbara in West Hollywood. He was dressed in men\u2019s clothing. However, he was wearing mascara, eye shadow and had his dyed hair wrapped in a bandana. He had shaved or heavily plucked eyebrows and an effeminate manner. He had a prominent Adam\u2019s apple and a crooked nose which looked as though it had once been broken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">Sales clerks Luis and Carol Ruano were working in the store when appellant came in. They noticed appellant and both got the impression he was \u201chigh\u201d on drugs because his eyes were red, he was sweating profusely, and he was nervous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">Appellant selected several items of clothing and brought them to the counter. Luis Ruano totaled the amount of the items which came to $78. Appellant seemed to reach for his wallet but then said, \u201cNo, fuck that.\u201d He drew two knives, a box cutter in one hand and a three-blade knife in the other, and brandished them at the sales clerks. One of the knives came within inches of Carol\u2019s face. Appellant told them, \u201cIf anybody moves, I am going to fuck you up.\u201d Appellant grabbed the clothes and ran out of the store. Appellant ran right past sales clerk, Juan Ruano, who was watching the outdoor clothes display.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">All three Ruanos positively identified appellant from a photo array and again at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">\n<em>Sabina\u2019s Wigs\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Count 3:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">At 1:00 p.m. on November 18, 2001, Sabina Hersco was in her store, Sabina\u2019s Wigs located on Fairfax near Melrose Avenue. Hersco was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>fitting a wig for Zhaleh Javanfard, an Orthodox Jewish woman whose religion and tradition requires her to cover her hair in the presence of men other than her husband. She was shocked and horrified when appellant walked into the store. Both women thought the door was locked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">Appellant started looking around the store. He wore a bandana over his hair, a woman\u2019s crop top and bell-bottom pants. Appellant had shaved or plucked eyebrows. Hersco asked appellant to leave and told him to come back some other time. Appellant pulled out a canister and told Hersco to \u201cback up, back up.\u201d According to Hersco, appellant took the \u201cpepper spray and he put in my eyes [\u00ed\u00edc].\u201d He also sprayed the substance around the store. Appellant grabbed two long human hair wigs worth several hundred dollars and fled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">The spray caused Hersco\u2019s eyes to tear. She could not see and could not breathe. She began coughing and gasping for air and her face became red. Hersco screamed her eyes were burning. When Javanfard came to her assistance she too began coughing and sneezing and could not breathe. Javanfard called 911 and the operator sent paramedics to assist them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Javanfard identified appellant from a photo array, at the preliminary hearing, at trial and from a videotape taken by a security camera in the store.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\n<em>Ultra Vixen\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Count 4:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">Around 2:30 p.m., sales manager Jenifer Weber was working at a lingerie store called Ultra Vixen on Wilcox in West Hollywood when appellant entered the store. He was wearing a dirty crop top blouse and low cut jeans with a rope belt. He had shaved eyebrows and wore old, smeared makeup. He went in and out of the store, explaining he was waiting for his boyfriend to pay for his purchases. Appellant asked Weber how a particular belt buckle worked. As she approached to explain, appellant pulled out a canister she believed to be pepper spray. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t move bitch,\u201d and sprayed the chemical into her eyes from about eight inches away. Appellant grabbed several rhinestone belts, jeans and other clothes worth about $400 and ran out of the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">Weber ran outside. Her eyes burned from the spray. She also could not breathe for 10 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">Weber identified appellant from a photo array and at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-12\"><em>Stephen Chapek\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Count </em>6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-13\">Around 7:00 p.m. on November 18, 2001, Stephen Chapek was in his car looking for a parking space near his residence in Silver Lake. Near Sunset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Boulevard and Golden Gate he saw appellant and another person walking together. Appellant wore a tube top, makeup and had long dark hair. Both persons were dressed as women and he assumed they were streetwalkers. Appellant and his friend approached Chapek\u2019s car and asked for a ride to Hollywood. Once he spoke, Chapek realized appellant was a man. Chapek refused but appellant and his friend got into his car anyway and would not leave. Appellant claimed to be sick. Chapek testified he felt sorry for appellant and wanted to avoid a confrontation so he agreed to drive them to Hollywood. While driving, appellant asked whether Chapek wanted him to \u201csuck his dick.\u201d Chapek declined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">Chapek stopped at a donut shop near Hollywood and Highland as appellant requested. As his companion got out of the car appellant demanded $20. Chapek refused. According to Chapek, appellant took a canister out of his purse and told him, \u201cGive me money or I am going to mace you.\u201d Chapek gave appellant the $1 he had in his wallet and appellant left. Chapek then noticed his cell phone was missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Chapek identified appellant from a photo array and at trial. He recognized the distinctive crook in appellant\u2019s nose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\n<em>Arsen Mkrtchyan\u2014Carjacking, Dangerous Weapon, Count 7:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">On November 20, 2001, around midnight Arsen Mkrtchyan was driving down Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, purportedly on his way to pick up his brother from his work place at Hollywood and Highland. He drove a 2000 silver Daewoo with tinted windows. He saw appellant in women\u2019s clothing. He had on black pants, a pink shirt, a longhaired wig and makeup. He stopped his car near appellant with the intention of asking for sex. Appellant walked over, got into the passenger seat and asked Mkrtchyan what he was \u201clooking for.\u201d Appellant coughed and stated he had not worked on his voice yet. Mkrtchyan stated he wanted oral sex and appellant asked how much money he had. Mkrtchyan replied he had seven dollars. Appellant asked Mkrtchyan to take his penis out. He complied. Appellant began to fondle Mkrtchyan\u2019s penis and then suggested they go to appellant\u2019s place instead. Appellant provided directions and then told Mkrtchyan to stop in a parking lot at Tamarind and Santa Monica. Appellant started fumbling around in his purse claiming he was looking for a condom. Appellant pulled out a box cutter. Appellant brought the knife close to Mkrtchyan\u2019s face and told him to get out of the car, \u201cor I am going to shank you.\u201d Appellant grabbed the car keys, opened the door and yelled to a man standing nearby in the parking lot. Mkrtchyan fled, fearing the two men were working together. Appellant got out of the car to speak with the man. Mkrtchyan took the opportunity to run back to his car to retrieve his wallet and cell phone. Appellant returned and drove off in Mkrtchyan\u2019s car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Mkrtchyan used his cell phone to call 911. When police arrived he told them he had picked up a hitchhiker who had stolen his car. He was too embarrassed to admit he had been carjacked by a transgender prostitute he had picked up for the purpose of having sex. When his car was recovered days later the interior was filled with trash. There were rotting groceries in the trunk as well as numerous flyers advertising gay parties. In addition to his car key, his key ring also had numerous additional unfamiliar keys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Mkrtchyan identified appellant at trial, stating he recognized appellant\u2019s eyes, eyebrows and crooked nose. Mkrtchyan also recalled appellant had a tattoo on his left bicep area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\n<em>Antenna Clothing\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Count 5:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">In the late afternoon of November 20, 2001, Hamid Habibian and Antonette Jackson were working as sales clerks at the Antenna Clothing store on Hollywood Boulevard. Appellant entered the store wearing men\u2019s clothing but with a bandana around his head. He had shaved or plucked eyebrows. Jackson heard another employee yell out appellant was running out of the store with merchandise. Jackson started to pursue him. Appellant turned and brandished an eight-inch knife. Habibian saw appellant pull out what appeared to him to be a hunting knife and saw him make jabbing motions at the employees to ensure they kept their distance. Appellant fled the store with women\u2019s clothing valued between $400 and $500. Habibian saw appellant get into the passenger side of a waiting silver sedan with tinted windows. Jackson got a partial license plate number and called police. The car turned out to be Mkrtchyan\u2019s silver Daewoo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">Jackson identified appellant from a photo array, at the preliminary hearing and at trial. Habibian testified appellant resembled the robber because of his high forehead, thin eyebrows, and distinctive nose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\n<em>No No Price\u2014Robbery of Lionel Levy, Petit Theft of No No Price, Counts 8 and 9:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">Lionel Levy owns a women\u2019s clothing store on Sunset Boulevard called No No Price. At approximately 6:30 in the evening of November 20, 2001, appellant entered the store. Levy recognized appellant as someone who had been in his store several times before. Levy discovered something missing from his store after each of appellant\u2019s visits. Appellant was dressed as a \u201cgirl\u201d with tight women\u2019s jeans and he was wearing makeup. Appellant tried on several pairs of jeans in a fitting room. He put on his own jeans over a pair of the store\u2019s jeans and ran from the store. Levy tried to block appellant\u2019s escape at the doorway. Appellant shoved Levy out of his way using both hands. Appellant jumped into a waiting car, which immediately sped away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Levy and his employee identified appellant from a photo array and at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqX\">\n<em>Enzo Barbera\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Great Bodily Injury, Count 10:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. on November 22, 2001, Enzo Barbera was driving in the area of Hollywood and Highland purportedly to look at the new Kodak Theater. He had his left arm resting on the open window on the driver\u2019s side of his car. At a stoplight appellant came to his open window and grabbed his arm. Appellant was clean-shaven, skinny, and wearing a bandana. Appellant demanded money. Barbera gave appellant the $40 he had. Appellant told Barbera, \u201cGive me everything or I will cut you.\u201d Barbera hesitated and appellant cut his wrist area with a knife. Barbera threw his wallet at appellant. His wallet contained his credit cards, driver\u2019s license, Social Security card and other papers. Barbera drove himself to a hospital for treatment. Barbera suffered nerve and tendon damage. By the time of trial he still suffered numbness in his thumb and fingers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Barbera cancelled two of his three credit cards when he got home from the hospital. He forgot he had a third credit card in his wallet. Appellant used Barbera\u2019s credit card to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of items: groceries at a Ralphs store, groceries at a Pavilions market, food, telephone calls and lodging at the Hyatt Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, and cosmetics and other items from a Rite Aid drug store on Centinela Boulevard in Culver City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">Barbera was not able to identify appellant from a photo array or from the security videotape taken of someone using his stolen credit card at the Pavilions store. However, the videotape showed the checker scanning grocery items that were later found rotting in the trunk of Mkrtchyan\u2019s car when he recovered it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">\n<em>Isa Clothing\u2014Burglary, Count 11:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Douglas Ayala owns a small clothing store at the comer of Centinela and Washington Boulevards in Culver City. Around noon on November 22, 2001, there were no customers in the store. Ayala stood outside his store in the doorway. A silver car pulled into his parking lot and two men got out of the car. Appellant drove the car. He wore a sleeveless crop top, bell-bottom pants, sandals, make up and a long hairpiece. Appellant had a large nose and a long green tattoo on his upper left arm. The men walked to the nearby Rite Aid drug store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">They returned to Ayala\u2019s store carrying Rite Aid bags. For 20 to 30 minutes appellant\u2019s companion tried on women\u2019s clothes. When it came time to settle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the bill appellant handed Ayala Barbera\u2019s credit card. The man depicted in the picture on the credit card was not appellant. Barbera was nearly twice as large and did not look at all like appellant. Appellant showed Ayala a driver\u2019s license, which matched the name and picture of the person on the credit card. Ayala tried the credit card but the transaction was declined. Appellant produced a second credit card from Barbera\u2019s wallet. Ayala ran this card through the machine and received a message to call \u201ccentral unit.\u201d Ayala called and the person at \u201ccentral unit\u201d asked to speak with appellant. Ayala handed appellant the phone. Apparently in response to questions appellant took out Barbera\u2019s Social Security card and told the operator Barbera\u2019s Social Security number. Ayala heard appellant say he did not know his home phone number and Ayala watched as appellant looked through the other papers in Barbera\u2019s wallet. The person at \u201ccentral unit\u201d told Ayala the transaction was not approved and directed Ayala to return the credit card to appellant. Ayala informed appellant the sale did not go through and asked appellant\u2019s companion to take off the store\u2019s clothing he was then wearing. Appellant\u2019s companion removed the clothes he had tried on except for a pair of panties. The men gathered up their Rite Aid bags and walked outside. When they reached the car in the parking lot appellant realized he did not have the car keys. Appellant went back inside the store and started yelling at Ayala. When Ayala stated he did not have appellant\u2019s keys appellant threatened to stab him. Ayala informed appellant he had already notified police. Appellant and his companion fled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">While waiting for the police Ayala started returning the merchandise to its proper spot and found a set of keys. One key operated Mkrtchyan\u2019s silver car which appellant had left in the store\u2019s parking lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Ayala identified appellant from a photo lineup and again at trial. At trial, he also identified Barbera\u2019s credit cards as the cards appellant had attempted to use at his store.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\n<em>You\u2019s Liquor\u2014Attempted Robbery, Count 12:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">On November 24, 2001, Steve You was standing outside the door of his liquor store around 10:30 a.m. Appellant walked up and asked You to call him a cab. You told appellant to use the pay phone at the comer. Appellant pushed You, said he had a gun, and demanded money from You. You did not see a gun but appellant had his hands under his shirt and was pointing something at You through his shirt. You walked inside toward the register. You intended to give appellant the money he demanded. Appellant told You to hurry up and open the register. At that moment, several customers happened to enter the store at once and You felt more secure. You called 911 but told appellant he was calling him a cab. Apparently realizing You had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>called the police, appellant opened his shirt revealing a Walkman and told You he did not really have a gun. Appellant fled from the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">You identified appellant from a photo array, at the preliminary hearing and at trial. He also identified appellant as the man depicted in the liquor store\u2019s security videotape of the incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\n<em>Kara Spolsky\u2014Auto Theft, Count 13:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">Around 11:00 a.m. on November 24, 2001, Kara Spolsky was in her car waiting for the light to change at the intersection of Wilton and Lemon Grove in Hollywood. She drove a Toyota Corolla. Spolsky\u2019s car\u2019s license plate number was 4GNW105 and she had a license plate frame which said \u201cAlumni Rider University.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">While waiting for the light to change, Spolsky noticed an angry group of men surrounding appellant and another man. A very large man was waving a knife at appellant. Appellant left the group and walked down the street toward Spolsky\u2019s car. As he neared, Spolsky opened her window and asked appellant whether he needed help. Appellant said, \u201cYes,\u201d and Spolsky handed him her cell phone. Appellant asked if she would instead take them to the police station a few blocks away. Spolsky agreed and appellant and his friend got into the back seat. Appellant had a prominent nose and reddish hair. He wore a nylon pullover jacket and his fingernails were painted with pastel glitter nail polish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">After she drove away appellant asked her to drive to his grandmother\u2019s house instead. Spolsky agreed and followed appellant\u2019s directions until he asked her to stop. Once she stopped the car appellant\u2019s friend started to exit but appellant stopped him. Appellant cursed at Ms friend and the men got into a loud and angry argument. Then appellant told Spolsky he had sometMng he wanted to show her. Appellant began fumbling around in Ms jacket. Spolsky was afraid appellant might have some type of weapon. She felt tMeatened and nervous. She grabbed her cell phone and fled the car in a pamc. When she turned around, she saw her car being driven away going the opposite direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">Spolsky identified appellant from a photo array and again at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">\n<em>Jahangir A. Shirazi\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Count 15:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">Jahangir Shirazi owns a 99 Cent Store on Western Avenue in Hollywood. Around noon on November 25, 2001, there were no customers in the store. Shirazi saw a wMte car pull up and park in front. Appellant came into the 99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Cent Store and asked Shirazi for change. When Shirazi opened the register appellant pulled a knife and threatened to cut Shirazi if he did not move away. As appellant waved the knife it cut Shirazi\u2019s thumb. Appellant took between $200 and $300 and the change tray. He fled in the white car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">Shirazi\u2019s wound required stitches and later became infected. Shirazi identified appellant from a photo array, at the preliminary hearing and again at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\n<em>Payless Shoes\u2014Robbery, Dangerous Weapon, Count 16:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Veronica Rangel was the manager of the Payless Shoes store on Vine Street. Around 6:00 p.m. on November 25, 2001, appellant came into the store. He selected some shoes and slammed the boxes on the sales counter. Rangel asked whether appellant was ready to pay for his items. Appellant drew a knife with a three- or four-inch blade and waved it six inches from Rangel\u2019s face. He told her, \u201cDon\u2019t try anything. I am taking the shoes.\u201d Rangel put her hands up and backed up as far as she could behind the counter. Appellant grabbed the shoes and a few belts and left. She watched through the window as appellant got into a car. Rangel noted the car\u2019s license plate number as 4GNW105. She also noticed the license plate holder said something about Rider University. The car turned out to be Spolsky\u2019s car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">Rangel identified appellant from a photo array and at trial. She also identified the two pairs of shoes taken in the robbery</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Arrest:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">In November 2001 Los Angeles Police Officer Joseph Bezak was working as an undercover vice officer in the Hollywood area. He was cruising near Santa Monica Boulevard when he spotted appellant and stopped his car. Appellant walked over and asked whether he was a cop. Bezak said no. Appellant got into his car and asked Bezak to show him his penis to make sure he was not a police officer. Bezak told appellant he could not do it right there but might do it somewhere else. Appellant got out of his car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">A day or two later Officer Bezak received a crime alert bulletin regarding a suspect in the Hollywood area. Bezak realized the suspect was appellant. That evening Bezak and his partner returned to the same area near Santa Monica Boulevard where Bezak had seen appellant before. They found appellant at the location and arrested him. Appellant was wearing the shoes he had just stolen from the Payless Shoe store. They still had the security sensor attached. Appellant had a knife on his person when arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>A jury convicted appellant of 10 counts of second degree robbery;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of second degree attempted robbery;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of carjacking;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> one count of commercial burglary;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> one count of auto theft,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and one count of petty theft with a prior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury found true the allegations appellant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury also found true the allegation appellant personally inflicted great bodily injury on Enzo Barbera in committing the robbery alleged in count 10.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Appellant admitted having suffered a strike prior conviction in Florida for what would have been a robbery in California.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He also admitted having served a prior prison term as a result of this conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate term of 51 years and eight months in state prison.

He sprayed the chemical directly into her face and into her eye area. Her eyes started tearing. She could not see. She could not breathe. She was coughing and gasping for air. Her face turned red. She was in such distress that her customer, Javanfard, called 911 and requested paramedics. According to the 911 tape, Javanfard told the operator \u201ccome [], come please.\u201d \u201cSome man\u2019s in there spraying, sprayed them [sz'c]. Sprayed them in the face with something. I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s screaming and her eyes are burning.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Similarly, at the Ultra Vixen shop appellant sprayed Jenifer Weber in the face in order to make his escape with the loot. Before he sprayed her, Weber saw the canister he used and believed it contained pepper spray. Even though she was wearing glasses, the spray burned her eyes. She also could not breathe for at least 10 minutes. As she told the jury, being unable to breathe for so long was \u201cno joke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The jury found true the allegation appellant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon by spraying \u201can unknown caustic substance\u201d to commit the robberies at Sabina\u2019s Wigs and at the Ultra Vixen store in counts 3 and 4. The jury also found true the allegation mace was the dangerous or deadly weapon appellant used to commit the robbery in count 6 by producing a canister and threatening to \u201cmace\u201d Stephen Chapek if he did not comply with his demand for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Appellant contends these enhancements are not supported by substantial evidence and must be stricken. First, he notes no reported decision in California holds substances such as tear gas, pepper spray or mace are capable of producing great bodily injury to in turn support a finding they constitute dangerous or deadly weapons. Second, he claims the evidence produced at trial did not demonstrate the spray caused, or was even capable of causing, the requisite significant or substantial injury to warrant a finding the \u201ccaustic substance\u201d was a dangerous or deadly weapon to sustain the true findings under section 12022, subdivision (b). He asserts the evidence showed the victims suffered only temporary pain, and thus insubstantial injury. He argues this evidence is insufficient to warrant the findings the substance he sprayed constituted a dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u201cIn order to find \u2018true\u2019 a section 12022(b) allegation, a fact finder must conclude that, during the crime or attempted crime, the defendant himself or herself intentionally displayed in a menacing manner or struck someone with an instrument capable of inflicting great bodily injury or death. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Some objects such as guns, dirks and blackjacks \u201chave been held to be deadly weapons as a matter of law; the ordinary use for which they are designed establishes their character as such.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In determining whether an object which is not inherently deadly or dangerous has been used as a dangerous or deadly weapon, \u201cthe trier of fact may consider the nature of the object, the manner in which it is used, and all other facts relevant to the issue.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The phrase \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d as used in section 12022, subdivision (b) means \u201cinjury which is significant or substantial, not insignificant, trivial or moderate.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Our research has uncovered no California decision holding substances such as pepper spray, tear gas and/or mace are dangerous or deadly weapons as a matter of law on the ground they are designed to incapacitate victims by affecting the person\u2019s vision and respiratory system. Nor have we found any published California decisions that found such substances were dangerous weapons as used in the particular circumstances of the case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Some courts in other jurisdictions have found chemical substances did not qualify as dangerous weapons because of the peculiar circumstances of the case. For example, in <em>Austin </em>v. <em>State,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the expert produced by the state testified spraying mace into a victim\u2019s mouth would not produce death or serious bodily harm. Because this was the <em>only </em>evidence bearing on the issue whether mace was a deadly or dangerous weapon the court found it did not support the finding the crime committed was an aggravated assault rather than a simple assault.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In <em>United States v. </em>Lancaster,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the court found the trial court did not commit clear error in finding no great bodily injury occurred from the defendant\u2019s use of mace. The court noted the victim suffered burning eyes and cheeks, not a wholly trivial injury. However, because the victim suffered no lasting harm, and because the trial court was entitled to apply the rule of lenity in interpreting sentencing provisions, the appellate court upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling as not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The court in <em>United States v. </em>Harris<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> found a brochure stating a competitor\u2019s brand had caused a death insufficient, standing alone, to prove mace was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>capable of being used as a dangerous and deadly weapon.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it rejected the <em>Lancaster </em>court\u2019s interpretation that injuries from substances such as mace must be painful and obvious for a substantial period of time in order to qualify as great bodily injury. \u201cA blow the effects of which can be shaken off in a moment or two may well be an insignificant injury. Blindness, disorientation, breathing difficulty, and extreme discomfort sufficient in combination to induce panic for a period of ten to fifteen minutes are something else entirely and can rationally be viewed as more than an insignificant injury.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The <em>Harris </em>court\u2019s view of these chemicals\u2019 potential to cause harm has been echoed by the vast majority of courts that have considered the issue. Most courts have found tear gas, mace or pepper spray to be dangerous or deadly weapons capable of inflicting great bodily injury. For example, in <em>United States v. Neill,</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the victim suffered from exercise- induced asthma before the incident which she controlled with an inhaler after exercising. A bank robber sprayed her with pepper spray during a holdup. The spray caused her to cough and choke and her eyes and nose to bum. The victim testified she felt as though she was on fire. She could not breathe. After being sprayed she suffered severe asthma attacks for weeks and had to take prescription steroids. The Ninth Circuit concluded the pepper spray had been used as a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bartolotta,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant sprayed a store\u2019s employee during a robbery. She developed chemical pneumonia as a result of the spray and was required to take daily steroid shots for over four months and steroid pills for one year to cleanse the mace from her system. The Eight Circuit found the defendant had used mace as a dangerous weapon in committing the crime.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson </em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant sprayed bank tellers with mace during a bank robbery. The tellers experienced pain for hours and had residual effects for days. The Seventh Circuit found this sufficient evidence to uphold a sentence enhancement for inflicting bodily injury.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>In <em>United States </em>v. Dukovich<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the defendant sprayed bank tellers with tear gas during a bank robbery. The Eleventh Circuit held tear gas is a dangerous weapon as a matter of law.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The court based its holding on evidence: all victims suffered a burning sensation in their faces and throats; some experienced eye pain and severe headaches; the tear gas struck one teller near her eye; two women in the bank were visibly pregnant; tear gas is capable of causing eye damage, vomiting, loss of breath or a rash; and tear gas is potentially harmful to pregnant women.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In <em>People v. Elliott,</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court found the pepper spray the defendant used in committing the bank robbery constituted a dangerous weapon. \u201cAlthough there was testimony that the effects of pepper spray are normally temporary, there is no question that its effects are disabling. Both victims testified that after the spray was used, they had difficulty breathing and their eyes burned. One of the victims stated that the spray made her feel nauseated. They were both temporarily incapacitated by the effects of the spray. These effects did not wear off completely until several horns after the robbery. The victims suffered injury and the fact that the injuries were not permanent does not change our conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Norris,</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant used a combination of pepper spray and tear gas in a jewelry store robbery. The store\u2019s employees suffered extreme eye pain and eye irritation, burning sensations on the skin and in the nose, mouth and lungs, and had breathing difficulties. One of the victims suffered a cornea defect in both eyes consistent with having been chemically sprayed. The court found the chemical spray constituted a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In <em>Pitts v. State,</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant threatened to use mace in committing a robbery. The Court of Criminal Appeals found the threatened use of mace sufficient evidence the defendant had used a dangerous weapon. The court noted, \u201cUnquestionably, mace is a substance which is designed as a defensive weapon, but may be used in such a manner as to cause great bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Whether appellant used the spray as a dangerous weapon capable of inflicting great bodily injury was a question for the jury to decide.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> While Hersco did not require hospitalization, her condition was sufficiently alarming to prompt paramedics to arrive. She was screaming in pain. Her eyes were burning and she could not see. She could not breathe and was coughing and gasping for air and her face turned red. Weber suffered similar effects. Her eyes burned. She could not breathe at all for 10 minutes. Appellant\u2019s threat to \u201cmace\u201d Chapek was enough to convince him to comply with appellant\u2019s demand for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In our view, this evidence demonstrates the victims suffered substantial, though transitory, respiratory distress, burning sensations and blindness. This evidence demonstrates the chemical spray was capable of, and did, inflict serious bodily injury in the present case. In light of the examples in the decisions discussed above, it takes little imagination to picture the more serious injuries these victims were fortunate to escape, such as bums, chemical pneumonia, cornea damage or serious asthma attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The evidence in the present case also establishes appellant intended to, and did, use the chemical spray to immobilize and temporarily disable his victims in order to escape with the loot. Evidence of these circumstances in combination supports the jury\u2019s reasonable deduction appellant used the chemical spray as a dangerous weapon in committing the robberies. Accordingly, the enhancements imposed for having used the chemical spray as a dangerous weapon in committing the robberies in counts 3, 4 and 6 need not be reversed for insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The judgment is modified to strike the one-year sentence enhancement imposed under section 667.5, subdivision (b) for having served a prior prison term. The clerk of the Superior Court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and to forward it to the Department of Corrections. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Woods, J., and Zelon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">On April 16, 2004, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
