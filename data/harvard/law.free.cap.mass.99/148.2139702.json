The legislature has power to impose \u201c proportional and reasonable assessments, rates and taxes, upon all the inhabitants of, and persons resident and estates lying within the Commonwealth ; <em>\u201d </em>and also to impose \u201c reasonable duties and excises upon any produce, goods, wares, merchandise and commodities whatsoever, brought into, produced, manufactured or being within the same.\u201d Const. of Mass. part 2, <em>c. </em>1, \u00a7 1, art. 4. But this gives no authority to impose taxes on property or persons not subject to their jurisdiction. The capital stock, as such, of the defendant corporation, is beyond its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">In <em>Portland Bank </em>v. <em>Apthorp, </em>12 Mass. 252, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton Manufacturing Co. </em>12 Allen, 298, the defendants being domestic corporations, it was held that under the term \u201ccommodity\u201d their charters were included, and that the legislature, which created and sold these commodities, might, as the price of the commodity, in the one case levy an excise or duty each year on the franchise of the bank, measured by the capital stock which it permitted the bank to hold, and in the other case measure the value of the commodity sold by the market value of the shares. But in the case at bar, though the legislature may compel the defendant corporation to pay a license for maintaining an office for the transaction of part of its business in Massachusetts, yet, having no control over the charter, it cannot levy a tax on the capital stock, all of which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>employed in another state. Massachusetts does not grant the defendants\u2019 franchise; and so cannot tax it. The principle, that a state, in order to tax a corporation on its franchise, must have granted the charter, or have the corporate property within its limits, seems to be expressly recognized by the St. of 1864, <em>c. </em>208, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 9, and by the very St. of 1865, <em>c. </em>283, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7, relating to railroad and telegraph companies extending beyond the limits of Massachusetts or incorporated by other states. See also <em>Easton Bridge </em>v. <em>The County, </em>9 Barr, 415.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">The real and personal estate of the corporation may be taxed to the corporation by any power within whose jurisdiction it may be found; and the interest of the shareholders is personal to them, and may be taxed to them in their places of domicil, whether the shares so held by them are shares of foreign or domestic corporations, and notwithstanding, in the case of foreign corporations, that such corporations have paid taxes on their franchises and corporate property to the power which created them. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Appeal Tax Court, </em>3 How. 133. Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, \u00a7 458. <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Boston, </em>12 Allen, 316. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berkshire Insurance Co. </em>98 Mass. 25. But if Massachusetts has jurisdiction for taxation over such of the shares in this Michigan corporation as are held by citizens of Massachusetts, it does not follow that it has therefore such jurisdiction over all the shares of the capital stock of the corporation, part of which are owned by citizens of other states, and that it may so tax property in oth\u00e9r states belonging to citizens of other states.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">2. The St. of 1865, <em>c. </em>283, on which this information is based, so far as applicable to the taxation of the capital stock of foreign mining corporations to such corporations, and not to the individual holders of shares in such stock, is repealed by the St. of 1866, c. 291, \u00a7 2, and the power to tax the shares in such corporations remitted to the towns and cities where the stockholders reside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">3. By the answer it appears that nearly all the contracts for labor at the mine in Michigan, and for materials purchased, are entered into in Michigan, and drafts for payments in fulfilment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of these contracts are drawn on the treasurer of the company The information asks the court to enforce the statute by enjoining the treasurer from paying these drafts; which would be in contravention of the Const, of the U. S., art. 1, \u00a7 10, forbidding any state from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> \u201c Every corporation chartered by this Commonwealth, or organized under the. general laws, for the purpose of engaging, without the limits of the Comm\u00bbuwealth, in the business of coal mining or other mining, quarrying or extracting carbonaceous oils from the earth, or for the purpose of purchasing, selling, or holding mines or lands without the Commonwealth, and every such company or association, incorporated elsewhere, and having an office or place of business within the Commonwealth for the direction of its affairs cr transfer of shares, shall, semiannually, between the first and the tenth day of June and December, make a return, under the oath of its treasurer, or president, to the tax commissioner, of the whole amount of its capital stock, as fixed by the corporation, on the first day respectively of May and November next preceding and pay to the treasurer of the Commonwealth a tax of one twentieth of one per cent, upon said capital stock at the par thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-5\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">The defence in this suit seems to rest upon the supposition that the existence and organization of the corporation, the functions and capacities with which it is endowed by the law creating it, are alone what constitute the franchise, or \u201c commodity,\u201d which is the subject of the tax or excise imposed by\" the St. of 1865, c. 283. If it were so, there would be much force in the argument that, when these are derived exclusively from the authority of another state, they are not proper subjects of state taxation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">But we think this is a too limited view of the matter. It is not merely the creation of corporate functions and privileges, or the conferring of rights and franchises by the legislature, which entitles the state to tax the possessor of such privileges and rights. The exercise of powers or privileges, and even of occupations without especial powers or privileges, may be equally subjected to such taxation, under the constitutional authority to \u201cimpose and levy reasonable duties and excises.\u201d It was so considered in the case of <em>Portland Bank </em>v. Apthorp, 12 Mass. 252; and the tax of one per cent., laid upon the capital stock of the bank, was justified upon principles equally applicable to individuals transacting similar business, and to brokers, factors, auctioneers, &amp;c. The tax was not sustained on the ground that the corporation derived its existence from the state which imposed the tax ; on the contrary, one principal question in that case was, whether, by the charter, the state had not conferred upon the bank the privilege of doing the business, for which it was created, without restriction, so as to exempt the corporation from the requisition of any tax or duty afterwards levied upon the exercise of that privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">That decision is sufficient for the present case. The tax is, indeed, in form., levied upon the capital stock of the corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>But it is not merely the franchise of incorporation that is the basis of the tax; nor is it the capital, regarded merely as property. In case of domestic corporations, it is based upon a valuation which involves an estimate of all the advantages, present and prospective, which the stock is supposed to derive from the combination of capital and the exercise of all the rights and privileges enjoyed by the corporation in the conduct of its business. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton Manufacturing Co. </em>12 Allen, 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">When the exercise of corporate functions, authorized by the state, is extended beyond the limits of the state, as in railroads and telegraph lines, the tax is apportioned accordingly. In the case of mining companies whose mines are without the state, the tax is limited by the \u201c par\u201d of the stock ; and the tax upon foreign companies is founded upon the express consideration of \u201c having an office or place of business within the Commonwealth for the direction of its affairs or \u2018transfer of shares.\u201d A mining corporation which comes within the terms of this provision has its domicil of business within the Commonwealth, as completely as one that is organized under our General Statutes for the prosecution of a like enterprise. A corporation which seeks, by its agents, to establish a domicil of business in a state other than that of its creation, must take that domicil, as individuals are always understood to do, subject to the responsibilities and burdens imposed by the laws which it finds in force there. The state may deny to foreign corporations the right to transact their business, hold property, or exercise any corporate function whatever within its limits. Or it may permit them to exercise such privileges upon terms prescribed by law, as has long been done in relation to insurance companies. <em>Erie </em>Rail<em>way Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Jersey, 2 Vroom, 531. The provisions of the statute in question are founded upon this right of exclusion or of conditional admission. Exclusion is the remedy provided to enforce compliance. The very defence to the suit implies the enjoyment of valuable rights and privileges within the Commonwealth, which a foreign corporation can only exercise by comity and the permission of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The court are all of opinion that the tax upon the defendant corporation is legal; that it is warranted by the Constitution of the Commonwealth, and is not in conflict with any provision of the Constitution of the United States; and that \u00a7 8 of the St. of 1865, <em>c. </em>283, is in no respect repealed or annulled by the St. of 1866, <em>c. 291.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The Commonwealth is therefore entitled to an injunction restraining the further prosecution of the business of the defendant corporation within the Commonwealth, excepting the payment of debts already contracted, until all taxes due under said act shall be paid with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
