Trial in the superior court, before <em>Vose, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-7\">The only witness for the Commonwealth was a police officer, the material part of whose testimony was this: \u201c I saw the defendant put her left hand into the pocket' of an old lady. I stepped forward and caught her by the left wrist while her hand was in the pocket. She immediately raised her hand in the air, with the dress, her hand being still in the pocket, and my hand still upon the defendant\u2019s hand; and, bringing her hand down again suddenly, tore the dress and pocket to the ground, the pocket-book dropping to the ground. She said, \u2018 Let go my hand. Who are you? Are you an officer? \u2019 I told her I was, and that she must go with \u00bfhe. The pocket-book dropped after the dress and pocket had been torn.\u201d There was no evidence that the defendant placed her hand upon the pocket-book. The witness also testified to other facts tending to show the guilt of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-8\">The defendant offered no evidence, but asked the judge to instruct the jury \u201c that, on the evidence as given on the part of the Commonwealth, there was a sufficient caption and asportation to constitute larceny, and so the indictment was not supported ; that any movement made by the defendant to alter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>position of the pocket-book of the party named in the indictment with a view to take it away was a sufficient asportation, and that no manual taking, was necessary.\u201d The judge declined so to rule ; and instructed the jury \u201c that if they were satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the hand of the defendant had been thrust into the woman\u2019s pocket with a felonious intent, and was arrested in the pocket while attempting to execute that in tent, and before her hand had reached or disturbed the woman\u2019s pocket-book, they might find her guilty of the offence charged in the indictment; that any alteration in the position of the pocket-book in the woman\u2019s pocket, caused by the struggle between the defendant and the officer, the pocket-book not having been nor being in the defendant\u2019s hand, or in contact with it, would not be such a caption or asportation as to constitute the offence of larceny instead of the offence charged; but that if the defendant\u2019s hand had reached or seized the pocket-book, before it was arrested by the officer, or during the struggle, and she altered the position of the pocket-book in the attempt to secure or retain it, this would be such a caption or asportation as would make it their duty to acquit the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-6\"><em>F.

To justify a conviction, it was necessary to show that she failed in the perpetration, or was prevented in the execution of the offence of stealing from the person, \u2014 an offence which could only be complete when the property sought to be taken was in the full custody and control of the defendant. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>is not indeed necessary that the pocket-book of the prosecutor should have been removed from the pocket, if once within the grasp of the thief, to constitute larceny. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Mood. 78. But the prisoner must for an instant at least have had perfect control of the property. There was nothing in the evidence reported which would justify the court in instructing the jury that there was such instantaneous caption and asportation in this case. Nor is there any evidence to which the last part of the instructions asked could be applied. It was not until after the hand was seized by the officer, and after all intention to commit any larceny must have been abandoned, that the pocket-book fell from the pocket in the straggle which ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">There was no error in the instructions given, or in refusing those asked. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
