There was no attachment of property. The writ alleges that the corporation has its usual place of business within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We are aware of no authority for the maintenance of such an action; and none has been found by the diligence of the learned counsel for the plaintiff. On the contrary, the numerous cases cited for the defendant fully support the opposite conclusion. A foreign corporation can only be sued in this Commonwealth by means of an attachment of its property; unless, as in the case of foreign insurance companies, by virtue of an express statute provision. The motion to dismiss was rightly allowed. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
