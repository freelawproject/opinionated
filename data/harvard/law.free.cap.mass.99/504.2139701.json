Sixteen years ago, the defendant came to this country, and has ever since lived in Hatfield, in this Commonwealth; and fifteen years ago, in Hatfield, he married a woman with whom he has ever since lived as his wife. Some time after the defendant came to this country, he sent for one of said bastard\u2019 children, and has since supported the same. It was the expectation of the parties, and their purpose, to perform the marriage contract, up to the time of the departure of the defendant from Germany. Two or three years after the marriage of the defendant the plaintiff knew and heard of it. Up to that time she expected to marry the defendant. She continued to live in Germany until some two years ago, when she came to this country.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-8\"><em>C.
