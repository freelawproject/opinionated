The Suffolk National Bank, of Boston, summoned as trustee, filed an answer denying that there were intrusted or deposited in its hands or possession any goods, effects or credits of the defendant, on June 25, 1867, when it received service of the writ; and replied substantially as follows to interrogatories of the plaintiff: That it did have in its possession a promissory note for $556.67, signed by Richards, Adams &amp; Co., and payable on that day, with interest, to the order of the defendant, the amount of which, with interest, it that day collected, and passed the proceeds to the credit of the Second National Bank of Portland on its open account with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Suffolk Bank, in accordance with the directions contained in a letter from the cashier of the bank in Portland, in which he had forwarded the note for collection; that neither the defendant nor any one in his behalf ever gave it notice that such proceeds belonged to him; that it never had any communication with the defendant; and that it gave notice to the bank in Portland of the service of the writ, and the cashier replied that \u201cthey would take care of it,\u201d and requested that the summons might be handed to a firm of attorneys-at-law in Boston. It did not appear by the answer that the note in question bore any indorsement whatsoever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-5\">No other evidence was offered on the question of charging the trustee; the superior court ordered its discharge ; and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-6\"><em>S. Wells, Jr., </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avc\">cited <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Ayres, </em>3 Pick. 298; <em>Parham </em>v. <em>Murphee, </em>16 Martin, 355; <em>Carvick </em>v. <em>Vickery, </em>2 Doug. 653.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-7\"><em>T. F.

The exception to this rule is, when the answer admits enough to make the trustee <em>primd facie </em>chargeable, and then states some special matter in avoidance. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Felt, </em>7 Gray, 491. A trustee cannot be held liable, when he does not appear ever to have been the debtor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">In the present case, it is clear that extrinsic evidence might have been offered by either party to show whether the note, when paid to the Suffolk Bank, was owned by the defendant or by the bank in Portland which sent it to Boston for collection. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>142, \u00a7 11. So also the Portland bank might have been summoned as claimant. \u00a7 15. In this way the rea! question in controversy would have been tried more fully, and determined more satisfactorily, than it can be upon the trustee\u2019s answers alone. But it was quite as much the duty of the plaintiff as of the trustee to take active measures to bring the Portland bank before the court as a claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>We are of opinion that the single fact, that the note does not appear to have been indorsed by the defendant, who was the original payee, is insufficient to overcome the effect of the trustee\u2019s general denial of liability, together with the statements that the note was transmitted for collection by the bank in Portland with directions to credit it, when paid, to the account of that bank, and that the defendant has never claimed the proceeds or had any communication with the Suffolk Bank in regard to the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The judgment of the superior court is affirmed, and the</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\n<em>Trustee discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
