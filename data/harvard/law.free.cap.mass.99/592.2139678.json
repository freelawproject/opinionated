Sts. <em>c. </em>18, \u00a7 38.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b600-8\">A police officer appointed by the selectmen of a town under the Gen. Sts. c. 18, \u00a7 38, need not be sworn to the faithful discharge of the duties of his office.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-9\">Indictment for assault and battery of Eben B. Place, a police officer in the lawful execution of bis office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-10\">At the trial in the superior court, before <em>Ames, </em>C. J., the attorney for the Commonwealth stated that he should not contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>that there should be a conviction \u201c unless the court should rule upon the facts which were not in dispute that Place was a properly appointed police officer of the town of Holyoke; \u201d and introduced in evidence the book of records of the selectmen of that town, containing the following vote : <em>\u201c </em>Voted that Eben B. Place be appointed on police duty, and that he be detailed with George Clark on duty at the hill until further notice; \u201d and, in proof of the qualification of Place, was permitted to introduce, against the defendant\u2019s objection, the testimony of the chairman of the selectmen that he administered to Place an oath, which was admitted to be proper in form. The judge ruled \u201c on the whole case, that the person named in the indictment was duly appointed and qualified as a police officer of Holyoke; \u201d the jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-5\"><em>G. M. </em>Stearns, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZM\">1. Place was not properly appointed under the Gen. Sts. c. 18, \u00a7 38, for the selectmen could only exercise the power conferred by the statute according to its terms; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Higgins, 4 Gray, 34; and he was not appointed in the language of the statute, nor substantially according to its terms. An appointment to a duty is not an appointment to an office, unless that duty pertains to one office and no other. Police duty pertains to many offices. An officer of the watch, appointed by selectmen under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>23, is appointed to police duties, but does not hold the office of police officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-6\">2. It was not competent to prove the qualification by parol, until it was first shown there was no record of it. <em>Pease </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>24 Pick. 122. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>13 Pick. 305. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>9 Mass. 312.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-7\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">The appointment of Place \u201c on police duty \u201d constituted him a police officer in conformity with the provisions of Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>18, \u00a7 38. It was not necessary that he should be sworn. Section 31 designates what officers are to be sworn. And see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>12 Met. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
