Sweetser, (W. B. Gale </em>with him,) for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-5\">Wells, J. The declarations of Stephen Howe, that the petitioner would have his father\u2019s share of said Stephen\u2019s property, made before the sickness which was claimed to have resulted in unsoundness of mind, would not of themselves tend to prove that his subsequent deeds were procured by undue influence and fraud; nor that he was insane at the time of making such deeds; and, if offered alone, would clearly be inadmissible. The question in this case is, whether they are admissible if offered \u201c among other circumstances tending to prove \u201d such facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-6\">The objection to the deeds rests upon the proposition that they are not the acts of a free will and sound mind. Upon such issues, the character and effect of the instruments themselves, and the nature of the transaction, would have an important bearing. If it was in the nature of a final settlement of the estate of Stephen Howe, dividing it among his children, and entirely excluding the son of a deceased child from all participation, that circumstance would be competent for consideration. It would be stronger or weaker according to the relations that existed between them. Such evidence is constantly resorted to in cases upon wills; and the proof is the same in kind, whether the issues relate to wills or deeds. The proposition that the instrument expresses a purpose different from the real purpose of the party when in sound mind involves an inquiry into what that real purpose was. The presumption, based upon natural impulses, that a man would not disappoint the just expectations of one who has claims of blood, affection, or dependence upon him, without some strong motive or influence operating on his mind or will, may properly be urged against an instrument which disregards such claims. It may be met by explanations, showing what the real purpose or motive was ; or by proof that the instrument actually accords with the declared purposes of the party. So also it may undoubtedly be strengthened by proof that it is contrary to the purposes previously declared by him. The competency of such declarations stands upon the same footing with the presumptions which render the un natural provisions of the instrument itself proper for consideration in determining such issues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>A foundation must undoubtedly be laid before such declarations can properly be admitted to impeach a deed. But, when the foundation has been laid by evidence tending to show unsoundness of mind, or undue influence and fraud, especially if th; deed be one of gift conveying all the property of the grantor, evidence of a previously declared purpose of the grantor, contrary to the disposition thus made, is admissible, in connection with such other evidence, to show that the deed is the result of insanity or imposition, and not the free act and deed of the grantor. In the issue of undue influence and fraud there are two distinct questions: first, Was the improper influence exerted <em>1 </em>second, Did it produce its intended effect? Upon the latter question, if there is other evidence to sustain the former, \u25a0such declarations are certainly admissible and competent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-5\">In this case, the deeds conveyed all the grantor\u2019s property to his four children. The petitioner, who is the child of a deceased son, is thus deprived of all share of the estate. The deeds were executed after the grantor, at the age of eighty-three, had been sick with a fever for several weeks, by which the petitioner claimed that his mind had been unsettled. A majority of the court are of opinion that the further statement in the report, that the declarations in question were offered \u201c among other circumstances tending to prove unsoundness of mind, undue influence and fraud,\u201d requires the interpretation that such other evidence fairly raised the question whether the deeds did express the free and conscious purpose of the grantor\u2019s mind, or the contrary; and that the evidence was rejected as incompetent in its nature, and not admissible in any aspect of the case. It does not appear that the declarations were rejected because a sufficient foundation had not been laid in other respects. We are forced to this construction of the report, because we can see no limit that we are authorized to put upon the extent of the \"other circumstances tending to prove,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-6\">The husband of one of the respondents was properly admitted to testify. The Gen. Sts. c. 131, \u00a7 14, expressly remove all objection on the ground of his being husband of one of the parties ; and the proviso, where one of the original parties to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>contract or cause of action is dead, excludes only \u201c.the othei party.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">Upon the first point, however, the objection of the petitioner is sustained and the <em>Verdict set aside.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-6\">A new trial was had at April term 1868, before Wells, J., who made a report thereof substantially as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">The petitioner proved Stephen Howe\u2019s seisin of the land described in the petition; the death of said Stephen on March 20, 1865; his own descent through Stephen\u2019s deceased son Alfred; and the survivorship of the three other sons and the daughter of said Stephen; as at the former trial. And it appeared that the wife of said Stephen died on July 14, 1864.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\">Nahum B. Howe and Elbridge Howe appeared and denied the petitioner\u2019s right, and produced in evidence a warranty deed from Stephen Howe to Mrs. Holman, dated and acknowledged September 1,1863, and recorded September 26,1863, conveying to her part of the land, minutely described by courses and distances, stakes, and other boundaries; and attested by Stephen Morse, a justice of the peace, who testified that he wrote, witnessed and took the acknowledgment of the deed; that Abraham Holman, the husband of the grantee, came to his house with the grantor, was present while the deed was written and executed, and went away with the grantor; that one of them gave him a memorandum of the courses and distances, from which he wrote the deed; and that the grantor had come alone to see him in relation to making the deed, on a previous day. The consideration named in the deed was love, affection and services rendered. There was no release of dower or homestead, nor any signature of the grantor\u2019s wife. The respondents also produced two warranty deeds from Stephen Howe to his three sons, Nahum, Elbridge and Benjamin, dated March 29, acknowledged April 1, and recorded April 28,1864; one conveying to them the remainder of the land included in the petition ; the other conveying to them all the residue of the grantor\u2019s real estate, including a lot of land called the Berlin woodlot. To those deeds also there was no signature of the grantor\u2019s wife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>They further produced a mortgage of the premises described in these deeds, from the grantees therein named to said Stephen, also dated March <em>29 </em>and acknowledged April 1, but not recorded, purporting to convey to him the premises, with a covenant by them to pay his debts not exceeding $1,000, and to support him and his wife during their lives, and upon condition as follows : \u201c At the death of S. Howe and his present wife, this deed shall be absolutely void. If default shall be made by said grantors, then this deed shall remain in full force and virtue.\u201d They also introduced in evidence a bill of sale from said Stephen to said grantees of all his personal property, also dated March 29. And they called as a witness Edward L. Bigelow, a justice of the peace, who testified that on April 1 he took said Stephen\u2019s acknowledgment of said two deeds, and wrote his name as witness thereto, in the sitting-room of Elbridge Howe\u2019s house, where the grantor then was, in the presence of Elbridge and his family; that in reply to a formal interrogatory whether they were signed by him and were his free acts and deeds, the grantor either nodded, or signified his assent by a word ; that at the same time, at Elbridge\u2019s request, the witness signed his name as a witness to the bill of sale; that Elbridge came to his place of business with a carriage, and conveyed him to the house and brought him back; that he was in the house only just long enough to do the formal work; that nothing else was said or done ; and that he left all the papers on a table in the room where said Stephen and Elbridge had been together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">The petitioner contended that at the time of the execution of the three deeds introduced by the respondents, Stephen Howe was of unsound mind; and also that they were obtained by undue influence and fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">Upon the issues of undue influence and fraud there was evidence tending to prove that the two deeds to the three sons, and the bill of sale of personal property, and the alleged mortgage, were written at Elbridge\u2019s dictation, by an attorney employed by him, who witnessed, and took his acknowledgment of, the mortgage, but who never saw or communicated with Stephen Howe ; that \u00ede May and June, 1863, Stephen Howe was sick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>with a fever, during which Mrs. Holman attended on and took care of him; that ever afterwards his body and mind were enfeebled; that after the sickness Mr. Holman had charge of his affairs till Elbridge took charge of them under a power of attorney dated February 24,1864; that Earl Joslin surveyed the and described in the deed to Mrs. Holman about the time of the date thereof, Mr. Holman at the grantor\u2019s request helping to carry the chain, the grantor being at the time in the house; that Joslin made a memorandum of the courses and distances, and gave it to Holman\u2019s daughter; that those courses and distances ran so as to greatly injure the rest of the farm; and that on several occasions, and to several persons, the grantor, before his sickness, and down to the time when Elbridge took charge of his affairs, expressed his intention that the petitioner should be remembered in the disposition of his estate, and should have the Berlin woodlot, saying it would be an appropriate gift for the boy. It was also testified by Earl Joslin that during the spring in which Elbridge took charge of the grantor\u2019s affairs the grantor told him that it was bis intention to give the boy the Berlin woodlot, and told Elbridge so, and Elbridge approved of it; that he and Elbridge went to look at it, and then Elbridge thought it was not best to give it to the boy, but that it should go with the farm. There was evidence that the grantor had great confidence in Elbridge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">The respondents also introduced evidence tending to show that several months after the deeds to the three sons the grantor spoke of them and of his having given them, that he remembered the transaction and understood what he had done, gave reasons therefor, and did not express any regret or dissent. At the respondents\u2019 request, the judge instructed the jury that this was competent evidence, tending to show that he understood h.is act at the time, and also that he ratified it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-6\">John C. Draper, one of the witnesses called by the respondents, testified on cross-examination that the grantor said that they teased him, and especially that Mr. Holman teased him constantly. At the respondents\u2019 request, the judge instructed the jury that a deed could not be avoided upon the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the grantor had been annoyed, by teasing, into making it, if he was of sound mind and able to exercise his own free will notwithstanding such influence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\">The judge also instructed the jury, at the request of the re apondents, that the burden of proving unsoundness of mind of the grantor at the time of the execution of the three deeds was upon the petitioner, and that it was incumbent on him to prove it by a fair preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">The petitioner requested the court to give to the jury the following instructions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">\u201c 1. That though the influence may have been that of affection only, and may have been gained by kind offices of duty or affection, or attention to the grantor\u2019s bodily infirmities, still if that influence so acquired was abused for a selfish and unjust purpose, or to obtaining an unjust and unfair advantage over others equally entitled to his bounty, such influence was undue influence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">\u201c2. That the circumstances attending the execution of the Holman deed \u2014 the facts that Holman at the time had charge of the grantor\u2019s affairs; that he helped to carry the chain ; that he accompanied the grantor to Stephen Morse\u2019s house, and remained present while the deed was written and executed, and accompanied him back; that the memorandum of the courses and distances was given to his daughter: and that the grantor\u2019s wife did not sign the deed \u2014 raise a presumption of fraud and undue influence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">\u201c 3. That the circumstances attending the execution of the deeds to the three sons at Elbridge\u2019s house \u2014 the facts that the documents were prepared, by Elbridge\u2019s dictation, by an attorney employed by him, and who never saw the grantor nor communicated with him ; that they were executed in Elbridge\u2019s house in the presence of himself and his family; that Elbridge brought the justice to his house, who only staid long enough to put the formal questions and receive a nod or a word in reply ; that they were not read over to him; that the grantor\u2019s wife did not execute the deeds ; that they embraced all his real estate; and that there was executed at the same time a bill of sale of all his per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>sonal property; that Elbridge had charge of the grantor\u2019s affairs at the time under a power of attorney; and that the transaction was contrary to the grantor\u2019s previous declarations of his intention that the petitioner should be remembered in the disposition of his estate and have the Berlin woodlot \u2014 raise a presumption of fraud and undue influence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-5\">\u201c4. That there was no evidence of any delivery of said mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-6\">\u201c5. That there was no evidence of any ratification of said deeds.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">The judge did not give the instructions as prayed for; but did instruct the jury \u201c that in order to avoid the deed it must appear that the influence, however obtained, was abused, or made use of improperly for the purpose of inducing the grantor to execute an instrument which was not in fact his own free act and deed ; and that the various facts referred to in the petitioner\u2019s prayer for instructions, so far as proved, were for the consideration of the jury, who would give them such weight up'on the several issues submitted to them, as in their judgment they were entitled to bear.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-8\">A verdict was returned for the respondents; and the petitioner alleged exceptions, which were argued in February 1869.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-9\"><em>E. M. </em>Bigelow, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN3\">1. There was no evidence that the mortgage was ever delivered. The attesting witness never saw or communicated with the mortgagee. It was never recorded. The mortgagors produced it in court without showing that it had ever departed from their possession. See <em>Maynard </em>v. Maynard, 10 Mass. 458; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>13 Pick. 69; <em>Samson </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>3 Met. 281; <em>Younge </em>v. <em>Guilbeau, </em>3 Wallace, 641; <em>Parmelee </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>5 Wallace, 86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-10\">2. There was no evidence of ratification. The established doctrine is, that no mere paroi acknowledgments, which were not intended to influence, and have not influenced, the conduct of any one, and no tacit acquiescence short of the period fixed by the statute of limitations, if uncoupled with acts of estoppel, will ratify the deed of one who at the time of executing it was an infant or of unsound mind. <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>53 Maine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>455, and cases cited. <em>Boody </em>v. <em>McKenney, </em>23 Maine, 517, 523, 524. <em>Cresinger </em>v. <em>Welch\u2019s lessee, </em>15 Ohio, 156, 193. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Moreland, </em>10 Pet. 75. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>13 Met. 310. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>3 Cush. 375. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>6 Gray, 281. <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>4 Allen, 95. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>13 M. &amp; W. 285. <em>Baylis </em>v. <em>Dineley, </em>3 M. &amp; S. 482.

We are of opinion that there was some evidence of the delivery of the mortgage. Its weight or sufficiency is not open for consideration under this bill of exceptions. Execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>of a deed in the presence of an attesting witness is evidence from which to infer a delivery. <em>Moore v. Hazelton, </em>9 Allen, 102, and cases there cited. The authorities on which the petitioner relies are those in which the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the legal delivery of an instrument has been in question. Here the execution of the mortgage was not a necessary fact to be proved in the case. It came in merely incidentally, as one of the circumstances attending the principal transaction ; and, though the evidence was very slight, the court could not be required to rule that there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">2. The evidence that the grantor in a deed remembered what he had done, and afterward spoke of it and gave his reasons foi it, and did not express any regret or dissent, was properly admitted as tending to prove that he understood his act at the time, and that he ratified it. The deed of an insane person is not void, but voidable. The maker of it, or his legal representative, may avoid it: or, when in possession of his full powers of mind, if he recovers his reason, he may affirm and ratify it. The contract is not a nullity, but, until disaffirmed, is binding; and the sane party cannot repudiate it. <em>Allis </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>6 Met. 415. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Richmond Iron Works, </em>1 Gray, 434. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>6 Gray, 279. Any distinct and decisive act of recognition as a valid and subsisting contract is competent evidence of ratification. \u00e1. new delivery of the deed is not requisite, as it would be if the deed of an insane person were void.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">3. The deed of an insane person being not void, but voidable only, it follows that the person who claims or takes title under a deed is not obliged to give any proof of the sanity of his grantor. The conveyance is binding upon the grantee, even if the grantor be insane, until it is avoided by the latter or his representative. In the case at bar, the petitioner claims title as heir to his grandfather. By proving his grandfather\u2019s seisin and his own descent, he makes out that title. The respondents introduce a deed from the grandfather, giving a prior title to them, and prove its execution by the grantor. They need prove nothing more. They need not show the sanity of the grantor, be. cause the deed is good until avoided, and to have the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>avoid it the petitioner must show that the grantor was not of sound mind. The burden of proof was therefore rightly held to be upon the petitioner upon the issue of sanity. The authorities cited by the respondents\u2019 counsel will be found to turn upon the form of issues out of chancery, or other pleadings, in which che general rule is stated, of which there can be no doubt, that the party alleging an affirmative fact is bound to prove it. The rule of evidence as to wills depends upon different principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">4. The instructions given to the jury appear to us to have contained all for which the petitioner asked which could properly or should have been given. The.first instruction asked was given in substance, and with only such qualification as the law requires. Influence properly gained, although used for a selfish purpose, and to obtain an unjust and unfair advantage, will not avoid a deed thereby obtained, unless there is fraud or duress, or the influence is exerted by a stronger mind over a weak one, in such a manner and to such a degree as to substitute the will of the person exerting the,influence in place of that of him upon whom it is exerted, so that the latter is no longer a free agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The facts set forth in the second and third prayers for instructions were submitted to the jury as evidence of fraud and undue influence. There is no legal presumption arising from them, but only a presumption of fact, of which the petitioner had the benefit, so far as the facts were established to the satisfaction of the jury. The court were not required to assume them to be proved \u2022 nor to give a hypothetical ruling upon them separately from the other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
