And did you not derisively sing under his window, while he lay sick in his bed, something about him to the effect that McGuire is lying low ? \u201d The witness replied in the negative ; and denied that he had ever done anything of the kind. For the purpose of contradicting the witness, and showing bias and prejudice on bis part, the plaintiff was then permitted, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to offer evidence tending to show that twice, soon after the assault, the witness did sing a derisive song under the windows of the plaintiff\u2019s house, about the plaintiff\u2019s lying low, and did also clap his hands at the close of the song; and that the song was heard by the plaintiff, while suffering in bed from the effects of the blows received from the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-9\"><em>W.
