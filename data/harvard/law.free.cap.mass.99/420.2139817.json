At the trial in the superior court, before <em>Ames, </em>C.

The conviction of any crime might be shown to affect the credibility of the witness. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>131, \u00a7 13. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>97 Mass. 587. The term \u201c conviction \u201d in the Gen. Sts. sometimes implies a judgment of the court; but at other times does not. Persons may be convicted by confession in open court; by admitting the truth of the charge by plea or demurrer; or by the verdict of a jury accepted and recorded by the court. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>158, \u00a7 5. Conviction does not mean the judgment passed upon a verdict. There is, in point of law, a difference between the pleas of <em>autrefois convict </em>and <em>autrefois attaint; </em>the former may be where there has been no judgment the latter is founded upon a judgment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gibert, 2 </em>Sumner, 40, and authorities cited. <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Faderman, </em>Temple &amp; Mew, 286. 4 Bl. Com. 336. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>8 Gray, 473. If the jury find a prisoner guilty he is then said to be convicted. 4 Bl. Com. 362. Judgmen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and sentence follow. This distinction is recognized by the common use of legal language. \u201c After conviction and before sentence \u201c Proceedings to reverse a conviction, before sentence; \u201d \u201c The prisoner was convicted, and brought up to receive the judgment of the court; \u201d are common expressions in the books. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Waddington, </em>1 East, 143, 145. <em>Rex </em>v. Bishop, 1 Stra. 9. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>1 Bulst. 84, 88. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Layton, </em>1 Salk. 106. 1 Bishop Crim. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 698-700. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Teal, </em>11 East, 307. In Massachusetts it has been adjudged in reference to a former statute, that the legislature intended to distinguish between a conviction and a judgment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>17 Pick. 295. This view is supported by <em>Green </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Allen, 172; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weymouth, 2 </em>Allen, 144. The doctrine of the common law was, that conviction of an infamous crime, followed by judgment, rendered a witness incompetent. The proof could only be made by production of the record. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 372. <em>Cushman </em>v. <em>Loker, 2 </em>Mass. 108. But now a witness is not thereby rendered incompetent ; though his conviction may be shown to affect his credibility. That is to say, the technical role is done away with ; but evidence of moral guilt may be introduced, to show the true character of the witness, morally. And for the purpose of aiding the judgment of a jury it is proper that a conviction for crime should be shown, whether judgment h\u00e1s followed thereon or not. It is now the policy of the law to impose few restrictions on the competency of witnesses, but to allow full and free proof of all matters affecting their credibility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-7\">2. The mode of proof was proper. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 502. The clerk\u2019s minutes were sufficient, until the full record was extended. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 513. <em>Pruden </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>23 Pick. 184. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Gilbert, 2 </em>Cush. 31. <em>Read </em>v. <em>Button, </em>Ib. 115. <em>Tillotson </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>3 Gray, 577.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b429-8\">Colt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As\">The defendant in this ease offered himself as a witness, and the rules of evidence affecting the competency or credibility of witnesses were all applicable to him in that character. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonner </em>97 Mass. 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">It was the rule of the common raw that the production of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>complete record, including the conviction, technically so called, and the final judgment thereon, was necessary in order to show that a witness offered was incompetent on account of infamy. This rule is founded on the reason that it is always within the power of the court, on motion in arrest or for a new trial, to set aside a verdict illegally or improperly rendered, at any time before judgment; and the prosecution may in the end result in the defendant\u2019s acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>131, \u00a7 13, no person can now be excluded by reason of crime from giving evidence as a witness, but the conviction of any crime may be shown to affect the credibility of the witness. The term \u201c conviction \u201d is used in at least two different senses in our statutes. In its most common use it signifies the finding of the jury that the prisoner is guilty; but it is very frequently used as implying a judgment and sentence of the court upon a verdict or confession of guilt. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>160, \u00a7 8; <em>c. </em>173, \u00a7 1. In <em>c. </em>174, the several sections relating to judgment and execution in criminal cases plainly describe the situation of the prisoner when nothing remains but the sentence. And in the several chapters which define and punish offences against persons, property, public morality and health, the words \u201cconviction\u201d and \u201cconvicted\u201d describe the same condition of the offender. We think the obvious purpose of the legislature was to restore the competency of a witness against whom the record of a judgment for crime was produced, bnt to permit the same evidence to be used as affecting his credibility, (in all cases requiring the same complete record of the whole case,) and that the word \u201c conviction \u201d is here used in the broader and less technical sense, and implies the judgment of the court. It could not have been the purpose of the lawmakers to permit evidence of moral guilt, as distinguished from guilt , egally established, to be produced against the witness. If this were so, then the finding of an indictment by the grand jury, which was afterwards quashed, or upon which a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered, might with equal propriety be permitted to ba shown. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
