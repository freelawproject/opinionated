Writ dated March 12, 1867. By the officer\u2019s return, it appeared that on March 14 he attached all the defendant\u2019s real estate in the county of Essex. The defendant, after filing an answer to the merits, commenced proceedings in bankruptcy on August 26, under the U. S. St. of 1867, c. 176. On December 11 he obtained his discharge in the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts; afterwards pleaded the same in bar of the action ; waived trial by jury and his first answer; and submitted the case, on his plea of discharge in bankruptcy, and the agreed fact that on March 14 he was seised of real estate in Essex, for the determination of the superior court, which ordered judgment for the plaintiff, \u201c said judgment only to be enforced against the property attached on the writ, but not to be enforced against the person of the defendant or any other property;\u201d and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-7\"><em>G. W. </em>Estabrook, for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-8\">H. <em>N. </em>Merrill, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK4\">1. The general intent of the oankrupt act is, that all the assets of the bankrupt upon the day of the adjudication of bankruptcy shall be taken into the custody of the law, and made to discharge all the debts and claims provable under the law. The debt in suit in this case was provable. U. S. St. of 1867, c. 176, \u00a7 19. \u201c No creditor whose debt is provable under this act shall be allowed to prosecute to final judgment any suit at law or in equity therefor.\u201d \u00a7 21. A discharge granted shall release the bankrupt from all demands provable; and may be pleaded \u201c as a full and complete bar\u201d to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>suits brought on such demands. \u00a7 34. But such discharge does not operate as a \u201c full and complete bar,\u201d if judgment be rendered and execution issue after such plea, even if the judgment be limited in its force to property attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\"><em>2. </em>The clause in \u00a7 14 which provides that the assignment in bankruptcy shall dissolve attachments of the debtor\u2019s property made within four months next preceding the commencement of proceedings in bankruptcy, if held to imply strictly that all attachments not made within four months shall not be dissolved, would be repugnant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 21, 34, as well as to the general intent of the statute. All conflict is avoided if it be held that the clause in \u00a7 14 implies only a saving of attachments made in suits, commenced four months before the bankruptcy, founded on any cause of action not provable as a demand against the estate of the bankrupt. Or all inconsistency in the act could be avoided by making this implied exception to the dissolution of attachments apply to cases in which an attachment had been in force more than four months in a suit in which judgment was had before the bankruptcy of the defendant; that is, to protect attachments of long standing, during the interval between judgment and levy of execution. In such cases, no judgment would be rendered contrary to the express provisions of the statute. Congress could not have intended to preserve all attachments made more than four months before bankruptcy, by a mere negative inference ; especially when in the same section it makes an express reservation of mortgages only, for, having expressed itself positively upon the same subject, it may be presumed that it so expressed all that was intended. <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>10 Met. 320, was decided on a provision in the act of 1841 in favor of all liens already attaching to the property of the bankrupt. No such provision is to be found in the act of 1867. Mortgages alone are excepted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-6\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-h\">The provision in the bankrupt act, \u00a7 14, that an assignment shall be made, and thereupon, by operation of law, the title to all property, real and personal, <em>\u201c </em>shall vest in said assignee, although the same is then attached on mesne process as the property of the debtor,\u201d would imply that all such attach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ments are to be thereby vacated. It is a reasonable, not ths necessary, inference. But it is not left to inference. The same sentence continues: \u201c and shall dissolve any such attachment made within four months next preceding the commencement of said proceedings.\u201d Such explicit terms do not admit of enlargement, nor of the special modifications which the defendant seeks to engraft upon the text of the statute. The provisions for a full discharge, \u00a7 34, and forbidding the prosecution of any suit to final judgment against the debtor, \u00a7 21, must be construed, as they well may be, so as not to prevent the enforcement of a lien, which the statute itself permits, by any requisite proceedings therefor which do not involve a judgment <em>in personam. </em>A lien by attachment can be enforced in no other way than by the qualified judgment which was rendered in the superior court. The entry must be therefore <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
