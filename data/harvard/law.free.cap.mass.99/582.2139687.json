The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-5\"><em>M. P. Knowlton, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av4y\">The conceded facts were, that the defendant built a barn with a cellar vault on a side hill, and percolations passed from his cellar through the earth into the plaintiff\u2019s cellar and well, further down the hill. The judge ruled that on these facts alone the plaintiff had a right of action. But the defendant\u2019s acts were upon his own premises and lawful in themselves. The plaintiff cannot recover without proving that the injuries resulted from wilful or negligent conduct. <em>Rockwood </em>v. Wilson, 11 Cush. 226. <em>Tourtellot </em>v. <em>Rosebeck, </em>11 Met. 462. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>6 Cush. 292. The declaration sets forth no other cause of action; and the question of negligence is always for the jury. There can be no legal liability for damages to land by mere subterranean percolation. <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>12 Mass. 220. <em>Greenleaf </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>18 Pick. 117. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illius, </em>25 Conn. 583. <em>Same </em>v. <em>Same, </em>27 Conn. 84. <em>Roath </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>20 Conn. 540. <em>Acton </em>v. <em>Blundell, </em>2 M. &amp; W. 348.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-6\"><em>H. Morris, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-7\">Foster, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa2B\">To suffer filthy water from a vault to percolate or filter through the soil into the land of a contiguous proprietor, to the injury of his well and cellar, where it is done habitually and within the knowledge of the party who maintains the vault, whether it passes above ground or below, is of itself an actionable tort. Under such circumstances the reasonable precaution which the law requires is, effectually to exclude the filth from the neighbor\u2019s land; and not to do so is of itself negligence. In the present instance, there was no pretence of a sudden and unavoidable accident which could not have been foreseen or guarded against by due care. The percolations appear to have been constant, and their existence to have been known to the defendant. The instructions asked for by his counsel were liable to mislead the jury, and those given were exactly accurate and appropriate to the case. <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>15 C. B. (N. S.) 376. <em>Rylands </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>Law Rep. 3 H. L. 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
