Duncan. Duncan interviewed White after he had conspired with three corrupt police officers, Gregg Junnier, Jason Smith, and Arthur Tesler, to corroborate a false affidavit and to conceal their unfounded search of a home for drugs that resulted in the death of homeowner Kathryn Johnston. White complained that he was falsely imprisoned during Duncan\u2019s interview, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that the officers and the City conspired to coerce White to conceal the illegal activities, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1985(2), and violated state law. After the district court dismissed Junnier, Smith, and Tesler, Duncan and the City moved for summary judgment. The district court ruled that White failed to establish that he was falsely imprisoned or that Duncan or the City were parties to an illegal conspiracy, and the district court dismissed without prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>White\u2019s claims under state law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">White argues that a genuine factual dispute exists about whether he was falsely imprisoned by Duncan, but White\u2019s trial testimony contradicts his argument. During Tesler\u2019s trial, White testified that he agreed to meet Duncan and climbed into his vehicle because he did not want to be seen \u201ctalking to the police\u201d because \u201cit isn\u2019t something you do.\u201d White argues that he was unable to escape from Duncan\u2019s vehicle, but White testified that he was \u201cjust ask[ed] ... questions\u201d regarding the drug transaction at Mrs. Johnston\u2019s house during the \u201capproximately eight minutes\u201d that he contends he was wrongfully detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">White also argues that a genuine factual dispute exists about whether Duncan conspired to violate his civil rights, but White failed to submit any evidence that Duncan even knew of the alleged conspiracy. White assumes that Duncan was involved based on evidence that the conspirators\u2019 supervisor, Lt. Stacy Gibbs, warned officers before field inspections to \u201cclean out\u201d their desks and police vehicles; Gibbs dispatched Duncan to question White; Junnier instructed White how to act when interviewed by Duncan; Smith gave White\u2019s contact information to Duncan; Duncan insisted that White view a photographic line-up at the police station before he met with Agent Eric Degree of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; and Duncan chased White after he fled Duncan\u2019s vehicle en route to the police station. White contends that \u201ca rational trier of fact might infer\u201d from these facts that \u201cDuncan was aware of the illegal goals of the conspiracy\u201d and \u201cshared the purpose of the conspiracy,\u201d but White\u2019s purported \u201c\u2018evidence,\u2019 consisting of one speculative inference heaped upon another, [is] entirely insufficient\u201d to establish that Duncan joined the conspiracy. <em>Josendis v. Wall To Wall Residence Repairs Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1318 (11th Cir.2011). Viewed in the light most favorable to White, the record establishes that Gibbs was a corrupt supervisor, the corrupt officers prepared White to meet with Duncan, and Duncan questioned White and then pursued a material witness to complete his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">White challenges on two grounds the judgment in favor of the City, but both of his grounds lack merit. First, White argues that the policies of the City caused the \u201cconspira[tors] to violate [his] civil rights,\u201d but White failed to provide any \u201c \u2018direct causal link between\u2019 \u201d the policies regarding arrest quotas and acceptance of fabricated warrants and the alleged coercion by the corrupt officers, <em>Snow ex rel. Snow v. City of Citronelle, Ala., </em>420 F.3d 1262, 1271 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1203, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989)). Second, White argues that the City is liable under state law, but the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over this argument and White does not challenge that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">White makes three other arguments, all of which are frivolous. First, White lists as an issue that the \u201cintracorporate conspiracy doctrine does not apply to claims arising under 42 U.S.C. Section 1985(2),\u201d but White fails to identify an adverse ruling by the district court on this issue. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Second, White argues that Duncan was not entitled to qualified immunity, but the district court did not reach that issue because it determined that White failed to produce any evidence that \u201cDuncan reached an agreement with\u201d the three corrupt police officers. Third, White argues that Duncan was not entitled to official immunity for his alleged violations of state law, but Duncan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>does not challenge the dismissal without prejudice of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Duncan and the City.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
