We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">The officials argue that we lack jurisdiction, but we disagree. Although \u201ca party cannot appeal from an order granting a Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal,\u201d <em>Ortega Trujillo v. Banco Central Del Ecuador, </em>379 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2004), this Court has \u201cjurisdiction to examine the district court\u2019s refusal to permit [a plaintiff from] ... withdrawing] [a] voluntary dismissal,\u201d <em>McGregor v. Bd. of Comm'rs of Palm Beach Cnty., </em>956 F.2d 1017, 1021 (11th Cir.1992). Harris\u2019s notice of appeal and amended notice of appeal state that he is challenging the \u201corder [of] February 3, 2011\u201d that denied his \u201cmotion to withdraw\u201d his voluntary dismissal. The denial of Harris\u2019s motion to withdraw is an appeal-able ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Harris\u2019s motion to withdraw. Before Harris\u2019s motion to withdraw reached the district court, Harris\u2019s \u201cmotion [to dismiss] ha[d] already been granted and the case dismissed.\u201d Because the district court dismissed Harris\u2019s complaint \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d Harris is free to file another complaint against the officials. Harris cannot fault the district court for refusing to undo the dismissal Harris had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">We AFFIRM the denial of Hams\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
