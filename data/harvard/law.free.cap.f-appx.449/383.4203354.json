On appeal, he asserts that the district court should not have attributed 383.8 grams of crack cocaine to him as relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Godfrey asserts that he has consistently denied any knowledge of crack cocaine and that the Government failed to present sufficient evidence connecting him to those drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">The Government moves for summary af-firmance, asserting that the drug quantity had no effect on the applicable guidelines range. In the alternative, the Government seeks an extension of time to file an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">Because the Government has failed to point to controlling authority from this circuit or the Supreme Court that forecloses Godfrey\u2019s claim, summary affir-mance is inappropriate. Thus, the Government\u2019s motion is denied. However, as the Government notes, the appellate argument is without merit. Godfrey\u2019s sentence was not determined based on the drug quantity calculation. Instead, his sentence was determined based on his status as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The argument concerning relevant conduct is irrelevant based on the facts of this case. Accordingly, we deny as unnecessary the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file an appellate brief and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-24\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
