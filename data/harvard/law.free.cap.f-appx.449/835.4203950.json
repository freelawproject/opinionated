On appeal, Alvarado challenges: (1) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction; (2) the denial of his motion to substitute counsel at sentencing; and (3) the imposition of an obstruction-of-justiee sentencing enhancement based on his perjured trial testimony. After review, we affirm Alvarado\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">A grand jury indicted Defendant Alvarado with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1), and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 2). The indictment also charged codefendant\u2019s Victor Rodriguez, Juan Sanches and Adolfo Armenta. Alvarado\u2019s codefendants pled guilty, and Sanches and Armenta testified against Alvarado at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">A. Government\u2019s Evidence at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">Beginning in late October 2010, two confidential sources, working for the Port Saint Lucie Police Department, met with Victor Rodriguez and Juan Sanches ostensibly to purchase cocaine from them. Rodriguez and Sanches then tried unsuccessfully to have cocaine delivered to Port Saint Lucie, Florida. Sanches eventually found a man in North Carolina named \u201cChino\u201d who said he could deliver four kilograms of cocaine to Florida. Chino told Sanches he would send \u201cthe guys\u201d with the delivery on the weekend. Chino and Sanches agreed the drug transaction would occur at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Chino gave the delivery men Sanches\u2019s phone number to call when they got close.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">In North Carolina, Chino recruited Adolfo Armenta to drive the cocaine to Florida and told him someone else would come along with him. On the day Armen-ta was to drive to Florida (November 21, 2010), Chino instructed Armenta to go to an exit off of a highway. There, Defendant Alvarado met Armenta and took him to a house where Chino was waiting outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">While Defendant Alvarado stood near the passenger-side door of Armenta\u2019s Isuzu Trooper, Chino gave Armenta two packages of cocaine and a bag to put them in. Armenta put the bag with the cocaine in his Isuzu Trooper. Chino put a third package of cocaine in a driver\u2019s side compartment in the rear of the Trooper. Defendant Alvarado then placed his own bags in the Trooper. Chino told Defendant Alvarado, \u201cWell, you know what you have to do already. Go on and leave because it is already very late.\u201d Chino told Armenta that all he had to do was drive. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>to Armenta, Defendant Alvarado was supposed to handle the exchange of drugs for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">During the November 21 drive to Florida, Defendant Alvarado gave Armenta directions. Chino called Defendant Alvarado every two hours to ask how everything was going. During one call, Chino told Defendant Alvarado that the buyers were waiting and gave Alvarado a phone number. Defendant Alvarado relayed the number to Armenta and told Armenta they were thirty or forty minutes away. While Defendant Alvarado continued to speak with Chino,. Armenta called the number and told Sanches that they were very close by-</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">About thirty minutes later, Armenta and Defendant Alvarado arrived at the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, which was under surveillance by law enforcement. Sanches, Rodriguez and the two confidential sources were waiting outside. As the Isuzu Trooper pulled in, Sanches signaled with his hand, and Defendant Alvarado nodded his head in acknowledgment. Defendant Alvarado said, \u201cThat\u2019s them, that\u2019s them. Those are the ones,\u201d and told Armenta to park. Defendant Alvarado said he was getting out to talk to the men and use the restroom. While Armenta waited in his vehicle, Defendant Alvarado exited the vehicle and entered the McDonald\u2019s. At that point, law enforcement arrested Armenta, Alvarado, Sanches and Rodriguez. A search of Armenta\u2019s Isuzu Trooper revealed the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Phone records showed numerous calls among Defendant Alvarado, Chino and Ar-menta. Incoming and outgoing calls between Chino\u2019s two phones and Defendant Alvarado\u2019s phone began on October 28, 2010, and continued until November 21, 2010. From November 18 to 21, Defendant Alvarado\u2019s phone called one of Chino\u2019s phones 37 times and the other phone 11 times. One of Chino\u2019s phones called Defendant Alvarado\u2019s phone 70 times. Alvarado\u2019s phone called Armenta\u2019s phone 6 times between November 14 and 18. Ar-menta\u2019s phone called Chino\u2019s, Sanches\u2019s and Alvarado\u2019s phones multiple times. On November 21, the day of the cocaine delivery, Chino\u2019s two phones called Defendant Alvarado\u2019s phone 44 times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">B. Defendant Alvarado\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Testifying in his defense, Defendant Alvarado claimed that he was merely riding as a passenger in Armenta\u2019s vehicle and did not know anything about the cocaine. According to Defendant Alvarado, he met Chino in Texas in late October at a neighbor\u2019s house. Alvarado and Chino agreed to travel together from Texas to North Carolina to find work. They arrived in North Carolina on November 13 or 14, 2010, where Chino introduced Defendant Alvarado to Armenta. Within a few days, the three men decided to return to Texas to pick up a car for Armenta. On the return trip to North Carolina, Chino told Defendant Alvarado that he wanted Alvarado to go with Armenta to Port Saint Lucie, Florida, and put the car in Alvarado\u2019s name. Alvarado did not agree, but decided to ride with Armenta to Florida. The men arrived back in North Carolina on November 19 and stayed at Armenta\u2019s house. Defendant Alvarado said that he did not see any cocaine and that neither Armenta nor Chino told him they were delivering cocaine to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">On November 21, 2010, Armenta drove the Isuzu from North Carolina to Florida. During the drive, Defendant Alvarado spoke with Chino only twice and never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>spoke to Sanches. Amenta spoke with Chino on his own phone and also on Alvarado\u2019s phone. When the government pointed out that phone records showed that Alvarado was talking to Chino at the same time Amenta was talking to Sanch-es, Alvarado said that Amenta used Alvarado\u2019s phone on loud speaker while speaking to someone else on his own phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">When they pulled into the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, Armenia told Defendant Alvarado they were stopping to eat. Alvarado claimed he was surprised when they were arrested because he did not know what was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Following Alvarado\u2019s testimony, the defense rested and renewed Alvarado\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. The district court again denied the motion. The jury found Alvarado guilty as to Count 2, but did not reach a verdict as to Count 1. The district court declared a mistrial as to Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">C.Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended an advisory guidelines range of 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on a offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of I. The PSI did not recommend a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement, but noted that the government believed Alvarado had provided false testimony at trial. The PSI stated that the district court was in the \u201cbest position to determine\u201d whether Alvarado\u2019s conduct obstructed justice for purposes of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Alvarado filed numerous objections to the PSI, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the PSI\u2019s recitation of the offense conduct and the failure to give a minor-role reduction and relief from the statutory mandatory minimum sentence under the safety-valve provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">D. <em>Pro Se </em>Motion to Substitute Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">After filing PSI objections, but before the sentencing hearing, Alvarado filed a <em>pro se </em>motion asking the district court to appoint new counsel to represent him at his sentencing. In the motion, Alvarado stated that his trial counsel: (1) did not spend enough time discussing Alvarado\u2019s case or let Alvarado fully relay his side of the events that had transpired; (2) failed to review discovery with Alvarado; (3) did not investigate leads or witnesses that would have shown Alvarado\u2019s innocence; (4) did not take Alvarado\u2019s phone calls; and (5) behaved in an unprofessional and belligerent manner when Alvarado \u201cexpressed [his] feelings on [counsel\u2019s] defense tactics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Alvarado\u2019s trial counsel then filed a motion for leave to withdraw as appointed counsel. In his motion, Alvarado\u2019s trial counsel stated that Alvarado had accused him of unethical and unprofessional conduct, which could possibly give rise to an actual conflict of interest, and noted that \u201cthe attorney/client relationship is not only incompatible, but apparently non-existent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">E. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Alvarado\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion for substitute counsel and his trial counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. The court stated that defense counsel had done a good job representing Alvarado and appeared to be filing all the appropriate motions for the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">With regard to his sentence, Alvarado objected, in relevant part, to an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. Alvarado maintained that he testified only to his recollection of the events surrounding his drive to Florida and should not receive the enhancement merely because he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>The district court overruled Alvarado\u2019s objection. The district court stated that it \u201cwould not have been amenable to\u201d imposing the enhancement if Alvarado had merely denied that he had done anything wrong. But, \u201cthe details of [Alvarado\u2019s] alternate universe that he testified about at the trial\u201d seemed to the district court \u201cto be not founded in any ... basis other than this is a good story.\u201d The district court noted Alvarado\u2019s testimony that Ar-menta drove down the highway while talking simultaneously on two different phones was \u201cnear ludicrous.\u201d The district court found that Alvarado\u2019s testimony contradicted the physical facts of the case, including the telephone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">With the addition of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, Alvarado\u2019s advisory guidelines range became 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a 100-month sentence. Alvarado filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe will not disturb a guilty verdict unless, given the evidence in the record, no trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 856 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, a defendant\u2019s own testimony can undermine a sufficiency challenge to the evidence presented at trial. <em>See United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1362 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1540, 179 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011). \u201cA defendant who chooses to testify runs the risk that the jury will disbelieve [his] testimony\u201d and instead conclude that the opposite of his testimony is true. <em>Id. </em>This risk is especially high when a case turns on subjective elements, such as the defendant\u2019s intent or knowledge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">To secure a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the government had to prove that Alvarado \u201c(1) knowingly (2) possessed cocaine (3) with intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>See United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). The defendant\u2019s \u201c[p]ossession may be either actual or constructive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant has constructive possession by maintaining \u201cdominion or control over the drugs or over the premises where the drugs are located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cConstructive possession can be established by either direct or circumstantial evidence and by inferences arising from the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">The trial record contains ample evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Alvarado knowingly possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute it. It is undisputed that Alvarado traveled from North Carolina to Florida in a vehicle carrying three kilograms of cocaine. The testimony of Armenta (Alvarado\u2019s co-defendant) established that Alvarado knew the cocaine was in the vehicle, that Alvarado had constructive possession of the cocaine while they traveled to Florida and that Alvarado intended to sell the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">According to Armenta, Alvarado stood by while Chino and Armenta loaded the cocaine into a bag and concealed it in the Isuzu and Chino told Armenta that Alvarado would handle the transaction when they arrived in Port Saint Lucie. While they drove, Alvarado was constantly on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>phone with Chino, Alvarado told Armenta where to go, and Alvarado told Armenta to call Sanches and reassure him that they would arrive soon. When they arrived, Alvarado acknowledged Sanches and Rodriguez with a nod, told Armenta he would talk with them and got out of the vehicle, while Armenta remained in the vehicle with the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">While Alvarado testified that he never saw the cocaine and did not know they were delivering cocaine, the jury was entitled to disbelieve him, which they obviously did. Moreover, Alvarado\u2019s discredited testimony is further evidence of his guilt. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, is more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">B. Motion for Substitute Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A defendant has a right to counsel, but not an unqualified right to the appointed counsel of his choice. Therefore, an indigent defendant has no right \u201cto demand a different appointed lawyer except for good cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Garey, </em>540 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir.2008) (en banc). Good cause for substitution of counsel exists where there is \u201ca fundamental problem, such as a conflict of interest, a complete breakdown in communication or an irreconcilable conflict which leads to an apparently unjust verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Because good cause for substitution of counsel cannot be solely based on a defendant\u2019s perception, a defendant\u2019s general loss of confidence or trust in his counsel, standing alone, is not sufficient. <em>Thomas v. Wainwright, </em>767 F.2d 738, 742 (11th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new counsel at sentencing, we consider: \u201c1) the timeliness of the motion; 2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into [the] merits of the motion; and 3) whether the conflict was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication between the defendant and his counsel thereby preventing an adequate defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1343 (11th Cir.1997). Even if the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion, the error is harmless unless the defendant shows \u201cthat, in the context of the sentencing hearing, he was somehow prejudiced by trial counsel continuing to represent him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">We reject Alvarado\u2019s argument that the district court did not conduct an adequate inquiry about the merits of his motion for substitute counsel. Although not conducting a separate hearing, the district court was fully apprised of the grounds by Alvarado\u2019s motion and in his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Also, the district court witnessed the relationship between counsel and Alvarado over the course of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Further, the record does not show the kind of serious breakdown in communication warranting substitute counsel in the sentencing phase. Despite any problems Alvarado and his counsel were having, counsel was able to prepare and file extensive written objections to the PSI. Instead, Alvarado\u2019s motion was founded on a general lack of confidence in his counsel\u2019s representation, which does not meet the good-cause standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court erred, any error was harmless because Alvarado has not shown prejudice in his sentencing. Alvarado argues that his counsel failed to obtain and present exculpatory evidence \u2014 primarily potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>witnesses who could verify Alvarado\u2019s trial testimony \u2014 that \u201cprobably would have affected the district court\u2019s rulings\u201d as to whether Alvarado was entitled to a minor-role reduction, an obstruction-of-justice enhancement and safety-valve relief. However, the district court was bound by the jury\u2019s finding of guilt in calculating the guidelines range. Thus, any alleged failure to present evidence of Alvarado\u2019s innocence at sentencing did not prejudice him.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">C. Obstruction-of-Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 BC1.1, a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by two levels if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. One type of conduct that obstructs justice is \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4; see <em>also United States v. </em>Williams, 627 F.3d 839, 845 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that a defendant\u2019s trial testimony that is irreconcilable with the evidence credited by the jury constitutes obstruction of justice for purposes of \u00a7 3Cl.l\u2019s enhancement). Perjury occurs when a defendant offers \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). Where the basis for the obstruction-of-justice enhancement is perjury, \u201ca general finding that an enhancement is warranted suffices if it encompasses all of the factual predicates for a perjury finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Here, the district court\u2019s findings that Alvarado\u2019s \u201ctestimony was not truthful\u201d and \u201capparently perjurious\u201d were not clearly erroneous. As the district court pointed out, Alvarado\u2019s sworn testimony that he knew nothing about the cocaine and talked with Chino only once during the trip directly contradicted Armenta\u2019s testimony and the physical evidence, including phone records. In addition, Alvarado\u2019s sworn version of events was irreconcilable with the evidence credited by the jury, and thus the district court did not err in imposing the obstruction-of-justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\">.
