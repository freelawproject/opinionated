Local Rule 1.03(e). On appeal, Castro only argues about the underlying merits of his case, and not about the dismissal under Local Rule 1.03(e). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a lawsuit for failure to comply with the rules of the court for abuse of discretion. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). Although we give liberal construction to the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, we have nevertheless required them to conform to procedural rules. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007). If a party, even a <em>pro se </em>litigant, fails to raise an issue on appeal, he has effectively abandoned that issue. <em>See Tanner Adver. Grp. v. Fayette Cnty., </em>451 F.3d 777, 787 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that a party must \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d indicate that he is seeking to raise an issue on appeal, or that issue will be considered abandoned). <em>See also Gardner v. Blackburn, </em>569 F.2d 856, 857 (5th Cir.1978) (stating that the <em>pro se </em>prisoners were deemed to have abandoned all arguments not raised in their brief).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may dismiss a case when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>plaintiff fails to comply with procedural rules or a court order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). A federal district court has the inherent power to dismiss a case <em>sua sponte </em>under Rule 41(b). <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 48-49, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). Unless otherwise stated, a dismissal under Rule 41(b) will be treated as a dismissal with prejudice. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Dismissal of a lawsuit with prejudice under Rule 41(b) is a severe sanction that should only be used in extreme circumstances where lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice. <em>Boazman v. Economics Laboratory, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 210, 212 (5th Cir.1976). We will apply a less stringent standard, however, when the district court dismisses a lawsuit without prejudice and the statute of limitations does not prevent the plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">A district court may adopt and amend local rules governing its practice, as long as those rules are adopted using proper procedures and are consistent with federal statutes and rules. Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(a); <em>Hoffmann-La Roche v. Sperling, </em>493 U.S. 165, 172, 110 S.Ct. 482, 107 L.Ed.2d 480 (1989). Local rules are rules which are necessary for the district court to carry out the conduct of its business. <em>Frazier v. Heebe, </em>482 U.S. 641, 645, 107 S.Ct. 2607, 96 L.Ed.2d 557 (1987). Local rules have the force of law. <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>558 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 705, 710, 175 L.Ed.2d 657 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Parties instituting a civil action in district court are required to pay filing fees, and each district court, by local rule, may require advance payment of such fees. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914(a), (c). A prisoner bringing a civil action may proceed without prepayment of fees by filing an affidavit to proceed in forma pauperis. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(l)-(2). Once a <em>pro se </em>IFP litigant is in court, he is subject to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the local rules of the court. <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989). In the Middle District of Florida, a prisoner\u2019s case is subject to dismissal by the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>if the filing fee is not paid or if the application to proceed IFP is not filed within 30 days of the commencement of the action. M.D. Fla. Local R. 1.03(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">On appeal, Castro raises various issues regarding the merits of his case, but he does not directly address the district court\u2019s reasons for the dismissal of his complaint \u2014 the failure to pay filing fees or move to proceed IFP. Therefore, Castro has abandoned the sole issue on appeal. <em>Tanner Adver. Grp., </em>451 F.3d at 787; <em>Gardner, </em>569 F.2d at 857. But even assuming he had raised this issue properly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his complaint without prejudice under M.D. Fla. Local Rule 1.03(e). Indeed, even if, as Castro claims, the district court never informed him that he was required to pay a filing fee or file a request to proceed IFP under Local Rule 1.03(e), the district court\u2019s actions did not affect or otherwise prejudice Castro\u2019s ability to assert his civil claim because the district court expressly dismissed Castro\u2019s complaint without prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-13\">. In <em>Bonner v.
