The breach of contract claim was tried to the district court without a jury, after which the court issued a memorandum decision and final judgment in favor of certain plaintiffs. An appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">In their amended complaint, the plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, race discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision and negligent training, and false imprisonment. In addition, all of the plaintiffs, except Keaton Williams, asserted a claim of libel. Plaintiff, DeVion Smith, asserted a claim of disability discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).
