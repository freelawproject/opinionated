The district court ruled that Lewis was exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">An employee is exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if he is subject to the rules promulgated by the Secretary of Transportation under the Motor Carriers Act. <em>Spires v. Ben Hill Cnty., </em>980 F.2d 683, 686 (11th Cir.1993). The Secretary regulates employees who work for a private motor carrier that provides transportation in interstate commerce and whose work activities affect the \u201csafety of operation\u201d of that motor carrier, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 782.2, including truck drivers, mechanics, loaders, and helpers, <em>Levinson v. Spector Motor Serv., </em>330 U.S. 649, 673, 67 S.Ct. 931, 943, 91 L.Ed. 1158 (1947). The employee need not devote all or even a majority of his time to safety activities, <em>id. </em>at 674, 67 S.Ct. at 944; it is enough that a \u201cloader\u201d devote a \u201csubstantial part\u201d of his time to \u201cactivities affecting safety of operation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 681, 67 S.Ct. at 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Lewis is a \u201cloader\u201d who is subject to regulation under the Motor Carrier Act and exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. A \u201cloader\u201d is an employee of a carrier \u201cwhose duties include ... the proper loading of ... motor vehicles so that they may be safely operated on the highways\u201d and who \u201cexereis[es] judgment and discretion in planning and building a balanced load or in placing, distributing, or securing the pieces of freight in such a manner that the safe operation of the vehicles on the highways in interstate or foreign commerce will not be jeopardized.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 782.5(a). Lewis testified that he was a \u201cloader\u201d for Eskridge Trucking who was unsupervised as he filled trailers with wood shavings and ensured that the loads were balanced, weighed the trailers, and inspected the trailers for maintenance problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Lewis includes, in his statement of the issues, an argument that he was not compensated for the time while he was on call for Eskridge Trucking, but he does not include any argument in his brief about this issue. <em>\u201c </em>\u2018The law is by now well settled in this Circuit that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tanner Adver. Group, LLC v. Fayette Cnty., Ga., </em>451 F.3d 777, 785 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Eskridge Trucking.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
