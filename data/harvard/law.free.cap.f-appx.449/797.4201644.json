Benedict, Ph. D., and the grant of defendants Louisville Ladder, Inc. and The Home Depot USA, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The issues presented on appeal are: (1) whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding the expert testimony of Dr. Benedict; and (2) whether the district erred in finding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a Cassisi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> inference and in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Fanin v. U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, </em>572 F.3d 868, 871 (11th Cir.2009). A district court\u2019s ruling excluding an expert witness under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>General Electric Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997); <em>Rink v. Cheminova, </em>400 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">After reviewing the record, and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we first conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 principal expert witness, Dr. Benedict. We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Dr. Benedict\u2019s failed test alone could support an exclusion of his testimony. We also agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Dr. Benedict\u2019s new opinion set forth in his deposition testimony violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">In <em>Cassisi v. Maytag Company, </em>396 So.2d 1140 (Fla. 1st DCA 1981), the Florida appellate court held that a legal inference is created that a product was defective at the time of injury or the time of sale when it malfunctions during normal use. The district court in its well-reasoned order held that the <em>Cassisi </em>inference is not applicable to this case because the ladder in question still existed and had been inspected by the plaintiffs\u2019 expert. Moreover, the plaintiffs did not prove that the ladder malfunctioned as required by <em>Cassisi. See Rink v. Cheminova, Inc., </em>400 F.3d at 1295 n. 9. Finally, the record demonstrates that the plaintiff failed to subject the ladder to a normal operation. The ladder was set up at too steep an angle at the time of Cannioto\u2019s fall which, in turn, caused it to slide as he climbed it. The record demonstrates that Cannioto also failed to secure the top of the ladder. Accordingly, for the above-stated reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness and the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-10\">. <em>Cassisi v.
