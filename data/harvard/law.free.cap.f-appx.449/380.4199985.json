The district court imposed a within-guidelines-range sentence of 46 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">Lacayo appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for downward departure based on credit for time served in state custody after his parole was revoked and he was adjudicated guilty of the offense of indecency with a child. Specifically, he argues that the district court erred when it arbitrarily concluded that no federal judge would run Lacayo\u2019s federal and state sentences concurrently based on the time that he had spent serving the state sentence after he was found by immigration officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-23\">Under <em>United States v. Barrera-Saucedo, </em>385 F.3d 533, 537 (5th Cir.2004), \u201cit is permissible for a sentencing court to grant a downward departure to an illegal alien for all or part of time served in state custody from the time immigration authorities locate the defendant until he is taken into federal custody.\u201d \u201cThis Court has jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure from the Guidelines only if the refusal was based on an error of law.\u201d <em>Barrera-Saucedo, </em>385 F.3d at 535. \u201cA refusal to grant a downward departure is a violation of law only if the court mistakenly assumes that it lacks authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 248 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Lacayo does not argue that the district court believed that it was not authorized to depart. Furthermore, there is no indication in the record that the district court was under the mistaken impression that it could not depart under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>law. The court specifically addressed the issue of a departure based on credit for time served but concluded that it was not warranted in this case. Thus, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Lacayo\u2019s downward departure motion. <em>See Barrera-Saucedo, </em>385 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
