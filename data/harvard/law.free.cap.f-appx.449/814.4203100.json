On appeal, N\u00fa\u00f1ez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court focused on his past criminal history to the exclusion of other appropriate factors. According to N\u00fa\u00f1ez, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>a downward variance from the guideline range was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in [ 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 8553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and alteration omitted). We vacate a sentence only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011) (quotation omitted). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">When sentencing a defendant, a district court must consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with training, medical care, or correctional treatment; (3) the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range; (4) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants with similar records; and (6) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (providing that the court must consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)(D), and (a)(4)(7) when sentencing a defendant upon revocation of supervised release); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)(D), and (a)(4)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Nu-\u00f1ez\u2019s 30-month sentence was substantively reasonable. The district court properly considered all the factors and imposed a within-range guideline sentence, well below the 20-year statutory maximum. As N\u00fa\u00f1ez himself mentions, there are almost no factors that would distinguish him from a typical illegal reentry case. He had a criminal history involving drugs, and even if the court could have deemed his prior conduct less serious, it was not unreasonable to treat it in the manner set forth in the guidelines, as serious, particularly since N\u00fa\u00f1ez committed fraud to avoid detection after reentering the country. Accordingly, for the aforementioned reasons, we affirm Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
