After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-24\">On May 14, 2010, Osorio and Jorge Mo-tato, Osorio\u2019s alleged coconspirator, went to Cargo Zone and tried to send a package under the alias \u201cBladimir Pizza\u201d labeled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u201ctools\u201d to Osorio\u2019s deceased brother in Cali, Colombia. Agents stopped the shipment and inspected the package, which weighed 203 pounds and contained old, used tools layered over 4 Bushmaster .223 rifles, each with its serial numbers obliterated. Agents immediately arrested Osorio at Miami International Airport where he was preparing to board a flight to Colombia. Agents also arrested Motato.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\">Between August 2008 and May 2010, Osorio bought 26 firearms, mostly Bushmaster .223 rifles. Motato often accompanied Osorio to purchase the firearms and sometimes purchased firearms himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Meanwhile, Osorio and Motato used Cargo Zone, a common carrier, to ship at least 10 packages marked \u201ctools\u201d or \u201cused tools\u201d to Cali, Colombia. Eight of these packages weighed between 153 and 243 pounds, and all of the packages were shipped a few days after Osorio purchased a firearm. Osorio sent the packages under the alias \u201cBladimir Pizza\u201d or \u201cBladimir Osorio\u201d and addressed the packages to a vacant address under the name of his deceased brother. Days after he shipped each package, Osorio traveled to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The presentence investigation report (PSI) set Osorio\u2019s base offense level at 26 because the probation officer concluded that Osorio\u2019s offense involved more than 10 non-fully automatic small firearms. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(2). Osorio objected, arguing that his offense involved fewer than 10 firearms and, therefore, his base offense level should be 14 rather than 26. \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(l). At his sentencing hearing, he argued that the government failed to prove that he shipped any of the other firearms he bought, so \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(2) could not apply. The district court overruled Osorio\u2019s objection, finding that his pattern of previous firearm purchases, shipments, and trips to Colombia matched the events that formed the basis of his conviction. Thus, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Osorio shipped at least 7 of the 22 additional firearms from August 2008 to May 2010. Osorio appeals this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1323 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cWe cannot find clear error \u2018unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Glassroth v. Moore, </em>335 F.3d 1282, 1292 (11th Cir.2003)). When a defendant challenges one of the factual bases of his sentence, the government bears the burden of presenting reliable and specific evidence to establish the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err by finding that Osorio shipped more than 10 firearms to Colombia. Osorio\u2019s conspiracy conviction is analogous to drug-conspiracy cases in which the amount of drugs seized \u201cdoes not reflect the scale of the offense,\u201d requiring the district court to \u201capproximate the quantity of the controlled substance\u201d for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>89 F.3d 1501, 1506 (11th Cir.1996). In such cases, \u201ca court may base its computation on evidence showing the average frequency and amount of a defendant\u2019s [illegal dealings] over a given period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although sentencing in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>manner cannot be based on mere speculative calculations, sentencing \u201cmay be based on fair, accurate, and conservative estimates of the quantity of [illegal dealings] attributable to a defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>139 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The district court in this case conservatively determined based on reliable and specific evidence in the record that Osorio previously shipped at least 10 firearms to Colombia. Osorio purchased 26 firearms and shipped packages to Colombia days after most purchases. He shipped 10 packages in the same manner as the package found to contain 4 of the 26 firearms. The packages were roughly the same weight (approximately 150 to 200 pounds), were each labeled \u201ctools\u201d or \u201cused tools,\u201d were shipped through Cargo Zone under the alias \u201cBladimir Pizza\u201d or \u201cBladimir Osorio,\u201d and were sent to the address of Osorio\u2019s deceased brother. Osorio repeatedly traveled to Colombia after shipping a package, and he was apprehended while attempting to do the same. This evidence shows a pattern of behavior that, when compared to the circumstances of Osorio\u2019s conviction, demonstrate that he likely shipped a number of the unrecov-ered firearms as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Regarding the total number of firearms Osorio shipped, the district court\u2019s finding was not clear error. Osorio made 10 shipments in addition to the shipment agents seized. Because the seized shipment contained 4 firearms, the district court\u2019s estimate that he shipped at least 7 other firearms in any combination in the 10 previous shipments was conservative.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Because the district court\u2019s conclusion that Osorio shipped additional firearms was based on reliable and specific evidence, and because its estimation of the total number of firearms shipped was fair and conservative, the district court did not commit clear error in setting Osorio\u2019s base offense level at 26. Accordingly, we affirm the district court and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-5\">.
