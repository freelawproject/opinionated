At sentencing, the district court, among other things, applied a five-level \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d increase for Counts One, Three and Five (the robberies) because Reid had brandished a firearm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). The district court imposed concurrent 120-month sentences on Counts One, Three and Five; a mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence on Count Two; and mandatory consecutive 240-month sentences on Counts Four and Six, for an initial total 660-month sentence. Reid appealed his convictions, but not his sentences. This Court affirmed. <em>See United States v. Reid, </em>No. 98-4337, 1999 WL 680195 (11th Cir. Aug. 20, 1999) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">On November 1, 2000, Amendment 599 amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, which provides the base offense level for a defendant who commits a \u00a7 924(c) offense. After Amendment 599, if the district court imposes a \u00a7 924(c) sentence \u201cin conjunction with a sentence for the underlying offense\u201d the court \u201cdo[es] not apply any specific offense characteristics for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In 2008, Reid filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 599. Reid argued that under Amendment 599, his consecutive, twenty-year sentences on Counts Four and Six were improper because they were charged in a single indictment. The district court denied Reid\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. On appeal, this Court affirmed the district court as to Counts Two, Four and Six (the firearm counts) because Amendment 599 had no effect on those sentences. However, the Court vacated and remanded as to Counts One, Three and Five (the robbery counts) because application of Amendment 599 eliminated the \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), which resulted in a new guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment on those counts. <em>See United States v. Reid, </em>364 Fed.Appx. 554 (11th Cir.2010). As noted earlier, the original sentence on these counts was 120 months concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">On remand, Reid was represented by counsel and argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court should resentence Reid to a single mandatory 60-month sentence on Counts One, Three and Five because they were charged in the same indictment and the sentences were imposed on the same day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted Reid\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and imposed three concurrent 70-month sentences, at the low end of the new, amended guidelines range, as to Counts One, Three and Five. The district court ran the three, new 70-month sentences concurrent to each other, but consecutive to the unchanged sentences for Counts Two, Four and Six, for a total of 610 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">On appeal, Reid argues that: (1) his 1996 indictment was flawed because it did not identify with sufficient specificity under which subsection of \u00a7 924(c) he was charged; (2) Counts Four and Six should not have received consecutive, twenty-year sentences as \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>victions under \u00a7 924(c) because those offenses were charged in the same indictment as Count Two; and (3) remand is necessary because the district court failed to address these arguments when it granted his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The problem for Reid is that his claims are outside the scope of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce an incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment when the defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a guidelines range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a de novo resentencing\u201d and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Here, only the sentences for Counts One, Three and Five received the \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d enhancement eliminated by Amendment 599. As such, these were the only sentences the district court could modify. The district court lacked the authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to consider Reid\u2019s arguments regarding his indictment and his sentences for Counts Two, Four and Six.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly limited its determination to whether to reduce Reid\u2019s sentences on Counts One, Three and Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\">. Reid also argued that, pursuant to <em>Pepper v. United States, 562 </em>U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), he was entitled to a full resentencing hearing, including consideration of his post-sentencing rehabilitation. Even construed liberally, Reid's <em>pro se </em>appellate brief does not raise this argument, and thus he has abandoned it. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that, although we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, \"issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AkP\">. Reid's arguments are also barred by the law of the case doctrine because he did not raise them in his direct appeal after his original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
