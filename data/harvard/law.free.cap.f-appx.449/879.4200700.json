After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Petitioner Lumpkins had a brother, Marvin Lumpkins, who was murdered on September 19, 2002. A week later, allegedly in retaliation for Marvin\u2019s murder, a drive-by shooting killed Johnnie Gatlin, Deon Kirkland, and Christopher Kirkland (the \u201cGatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders\u201d). On October 4, 2002, Petitioner Lumpkins confessed to his involvement in the Gatlin\u2014 Kirkland murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">In the state court trial in 2005, the State introduced Lumpkins\u2019s confession, along with other evidence. The State also introduced a videotaped confession of Lump-kins\u2019s codefendant, Maurice Silas, who also testified and identified himself and Lump-kins as the gunmen in the drive-by shooting. The jury convicted Lumpkins, who is now serving a life sentence on his three murder convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">In 2008, Lumpkins filed this \u00a7 2254 petition asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that his confession was obtained in violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and that his state murder convictions should be vacated. Because the sole issue before us involves Lumpkins\u2019s confession, we detail the evidence and the state trial court\u2019s findings about his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">II. SUPPRESSION HEARING BEFORE THE STATE TRIAL COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">Before trial, Lumpkins moved to suppress his confession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At a two-day suppression hearing, the State submitted the following testimony and evidence. In an October 2, 2002 videotaped statement to the police, Maurice Silas confessed to the September 29, 2002 Gatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders. On the videotape, Silas stated that Petitioner Lumpkins was the other shooter and Latroy Bouknight was the driver of the vehicle used in this drive-by shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-18\">On October 3, 2002, Sheriffs Detective Guy Weber was on patrol in an unmarked car. Detective Weber was instructed to locate Lumpkins and ask if Lumpkins would come voluntarily to the sheriffs office. Weber was instructed not to arrest Lumpkins and not to force Lumpkins to come to the sheriffs office. Weber and his partner drove around looking for Lump-kins and located his vehicle. Weber began following the vehicle with the intention of calling for a marked police vehicle to conduct a traffic stop, but Lumpkins\u2019s vehicle eventually pulled to the side of the road and stopped without Weber\u2019s initiating a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">Sheriffs Detective Weber approached the vehicle, where Lumpkins sat in the passenger seat. A woman named Gabrielle Solomon was the driver. Lumpkins voluntarily agreed to accompany Weber to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>the sheriffs office. Weber transported Lumpkins to the sheriffs office in his unmarked vehicle, which did not contain a cage. Weber did not handcuff Lumpkins, did not read him his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, did not ask him any questions, and did not tell him that he was in custody. Weber and Lumpkins arrived at the sheriffs office around 12:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">A. First Interview About Marvin\u2019s Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Around 12:45 p.m., Detective David Meacham, a homicide detective investigating Marvin\u2019s murder, met Lumpkins in an interview room at the sheriffs office. For approximately 45 minutes, Detective Meac-ham and another detective interviewed Lumpkins about Marvin\u2019s murder. The interview was videotaped. Meacham did not read Lumpkins his <em>Miranda </em>warnings because he was interviewing Lumpkins only about his brother Marvin\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">During the interview, Lumpkins identified Marvin\u2019s killer in a photospread and stated that the killer was nicknamed \u201cC.\u201d Detective Meacham neither believed Lumpkins was in custody nor told Lump-kins that he was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">B. Second Interview About the Gat-lin \u2014 Kirkland Murders</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">At approximately 1:53 p.m., Detectives Shawn Coarsey and Robert Nelson, the lead detectives on the Gatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders, entered the interview room. Detective Nelson read Lumpkins his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Lumpkins signed a form acknowledging that he read and understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">For about an hour and a half, Detectives Nelson and Coarsey questioned Lumpkins about the Gatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders. The detectives then took a break to allow Lumpkins to use the restroom. Neither officer threatened Lumpkins or promised him anything in return for making any statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">After the bathroom break and around 3:30 p.m., the interview continued and Lumpkins gave the names of several family members who were his alibi witnesses. Detective Nelson responded that it would take time to locate the witnesses, and Lumpkins agreed to wait while the detectives located his alibi witnesses. The detectives left the interview room around 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">At 6:20 p.m. the detectives returned to the interview room and showed Lumpkins Silas\u2019s videotaped confession incriminating Lumpkins as the other shooter. The detectives then left. At 6:50 p.m., someone brought Lumpkins food.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">At 8:00 p.m., Detective Nelson returned and continued to question Lumpkins, who continued to deny involvement in the shooting. This second part of the questioning about the Gatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders was videotaped. Detective Nelson confirmed that Lumpkins had read and understood his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">Detective Nelson then confronted Lumpkins with the discrepancies in his alibi. During the interview, Lumpkins several times indicated that if the police were going to arrest him, then the police should go ahead and take him on to jail and he was \u201cthrough with this.\u201d Throughout, Lumpkins continuously talked to Detective Nelson. When Detective Nelson got up to leave, Lumpkins said implicitly about the murders: \u201cIt\u2019s over with. What happened, it just happened. I\u2019m through with it man. I\u2019m through with it. Take me on to jail, man.\u201d During the entire interview, Lumpkins never explicitly stated that he did not want to talk to the police or that he did not want to talk to Detective Nelson. Rather, the tenor of the overall colloquy was Detective Nelson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>saying to Lumpkins, \u201cI know you\u2019re involved,\u201d and Lumpkins\u2019s denying involvement in the shootings and in effect trying to call Detective Nelson\u2019s bluff by saying just go ahead and arrest me then if you don\u2019t believe me.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Between approximately 9:00 p.m. and 2:30 a.m., the detectives interviewed other witnesses and allowed Lumpkins to sleep and use the restroom. Eventually, Lump-kins\u2019s sister, Dora Lumpkins Gettis, told one detective that Lumpkins had admitted to her that he was involved in the Gatlin\u2014 Kirkland murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Around 2:30 a.m., Detective Nelson and another detective returned to the interview room, accompanied by Gettis, because they wanted Gettis to tell Lumpkins what she had told the detectives. According to Detective Nelson, Gettis told Lumpkins that she had \u201ctold them what you told me,\u201d and then Lumpkins confessed. Gettis left the room, and there was a brief break in the questioning. At 3:40 a.m., Lumpkins confessed again on video and signed a statement. Detective Nelson testified that he never promised Lumpkins anything in return for the statement and never threatened Lumpkins. According to Detective Nelson, Lumpkins was advised of his constitutional rights, and Lumpkins never stated that he did not want to talk to the police and did not request an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">C. State Trial Court Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The state court denied the motion to suppress. In a subsequent written order, the state court found that Lumpkins voluntarily agreed to accompany Detective Weber to the sheriffs office and arrived at the sheriffs office around 12:30 p.m. At 1:53 p.m., after an interview about the murder of his brother, two other detectives entered the interview room to ask Lump-kins about the Gatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders. The detectives properly informed Lump-kins of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The state court found that Lumpkins understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, was not impaired, was not threatened or promised anything, and voluntarily spoke with the detectives. The court found that the interview about the Gatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders initially lasted approximately an hour and a half.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">The state court also found that the later interview concluded at 3:40 a.m. and that Lumpkins \u201cwas not illegally detained when he made those incriminating statements.\u201d Specifically, the court found that Lump-kins: (1) \u201chad been in police custody from 10:30 A.M. on October 3, 2002 until 3:40 A.M. on October 4, 2002 ..., a time period of approximately seventeen (17) hours\u201d; (2) \u201cwas attempting to establish an alibi\u201d; and (3) \u201cremained at the police station voluntarily in an effort to convince the police that he was not involved in the shootings.\u201d The state court further found that the police (1) summoned several of Lumpkins\u2019s family members to the police station; (2) did not threaten the family members; and (3) did not attempt to influence the family members to pressure Lumpkins to confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">The court also found that Lumpkins: (1) \u201cnever invoked any of the rights set-forth in his constitutional rights form\u201d; (2) \u201cnever asked for an attorney\u201d; and (3) made statements to the effect that he was through and that the detectives should take him to jail, but \u201che continued to talk to the detectives without specifically telling the detectives that he had decided to terminate the interrogation.\u201d Based on these findings, the state court concluded that the detectives were not required to terminate the interrogation. Finally, the court found that Lumpkins was never threatened with the death penalty in an attempt to coerce a confession and that the police officers involved in the investigation had not engaged \u201cin any unlawful activities so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>cause [Lumpkins\u2019s] statements to have been made involuntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">On direct appeal, Lumpkins challenged the denial of his motion to suppress, and Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeal affirmed without a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">III. DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">In 2008, Lumpkins timely filed this \u00a7 2254 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His petition asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that his confession was obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because the detectives continued to interrogate him after he invoked his right to remain silent. The district court denied Lumpkins\u2019s petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">After noting that \u201cit is difficult to ascertain at what time the interview of [Lump-kins] became a custodial interrogation,\u201d the district court declined to address this custody issue. Rather, the district court concluded that, even if Lumpkins was in custody, the state trial court reasonably found Lumpkins: (1) was \u201cproperly given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u201d; (2) \u201cvoluntarily elected to waive his rights\u201d; (3) \u201cnever made any unambiguous statements that could be construed as an invocation of his right to cease the questioning\u201d; and (4) voluntarily confessed, based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. In particular, the district court concluded that the state court\u2019s determination \u2014 that Lumpkins failed to unambiguously assert his right to remain silent \u2014 involved neither an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law nor an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented at the state court proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>Hall v. Thomas, </em>611 F.3d 1259, 1284 (11th Cir.2010). Under \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may grant habeas relief from a state court judgment only if the state court\u2019s decision on the merits of the issue was (1) contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">\u201c[A]n <em>unreasonable </em>application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law. Indeed, a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1862, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court repeatedly has admonished that \u201c[t]he petitioner carries the burden of proof\u2019 and that the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard is \u201ca difficult to meet\u201d and \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (quotation marks omitted). Under the Antiter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), <em>codified in </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, \u201ca state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from a federal court \u2018must show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an <em>error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u2019\u201d Bobby v. Dixon, </em>565 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 26, 27, 181 L.Ed.2d 328 (2011) (quoting <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)). In other words, we cannot grant relief unless Lumpkins can show that \u201cno fairminded jurist could agree with that [state] court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">V. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Lumpkins argues that the state trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his confession was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts and involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, namely, <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and its progeny. Lumpkins does not dispute that he was given and understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he does not claim that he asked for an attorney. Rather, Lumpkins argues that the police continued to question him despite his specific request to terminate the interrogation. Lumpkins also argues that his confession was involuntary because the interrogation in its entirety lasted 17 hours and the police used his sister to \u201ccajole\u201d him into confessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Under <em>Miranda, </em>the state must \u2014 prior to initiating any interrogation of a suspect \u2014 warn the suspect in police custody of his right to remain silent and of his right to have counsel, retained or appointed, present during interrogation. <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2259-60, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010). If, during custodial interrogation, a suspect indicates that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. at 1627. \u201c[T]he admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 103-04, 96 S.Ct. 321, 326, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975). Similarly, if an individual \u201cstates that he wants an attorney\u201d during a custodial interrogation, the interrogation \u201cmust cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 474, 86 S.Ct. at 1628.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">On the other hand, \u201cif a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2355, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). \u201cRather, the suspect must unambiguously request counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the suspect\u2019s statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 114 S.Ct. at 2356.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Moreover, in <em>Berghuis, </em>the Supreme Court applied <em>Davis\u2019s </em>unambiguous rule to a suspect\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent and held that a suspect must \u201cunambiguously\u201d invoke his right to remain silent. 130 S.Ct. at 2260. Because the suspect in <em>Berghuis </em>stated neither that he wanted to remain silent nor that he did not want to talk to the police, the Supreme Court held that the suspect failed unambiguously to invoke his right to remain silent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>\u201cThe inquiry as to whether a suspect\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent was ambiguous or equivocal is an objective one.\u201d <em>Medina v. Singletary, </em>59 F.3d 1095, 1101 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cA suspect must articulate his desire to cut off questioning with sufficient clarity that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be an assertion of the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Although \u201can accused\u2019s postrequest responses to further interrogation may not be used to cast retrospective doubt on the clarity of the initial request itself,\u201d the request \u201cmay be characterized as ambiguous or equivocal as a result of events preceding the request or of nuances inherent in the request itself.\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 99-100, 105 S.Ct. 490, 495, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984). \u201cThus, the determination of whether a suspect\u2019s right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored requires a case-by-ease analysis.\u201d <em>Medina, </em>59 F.3d at 1101 (alteration and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Here, the state trial court\u2019s decision\u2014denying Lumpkins\u2019s motion to suppress his confession\u2014was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law or an unreasonable determination of the facts. As the state court noted, Lumpkins never specifically told the detectives that he wanted or had decided to terminate the interrogation. Lumpkins\u2019s colloquy with the detectives, when placed in context, shows that Lumpkins was indicating that if the police were going to arrest him anyway, then they should go ahead and take him to jail and he was \u201cthrough with this.\u201d Given Lumpkins\u2019s unequivocal willingness to talk to the detectives throughout the interview, we cannot say that no \u201cfairminded jurist could agree\u201d with the state court\u2019s determination that Lumpkins never unambiguously invoked his right to remain silent. <em>See Dixon, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 26, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">We also conclude that the state court\u2019s determination that Lumpkins\u2019s confession was voluntary was supported by considerable evidence. As to length of the interrogation, the state court was not unreasonable in finding that the interview was extended in part because Lumpkins was attempting to establish his alibi. Lumpkins identified potential alibi witnesses and agreed to wait at the sheriffs office while the detectives located and interviewed the potential witnesses. The 17 hours thus included a 5 or 6 hour break while the detectives interviewed Lump-kins\u2019s alibi witnesses. Under these circumstances, the length of the interrogation did not render Lumpkins\u2019s confession involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Additionally, the state court was not unreasonable in finding that the detectives did not engage in any other \u201cunlawful activities\u201d so as to cause Lumpkins\u2019s statements to be involuntary. Lumpkins\u2019s sister, Gettis, agreed to talk to Lumpkins and to tell him that she already told the officers what he told her. The record contains no evidence that the police officers pressured Gettis to reveal this information or that the police officers deployed Gettis\u2019s information in order to \u201ccajole\u201d Lumpkins into confessing. Additionally, although we can find several cases in which courts have held that <em>preventing </em>a suspect from interacting with his family may affect the vol-untariness of a confession in certain circumstances,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we can find no case (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Lumpkins cites none) holding that, by allowing a suspect to talk to his family, the police improperly coerced a confession. We conclude that the state court was not unreasonable in concluding that, under the totality of the circumstances, Lumpkins voluntarily confessed to the Gatlin \u2014 Kirkland murders and that there was no violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lumpkins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-12\">. Lumpkins filed both an original and an amended motion to suppress. The state trial court considered both motions. For purposes of this \u00a7 2254 petition, we consider the motions together and refer to them as a single motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-9\">. After his direct appeal, Lumpkins moved for relief under Rule 3.850 of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure. Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeal denied Lumpkins\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion on the merits in October 2007 and denied rehearing in November 2007. Thus, Lumpkins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was timely filed in 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-19\">.
