Whitehead contends he should have been granted a writ of <em>audita querela </em>pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, because he did not discover his claimed double-jeopardy violation until after he had sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\">The question whether a prisoner may challenge his sentence via a writ of <em>audita querela </em>is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, </em>449 F.3d 655, 662 (5th Cir.2006) (questions of law reviewed <em>de </em>novo); <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a prisoner may challenge his sentence by filing a motion for a writ of <em>audita querela.\u201d). </em>The writ is not available if the objection can be brought pursuant to any other post-conviction rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>edy. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 488 (5th Cir.2010). Thus, the writ is not available when the prisoner may seek redress under \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1993). Neither a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion nor an inability to meet the requirements for pursuing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion renders the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
