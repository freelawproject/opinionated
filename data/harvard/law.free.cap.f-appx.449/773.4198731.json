The district court found that Miller could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because he had filed a prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied on the merits, and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 did not apply to allow him to proceed under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-26\">\u201cTypically, a petitioner collaterally attacks the validity of his federal sentence by filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition in limited circumstances \u2014 if the petitioner establishes that \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Id. </em>To meet this standard, a petitioner must show that: (1) his claim is based upon a retroactively applicable U.S. Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of the U.S. Supreme Court decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a non-existent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). Only if the petitioner \u201copens the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 petition by establishing these three elements may he proceed to argue the merits of his claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In addition, if a federal prisoner previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied or dismissed with prejudice, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. The restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions do not, by themselves, render that section inadequate or ineffective. <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. Thus, a petitioner who previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate cannot circumvent the successive motion restrictions by simply filing a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Applying these standards, the district court properly dismissed Miller\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Because Miller previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied on the merits, he could not again seek relief pursuant to \u00a7 2255 without obtaining prior authorization from this Court, which he did not do. Nor can Miller seek relief under \u00a7 2241 because he has not identified as the basis of any claim a retroactive Supreme Court decision that establishes he was convicted of a non-existent offense, nor has he asserted any legal claim that was unavailable to him at the time he filed his previous \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, he has failed to show that the \u00a7 2255 savings clause applies to \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-17\">.
