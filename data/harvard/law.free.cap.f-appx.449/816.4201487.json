Paguada was initially charged as inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (6) (A) (i), as an alien who had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>been admitted or paroled. Subsequently, the government added a second charge of removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), for being an alien who was convicted of a controlled substance offense. Paguada was found removable on both grounds and sought, as a form of relief, withholding of removal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the basis that, as a person with HIV/AIDS, he fears that he will be persecuted in Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In his petition for review, Paguada raises the same two claims that he raised before the BIA, and which the BIA denied. First, he argues that his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment was violated during the immigration court hearing because comments between witnesses, the government, and the IJ were not completely and simultaneously translated. Second, Paguada argues that, based on the record evidence, the BIA erred in determining that he had not established that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of his HIV status should he be removed to Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">When examining a petition for review, \u201cwe must first consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition at all.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>388 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2004). We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). Because the IJ found Paguada removable, in part, based on his conviction of a controlled-substance offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), we only have jurisdiction to review his petition to the extent that he raises constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>See Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1343-44 (11th Cir.2010) (no jurisdiction to review a final order of removal when an alien is removable for having committed an offense involving a controlled substance);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>but see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (\u201cNothing in sub-paragraph (B) or (C), ... which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review Paguada\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in determining, based on the record, that he failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted in Honduras based on his HIV status. Whether Paguada has established that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted for purposes of withholding of removal is a factual determination, <em>see Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002), not one that raises a constitutional claim or question of law, and therefore is not reviewable in this case where Paguada is removable for having committed a controlled substance offense. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Paguada\u2019s due process claim is, however, a constitutional claim for which we retain jurisdiction to review <em>de novo. Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2003). To establish substantial prejudice, an alien must show that the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>their proceeding would have been different but for the due process violation. <em>See Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Even if we agree with Paguada that parts of the immigration court hearing were not translated completely and simultaneously, we still must deny his claim because he has failed to show that any translation deficiency caused him substantial prejudice. Other than generalized statements in his brief that he has a right to a fair hearing and should be allowed to create a full record, Paguada fails to show how the outcome of his removal proceeding would have been different, but for the deficiencies he alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">PETITION DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Paguada also sought asylum and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, both claims which were denied and are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-13\">. Although the IJ did grant Paguada\u2019s application for voluntary departure, she also entered an alternate order of removal, thereby raising the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
