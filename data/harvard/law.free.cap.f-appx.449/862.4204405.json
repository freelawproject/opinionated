Davis, </em>433 Fed.Appx. 888, 890 (11th Cir.2011) (qualified immunity content).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">Plaintiffs in this case are all owners of real property in Duval County, Florida. In their complaint, plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive, and supplemental relief due to Overton\u2019s placement of a public notation on their property records that their properties had or might contain hazardous substances. According to Overton, he was sued in this action because he complied with the requirements of a consent decree;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> therefore, he contends he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>entitled to judicial immunity. The district court found that this assertion was misplaced. While non-judicial officers are entitled to \u201cabsolute immunity when their official duties \u2018have an integral relationship with the judicial process,\u2019 \u201d <em>Roland v. Phillips, </em>19 F.3d 552, 555 (11th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Ashbrook v. Hoffman, </em>617 F.2d 474, 476 (7th Cir.1980)), that immunity only attaches when the officials are acting \u201cwithin the scope of their authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this matter, plaintiffs allege that Over-ton acted outside and beyond the bounds of the consent decree when he placed the notation on the plaintiffs\u2019 property records. The district court agreed with that argument and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The consent decree does not require Overton to take any action. The only parties bound by the consent decree are the United States and the settling defendant, the consolidated City of Jacksonville as a county and political subdivision of the State of Florida, its successors and assigns. The pertinent language of the consent decree states that <em>the City of Jacksonville </em>\u201cshall satisfy this requirement through ordinances (1) directing the Duval County property appraiser to annotate the property record cards of all properties located within the site boundaries that there are or may be hazardous substances on the property; ...\u201d R.2, Exh. B at p. 16, \u00b6 27(1). There is no enacted ordinance authorizing the property appraiser (Over-ton) to place a notation on the information for the affected properties. R.2, \u00b6 17. Because the consent decree did not order Overton to take any action, he was not charged with its enforcement. Moreover, we conclude that the act of tagging the plaintiffs\u2019 properties with the notation was not integral to the judicial process. <em>See Roland, </em>19 F.3d at 555. Accordingly, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Overton was not entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity and therefore affirm its order denying Overton\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-10\">. A panel of our court determined that the district court's March 2, 2011, order denying Overton's motion to dismiss based on CERC-LA and sovereign immunity was not an immediately appealable order. <em>See </em>order filed on September 27, 2011. In that same order, our court held that the district court\u2019s order denying Overton\u2019s motion to dismiss based on judicial immunity was an appealable order. <em>Id.; see also Roland v.
