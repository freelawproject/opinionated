Gay, Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, San Antonio, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-12\">Jay Calvin Garcia, Minersville, PA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b408-14\">Before SMITH, BARKSDALE, and SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-15\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">Proceeding pro <em>se </em>and <em>in forma pauper-is, </em>Jay Calvin Garcia, federal prisoner # 28875-180, appeals the denial of his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a sentence reduction based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines concerning offenses involving cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">Garcia pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The district court departed downward from Garcia\u2019s career-offender sentencing range and sentenced him to 292-months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-23\">Denial of a motion for sentence reduction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791. Nevertheless, Garcia maintains: although he was designated a career offender, that the sentencing court departed downward indicates he was sentenced based on the crack-cocaine Guidelines and is therefore eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-24\">To the contrary, the district court denied relief based on its finding that Garcia\u2019s sentence was based on his career-offender status, rather than the amount of crack cocaine involved in the offense. Therefore, the record does not support Garcia\u2019s contention that his sentence was based on the crack-cocaine Guidelines. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
