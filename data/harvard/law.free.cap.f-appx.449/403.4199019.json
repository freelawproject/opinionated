He contends that the district court erred in applying the 12 level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) based on his 2010 Utah drug conviction, arguing that the Utah conviction does not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d on which the enhancement can be based. He insists that the Utah statute of conviction may be violated in ways that do not qualify as a drug-trafficking offense under the Guidelines and that the Utah judgment and docket sheet submitted with the presen-tence report do not provide a sufficient basis under <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) for determining that his conviction was for a drug-trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-22\">Based on the Utah judgment of conviction, the district court ruled that Sierra had been convicted of distribution of a controlled substance. At the sentencing hearing, Sierra admitted that he had been charged and convicted in Utah because he had sold crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. This admitted conduct constitutes distribution of a controlled substance and falls within \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Sierra\u2019s admission that he distributed crack cocaine and the information in the Utah judgment are sufficient to establish his prior conviction for a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d 479, 483 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.2008). The district court did not err in applying the 12 level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-23\">Sierra also argues claims he should not have been convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because his sole prior conviction in Utah has not been shown t\u2018o qualify as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d An aggravated felony is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) as \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>... including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Section 924(c) defines a drug trafficking crime as, inter alia, \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).\u201d Sierra\u2019s prior Utah conviction for distribution of a controlled substance thus qualifies as an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(a), and his contention to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
