LAMBERTH, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"At\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Pending before this Court is plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Enter Judgment and for an Interim Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Litigation Expenses [83]. This Court will GRANT plaintiffs\u2019 motion for final judgment in part and DENY the motion in part. The Court will enter final judgment in favor of the <em>Sloan </em>plaintiffs on their procedural APA claim and for the government with respect to all other claims. The Court will enter final judgment in favor of the government on all claims raised by the <em>Cohen </em>and the <em>Gurrola </em>plaintiffs. The Court will DENY plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an interim award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">For decades, the IRS collected an excise tax on long-distance calls based on the distance and duration of calls. <em>See Cohen v. United States, </em>650 F.3d 717, 719-20 (D.C.Cir.2011) (en banc). The service providers collected the tax and paid it over to the IRS. <em>Id. </em>However, as technology changed, service providers no longer calculated the distance of the call in their billing and the IRS began to base the tax solely on duration. <em>Id. </em>at 720. Multiple plaintiffs brought cases challenging this new method, seeking refunds and injunctive relief. Even after the IRS lost on this issue in the Eleventh Circuit, <em>see Am. Bankers Ins. Grp. v. United States, </em>408 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.2005), the Service continued to defend the tax in court and directed phone service providers to continue collecting it \u2014 even within the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Cohen, </em>650 F.3d at 720 (citing IRS Notice 2005-79). Only after four other circuits held that the tax was illegal, <em>see Reese Bros., Inc. v. United States, </em>447 F.3d 229, 234 (3d Cir.2006); <em>Fortis, Inc. v. United States, </em>447 F.3d 190, 190 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. United States, </em>431 F.3d 374, 379 (D.C.Cir.2005); <em>OfficeMax, Inc. v. United States, </em>428 F.3d 583, 600 (6th Cir.2005), did the IRS finally change its position. <em>See Cohen, </em>650 F.3d at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">In May 2006, without notice or opportunity for public comment, the IRS issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Notice 2006-50. This Notice discontinued the collection of the tax and provided a limited procedure that allowed some taxpayers to obtain a refund for taxes that had been illegally collected. <em>See Cohen, </em>650 F.3d at 720. More litigation ensued challenging the lawfulness and adequacy of this refund process. <em>Id. </em>at 720-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Three cases are involved in the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\"><em>Cohen v. United States, </em>05-cv-1237 (E.D.Wis.2005) was filed in 2005 as a putative class action, seeking refunds, an injunction against the collection of further taxes, and other relief. After the IRS issued Notice 2006-50, Mr. Cohen amended his class action complaint by adding a challenge to the notice as an \u201carbitrary and unreasonable administrative action\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See Second Amended Complaint [75] at 8, <em>Cohen, </em>05-cv-1237. Mr. Cohen\u2019s amended Complaint alleges that the \u201crestitution procedure adopted by the government arbitrarily, unreasonably, and unlawfully limits restitution of the funds unlawfully exacted from phone-users\u201d in several enumerated respects. The Complaint does not refer to the absence of notice and comment, or otherwise to the procedures used in issuing the Notice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>Sloan v. United States, </em>06-cv-483 (D.D.C.2006) was filed in March 2006 as a putative class action seeking refunds, an injunction against the collection of further taxes, and other relief. After the IRS adopted Notice 2006-50, the <em>Sloan </em>plaintiffs amended their Complaint, adding substantive and procedural APA challenges to the notice. Second Amended Complaint at 18-20, <em>Sloan v. United States, </em>06-cv-483 (D.D.C.2006). The Complaint\u2019s sixth Cause of Action alleges that the IRS failed to comply with the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements. <em>See id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\"><em>Gurrola v. United States, </em>06-cv-3425 (C.D.Cal.2006) was filed in June 2006, after Notice 2006-50 had already been issued. The Complaint does not include any claims for relief based on the APA, but the plaintiffs\u2019 response to the governments\u2019 motion to dismiss their claim did allege that Notice 2006-50 had been promulgated \u201cwithout any public notice, public comment or evidence.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Response in Opposition to Motion of Defendant United States\u2019 To Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint at 3, <em>Gurrola v. United States, </em>06-cv-3425 (C.D.Cal. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">In late 2006, the Multidistrict Litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) Panel transferred <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gurrola </em>to this Court where they were consolidated with <em>Sloan </em>\u201cfor pretrial proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Long-Distance Tel. Serv. Fed. Excise Tax Refund Litig., </em>469 F.Supp.2d 1348, 1350 (J.P.M.L.2006) (Transfer Order); <em>accord </em>Practice and Procedure Order Establishing the Governing Practice and Procedure Upon Transfer Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407(a) at 1, <em>In re Long-Distance Tel. Serv. Fed. Excise Tax Refund Litig., </em>07-mc-14, Docket No. 8 (Jan. 29, 2007) (noting that these actions are \u201cconsolidated for pretrial purposes\u201d); <em>see also Cohen, </em>650 F.3d at 721. Plaintiffs declined to file a consolidated amended complaint \u201c[i]n light of the extensive prior briefing in all the actions, and in light of the fact that such briefing is complete.\u201d <em>See </em>Joint Status Report, <em>In re Long-Distance Tel. Serv. Fed. Excise Tax Refund Litig., </em>07-mc-14, Docket No. 20 (D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Judge Urbina dismissed the consolidated cases. <em>In re Long-Distance Tel. Serv. Fed. Excise Tax Refund Litig., </em>539 F.Supp.2d 281, 287 (D.D.C.2008). He concluded that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, to state valid claims under federal law, and that No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tice 2006-50 constituted unreviewable agency action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The D.C. Circuit reversed. <em>Cohen v. United States, </em>578 F.3d 1, 4-14 (D.C.Cir. 2009). Judge Rogers Brown, joined by Judge Garland, concluded that Notice 2006-50 constituted final agency action reviewable under the APA, and rejected the government\u2019s jurisdictional challenges. <em>Id. </em>Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the Anti-Injunction Act and the ripeness doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 16-21 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The D.C. Circuit granted the government\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc. <em>Cohen v. United States, </em>599 F.3d 652 (D.C.Cir.2010). The en banc court affirmed the decision of the panel, and remanded to this Court to consider the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 APA claims. <em>Cohen, </em>650 F.3d 717. Judge Kavanaugh reiterated his objections to reaching the merits of these claims, and was joined in dissent by Chief Judge Sentelle and Judge Henderson. <em>See id. </em>at 736-745 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">On remand, Judge Urbina found that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s en banc opinion had concluded that the IRS violated the APA\u2019s procedural notice-and-comment requirements by issuing Notice 2006-50. He prospectively vacated the Notice, and remanded to the IRS for further action. <em>In re Long-Distance Tel. Serv. Fed. Excise Tax Refund Litig., </em>853 F.Supp.2d 138 (D.D.C. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In May 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking entry of judgment in favor of all plaintiffs and an interim award of attorneys\u2019 fees of more than $6.5 million in fees and expenses, and seeking the court\u2019s permission to allow them to file an additional motion for attorneys\u2019 fees when the IRS takes further actions. PI. Br. at 10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">The case was reassigned to the undersigned Judge upon Judge Urbina\u2019s retirement from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">A. Final Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">Plaintiffs move for an entry of final judgment in favor of the <em>Cohen, Gurrola </em>and <em>Sloan </em>plaintiffs on their procedural APA claim. This Court will enter final judgment only in favor of the <em>Sloan </em>plaintiffs, and only on this single claim. It will enter judgment in favor of the government on all other claims and with respect to the other two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-15\">\u201cEvery judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document----\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a). A party may move for final judgment. Fed. R.Civ.P. 58(a). A court must \u201cpromptly approve the form of judgment\u201d to be entered by the clerk. Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-17\">Plaintiffs initially sought an entry of judgment \u201cin favor of Plaintiffs and against the United States with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for a procedural violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 [Proposed] Order [83-1]. While some language in plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief suggested they might seek an even broader entry of judgment, <em>see, e.g., </em>PI. Br. at 2-3 (enumerating favorable IRS actions taken after commencement of this litigation), plaintiffs\u2019 proposed order confirms that they only seek final judgment based on the single procedural APA claim. This Court takes it as conceded that the procedural APA claim is the only proper source of judgment in favor of plaintiffs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>In the government\u2019s Response, it notes that the three cases at issue here were consolidated solely for pre-trial purposes, so that \u201cseparate judgments must be entered for the three cases, rather than the one universal judgment that plaintiffs seek.\u201d Def. Judgment Br. at 1 (citing <em>In re Long-Distance, </em>469 F.Supp.2d at 1350 (Transfer Order)). The government further argued that only one of the three cases <em>(Sloan) </em>actually stated the procedural APA claim in its complaint, and so final judgment may only be granted with respect to those plaintiffs on that particular claim. <em>Id. </em>at 4-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In their Reply, plaintiffs seem to concede that judgment must be considered separately for each case. <em>See </em>PI. Reply at 2-5. Instead, they insist that all plaintiffs have pursued the procedural APA claim and criticize the government\u2019s proposed readings of the <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gurrola </em>complaints as \u201cformalism at its worst.\u201d PL Reply at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">This Court agrees with the government and finds that the <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gurrola </em>plaintiffs did not raise the procedural APA claim in their complaints and so cannot now be awarded final judgment on that claim. These cases were consolidated for \u201cpretrial purposes\u201d only, <em>see In re Long-Distance, </em>469 F.Supp.2d at 1350; Practice and Procedure Order at 1, <em>In re Long-Distance, </em>07-mc-14, Docket No. 8 (Jan. 29, 2007); <em>Cohen, </em>650 F.3d at 721, and plaintiffs declined to file a consolidated amended complaint, <em>see </em>Joint Status Report, <em>In re Long-Distance Tel. Serv. Fed. Excise Tax Refund Litig., </em>07-me-14, Docket No. 20 (D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2007). Thus, for purposes of final judgment, plaintiffs must be evaluated separately on the basis of their complaints. Only the <em>Sloan </em>plaintiffs raised the procedural APA claim in their complaint and so only those plaintiffs are entitled to final judgment on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Mr. Cohen\u2019s complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>a cause of action based on a \u201cReview of Arbitrary and Unreasonable Administrative Action,\u201d and argued that Notice 2006-50 \u201carbitrarily, unreasonably, and unlawfully limits restitution of the funds unlawfully exacted from phoneusers.\u201d Second Amended Complaint [75] at 8, <em>Cohen, </em>05-cv-1237. This states only a substantive APA challenge, not a procedural one. Mr. Cohen\u2019s complaint contains no reference to the lack of notice and comment procedures, nor does it refer otherwise to the procedures by which the Notice 2006-50 was promulgated. This complaint cannot be fairly read to state a procedural APA claim. Mr. Cohen did not pursue this procedural APA theory until his case had been consolidated with the <em>Sloan </em>case. Because these cases were consolidated for \u201cpretrial purposes\u201d only, and because plaintiffs declined to file a consolidated amended complaint incorporating all theories raised by separate plaintiffs into a single, unified document, this Court finds that Mr. Cohen did not pursue a procedural APA claim and must enter judgment in favor of the government with respect to all of Mr. Cohen\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The <em>Gurrola </em>complaint alleged neither procedural nor substantive challenges under the APA. Plaintiffs point out that the <em>Gurrola </em>Complaint challenged the lawfulness of Notice 2006-50, and that their opposition brief to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss alleged that the Notice had been promulgated \u201cwithout any public notice, public comment or evidence.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 3, <em>Gurrola v. United States, </em>06-cv-3425 (C.D.Cal.2006). However, an unspecified challenge to the \u201clawfulness\u201d of Notice 2006-50 cannot be reasonably read to state a procedural APA claim, and the fact that the <em>Gurrola </em>plaintiffs later raised this claim in subsequent briefs does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>alleviate their failure to include this theory-in the complaint. Because these cases were consolidated for \u201cpretrial purposes\u201d only, and because plaintiffs declined to file a consolidated amended complaint incorporating all theories raised by separate plaintiffs into a single, unified document, this Court cannot enter judgment in favor of the <em>Gurrola </em>plaintiffs based on a claim they did not properly pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Accordingly, final judgment will be entered in favor of the <em>Sloan </em>plaintiffs on the procedural APA claim and in favor of the government on all remaining claims including all claims raised by the <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gurrola </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">B. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Plaintiffs seek an Interim Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Litigation Expenses. This Court will DENY this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">1. Preliminary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Before addressing the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees, this Court first must resolve two preliminary questions: (i) whether there is a separate \u201cneed\u201d requirement for an interim fee request; and (ii) whether the general fee shifting provision of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) or the more demanding provision of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) governs plaintiffs\u2019 request. The Court agrees with plaintiffs on both issues, finding that (i) there is no additional \u201cneed\u201d requirement for an interim fee request; and (ii) that the general EAJA provision applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\n<em>i. There is No Additional \u201cNeed\u201d Requirement For An Interim Fee Request</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Plaintiffs seek an interim award. The motion comes before the entry of final judgment, and plaintiffs seek to reserve \u201cthe right to make a supplemental fee application to take appropriate credit for any ... additional value created\u201d by their work on these cases. PI. Br. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">As to the timing of plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the government concedes that \u201cunder this Court\u2019s Local Rules ... a party may move for an interim application for attorneys\u2019 fees pi\u2019ior to final judgment.\u201d Def. Judg. Br. at 10 (citing Local Civ. R. 54.2(c)). However, the government insists that such a motion must demonstrate a special \u201cneed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The government points to <em>Beltranena v. Clinton, </em>770 F.Supp.2d 175, 187 (D.D.C.2011), wherein Judge Friedman rejected a party\u2019s request for interim fees as premature because (1) final judgment was not appropriate; and (2) the moving party had not demonstrated any need for interim fees. <em>See also Hussain v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>674 F.Supp.2d 260, 272 (D.D.C.2009) (Friedman, J.) (making the same judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">This Court finds that a party need not demonstrate \u201cneed\u201d to properly state a request for attorneys\u2019 fees before final judgment has been entered. Our Local Civil Rule 54.2 provides guidance to litigants and Courts in the D.D.C. on matters related to attorneys\u2019 fees. Rule 54.2(c) explains that \u201c[n]othing in this Rule precludes interim applications for attorneys fees prior to final judgment.\u201d Nothing in the text of this rule suggests any \u201cneed\u201d requirement. This Court reads Judge Friedman\u2019s reasoning in <em>Beltranena </em>as expressing two <em>alternative </em>modes to pursue an interim motion, rather than two necessary elements. A party may state an interim award of fees before final judgment has been entered if (a) final judgment is subsequently deemed appropriate by the court after the motion is filed; or (b) plaintiff has demonstrated need. Here, as discussed above, final judgment is appropriate, and thus the interim motion is suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ficient without any separate demonstration of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">As <em>to </em>plaintiffs\u2019 reservation of the right to file a supplemental request at a later date, the Court declines to comment on that issue until it is raised on such a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\n<em>ii. The Equal Access to Justice Act Governs Plaintiffs\u2019 Request For Fees, Not Internal Revenue Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Plaintiffs moved for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to two provisions in the EAJA: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2412(b) &amp; (d). The government counters that because plaintiffs\u2019 cases challenged the collection of a tax, and sought refunds of that tax, any award of fees must be governed by a provision from the IRC, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430(a), which applies to \u201cany administrative or court proceeding which is brought by or against the United States in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, interest, or penalty under this title.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">This Court agrees with plaintiffs. Though these cases began seeking refunds, those claims have long since been dismissed. Thus, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s en banc decision concluded that \u201c[t]his suit does not seek to restrain the assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>650 F.3d at 725. Earlier the Circuit panel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">[T]his is not your typical tax case. In a run-of-the-mill case, taxpayers litigate who has the right to disputed funds ... in the context of a suit for refund.... But this case is different: the fight is over process, not disputed funds---Appellants no longer seek a refund in this suit____They seek to challenge the procedural obstacles the IRS inserted between individual taxpayers and their right to file suit to recover unlawfully collected taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-13\"><em>Cohen, </em>578 F.3d at 5. Applying the IRC fee shifting provision as the government urges would contradict these statements. This Court concludes that the EAJA, not the IRC applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">2. The Merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 Fee Request</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">Plaintiffs request fees under two provisions of the EAJA: \u00a7 2412(b) &amp; (d). This Court concludes that plaintiffs are not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to either provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-16\">\n<em>i. Plaintiffs are Not Entitled to Fees under \u00a7 2112(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-17\">Section 2412(b) of U.S.Code Title 28 permits recovery of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses and costs for a prevailing party in litigation against the United States \u201cto the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-18\">The government\u2019s brief erroneously seeks to apply the requirements of \u00a7 2412(d) which allows recovery of reasonable fees by a party unless the government\u2019s position is \u201csubstantially justified\u201d and unless the movant\u2019s net worth exceeds $2,000,000 at the time the action was filed. The government\u2019s attempt to read the requirements of subsection (d) onto subsection (b) is incorrect. The \u201csubstantially justified\u201d requirement appears only in subsection (d). Pursuant to the canon of construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>the inclusion of this requirement in subsection (d) but not in subsection (b) implies that no such requirement applies to subsection (b). Similarly, the net worth requirement articulated in subsection (d)(2)(B)\u00ae explicitly applies only to \u201cthis subsection\u201d \u2014 language that refers to subsection (d). Only the requirements of sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>section (b) apply to plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees under that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 request for fees under \u00a7 2412(b) relies on the common law \u201ccommon benefit\u201d theory. This theory has been applied \u201cto impose fees on a corporate or union defendant when the fruits of a named plaintiffs victory, though non-monetary, were spread evenly among shareholders or union members.\u201d <em>Grace v. Burger, </em>763 F.2d 457, 459-60 (D.C.Cir. 1985) (citing <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 8-9, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973); <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 391-97, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970)). Specifically plaintiffs argue that this case has \u201cgenerated a substantial benefit for more than 100 million taxpayers\u201d who have \u201calready received, or will in the future receive, at least partial refunds,\u201d and that counsel deserve fees for generating this common benefit. <em>See </em>PI. Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), the Supreme Court articulated requirements that any \u201cclass\u201d of beneficiaries must satisfy in order for prevailing attorneys to recover fees under the common-benefit doctrines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">[1] the classes of beneficiaries [must be] small in number and [2] easily ascertainable. [3] The benefits [must be] traced with some accuracy, and [4] there [must be] reason for confidence that the costs [can] indeed be shifted with some exactitude to those benefitting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\"><em>Alyeska, </em>421 U.S. at 265 n. 39, 95 S.Ct. 1612 (quoted in <em>Brzonkala v. Morrison, </em>272 F.3d 688, 691 (4th Cir.2001)). In <em>Grace v. Burger, </em>763 F.2d 457, 459-60 (D.C.Cir.1985), the D.C. Circuit categorically rejected the application of the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d theory to allow recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 2412(b) in cases where plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against the United States. The court adopted the reasoning of Judge Kane of the District of Colorado:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">[T]he defendant, United States, is more than just a representative of all the beneficiaries of the litigation. An award of attorney fees would ultimately be born[e] by all taxpayers, rather than just those benefiting from the injunctive order. As such, ... <em>the common benefit theory is inapplicable in cases such as this where plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against the government </em>.... The common benefit theory is designed to avoid unjust enrichment of beneficiaries to a law suit who are not named plaintiffs. An award of fees here would not compel the beneficiaries to compensate the winning litigant who acted as their representative, but would assess costs against the unrelated losing party. This, clearly, is inconsistent with the American rule and the common benefit exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 460 (quoting <em>Trujillo v. Heckler, </em>587 F.Supp. 928, 931 (D.Colo.1984)) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Instruments, S.A., Inc., </em>1993 WL 198842 at *4 (D.D.C. May 26, 1993) (collecting cases that have rejected the applicability of the common benefit theory to recovery against the United States); 10 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 54.171[2][c] (3d ed.1997) (noting that <em>Alyeska </em>\u201ccompletely undermined\u201d the application of the common-benefit doctrine against governmental entities).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">In <em>Brzonkala, </em>the Fourth Circuit denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for fees from the government under the common-benefit doctrine. Plaintiffs\u2019 first purported class of beneficiaries \u2014 all U.S. taxpayers \u2014 was \u201cnot sufficiently \u2018small in number and easily identifiable\u2019 to withstand scrutiny under <em>Alyeska.\u201d </em>272 F.3d at 691 (quoting <em>Alyeska, </em>421 U.S. at 265 n. 39, 95 S.Ct. 1612). Their alternate proposed class of beneficiaries \u2014 the class of individuals spared liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ty thanks to the judicial decision plaintiffs\u2019 obtained \u2014 also failed because \u201ceven assuming it would be possible to identify such persons ..., imposing fees on the United States would not \u2018shift [costs] with some exactitude to those benefitting,\u2019 as required by <em>Alyeska.\u201d Id. </em>at 692 (quoting <em>Alyeska, </em>421 U.S. at 265 n. 39, 95 S.Ct. 1612). The court also noted that \u201c[a]ll federal taxpayers would bear the burden of fees, not merely the comparatively much smaller class of those who would otherwise have been prosecuted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">This Court concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 request for fees from the government under the common benefit theory fails for several reasons. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class of \u201cmore than 100 million taxpayers\u201d who have \u201calready received, or will in the future receive, at least partial refunds\u201d fails under <em>Alyeska\u2019s </em>stringent requirements that any class of beneficiaries must be \u201csmall in number,\u201d \u201ceasily ascertainable,\u201d the benefits \u201ctraced with some accuracy,\u201d and some \u201creason for confidence that the costs [can] indeed be shifted with some exactitude to those benefitting.\u201d <em>Alyeska, </em>421 U.S. at 265 n. 39, 95 S.Ct. 1612. This proposed class of beneficiaries fails on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Plaintiffs point to <em>Swedish Hospital Corp. v. Shalala, </em>1 F.3d 1261, 1266-71 (D.C.Cir.1993) but, this case does not help plaintiffs here. <em>See </em>PI. Br. at 7. In that case, under a court-approved settlement, the Department of Health and Human Services agreed to pay $27.8 million into a fund for distribution among the members of the class. <em>See Swedish Hosp. Corp. v. Sullivan, </em>89-1693, 1991 WL 319154 at *1 (D.D.C. Dec. 20, 1991). Judge Oberdorfer calculated that the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were only responsible for a portion of that fund, and calculated the attorneys\u2019 fees by taking 20% of that portion. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the Circuit approved the use of this percentage-of-the-benefit method in common fund cases. <em>Swedish Hosp., </em>1 F.3d at 1266-71. In that case the dispute was over the proper measure of attorneys\u2019 fees to be drawn from a formally fixed pool of money that had been drawn from the government in the course of a judicially approved settlement. 1 F.3d at 1266-71. In the present case, by contrast, there is no such common fund. Here, in fact, plaintiffs tried and failed to obtain monetary relief from the government. Plaintiffs analogize the value that their litigation has generated to other taxpayers with the common fund in <em>Swedish Hospital, </em>but <em>Swedish Hospital </em>simply provides no support for this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Finally, as in <em>Brzonkala, </em>\u201c[a]ll federal taxpayers would bear the burden of fees, not merely the comparatively much smaller class of those who\u201d allegedly benefitted from plaintiffs\u2019 work on these cases. <em>See </em>272 F.3d at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Because of our circuit\u2019s demonstrated hostility towards applying the common benefit theory to cases against the government, <em>Grace v. Burger, </em>763 F.2d at 459-60, plaintiffs\u2019 failure to cite any authority supporting its theory, the failure of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class to satisfy the requirements of <em>Alyeska, </em>and the fact that the burden would be borne by all taxpayers to compensate for a benefit allegedly received by only some of them, this Court will DENY plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to \u00a7 2412(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\n<em>ii. Plaintiffs are Not Entitled to Fees Under \u00a7 2112(d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">In their Reply, plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to recover fees under \u00a7 2412(d). This argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Section 2412(d) provides that a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is entitled to recover fees from the United States \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the United States was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>substantially justified.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). \u201cWhether or not the position of the United States was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record (including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based) which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought.\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). The \u201c \u2018position of the United States\u2019 means, in addition to the position taken by the United States in the civil action, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based.\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(D). Recovery is limited to individuals \u201cwhose net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed.\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>a. Only </em>Sloan <em>and not </em>Cohen <em>or </em>Gurrola <em>Plaintiffs are \u201cPrevailing Parties \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Prevailing party status is only conferred on a plaintiff who obtains a \u201cmaterial alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u201d either through judgment or a court-ordered consent decree. <em>See Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 600-04, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). A party who produced agency change through litigation without securing such an order is not a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>WTiere a plaintiff has obtained such a court-ordered material alteration, his counsel may be entitled to fees for \u201call hours reasonably expended on the litigation\u201d including time spent pursuing alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). A party who seeks and obtains a judicial order vacating an agency order is a prevailing party. <em>LePage\u2019s 2000, Inc. v. Postal Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>674 F.3d 862, 866 (D.C.Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Plaintiffs claim that they are \u201cprevailing parties\u201d here both because of their success in court on the procedural APA violation claim and because the IRS\u2019s decision to stop collecting the tax and issue Notice 2006-50 was allegedly occasioned by their legal actions. <em>See </em>PI. Reply at 8-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 success on the procedural APA claim constitutes a \u201cmaterial alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u201d through judgment. <em>See Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 600-04, 121 S.Ct. 1835; <em>see also LePage\u2019s 2000, </em>674 F.3d at 866. However, as discussed above, only the <em>Sloan </em>plaintiffs properly pursued this claim, and so only these are entitled to \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. Neither Mr. Cohen nor the <em>Gurrola </em>plaintiffs are entitled to \u201cprevailing party\u201d status because they did not properly pursue the procedural APA claim. And, any other results these plaintiffs might have otherwise accomplished through the litigation \u2014 e.g., by catalyzing the IRS to change positions\u2014 do not qualify them as prevailing parties under the principles of <em>Buckhannon. </em>Accordingly, Mr. Cohen and the <em>Gurrola </em>plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\n<em>b. The \u201cGovernment\u2019s Position\u201d Was Substantially Justified With Respect To Sloan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">Section 2412(d) provides that substantial justification must be provided not only for \u201cthe position taken by the United States in the civil action\u201d but also \u201cthe action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based.\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(D). \u201cSubstantially justified\u201d means \u201cjustified in substance or in the main \u2014 that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Le-Page\u2019s 2000, </em>674 F.3d at 866 (D.C.Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>(1988)). \u201c[D]effects common to positions that are not substantially justified\u201d include actions that are \u201cflatly at odds with controlling case law\u201d or which are taken \u201cin the face of an unbroken line of authority.\u201d <em>Hill v. Gould, </em>555 F.Sd 1008, 1008 (D.C.Cir.2009). The burden is on the government to demonstrate that it was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d <em>Halverson v. Slater, </em>206 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Here, the government must demonstrate \u201csubstantial justification\u201d for the IRS\u2019 action in issuing Notice 2006-50 and for the government\u2019s legal defense of that Notice. It has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Judges of this Court and the Court of Appeals have written opinions finding that the Notice was not subject to judicial review. <em>See, e.g., Cohen, </em>650 F.3d at 736-45 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (joined by Chief Judge Sentelle and Judge Henderson); <em>In re Long-Distance, </em>539 F.Supp.2d at 308-311 (Urbina, J.). This fact provides an adequate basis to allow this Court to conclude that the government was substantially justified both in issuing the Notice and defending it in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>LePage\u2019s 2000 </em>is misplaced. <em>See </em>PI. Reply at 8 (citing <em>Le-Page\u2019s 2000, </em>674 F.3d at 866). In that case, the Court of Appeals held that an agency was not substantially justified in issuing an order that it struck down under a substantive APA challenge as arbitrary and capricious based on numerous internal inconsistencies and anomalies \u2014 problems that would have been apparent on the face of the order. In the present case, by contrast, the challenged order was struck down on procedural APA challenge only after overcoming obstacles to judicial review \u2014 obstacles that had the well-reasoned support of Judges Urbina, Kavanaugh and Henderson and Chief Judge Sentelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Thus, the position of the government was substantially justified, and plaintiffs are not entitled to Attorneys Fees under \u00a7 2412(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Enter Judgment and for an Interim Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Litigation Expenses will be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Separate orders consistent with this Opinion shall issue on this date.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\">.
