Pursuant to App.R. 11.1(E), this court will render a brief and conclusionary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">On January 27, 1997, an intruder entered appellant\u2019s apartment and forcibly raped her. On March 25, 1999, appellant filed a complaint against her landlord, defendant-appellee Zehman-Wolf Management, Inc., in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. In her complaint, appellant averred that appellee was responsible for the attack because it failed to maintain adequate security in violation of R.C. 5321.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">On August 9, 1999, appellee filed a preliminary motion for summary judgment. In its summary judgment motion, appellee asserted that appellant\u2019s complaint was in effect a claim for bodily injury covered by the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.10. In her response, appellant insisted that appellee\u2019s liability was created by R.C. 5321.04 and, therefore, the six-year statute of limitation applied pursuant to R.C. 2305.07. In a journal entry filed on November 3, 1999, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Therefrom, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal with this court, arguing:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting the appellee\u2019s preliminary motion for summary judgment and holding that plaintiffs claim was a common-law claim for \u2018bodily injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (subject to the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. \u00a7 2305.10), rather than a statutory claim plead and based upon violation of a duty created by R.C. \u00a7 5321.04 (subject to the six-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. \u00a7 2305.07).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">In her sole assignment of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment based upon the two-year statute of limitations for bodily injury claims. Appellant insists that the six-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.07 applies to her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number> Pursuant to R.C. 2305.07, \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute * * * shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d The Supreme Court of Ohio has interpreted the phrase, \u201ca liability created by statute,\u201d to mean a liability that would not exist but for the statute. <em>McAuliffe v. W. States Import Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 534, 538, 651 N.E.2d 957, 960. \u201cAny statutory \u2018modification, alteration or conditioning\u2019 of a common-law cause of action which falls short of creating a previously unavailable cause of action is not \u2018an action * * * upon a liability created by statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In 1974, the General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 5321 to provide tenants with greater rights. See 135 Ohio Laws, Part II, 36. Appellant insists that R.C. 5321.04 created a cause of action unavailable at common law. In an analogous case, <em>Daniels v. Thompson </em>(Apr. 25, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 49015, unreported, 1985 WL 7992, at *3-*4,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\u201c[R.C. Chapter 5321] did not create new liabilities based upon statutes. Rather, it expanded and redefined pre-existing, common-law rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">\u201cTherefore, since [plaintiffs] cause of action is grounded in tort, it is governed by the two-year statute of limitations found in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.10.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">R.C. Chapter 5321 merely expands existing remedies by allowing a tenant to file a complaint predicated upon the negligence <em>per se </em>of the landlord for breach of a statutory duty to make repairs under R.C. 5321.04. We find that the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.10 applies to this case and, therefore, the trial court did not err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-11\">Blackmon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b182-12\">Dyke, A.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-13\">. In <em>Daniels, </em>this court relied on the concurring opinion in <em>Shroades v. Rental Homes, Inc. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 20, 27, 22 O.O.3d 152, 156, 427 N.E.2d 774, 779, wherein Justice Clifford F. Brown noted that the remedies afforded the tenant in R.C. Chapter 5321 are in addition to the tenant\u2019s existing common-law remedies \u201cby way of an action in tort against his landlord.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
