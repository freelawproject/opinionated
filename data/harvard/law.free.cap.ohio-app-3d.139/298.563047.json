He contends that the trial court erred by permitting the state to question him regarding a prior child support contempt proceeding, and that he was unfairly prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">We conclude that the trial court did err by permitting the introduction of evidence that could have caused the jury to be improperly swayed in its determination regarding guilt or innocence. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In 1997, Edmonds and his real estate firm, MCE Realty, were named as defendants in a civil lawsuit. Edmonds signed and filed an answer for himself, individually. He also signed and filed an answer on behalf of the company. The judge assigned to the case struck the answer of MCE Realty on the grounds that it was not signed by an attorney, in view of the fact that the corporation was required to be represented by an attorney. Edmonds was given twenty-one days to file an answer through counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">New answers, purportedly signed by attorney Charles McKinney, were timely filed. McKinney and the attorney for the plaintiffs were notified of a pre-trial conference. McKinney failed to appear at the pretrial. When the judge contacted him regarding his absence, McKinney denied representing either Edmonds or MCE Realty. The judge then began to suspect that McKinney\u2019s signature had been forged. The matter was referred to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>After an investigation was conducted, Edmonds was indicted on one count of tampering with evidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(2), and one count of forgery, in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2). A jury trial was held in June 1999. At trial, McKinney testified that the signature on the answers was his, but noted that it was not an original. He also testified that he did not give Edmonds permission to use his signature. Edmonds admitted that he had altered the documents and used McKinney\u2019s signature, which he had photocopied from another document. However, Edmonds claimed that McKinney had given him permission to do so. Edmonds was convicted as charged, and sentenced appropriately. From his conviction and sentence, Edmonds appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Edmonds\u2019s sole assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by permitting the state to interrogate appellant about his prior failures to pay child support which testimony was of minimal relevance to the issue before the court and was very prejudicial to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Edmonds contends that the trial court erred by permitting the introduction of matters that unfairly prejudiced him. Specifically, he claims that the prosecutor was improperly allowed to question him regarding a prior contempt proceeding involving the failure to pay child support, despite its lack of relevancy, and its highly prejudicial nature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Relevant evidence is defined as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. Relevant evidence is generally admissible. Evid.R. 402. However, even if relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">A trial court has broad discretion in the admission of evidence. <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019, 1034-1035. Decisions regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Graham </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 350, 352, 12 O.O.3d 317, 318, 390 N.E.2d 805, 806-807. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Weaver </em>(1988), 38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Ohio St.3d 160, 161, 527 N.E.2d 805, 807, quoting <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">The portion of the transcript relevant to this issue is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201cQ: Mr. Edmonds, you\u2019re not too fond of the judicial process, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cA: Well, if you went through what I\u2019ve went through in the past few months dealing with this criminal matter, civil matter and having someone testify under oath to some things that I feel were untrue\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cQ: Answer the question. You\u2019re not too\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Objection. He is answering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">\u201cThe Court: I think I\u2019ve already directed the witness to please answer the question directly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201cQ: You\u2019re not too fond of the judicial process, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201cA: I would not say I\u2019m not too fond of it. A lot of it I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s my first time really ever being in a trial in a courtroom. So basically all this is new to me, you understand, with me being charged with something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">\u201cI\u2019ve been on the \u2014 a witness in basically dealing with maybe a couple of suits, you understand, but when you say being fond of the judicial system, you need to give me a little more in-depthness on that for me to answer correctly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">\u201cQ: You\u2019re saying this is the first time you\u2019ve ever been called into court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">\u201cA: This is the first time I\u2019ve ever been charged with allegations against me that I committed a crime that I\u2019ve been in a court and a jury. I\u2019ve been in court before. I\u2019ve testified before a grand jury. I\u2019ve been in a lawsuit where I was a witness. I\u2019ve sold property where a owner and a buyer had disputed and I had to attend court to give testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-16\">\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a situation where I\u2019m being examined, you understand what I\u2019m saying, as far as me, my character and, you know, the situation of this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">The prosecutor then proceeded to interrogate Edmonds concerning prior child support proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">The state contends that Edmonds \u201copened the door\u201d to examination regarding the prior contempt proceeding by failing to list all of his courtroom experiences and by claiming that his character had never been examined in court. The state also contends that the evidence was relevant on the issue of Edmonds\u2019s credibility. Specifically, the state argues that Edmonds lied when he testified that his character had never been examined in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>From our review of the entire transcript, we conclude that Edmonds neither opened the door to the support issue, nor did he lie about his involvement with the courts. Furthermore, it does not appear that Edmonds was trying to make any statement regarding his character. Instead, we find that Edmonds was merely attempting to explain to the prosecutor, in response to a somewhat ambiguous question, that he had never been a defendant in the type of criminal action for which he was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Moreover, a review of the record indicates that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were designed to introduce evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, in an effort to malign Edmonds\u2019s character. Evid.R. 404(B) prohibits the use of such evidence when it is designed to \u201cprove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d The state has not demonstrated that the evidence was used to prove any of the exceptions permitted by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were unfairly prejudicial. This case essentially hinged on the jury\u2019s determination of credibility; specifically, whether it found Edmonds or McKinney to be more believable. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s introduction of evidence indicating that Edmonds had, at one time in the past, fallen behind in his child support obligation might have improperly influenced the jury in deciding whether to credit McKinney\u2019s testimony, discredit Edmonds\u2019s testimony, and find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Edmonds affixed McKinney\u2019s signature to his pleading without McKinney\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Edmonds\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Edmonds\u2019s sole assignment of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-11\">Grady, P.J., and Frederick N. Young, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-11\">. The state claims that Edmonds has waived this issue on appeal by failing to raise appropriate objections. However, from our review of the record, we find that the issue was properly preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
