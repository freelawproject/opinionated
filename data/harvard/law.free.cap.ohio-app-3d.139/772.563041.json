Kilbane, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">This is a consolidated appeal from an order of Judge Daniel O. Corrigan. Plaintiff-appellant Buyer\u2019s First Realty, Inc. (\u201cBuyer\u2019s First\u201d) claims that the judge erred when he granted two motions for summary judgment and confirmed the two arbitration awards against it in favor of appellee Realty One, Inc. It alleges that appellee Cleveland Area Board of Realtors (\u201cCABOR\u201d) lacked the authority to impose arbitration on its dispute with Realty One and agents, appellees Laura Rigney and Marilyn Lupi (\u201cRealty One\u201d), because the funds in dispute did not result from a real estate agent\u2019s commission. We disagree and affirm the order confirming the arbitration awards in favor of Realty One.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">From the record we glean the following: Both Buyer\u2019s First and Realty One are members of CABOR, whose purpose is, in part, \u201c[t]o promote and maintain high standards of conduct in the real estate profession as expressed in the Code of Ethics of the National Association of REALTORS\u00ae.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Members are required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>pursuant to CABOR bylaws, to arbitrate disputes between each other in accordance with the Code of Ethics and Arbitration Manual of the National Association of REALTORS\u00ae and R.C. 2711.01 <em>et seq. (Id., </em>Bylaws, Sections 1 and 2, Article 7). Through CABOR, Realty One requested arbitration with Buyer\u2019s First on disputes regarding the commissions on two separate real estate transactions. The arbitrators found in favor of Realty One on both disputes, and Buyer\u2019s First filed the following complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">On August 28, 1997, Buyer\u2019s First filed its first complaint in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court case No. 339578 against Realty One, Rigney and CABOR, alleging that it acted as the agent for Trevor and Rhonda Collis, who had purchased the home of Robert and Dianna Gronski. It claimed that, according to the Purchase Agreement attached to the complaint, both the Collises and the Gronskis had agreed that Buyer\u2019s First should receive a brokerage fee of 3.5 percent of the $117,000 purchase price for services rendered to the Collises. Buyer\u2019s First further alleged that Realty One was entitled to a commission from the Gronskis on the sale of the property. It further claimed that on April 17, 1997, after a CABOR arbitration hearing, the arbitrators awarded Realty One the full $3,925 that Buyer\u2019s First had received upon the closing of the Collis/Gronski sale, which award the CABOR Board of Directors confirmed on August 14, 1997. Buyer\u2019s First did not attach to the complaint copies of the CABOR rules that provide for arbitration of disputes, the arbitration agreement, the arbitration award, or the award confirmation as required by R.C. 2711.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">On December 29, 1997, Buyer\u2019s First filed a second complaint in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, case No. 346010, against Realty One, Lupi, and CABOR, alleging that it had acted as an agent for Martino Rossi and Lisa Aveton in the purchase of a home from Richard A. Favazzo and/or John Kobal. It further alleged that the buyers and sellers agreed in writing to pay Buyer\u2019s First $3,443.75 as a brokerage fee from the $105,750 purchase price and that on December 8, 1997, the CABOR hearing panel awarded Realty One the $3,443.75 paid to Buyer\u2019s First. Again, Buyer\u2019s First did not attach to the complaint a copy of the purchase agreement or either the CABOR rules or the arbitration agreement. It did, however, attach a copy of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">In both complaints, Buyer\u2019s First alleged in its first cause of action that the award was \u201coutside its [CABOR\u2019s] scope of authority in that no rule in the ByLaws or other regulations of CABOR authorized the making of an award of funds which were paid to Buyer\u2019s First as a result [of] and as consideration for its service and which was not in the nature of a real estate agent\u2019s commission.\u201d It further contended, \u201c[T]he award was entirely <em>ultra vires </em>and manifestly mistaken in that by the rules of CABOR, the arbitration must be the subject of a contract between the complainant and the respondent. No such contract existed.\u201d Buy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>er\u2019s First also claimed that Realty One and Rigney were \u201cguilty of laches\u201d because of their negligence \u201cin failing to raise their claim for said commission prior to and during the time the sales contract was finalized.\u201d Finally, Buyer\u2019s First requested that the judge \u201creverse\u201d the arbitration award and grant judgment in its favor because Realty One would be \u201cunjustly enriched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In its answers, CABOR asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was an improper party to the suit. Realty One denied the various allegations in its answers, asserted in its counterclaims for entry of judgment in its favor on the arbitration awards, and attached all documentation required under R.C. 2711.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">On March 27, 1998, the judge granted the defendants\u2019 joint motion to consolidate both actions upon his docket. On September 18, 1998, CABOR filed its motion for summary judgment, arguing that Buyer\u2019s First asserted no facts to support a cause of action against it and that it was completely immune from liability for its act of handling the arbitration. Later, on October 4, 1998, Realty One, Rigney, and Lupi filed a motion for summary judgment on both Buyer\u2019s First\u2019s claims and Realty One\u2019s counterclaims. Realty One argued that the remedy sought by Buyer\u2019s First \u2014 a \u201creversal\u201d of the arbitration award after a <em>de novo </em>review \u2014 was not allowed under R.C. Chapter 2711. Moreover, it argued, Buyer\u2019s First could not show any specific grounds under the statute that would authorize the judge to vacate the arbitration award. Realty One then asked the judge to grant summary judgment in its favor on its' counterclaims and confirm the two arbitration awards because Buyer\u2019s First failed to show grounds for the vacation or modification of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">In response to both motions for summary judgment, Buyer\u2019s First asserted that the CABOR arbitrators acted outside their authority, arguing that they had authority to consider only the division of commissions where there is an agreement between its members to share commissions. Buyer\u2019s First attached as exhibit \u201cC\u201d a document titled \u201cAppendix I to Part Ten, Arbitrable Issues.\u201d It also attached an affidavit of James L. Restina, an officer of Buyer\u2019s First and a member of its board of directors, and copies of both the Collis and the Rossi/Av-erton Purchase Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In his affidavit, Restina claimed that Realty One sought \u201cto obtain funds from Plaintiff which were earned by Plaintiff pursuant to contracts between other parties, and of which contracts Plaintiff, was a third-party beneficiary.\u201d He asserted that neither the by-laws, rules of governance, rules of arbitration, nor membership conditions authorize CABOR arbitrators to award damages or other compensation to a member \u201cclaiming funds earned by and paid to another member via a specific contract for services rendered.\u201d He also claimed that the sellers may have had separate contracts obligating them to pay Realty One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>commissions greater than those called for under the Buyer\u2019s First purchase agreements and which were, in fact, paid to Realty One by the sellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">On December 8,1998, the judge entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201c[Defendant], Cleveland Area Board of Realtors\u2019 motion for summary judgment is granted. Motion of [Defendants], Realty One Inc., Laura Rigney, and Marilyn Lupi for summary judgment on [Plaintiffs] complaints is hereby granted. Motion for summary judgment on the counterclaims of Realty One is granted. Pursuant to R.C. 2711.09, the Court hereby confirms the two arbitration awards. FINAL.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">It is from this journal entry Buyer\u2019s First appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">It is clear that the order confirms the arbitration award but <em>does not </em>enter judgment on the award and, therefore, we are required to consider whether the order is final and appealable before addressing the merits of the Buyer\u2019s First appeal. We look to the following to answer that question: the rules announced in\u2019 <em>Stewart v. Midwestern Indent. Co </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 124, 543 N.E.2d 1200, as reaffirmed on July 29, 1998 in <em>Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn. v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 393, 696 N.E.2d 571; (2) the amended final order statute, R.C. 2505.02 (eff. July 21, 1998); (3) the Arbitration Act, R.C. 2711.01, <em>et seq.; </em>and (4) the origins of statutory arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">While arbitration was recognized at common law, a judge would \u201cnot force the specific performance of an agreement to refer any matter in controversy between adverse parties to arbitrators. Nor [would] they compel arbitrators to make an award * * *. The reason given for this rule is that [the courts] will not aid parties in ousting, by their agreements, the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals of the country, established for the trial of causes.\u201d <em>Conner v. Drake </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 166, 168-169, 1853 WL 12; see <em>Guider v. LCI Communications Holdings Co. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 412, 417, 622 N.E.2d 415, 418-419. In addition, a party engaged in common-law arbitration had the right to revoke an agreement to submit to arbitration at any time prior to the announcement of the award. <em>Shafer v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distrib. Corp. </em>(1929), 36 Ohio App. 31, 42, 172 N.E. 689, 693; <em>Carey v. Commissioners of Montgomery Cty. </em>(1850), 19 Ohio 245, 247, 1850 WL 83.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">In contrast to common-law arbitration, courts construing the early examples of statutory arbitration recognized that \u201cit is capable of becoming extensively useful in its operation\u201d as \u201c[i]t settles controversies speedily * * <em>Carey, </em>19 Ohio at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>280 (construing 3 Curwen\u2019s Revised Statutes (1854), Chapter 1355, passed February 17, 1831, 29 Ohio Laws 264),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201ccheaply,\u201d <em>Ormsby\u2019s Admrs. v. Bakewell </em>(1835), 7 Ohio 98, 114, 1835 WL 10. Recognizing the need to consider statutory arbitration awards as conclusive to the parties\u2019 rights,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Supreme Court in <em>Carey v. Commrs. of Montgomery Cty. </em>concluded that parties to statutory arbitration \u201chave no right to revoke the submission after the arbitrators are sworn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. It noted that \u201c[w]hen the legislature enacted this law upon the subject of arbitrations, gave powers so ample, and at the same time guarded them so carefully, they never could have meant to allow an interference like this right of revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Over one hundred years after <em>Carey, </em>the Supreme Court succinctly held that \u201cthe law favors arbitration.\u201d <em>Brennan v. Brennan </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 29, 57 O.O. 71, 128 N.E.2d 89, paragraph one of the syllabus. A review of the current Arbitration Act, R.C. 2711.01 <em>et seq., </em>reflects both the public policy favoring arbitration and the General Assembly\u2019s continued interest in providing an efficient, expedited, and economical remedy to resolve disputes, with the \u201cadditional advantage of unburdening crowded court dockets.\u201d <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation v. Mahoning Cty. TMR Edn. Assn. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 80, 83, 22 OBR 95, 98, 488 N.E.2d 872, 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">To this end, the General Assembly has limited the role of judicial review by delineating the circumstances under which a judge may vacate (R.C. 2711.10) or modify (R.C. 2711.11) an arbitration award. <em>Lake Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Professional Assn. for Teaching of Mentally Retarded </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 15, 17-18, 641 N.E.2d 180, 181-182.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>documents required to be filed when a party seeks an order confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating an arbitration award are limited to only what is necessary for that limited review by the court of common pleas. R.C. 2711.14. The Act also encourages the parties to act quickly and either contest the award within three months after it is delivered, R.C. 2711.13, <em>Galion v. Am. Fed. of </em>State, <em>Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp. </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 620, 646 N.E.2d 813, paragraph one of the syllabus, or apply for an order confirming the award within the one-year limitation period and obtain a judgment in the prosecuting party\u2019s favor, R.C. 2711.09.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">To further the purpose of the Arbitration Act, the General Assembly also provided for a two-step process in the ultimate entry of an arbitration award. After conducting a limited review under R.C. 2711.10 or R.C. 2711.11, the judge must first enter an order confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating the award, and then he or she must enter judgment \u201cin conformity therewith\u201d as required by R.C. 2711.12. R.C. 2711.15 also reflects this two-step process, specifically allowing an appeal to \u201cbe taken from an order confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating an award made in an arbitration proceeding or from judgment entered upon an award.\u201d It is clear that the General Assembly intended to allow a party in an arbitration award dispute the opportunity to appeal from <em>either </em>(1) the order confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating an award, or (2) from judgment on that award. \u201cWhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need for this court to apply the rules of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Symmes Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Smyth </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 549, 553, 721 N.E.2d 1057, 1061, citing <em>Meeks v. Papadopulos </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 187, 190, 16 O.O.3d 212, 213, 404 N.E.2d 159, 161, citing <em>Sears v. Weimer </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 312, 28 O.O. 270, 55 N.E.2d 413, paragraph five of the syllabus; see, also, <em>Muczyk v. Cleveland State Univ. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 167, 169, 675 N.E.2d 1283, 1284-1285. Therefore, the mere absence of an order entering \u201cjudgment in conformity therewith\u201d as required under R.C. 2711.12 does not affect the \u201cappealability\u201d of an order confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating an award for purposes of R.C. 2711.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">This conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry, since the Supreme Court has concluded that this section must be read in <em>pari materia </em>with R.C. 2505.02, the \u201cfinal order\u201d statute. In <em>Stewart v. Midwestern Indem. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 124, 543 N.E.2d 1200, syllabus, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>order which vacates an arbitration award and orders the parties to select new arbitrators and to conduct a new arbitration proceeding is not a \u2018final appealable order\u2019 as defined in R.C. 2505.02.\u201d In the body of its opinion, without explaining its reasons, the court stated that R.C. 2711.\u00cd5<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (which provides for an appeal if an award is vacated) must be read in <em>pan materia </em>with R.C. 2505.02, noting that for an order to be considered \u201cfinal,\u201d it must satisfy \u201cthree qualifications\u201d: (1) it must \u201caffec[t] a substantial right\u201d; (2) it must \u201cdetermine the action\u201d; and (3) it must \u201cpreven[t] a judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 543 N.E.2d at 1202, citing <em>Bellaire City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Paxton </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 65, 69-70, 13 O.O.3d 58, 60-61, 391 N.E.2d 1021, 1023-1025.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the judge not only vacated the award but also provided for a new arbitration proceeding, the court concluded that \u201cthe order cannot be considered a \u2018determin[ation of] the action\u2019 or one which \u2018prevents a judgment\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02.\u201d (Bracketed changes <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 126, 543 N.E.2d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The <em>Stewart </em>decision was reaffirmed without opinion in <em>Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Assn. v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 393, 696 N.E.2d 571, based upon similar facts, the vacation of an arbitration award, and remand for a new hearing. The <em>Stewart </em>syllabus, arising from facts very different from those in the case <em>sub judice, </em>does not control our decision. S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. 1(B). However, because the decision in <em>Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn. </em>was announced six days after the effective date of the amended R.C. 2505.02, we believe it is appropriate to review the present order and decide whether it fulfills any of the definitions contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">At the time the court decided <em>Stewart, </em>R.C. 2505.02 described three types of final orders:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">\u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>after judgment, or an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">R.C. 2505.02 (effective July 22, 1998) now describes five types of final orders, preserving the original three:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">\u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">\u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">\u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">\u201c(3) An order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">\u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-11\">\u201c(5) An order that determines that an action may or may not be maintained as a class action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">A \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d as now defined by R.C. 2505.02(A)(2), is \u201can action or proceeding that is specially created by statute and that prior to 1853 was not denoted as an action at law or a suit in equity.\u201d See, also, 51 Ohio Laws, 57, 161, Section 604, 3 Curwen\u2019s Revised Statutes, 2036-2037, Chapter 1202, Section 604 (passed Mar. 11, 1853) (specifically providing that Code of Civil Procedure shall not affect proceedings under statute relating to arbitration). After the adoption of the Code of Civil Procedure in 1853, the Supreme Court specifically held that \u201c \u2018[arbitration\u2019 is a \u2018special proceeding\u2019 \u201d for purposes of that code. <em>Moore v. Boyer </em>(1884), 42 Ohio St. 312, 313, 1884 WL 243, referring to R.S. 5601-5613, 29 Ohio Laws 264.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, an order confirming an arbitration award is one rendered in a special proceeding as defined by R.C. 2505.02(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">After having determined that the present order under appeal was made in a \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d we now consider whether it \u201caffects a substantial right.\u201d A \u201csubstantial right\u201d as now defined by R.C. 2505.02(A)(1) \u201cmeans a right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Prior to this amendment, the courts applied the rule in <em>Noble v. Colwell </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 540 N.E .2d 1381, which defined a substantial right as one which \u201c \u2018involves the idea of a legal right; and that right is one which is enforced and protected by law.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 94, 540 N.E.2d at 1383, quoting <em>North v. Smith </em>(1906), 73 Ohio St. 247, 249, 76 N.E. 619, 619. In <em>North, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he circuit court has jurisdiction to review on error an order of the court of common pleas, made on appeal from the probate court, removing a guardian for cause.\u201d <em>North, </em>73 Ohio St. 247, 76 N.E. 619 at syllabus. The 1906 court noted that, prior to then recent amendments to the Revised Statutes affecting appellate jurisdiction, such an order \u201cwas not reviewable\u201d because \u201c[t]here was then no legislation authorizing an appeal and because such an order was not a final order affecting a substantial right * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 76 N.E. at 619. It concluded that, after the legislature made the applicable statutory amendments to provide for such appeal, \u201cit is no longer a pertinent question whether such an order is a final order affecting substantial rights; for it is conceded that the right to proscribe in what cases there may be review by error or appeal is wholly with the legislative power and is not the subject of judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 76 N.E. at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">\u201c[T]hat it affects substantial rights, if that must be deemed of any importance, must be apparent from the very fact that, in the judgment of the legislature, the rights affected by such order are of sufficient importance to be protected by allowing a review either by appeal or in error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 76 N.E. at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Applying <em>North </em>to the present matter, the fact that the General Assembly has granted the right of appellate review to either orders confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating an award, or from judgment on that award establishes that it has predetermined that the right involved is a substantial one. Therefore, this order confirming the arbitrators\u2019 award satisfies the definition of final order contained in subdivision (B)(2) of R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Our <em>in pari materia </em>review, as required by <em>Stewart, </em>is in keeping with the definition of \u201csubstantial right\u201d adopted by the General Assembly in 1998. It also furthers the purpose of the Arbitration Act by allowing the aggrieved party to quickly appeal without having to wait for the common pleas judge to enter judgment against the aggrieved party and in the triumphant party\u2019s favor. Therefore, whether we apply the mandates of R.C. 2711.15 as it stands alone, or</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the <em>in pari materia </em>rule espoused in <em>Stewart, </em>an order confirming an arbitration award is a final order subject to this court\u2019s review under R.C. 2505.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Turning now to the merits of this appeal, we first address Buyer\u2019s First\u2019s second assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for appellees where the rules governing the arbitration specifically provided for judicial review of the arbitration procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Buyer\u2019s First argues that R.C. 2711.10 does not preclude judicial review of the arbitration awards. Moreover, it argues, the CABOR Code of Ethics, Arbitration Rules, Part Ten, specifically makes reference to a member\u2019s \u201clegal challenge\u201d to the validity of the award and because arbitration rules do not limit a judge\u2019s jurisdiction, a review of an arbitration award is <em>de novo. </em>Both CABOR and Realty One counter that the judicial review is not <em>de novo </em>but statutorily limited to the factors set forth in R.C. 2711.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">\u201cR.C. 2711.10 limits judicial review of arbitration to claims of fraud, corruption, misconduct, an imperfect award, or that the arbitrator exceeded his authority.\u201d <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Local Union No. 200, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of Am. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 516, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cGiven the presumed validity of an arbitrator\u2019s award, a reviewing court\u2019s inquiry into whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority, within the meaning of R.C. 2711.10(D), is limited.\u201d <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 129, 551 N.E.2d 186, paragraph one of the syllabus. As such, a review of an arbitration award pursuant to R.C. 2711.10(D) is not a <em>de novo </em>review of the merits of the dispute. See <em>Roper v. Town &amp; Country Inv. Fund II </em>(Oct. 8, 1998), Cuyahoga App. 73374, unreported, 1998 WL 703346 (reviewing court does not consider or determine whether arbitrator\u2019s decision was legally or factually erroneous). Rather, the review is limited to the question whether the arbitration award \u201cdraws its essence from the * * * agreement and is not unlawful, arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. Once the reviewing court determines that the award is drawn from the essence of the agreement and is not unlawful, arbitrary, or capricious, the \u201cinquiry for purposes of vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to R.C. 2711.10(D) is at an end.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">In the instant case, it is clear that the judge\u2019s review was limited to the question of whether the arbitration awards were drawn from the essence or terms of the rules of arbitration between members as adopted by CABOR and the arbitration agreement as assented to by Buyer\u2019s First upon its membership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>in the organization and upon its agreement to arbitrate both the Collis and Rossi/Averton disputes. This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">We next consider the application of this standard in the context of Buyer\u2019s First\u2019s first and third assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for appellees where the pleadings and exhibits submitted demonstrated genuine issues of fact in dispute relating to the extent of the authority of arbitrators in the subject matter under arbitration as provided in the rules of the organization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">\u201cHI. [The] trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment where exhibits submitted pursuant to the motion clearly showed the award made by the arbitrators to be exceeding their authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Buyer\u2019s First argues that the purchase agreements entered into by both the buyers and sellers in the two transactions were not subject to arbitration pursuant to the CABOR code of ethics and rules of arbitration. Buyer\u2019s First denies any agreement with Realty One regarding these transactions and contends that the arbitration award giving the brokerage fee to Realty One fell outside the scope of authority granted to the arbitrators and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Realty One challenges this assertion, arguing that Buyer\u2019s First failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because R.C. 2711.10 does not authorize the \u201creversal\u201d of an arbitration award. Both CABOR and Realty One submit that Buyer\u2019s First failed to fulfill its burden of showing that the arbitrators exceeded their authority; rather, the rules adopted by CABOR verify that the arbitrators did not exceed their authority based upon the absence of qualifying language limiting their powers solely to <em>contractual </em>disputes. Additionally, CABOR contends that it is immune from suit for its role as arbitrator in the Collis and Rossi/Averton commission disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">This court reviews the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>.applying the same standard as that applied by the trial judge. <em>Druso v. Bank One of Columbus </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 125, 131, 705 N.E.2d 717, 720-721. A judge may grant a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C) when the following elements are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">\u201c(1) No genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274; accord <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201, 203-204.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>The foundation of these assignments of error rests solely upon the premise that Buyer\u2019s First and Realty One did not have a contract or agreement regarding the division of a commission associated with each property. According to Buyer\u2019s First, under the CAB OR rules of arbitration, the lack of agreement between them precludes the arbitrators from considering such a dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">As we indicated earlier, Buyer\u2019s First failed to provide the arbitration agreement or material outlining the authority of the arbitrators with its complaint and request to \u201creverse\u201d the arbitration awards. Applying a strict construction of the Arbitration Act, this defect would ordinarily require the judge to deny a request to confirm, vacate, modify, or correct an arbitration award. Cf. <em>Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn. v. Cleveland </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 63, 69, 649 N.E.2d 1291, 1294 (\u201cwithout the pertinent documents the trial court could not determine that the award drew its essence from the agreement and should have affirmed the award\u201d). However, Realty One and CABOR do not deny the existence or amount of the awards, and information regarding the power of the arbitrators to consider certain disputes was appended to Buyer\u2019s First\u2019s brief opposing the motions for summary judgment. This information, a copy of a document titled \u201cAppendix I to Part Ten, Arbitrable Issues,\u201d from the Code of Ethics and Arbitration Manual, pages 115 to 116, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201cIn the event of contractual disputes or specific non-contractual disputes as defined by Standard of Practice 17-4 between REALTORS\u00ae associated with different firms, arising out of their relationship as REALTORS\u00ae, the REALTORS\u00ae shall submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the regulations of their Board or Boards rather than litigate the matter. [Citing Article 17 of the Code of Ethics; emphasis omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">\u00ab <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">\u201cAs used in Article 17 of the Code of Ethics and in Part Ten of this Manual, the terms \u2018dispute\u2019 and \u2018arbitrable matter\u2019 refer to contractual issues and questions, and certain specific non-contractual issues and questions outlined in Standard of Practice 17-4, including entitlement to commissions and compensation in cooperative transactions, that arise out of the business relationships between REALTORS\u00ae, and between REALTORS\u00ae and their clients and customers * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">This document continues, noting that \u201c[m]any arbitrations conducted by Boards of REALTORS\u00ae involve entitlement to compensation offered by listing brokers through a multiple listing service or otherwise to cooperating brokers acting as subagents, [or] as agents of purchasers * * Buyer\u2019s First did not include with its brief or otherwise in the record, the language of Standard of Practice 17-4, referred to in \u201cAppendix I to Part Ten,\u201d which purportedly outlines the \u201cspecific non-contractual disputes\u201d subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>To the extent the rules governing CABOR and its members were disclosed, such rules contradict Buyer\u2019s First\u2019s contention. These rules apparently allow CABOR members to arbitrate disputes regarding their claims against each other for a portion or a whole of a real estate commission, regardless of whether the commission relates to an express commission-sharing agreement. Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Buyer\u2019s First, we find no issue of material fact about the arbitrators\u2019 exceeding their authority to be in dispute. <em>Temple, </em>50 Ohio St.2d at 327, 4 O.O.3d at 471-472, 364 N.E.2d at 273-274. Reasonable minds could only conclude that the arbitration awards were in conformity with both the \u201cessence\u201d of the rules governing CABOR and the arbitration agreement. <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. As a result, there is no error in finding that Buyer\u2019s First failed to present a genuine issue of material fact that would entitle it to relief under R.C. 2711.10(D) and in confirming the award on Realty One\u2019s counterclaims in accordance with R.C. 2711.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Additionally, CABOR is correct in its contention that it is immune from suit for its role in arbitrating the two commission disputes:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">\u201cThe ability to secure such able persons as arbitrators is essential if such system is to continue as a valuable tool of the judicial system in facing and coping with overcrowded dockets. It is, therefore, necessary and within the doctrines of quasi-judicial immunity, that arbitrators be immune from suits for acts performed within their capacity as arbitrators and performed within their assigned duties and authority.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Columbia Gas Transm. Co. </em>(Mar. 30, 1982), Knox App. 81-CA-19, unreported, 1982 WL 5431. See, also, <em>Barbara v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc. </em>(C.A.2, 1996), 99 F.3d 49, 58-59 (where the plaintiff sought to recover money damages for alleged abuses in the conduct of the defendant\u2019s disciplinary proceedings, court applied the doctrine of absolute immunity to preclude assertion of such claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">There was no error in granting summary judgment in CABOR\u2019s favor, since the only claim and factual allegations asserted by Buyer\u2019s First was solely to CABOR\u2019s role as arbitrator. The first and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Buyer\u2019s First argues in its fourth assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201cIV. The trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment when the pleadings, affidavit [sic] clearly raised the question and issue of a tortious interference by the arbitrators with appellant\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Buyer\u2019s First argues that \u201chaving as much as raised that question [of tortious interference with a contract] in the complaint, while perhaps not in those words, but by allegations tantamount thereto, a genuine issue of fact was raised, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>defeating the ground for issuance of summary judgment.\u201d Both CABOR and Realty One assert that Buyer\u2019s First neither alleged such a cause of action nor presented any facts to support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">\u201cThe elements of the tort of tortious interference with contract are (1) the existence of a contract, (2) the wrongdoer\u2019s knowledge of the contract, (3) the wrongdoer\u2019s intentional procurement of the contract\u2019s breach, (4) lack of justification, and (5) resulting damages.\u201d <em>Fred Siegel Co., L.P.A. v. Arter &amp; Hadden </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 171, 707 N.E.2d 853, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Because Buyer\u2019s First failed to argue below that the \u201cfacts\u201d support a claim for tortious interference with a contract against CABOR, we need not address the question here. \u201cIt is fundamental that a reviewing court need not consider any issues that could have been raised in the trial court, but were not.\u201d <em>Thomas Steel, Inc. v. Wilson Bennett, Inc. </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 96, 105, 711 N.E.2d 1029, 1036, appeal not allowed (1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 1452, 695 N.E.2d 1149. Moreover, the complaint does not contain averments that would give reasonable notice of such a claim. We find Buyer\u2019s First waived this issue for appellate review.
