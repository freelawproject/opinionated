This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">The village of Spencer has two state highways that intersect in its center, State Routes 162 and 301. There are two railroad tracks north of this intersection, and appellee operates trains on these tracks. On August 11, 1998, a police officer for the village of Spencer observed a train operated by appellee stopped on one of these tracks, blocking traffic. He observed the train stopped at 3:47 p.m. until 3:50 p.m. At 3:50 p.m., the train began moving, and cleared the crossing at 3:56 p.m. Traffic was prevented from moving north or south for at least nine minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">The police officer charged appellee with a violation of Spencer Village Ordinance 654.01(a), which is identical to R.C. 5589.21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>dismiss the complaint, alleging that R.C. 5589.21 was preempted by federal law and therefore unenforceable. The trial court granted this motion and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Appellant raises two assignments of error in relation to this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in determining that [R.C.] 5589.21 relates to an area of railroad safety and erred in determining that the subject matter of the Ohio statute is one in which the federal government has legislated or adopted regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In its first assignment of error, the state argues the trial court erred in determining that R.C. 5589.21 is preempted under federal law. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Under Section 20106, Title 49, U.S.Code, \u201c[a] State may adopt or continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to railroad safety until the Secretary of Transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the State requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u201cThe key question in any preemption analysis is whether Congress intended for state law to be superseded by federal law.\u201d <em>In re Miamisburg Train Derailment Litigation </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 255, 260, 626 N.E.2d 85, 89-90. This inquiry must begin with the presumption against preemption. <em>CSX Trans., Inc. v. Easterwood </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 658, 668, 113 S.Ct. 1732, 1741-1742, 123 L.Ed.2d 387, 399. Preemption will not lie unless it is \u201cthe clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Rice v. Santa Elevator Corp. </em>(1947), 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447, 1459, citing <em>Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line RR. Co., </em>272 U.S. 605, 611, 47 S.Ct. 207, 209, 71 L.Ed. 432, 438, and <em>Allem-Bradley Local No. 1111 v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Bd., </em>315 U.S. 740, 749, 62 S.Ct. 820, 825, 86 L.Ed. 1154, 1164-1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">R.C. 5589.21 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\u201cNo railroad company shall obstruct, or permit or cause to be obstructed a public street, road, or highway, by permitting a railroad car, locomotive, or other obstruction to remain upon or across it for longer than five minutes, to the hindrance or inconvenience of travelers or a person passing along or upon such street, road, or highway. No railroad company shall fail, at the end of each five minute period of obstruction of a public street, road, or highway, to cause such railroad car, locomotive, or other obstruction to be removed for sufficient time, not less than three minutes, to allow the passage of persons and vehicles waiting to cross.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cThis section does not apply to obstruction of a public street, road, or highway by a continuously moving through train or caused by circumstances wholly beyond the control of the railroad company, but does apply to other obstructions, including without limitation those caused by stopped trains and trains engaged in switching, loading, or unloading operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In essence, R.C. 5589.21 governs the length of time a stopped train can block a roadway. Neither the trial court nor appellee has indicated any federal regulation governing this issue, let alone demonstrated the \u201cclear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d to preempt local regulations on how long a stopped train can block an intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">This court has reviewed this issue previously in <em>State v. Chessie Sys. RR. </em>(Jan. 3, 1990), Wayne App. No. 2494, unreported, 1990 WL 1209, and specifically held that R.C. 5589.21 is not preempted under federal law. In <em>Chessie, </em>this court determined that there is \u201cno explicit or implicit preemption of the subject matter of R.C. 5589.21.\u201d Congress has not evidenced any contrary intention since <em>Chessie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in determining that the \u2018local safety hazard\u2019 obstruction does not apply to prevent preemption of [R.C.] 5589.21.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error claims that the trial court erred in dismissing its complaint because \u201cthe local safety hazard\u201d excepts R.C. 5589.21 from being preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">This court need not address this issue, as we have previously found that R.C. 5589.21 is not preempted under federal law. Therefore, there is no reason to examine any exceptions to preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b308-12\">Slaby, P.J., and Whitmore, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-20\">. Although appellee was initially charged with a violation of Spencer Village Ordinance 654.01(a), the trial court granted the village leave to amend its complaint to allege a violation of R.C. 5589.21. Consequently, the village of Spencer replaced the state of Ohio as plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
