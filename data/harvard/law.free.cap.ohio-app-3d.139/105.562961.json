Shelly Glenn assigns the following two errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">\u201cI. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that mother Shelly Glenn failed to remedy the conditions that prompted the removal of her children from her home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">\u201cII. Appellant/mother Shelly Glenn\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">Appellant Patrick Young assigns the following error for our review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">\u201cI. The trial court erred by granting CCDCFS permanent custody of the involved minor children where the natural father was incarcerated during the relevant time period when completion of the case plan was to have occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>although having no meaningful opportunity or facilities by which to fully and completely comply with his case plan and he otherwise established a continuing interest in taking steps toward regaining custody by taking some related courses and programs while incarcerated and by attending the permanent custody hearing and testifying therein explaining his good faith efforts and continuing efforts and improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Having reviewed the record and the legal arguments of the parties, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. The apposite facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The juvenile court awarded permanent custody of Dustin (five years), Destiny (three years), and Diamond (seventeen months) to CCDCFS on its neglect complaint against parents Shelly Glenn (twenty-two years) and Patrick Young (thirty-six years). The neglect complaint averred under R.C. 2151.414 that neither parent substantially remedied the conditions that led to CCDCFS\u2019s temporary custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">CCDCFS obtained temporary custody of Dustin in September 1997, Destiny in December 1997, and Diamond at the point of birth. Glenn came to the attention of CCDCFS when she gave birth to Dustin at age seventeen years old, unmarried, and homeless. Patrick Young, a career criminal and abuser, did not prove to be a suitable parent for placement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">During the permanent custody hearing, the record revealed that over the history of this case, many changes had occurred. The initial case was opened because Glenn, a minor, had no place to go after giving birth to Dustin, May 1995. Glenn\u2019s father disapproved of Young and that Dustin was biracial. During CCDCFS\u2019s intervention, Glenn found housing and Unicare aided her in getting help with welfare, day care, medical care, and helping her to continue her schooling. In August 1995, CCDCFS closed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">CCDCFS reopened it when Shelly sought help in December 1996. She wanted to place Dustin in foster care. Also, an issue arose as to Glenn\u2019s physical abuse of Dustin. Apparently, the placement did not occur because on December 16, 1996, a new plan was developed. Shelly moved in the home of Mary Jane Sable, applied for ADC, food stamps, and medical assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">On January 17, 1997, Shelly moved from Sable\u2019s house and moved back with Young. This necessitated a new plan because of the history of instability and violence perpetrated on Glenn by Young. On October 6, 1997, a new plan was developed because of the birth of Destiny and the emerging temporary custody of Dustin. CCDCFS eventually took temporary custody of Destiny and required Glenn to have parenting classes. Sometime in November 1998, while Glenn was visiting with Destiny, the foster parent reported that diapers were unused and food returned unused after the visits. Apparently, Glenn fed the child cookies.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>During these months, Glenn was pregnant but had not revealed it to her caseworker. She also had not received any prenatal care. She did not want anyone to know about the pregnancy. On January 8, 1999, she gave birth to Diamond. CCDCFS immediately placed Diamond with foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">By September 1998, all of the children had been removed from Glenn and Young and were placed in foster care, and adoptable. Glenn and Young had virtually failed in every element of the case plans, <em>i. e., </em>suitable housing, nonviolent home, no contact with Young, requirement that Young seek anger-management counseling, and obtaining employment, attend parenting classes, and complete domestic violence counseling. However, after CCDCFS filed for permanent custody, Glenn did accomplish all of the case plan. CCDCFS filed for permanent custody September 1998, and by November 1998, Glenn had found housing and work at McDonald\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In November 1998, CCDCFS felt that the housing and job issues were no longer applicable to the case plan. However, under the new c\u00e1se plan, CCDCFS required Glenn not to have further contact with Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Glenn completed parenting classes and domestic violence classes. The guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) concluded that Glenn functions well when Young is in jail. She visits with the children biweekly at Metzenbaum Children\u2019s Center and she is receiving counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">At the permanent custody hearing, caseworker Tanya Cross testified that she does believe that Glenn will stay away from Young. She further stated, \u201cPC motion is in place and Young had applied children don\u2019t have time to wait for the parents to grow up. She had gone over to Patrick Young\u2019s house again and gotten herself beaten up again.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The GAL submitted his report on March 24, 1999, and reported that there were no suitable relatives in Young\u2019s family for placement of the children and that no relatives in Glenn\u2019s family wished to accept placement of the children. Further, the GAL stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">\u201c* * * Patrick Young has not taken any meaningful steps to curb his anger toward females, and although he has not been known to vent his anger toward his children, he has struck the mother when she was pregnant. Patrick\u2019s abusive behavior would not lead to him being a proper custodian of the Glenn children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">\u201cShelly Glenn appears to be a victim of abuse by Patrick Young, and when he is incarcerated, she is functioning at an acceptable level. She appears to be able to do all that is requested of her for her children\u2019s sake. <em>Without hearing all the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>testimony, I am not in a position to state, that by clear and convincing evidence, mother should be divested of her parental rights.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The GAL also reported that the children\u2019s foster parents were willing to adopt. He opined that the foster parents got along well with the children and that their homes were clean, neat, and appropriate. It is unclear from the record whether the GAL, after hearing the evidence, made a recommendation of divestiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u25a0 During caseworker Tanya Cross\u2019s testimony, she explained that although Glenn had made improvements from November 1998 to the time of the hearing, March 1999, before the permanent custody petition, Glenn had been slow to respond to any of the recommendations under the case plan. Cross implied that on Glenn\u2019s present record she could work for reunification but was extremely skeptical that Glenn could stay away from Young, and Young showed no evidence of ending his violent behavior. Thus, Cross recommended permanent custody to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Young testified that Glenn had indicated that she wanted to renew their relationship once he was released from prison. Young also admitted to his drug addiction and numerous misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Glenn presented her case and called her mother, Ann Glenn. Ann Glenn stated that her daughter never expressed a desire to continue her relationship with Young. She also testified that she attended visitation of the children with Glenn. She stated that she or Glenn always checked the children\u2019s diapers. On cross-examination, she admitted she was aware of the abusive nature of Glenn\u2019s relationship with Young. She admitted to seeing bruises on her daughter\u2019s body. She admitted telling her daughter repeatedly that she needed to stop seeing Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Glenn also testified at the hearing. Glenn said that she was complying with her case plan. Glenn stated that she lived at her current residence since November 1998 after leaving the house she shared with Young. Glenn testified that she attended parenting classes and completed domestic violence counseling. Glenn testified she participates in individual counseling at Marymount Hospital once a week. Glenn also stated that she works at McDonald\u2019s where she receives both medical and dental insurance benefits. Glenn stated that she planned to become a manager within a year. Glenn admitted that she visited Young in prison, but stated that she did so because Young threatened to \u201ctell the court a bunch of lies about me to try to take my kids away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">On cross-examination, Glenn admitted that she failed to attend her first parenting class, but added that, it was in a bad neighborhood. When asked why she failed to start a domestic violence class until the summer of 1998 although the case plan called for the course in January 1997, Glenn stated, she had to look for a place. Glenn admitted that she spent Labor Day with Young, but denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Young did anything to hurt her at that time. She stated that the last time Young hurt her was two weeks before she gave birth to her youngest child, Destiny. However, Glenn admitted that Young had beaten her on numerous occasions. Glenn admitted visiting Young several times during his incarceration, but denied having any plans to reunite with Young upon his release from prison. However, Glenn admitted saying that she would never see him again many times in the past, and yet she continued the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">On April 20, 1999, the trial court adjudicated all three children neglected and placed them in the permanent custody of CCDCFS. The trial court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201cUpon further consideration, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the children to grant permanent custody to the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services and that reasonable efforts by CCDCFS to prevent removal of the children from their home were made and the children are not abandoned or orphaned. The court further finds that the children cannot be placed with their parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with their parents for the following reasons: parents have failed to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of the children from their home. Mother continues to have a relationship with father even after completing domestic violence program. Mother has failed to establish stable and appropriate housing for the children. Father is presently incarcerated and has not complied with case plan requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Glenn and Young appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In her first assignment of error; Shelly Glenn argues that the trial court erred in granting permanent custody of her minor children to CCDCFS because the trial court lacked clear and convincing evidence that Glenn failed to remedy the conditions that prompted the removal of the children from her home. Similarly, Patrick Young, in his sole assignment of error, argues the trial court erred in granting permanent custody to CCDCFS because the weight of the evidence demonstrated that he lacked a meaningful opportunity to comply with the case plan established to aid in regaining custody of his children. Shelly Glenn\u2019s first assignment of error and Patrick Young\u2019s sole assignment of error have a similar basis in law. Therefore, we consider these assignments simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In order to justify termination, of parental rights and award permanent custody of a child who is neither abandoned nor orphaned to a public children\u2019s services agency, a juvenile court must find by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the grant of permanent custody to the agency is in the best interest of the child and (2) the child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with either parent. <em>In re Patterson </em>(1999), 134 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>App.3d 119, 730 N.E.2d 439, citing <em>In re William S. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 95, 99, 661 N.E.2d 738, 741-742. Clear and convincing evidence is \u201cevidence sufficient to produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d <em>In re King </em>(Aug. 11, 1999), Adams App. No. 99CA671, unreported, 1999 WL 624536, citing <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 368, 18 OBR 419, 425-426, 481 N.E.2d 613, 620-621; <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Massengale </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 121, 122, 568 N.E.2d 1222, 1222-1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u201cThe standard of review for weight of the evidence issues, even where the burden of proof is \u2018clear and convincing,\u2019 retains its focus upon the existence of \u2018some competent, credible evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hawn v. Pleasant </em>(June 1, 1999), Scioto App. No. 98CA2595, unreported, 1999 WL 366584, citing <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 564 N.E.2d 54, 60-61. Therefore, when reviewing awards of permanent custody to public children services agencies, judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence must be affirmed. <em>In re Thomas </em>(Mar. 9, 2000), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 75330, 75331 and 75332, unreported, 2000 WL 263735; <em>In re Rowe </em>(Jan. 30, 1998), Scioto App. No. 97CA2529, unreported, 1998 WL 65460; see, also, <em>Jones v. Lucas Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 85, 86, 546 N.E.2d 471, 472-473.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">R.C. 2151.414 sets forth the factors a trial court must consider in determining whether a child cannot be placed with his parents. Factors enumerated in R.C. 2151.414 include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201c(1) Following the placement of the child outside his home and notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and repeatedly for a period of six months or more to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed outside his home. In determining whether the parents have substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and rehabilitative services and material resources that were made available to the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to resume and maintain parental duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">* <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201c(4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home for the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201c(6) The parent is incarcerated at the time of the filing of the motion for permanent custody or the dispositional hearing of the child and will not be available to care for the child for at least eighteen months after the filing of the motion for permanent custody or the dispositional hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\u201c(7) The parent is repeatedly incarcerated and the repeated incarceration prevents the parent from providing care for the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">\u201c(8) The parent for any reason is unwilling to provide food, clothing, shelter, and other basic necessities for the child or to prevent the child from suffering physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or physical, emotional, or mental neglect.\u201d Former R.C. 2151.414(E). See 142 Ohio Laws, Part 1,198, 238, 240.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Once a court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that one of the enumerated factors exists, the court must enter a finding that the child cannot or should not be placed with either of his parents within a reasonable time. <em>In re Shanequa H. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 142, 671 N.E.2d 1113; <em>In re Higby </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 466, 611 N.E.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">A review of the record reveals clear and convincing evidence upon which the trial court could determine that granting permanent custody of the children to CCDCFS is in the best interest of the children and that the children could not and should not be-placed with either parent within a reasonable time. The evidence demonstrated that Glenn and Young maintained a continuing and abusive relationship. Although the violence was not directed at the children, they could be expected to be emotionally and psychologically damaged as a result of the parents\u2019 actions. Further, the evidence showed a pattern of behavior suggesting that Glenn planned to continue her relationship with Young upon his release from jail. Additionally, the evidence demonstrated that Glenn failed to address the issues of violence in a timely manner by allowing approximately one and a half years to pass before choosing to participate in a course. The evidence demonstrated that Young exhibited a pattern of violence toward women. The record showed that Young was currently incarcerated and has a history of repeated incarcerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">If it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that a parent has continuously and repeatedly failed to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the grant of temporary custody of her children to a children services agency, the court must find that the children cannot be placed with the parent within a reasonable time. R.C. 2151.414(E)(1). The evidence presented before the juvenile court clearly and convincingly established that Glenn and Young failed to rectify the conditions that led to the temporary custody order. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the trial court properly decided that the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>could not be placed with either parent within a reasonable time. Accordingly, we overrule Shelly Glenn\u2019s first, and Patrick Young\u2019s sole, assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In her second assignment of error, Shelly Glenn argues that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to elicit testimony beneficial to Glenn. Glenn argues that the ineffective assistance rendered by her counsel altered the outcome of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The two-part standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, for proving ineffective assistance of counsel in criminal cases also applies in cases where the state attempts to gain involuntary and permanent termination of parental rights. <em>In re Wise </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 619, 627, 645 N.E.2d 812, 816-817; <em>Jones v. Lucas Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1988) 46 Ohio App.3d 85, 546 N.E.2d 471. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must show that her counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable professional competence and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, an appellate court need not address both components of the analysis if one component fails. <em>In re Hart </em>(Apr. 16, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 71783, unreported, 1998 WL 183863.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In applying <em>Strickland, </em>we note that a properly licensed attorney enjoys a presumption of competence. <em>State v. Nabozny </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 195, 214, 8 O.O.3d 181, 191-192, 375 N.E.2d 784, 796-797. Generally, a trial counsel\u2019s decision to engage in a particular line of questioning will not be second-guessed on appeal. <em>State v. Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189. Rather, the appellate court will consider trial counsel\u2019s decision to be the product of sound trial strategy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In the instant case, Glenn\u2019s counsel engaged in the following line of questioning in his direct examination of Glenn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">\u201cQ. Well, okay, I\u2019m using county jail as an institution. You visit [Patrick Young] locked facilities; [sic] you not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">\u201cA. Just a couple of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t you visit him at county jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">\u201cA.

You heard you [sic] mom being asked a question, I believe by Ms. Jones, which, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good question or a bad question, but it certainly begged an answer your mom didn\u2019t have, and that is, don\u2019t you wonder why she goes down to see him after he\u2019s done all these things to her, and I don\u2019t think your mom had an answer; did she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">\u201cA.

Glenn argues, but for her counsel\u2019s deficient performance, that it is possible the trial court would not have granted CCDCFS permanent custody of her children. Further, Glenn suggests that her counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient as to be <em>per se </em>prejudicial. She cites <em>Rickman v. Bell </em>(C.A.6, 1997), 131 F.3d 1150, in support of this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">In <em>Rickman, </em>defense counsel conducted no investigation and presented no defense during the guilt phase of death penalty proceedings. Moreover, during the guilt phase of the trial, defense counsel pursued a strategy designed to show that his client was a sick and subnormal human being, although he had been found competent to stand trial. <em>Rickman, </em>at 1157. He suggested in his questioning of witnesses that Rickman looked like he had just been released from an insane asylum and in his closing argument, he argued that Rickman was as wild as a March hare. <em>Id. </em>at 1158-1159. In addition, defense counsel elicited testimony during cross-examination of co-defendants that the murder had been thoroughly planned in advance, despite proof that suggested Rickman entered the victim\u2019s residence without a lethal weapon and may have lacked a coherent plan as to how she was to be killed. <em>Id. </em>at 1158. Finally, defense counsel even called a witness to testify as to Rickman\u2019s threats to commit unrelated crimes. <em>Id. </em>Given these facts, the Rickman court concluded that \u201c[defense counsel\u2019s] perfor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>manee dispenses with the necessity of a separate showing of prejudice [as required by Strickland]; it is, in this case, patently inherent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">CCDCFS argues that, in contrast to the defense counsel in <em>Rickman, </em>Glenn\u2019s counsel demonstrated a thorough grasp of the facts of the case. He vigorously cross-examined witnesses presented by CCDCFS. For example, he challenged Donna Miller\u2019s truthfulness by suggesting that Miller testified against Glenn because Glenn owed her money. During cross-examination of Patrick Nicolino, Glenn\u2019s domestic violence counselor, trial counsel attempted to establish that Glenn\u2019s continuing relationship with Patrick Young was not unusual and did not necessarily need to be terminated. He also challenged the program\u2019s method of evaluating a client\u2019s degree of success in the program, as well as the program\u2019s overall success rate. Further, Glenn concedes that her trial counsel\u2019s examination of other witnesses elicited beneficial facts and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">While we may not agree with trial counsel regarding the line of questioning followed with Glenn, we cannot conclude on this record that his representation is below an objective standard of reasonable professional competence. Accordingly, we overrule Glenn\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-7\">James D.
