In September 1980, appellee, Charles Gayton, prepared a last will and testament on behalf of decedent, Alice Lucille Weilert. Unfortunately, appellee failed to obtain the statutorily required signature of one of the two attesting witnesses. Subsequent to the decedent\u2019s death in November 1997, her will was filed with the Franklin County Probate Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>However, the probate court denied admission of the will to probate because of the statutory defect caused by the missing witness signature. Appellants are all intended beneficiaries under the defective -will of decedent with the exception of appellant, Robert Dykes, who is the court-appointed administrator (the defective will named Sandra Louise Sayre, one of appellant-beneficiaries, as the executor). All of appellants allege economic loss as the direct and proximate result of Gayton\u2019s negligence in preparation of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Procedurally, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss because appellants failed to allege in their complaint \u201cprivity\u201d with the decedent. The trial court correctly cites the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions of <em>Scholler v. Scholler </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 98, 10 OBR 426, 462 N.E.2d 158, and <em>Simon v. Zipperstein </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 74, 512 N.E.2d 636, as the controlling authority, which supports the proposition that an attorney is immune from liability to third-parties arising from his/her performance as an attorney in good faith on behalf of his/her client unless the third-party is in privity with the client or the attorney acts with malice. We are compelled to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision pursuant to that same authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Appellants raise one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cWith sufficient allegations pleaded in appellants\u2019 complaint to place at issue whether appellants suffered damages as a proximate result of appellees\u2019 professional negligence, the trial court erred by finding otherwise and sustaining appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Within appellant\u2019s single assignment of error, three issues were presented for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201c1. Whether a \u2018special circumstances\u2019 exception to an attorney\u2019s immunity from third-party claims exists when allegations concern the attorney\u2019s professional negligence surrounding the procedural execution of the last will and testament of a deceased client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\u201c2. Whether inclusion of the court-appointed fiduciary of the estate as a plaintiff in the legal malpractice action, acting as the <em>alter ego </em>of the deceased client, precludes granting of a motion to dismiss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">\u201c3. Whether Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution, which guarantees a right-to-a-remedy, is violated by the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Appellants\u2019 action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">The trial court addressed each of these issues in its decision granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss appellants\u2019 complaint filed December 17,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s decision which, in short, held that the current case law authority does not recognize any \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception to an attorney\u2019s immunity from third-party claims that falls within the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>presented here, and specifically the holding in <em>Simon </em>is contrary to appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Moreover, there is no statutory or case law authority that supports appellants\u2019 \u201calter ego\u201d theory in regard to Dykes, the court-appointed administrator, and, finally, there was no violation of Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, because our common law does not recognize a third-party claim against an attorney without the required \u201cprivity\u201d with the decedent or malice on behalf of the attorney. See, generally, <em>Johnson v. Koppers Co., Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1981), 524 F.Supp. 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We believe, however, that appellants raise a persuasive public policy argument which requests that we balance the public policy that supports the right of a testator to make a will and have its provisions carried out with the public policy that favors some immunity for attorneys, as against lawsuits by third-parties, so that the attorney may properly represent his client without the fear of indiscriminate third-party actions. <em>Scholler, Simon. </em>This case may indeed be appropriate for review by our state\u2019s highest court, and we would respectfully invite the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-8\">Peggy Bryant and Lazarus, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
