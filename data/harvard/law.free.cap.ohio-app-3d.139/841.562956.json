Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Defendant-appellant Richard E. Carley appeals from his convictions after entering guilty pleas to two counts of aggravated murder with mass murder and felony murder specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Appellant challenges the acceptance by the trial court three-judge panel of his guilty pleas because of the panel\u2019s failure to comply with several of the requirements set forth in R.C. 2945.06. Appellant further argues that his pleas were not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, contending both that the trial court panel\u2019s compliance with Crim.R. 11(C) was inadequate and that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">After an examination of the record, this court is compelled to sustain appellant\u2019s challenge to the acceptance of his guilty pleas by the three-judge panel, not precisely on the basis of appellant\u2019s arguments but, rather, on the basis that the panel lacked subject matter jurisdiction to do so. Appellant\u2019s convictions, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Appellant originally was indicted in October 1997 on charges related to the September 1997 shooting deaths of two men in Cleveland, Ohio. The indictment alleged six counts against appellant as follows: two counts of aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01(A) (murder committed with prior calculation and design), both counts containing two firearm specifications, a mass murder specification, and a felony murder specification; two counts of aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01(B) (felony murder), both counts containing two firearm specifications, a mass murder specification, and a felony murder specification; and two counts of aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01, both counts containing two firearm specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">At his arraignment, appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. His case duly was assigned to a trial judge for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Although appellant initially retained counsel to represent him, subsequent to his waiver of his right to a speedy trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s original counsel requested permission to withdraw from the case due to appellant\u2019s inability to pay for the representation. The trial court granted that request and, in view of appellant\u2019s indigency, appointed new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Thereafter, the prosecutor\u2019s efforts to come to a plea agreement with appellant proved futile, in spite of the fact that, after conducting a hearing on his motion to suppress the evidence of his written confession to the murders, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion. The trial court, therefore, commenced voir dire of prospective jury members for appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>The trial court had not yet concluded this process, however, when the prosecutor and the defense attorneys notified the trial court that a plea agreement had been reached. In consequence, the administrative judge of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court issued an order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to R.C. 2956.06<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appointing the trial judge and two other judges of the court \u201cto serve on a 3 judge panel\u201d to consider appellant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The trial court panel thereupon assembled. Initially, the panel permitted the prosecutor to present the substance of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The prosecutor indicated that appellant would enter pleas of guilty to only the felony murder counts. The prosecutor further stated that although the capital murder specifications would remain in the indictment, the agreed penalty would not be death but, rather, a sentence of concurrent terms of \u201c30 full years to life\u201d imprisonment on the two charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The panel proceeded to conduct a colloquy with appellant pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C), requested his plea to the charges, which was \u201cguilty,\u201d then heard the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpresentation of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s evidence consisted of the following: (1) the coroner\u2019s autopsy reports relating to the two shooting victims; (2) appellant\u2019s written confession via the testimony of one of the investigating police detectives; together with (3) the detective\u2019s testimony that (a) the pager of one of the victims indicated that appellant had contacted the victim three times on the day of the shootings and (b) a search of appellant\u2019s home pursuant to a warrant led to the discovery of drugs, which corroborated appellant\u2019s confession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Thereafter, the panel made a \u201cfinding of guilt\u201d and accepted appellant\u2019s \u201cplea of guilt to both offenses of aggravated murder -with [capital] specifications under the third and fourth counts of the indictment.\u201d The panel dismissed the remaining charges and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The panel then accepted the parties\u2019 \u201cstipulation\u201d that the \u201caggravating specifications contained within the body of each counts [sic] of the indictment relating to mass murder and felony murder do not outweigh by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt claimed factors in mitigation.\u201d Subsequently, the panel sentenced appellant to concurrent terms of life imprisonment without possibility of parole for thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Only two months later, in April 1998, appellant, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion to withdraw his pleas. The judge originally assigned to appellant\u2019s case issued an order denying appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In September 1998, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief. One month later, the same originally assigned trial court judge denied appellant\u2019s petition. The judge\u2019s order further essentially advised appellant to file a direct appeal of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Appellant\u2019s first attempt to follow the trial judge\u2019s advice was dismissed as untimely pursuant to App.R. 4(A). Subsequently, this court granted appellant\u2019s request to file a delayed appeal of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Appellant presents five assignments of error for review in this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this court need not directly address them since the record demonstrates that the trial court panel lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently required strict compliance with Ohio statutes when reviewing the procedures [used by the trial court] in capital cases.\u201d <em>State v. Filiaggi </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 240, 714 N.E.2d 867, 876-877; see, also, <em>State v. Green </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 100, 103, 689 N.E.2d 556, 558-559. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s strict compliance with the requirements of both R.C. 2945.05 and 2945.06 is a \u201cjurisdictional matter\u201d that \u201ccannot be waived.\u201d <em>Filiaggi </em>at 239, 714 N.E.2d at 876; <em>State v. Pless </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">The trial court panel in this case proceeded to consider appellant\u2019s decision to enter into a plea agreement pursuant to R.C. 2945.06. With regard to this statute, the Supreme Court has most recently observed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">\u201cR.C. 2945.06 does not require an examination of witnesses, determination of guilt, and pronouncement of sentence <em>by a three-judge court if the accused </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number><em>is not charged with an offense punishable by death. Ullman v. Seiter </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 59, 18 OBR 92, 479 N.E.2d 875. In this regard, R.C. 2945.06 must be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with Crim.R. 11(C). <em>State v. Green </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 100, 104, 689 N.E.2d 556, 559. <em>At the time [the defendant] pled guilty, his indictment had been amended </em>to delete any death-penalty specification. Therefore, neither R.C. 2945.06 nor Crim.R. 11(C) required an examination and determination <em>by a three-judge panel </em>because [the defendant] was <em>no longer charged with an offense punishable by death at the time he entered his guilty plea.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted and emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Henry v. McMona-gle </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 543, 544-545, 721 N.E.2d 1051, 1052-1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">In contrast to <em>Henry, </em>however, at the time appellant entered his pleas in this case, both counts still contained death penalty specifications. Indeed, the prosecutor took pains to place this fact on the record. Notably absent from the record in this case is any indication that appellant waived his right to a jury trial, pursuant to R.C. 2945.05, prior to the appointment of the three-judge panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Henry </em>construed the fourth sentence of R.C. 2945.06. However, the first sentence of that statute limits its applicability to those cases in which a defendant has waived his right to a trial by jury in accordance with R.C. 2945.05. <em>State v. McCoy </em>(1969), 26 Ohio App.2d 62, 55 O.O.2d 86, 269 N.E.2d 51, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Henry v. McMonagle </em>(June 3, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 75464, unreported, at 5, 1999 WL 359204; cf. <em>State ex rel. Novack v. Eckle </em>(App.1956), 77 Ohio Law Abs. 185, 148 N.E.2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The decision in <em>State v. McCoy, supra, </em>was cited by the Supreme Court in <em>State ex rel. Larkins v. Baker </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 658, 653 N.E.2d 701, to illustrate the proposition that \u201cR.C. 2945.05 and R.C. 2945.06 <em>must </em>be read in context and * * * regulate not only the procedure, but also the <em>jurisdiction </em>of the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 660, 653 N.E.2d at 703, and fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Subsequently, in <em>Piess, </em>the application of <em>Larkins </em>was limited to require only that, in order to remedy a trial court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of R.C. 2945.05, a defendant must file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Appellant\u2019s delayed appeal of his convictions has met that requirement in this case. Moreover, the issue of a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction is one that may be raised at any time. A review of the relevant case law fails to provide another single instance of a trial court panel assuming jurisdiction of a capital case in the absence of a written waiver by the defendant of his right to a jury trial. <em>State v. Pless, supra; State v. Filiaggi, supra; State v. Green, supra; </em>see, also, <em>State v. Staton </em>(Dec. 22, 1997), Butler App. No. CA-97-08-0156, unreported, 1997 WL 786201. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Henry v. McMonagle, supra; State v. Perkins </em>(June 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76321, unreported, 2000 WL 804618; <em>State v. Shakoor </em>(Dec. 13, 1996), Trumbull App. No. 93-T-4917, unreported, 1996 WL 788413.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Appellant signed no waiver of his right to a jury trial' in this case as required by R.C. 2945.05 and 2945.06. Without strict compliance with the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 and 2945.06, the trial court panel lacked jurisdiction to consider appellant\u2019s plea to the capital offenses with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Appellant\u2019s convictions, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The judgment cause is reversed and the cause is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b881-9\">Anne Dyke, A.J., and Karpinski, J., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">The trial court erred when it accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea without examining the witnesses, determining whether the accused is guilty of aggravated murder or any other offence [sic] before pronouncing sentence in violation of Ohio Revised Code Section 2945.06 and appellant\u2019s rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">The trial court erred when it failed to properly journalize a finding of guilty with regard to appellant\u2019s conviction in violation of Ohio Revised Code Section 29[45].06 and Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, thereby resulting in an invalid conviction and a violation of appellant\u2019s rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">The appellant\u2019s guilty plea was invalid and his due process rights were violated where the trial court failed to require the appellant to separately plead guilty to the specifications in his indictment in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"A-f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 4</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The appellant\u2019s guilty plea was invalid and his due process rights were violated where the trial court failed to fully inform the appellant of and determine that the appellant understood the effect of the pleas of guilty in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Assignment of Error No. 5</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The appellant\u2019s guilty plea was invalid and unknowingly made where he received ineffective assistance of counsel before, and during his plea proceedings[,] in violation of his sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-12\">. The signed waiver form is contained in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">. The order was dated February 24, 1998, and filed for journalization on March 23, 1998. Since the record reflects that the plea agreement was not reached until the afternoon of February 25, 1998, it may be assumed the order was misdated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-10\">. R.C. 2945.06 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-11\"><em>\"In any case in wfiich a defendant waives his right to trial by jury </em>and elects to be tried by the court under section 2945.05 of the Revised Code, any judge of the court in which the cause is pending shall proceed to <em>hear, try, and determine the cause in accordance with the rules and in like manner as if the cause were being tried before a jury.
