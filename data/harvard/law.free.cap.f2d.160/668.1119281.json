Pistolesi two life insurance policies \u2014 one for $5,000 and the other for $2,000. Mr. Pistolesi died on October 5, 1941, and the ordinary benefits payable under each policy have been satisfied. The claim in suit is based on the double-indemnity feature of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The question here is whether the appellee, the plaintiff below, has maintained her burden of proof that the accident, which we assume caused the death, produced \u201ca visible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body\u201d of the deceased within the policies\u2019 provisions that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">\u201cUpon receipt of due proof that the death of the insured occurred * * * as the result of bodily injury effected solely through external, violent, and accidental means, as evidence of which injury (except in case of drowning or of internal injuries revealed by an autopsy) there is a visible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body, and that such death occurred * * * as a direct result thereof, independently and exclusively of all other causes * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">On September 14, 1941, three weeks prior to his death, Mr. Pistolesi, aged 39 years, was on board a pleasure yacht, the Eloise. He was traveling hand-over-hand suspended from a wire which was strung between two masts of the boat. He reached for the wire with one hand, missed the wire, so that his body swung around, and he held on to the wire with the other hand. Then he went back to the mast and remained there for a few minutes while his photograph was taken by another guest on the boat. Pistolesi then climbed down the mast to the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">From that occasion until his death, Pistol-esi intermittently complained of pain in his chest, and on physical effort he perspired freely, his face became pale, and his lips were sometimes blue. He lost his customary vigor, he walked in a shuffling manner, at times his breathing was labored, and his countenance was drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Early in the morning of October 5, 1941, he awakened and complained of severe pain. A Dr. Wagner was called, but before Pis-tolesi could be removed to a hospital he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">There was no autopsy. The coroner was not notified. The body was cremated on October 7, 1941. The official death certificate signed by Dr. Wagner stated that the immediate cause of death was \u201cacute myocardial failure due to coronary thrombosis\u2014 duration one week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">We assume as correct the appellee\u2019s contention that the happenings to Pistolesi on the yacht\u2019s rigging accidentally caused coronary thrombosis and, as a result, his death. We do not agree with appellee\u2019s contention that either mere sweating or paleness of skin or recurring blueing of the lips of Pis-tolesi after such exertion constitutes a \u201cvisible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body.\u201d Appellee gave no evidence of any wound and we think none of a \u201ccontusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">The California Civil Code, Section 1644, provides that \u201cThe words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.\u201d In California, insurance policies are so construed. Cf. Greenberg v. Continental Casualty Co., 24 Cal. App.2d 506, 75 P.2d 644, relying on the dictionary definition of the policy\u2019s words. The Supreme Court states of dictionary definitions of the word \u201cpassenger\u201d that \u201cWhile for the purposes of judicial decision dictionary definitions often are not controlling, they are at least persuasive that meanings which they do not embrace are not common.\u201d Aschenbrenner v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 292 U.S. 80, 85, 54 S.Ct. 590, 593, 78 L.Ed. 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Ed., defines a \u201ccontusion\u201d as \u201ca bruise; and injury attended with more or less disorganization of the subcutaneous tissue and effusion of blood beneath the skin but without breaking the skin.\u201d Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s New Standard Dictionary as</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">\u201c1. The act of bruising by striking or pounding, or the state of being so bruised; also a pulverizing by beating or pounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Surg. A bruise; an injury, as from a blow with a blunt instrument, that does not make an open wound.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b721-18\">The court recognizes that an injured heart may drive less blood to the lips and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>that they will appear blue, as they did with the deceased just after his strain on the yacht\u2019s rigging. This, however, is no evidence that the lips were contused any more than if they turned blue from a sudden gust of fog laden air.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">It is possible that such a heart affliction as here claimed may gradually deposit in the veins and arteries material which will slow the circulation and in time cause a permanent blueing of the lips by such deposit therein. It is not necessary to decide whether this would be a contusion. Here the testimony is that the blue lips appeared only when the deceased physically exerted himself. It is not claimed that he sustained a blow on the lips or that .they were swollen.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The uncontradicted medical testimony corresponds with the dictionary definitions. It is '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201cQ. State whether blue lips are wounds or contusions? A. Blue lips are not a wound or contusion, not a bruise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">\u201cMr. Healy: I move to strike the answer as not responsive, it can be answered yes or no. A. The answer is no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">\u201cA. Blueness of the skin is a result of the oxygen content of the blood, \u2014 veinous blood is blue and the oxygenized blood is red. When the heart action is insufficient and the blood is not pumped properly and sufficient oxygen does not enter the blood, that imparts a blue color or character to the skin, the blood becomes blue, and that imparts the color to the skin. There is no damage and there is no wound or contusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">\u201cQ. Is there any damage to the subcutaneous tissue? A. There is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">\u201cQ. In the case of pallor is there any damage to the subcutaneous tissue ? A. There is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">\u201cQ. In case of pallor is there any effusion of blood beneath the skin ? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-12\">\u201cQ. In case of blue lips is there any effusion of blood beneath the skin? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">Our conclusion that appellee\u2019s burden of proof of contusion has not been sustained by the evidence of pallor and blue lips is in accord with the decision on the identical facts in the case of Paul Revere Life v. Stanfield, 10 Cir., 151 F.2d 776, 777, where the court construed the same policy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">It appears that appellant was entitled to have given to the jury its requested instruction for a verdict in its favor and to have granted its motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. It is now entitled to have vacated the judgment appealed from and to have one entered that plaintiff take nothing by her complaint and for its costs. Central Vermont Railway v. Sullivan, 1 Cir., 86 F.2d 171, 174; Brennan v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., 2 Cir., 115 F.2d 555; Leader v. Apex Hosiery Co., 3 Cir., 108 F.2d 71, 81; Southern Railway Co. v.
