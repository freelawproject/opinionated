Fair market value of the commodities at the time that the plaintiff called, or should have called, for the food, less stipulated storage charges until such time, was the full measure of plaintiff\u2019s damages,</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">A case for the jury was made out by the plaintiff, and we discern no reversible error, within the exceptions taken at the trial, other than the rejection of defendant\u2019s right to have its storage charges deducted from plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">The cause is remanded for the allowance of defendant\u2019s counterclaim in such amount as shall be fixed by verdict or agreed upon between the parties, and upon such ascertainment, if the plaintiff, within fifteen days thereafter, will enter a remit-titur in the amount thereof, as so ascertained, the judgment herein shall thereupon stand affirmed; otherwise there shall be a new trial of the case in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">The costs of this appeal shall be divided between the parties, the appellee to pay one-fourth and the appellant to pay three-fourths thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-26\"> Western Union Cold Storage Co. v.
