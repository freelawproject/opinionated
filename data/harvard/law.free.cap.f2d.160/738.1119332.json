The evidence was sufficient to warrant submitting the case to the jury and to support the verdict. The exclusion of exhibit No. D-3 for identification was not prejudicial error. While the question and the remark of the Assistant United States Attorney, objected to by the defendant, were improper, they were not of such a character as to affect seriously the fairness of the proceedings. The motions for mistrial were properly denied. The trial judge\u2019s charge was adequate and fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-21\">Accordingly the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
