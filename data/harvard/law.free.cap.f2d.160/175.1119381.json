Two questions are presented: (1) whether certain bequests to charities in the will of decedent are sufficiently ascertainable to be allowed as deductions under Internal Revenue Code, \u00a7 812(d), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 812(d), and (2), the measure of the value of the property includible in the gross estate by reason of the exercise by decedent in his will of two powers of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">Nathan P. Cutler, Sr., decedent\u2019s father, created an inter vivos trust in 1926, the income of which was payable to .himself for life, and on his death the net income was payable in equal shares to his two children, Nathan P. Cutler, Jr., the decedent, and his brother, William H. Cutler, as long as they should live. Upon the death of one of them, that decedent\u2019s portion of the income was to go according to the will of that deceased life tenant. On the death of the survivor of the two brothers, the corpus was to be divided into equal shares payable as each son appointed by will. Provisions were made for disposition in the event of default of appointment but they are not now pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-19\">After the father\u2019s death in 1931 the net income of the trust was paid in equal parts to the two sons. Nathan P. Cutler, Jr., whose estate is the subject of the present, proceedings, died on September 10, 194Q survived by his brother William. The decedent devised and bequeathed to. a trustee \u201call the rest and residue of my property,, real or personal, of which I shall die seized or possessed, or to which at the time of my decease I shall be in any way entitled or over which I may have any power of appointment,\u201d in trust to pay the net income thereof \u201cto or for the use and benefit\u201d of his wife for life. The trustee was. given a power \u201cto make such payment or-payments to or for the use and benefit of' my said wife as it may in its sole discretion deem advisable.\u201d On the death of the wife the remainder, subject to certain specific bequests, was bequeathed to charity,. The will empowered the trustee to mortgage, lease, or sell both real and personal property in the trust fund and provided that; all decisions of the trustee made in good-, faith should be conclusive on all parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">After the death of decedent, one-half of' the income from the father\u2019s trust was paid to the trustee under the decedent\u2019s will. At the time of decedent\u2019s death, his brother William\u2019s age was 68 years, 3\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>months, -and the wife\u2019s <em>67 </em>years, 8 months. It has been conceded that the charitable organizations are of the type to which charitable bequests may be made and allowed as deductions under Internal Revenue Code, \u00a7 .812(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Commissioner disallowed any deduction for the charitable bequests on the ground that the trustee\u2019s power of invasion of the principal for the use and benefit of the wife of decedent made it impossible to determine with any degree of certainty what amounts would ultimately go to charity, and hence the value of such bequests was not presently ascertainable. The Commissioner also determined that the value of the one-half interest in the Cutler Sr. trust over which the decedent exercised the powers of appointment was $201,382.99. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner on the disallowance of the amount of the charitable bequests; but found the value of the property passing under the powers of appointment to be the sum of the separate value of the life estate and the remainder, viz., $195,778.35. The Tax Court also made a finding that the wife did not file a disclaimer under the provisions of \u00a7 812(d), as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Section 812(d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code \u25a0 provides for a deduction from the gross estate of decedent of the amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers to charitable corporations. Treasury Regulations 105, \u00a7 81.44<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires that the charitable gift in trust have a \u201cpresently ascertainable\u201d value in order to warrant the deduction; and \u00a7 81.46<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that where a power of invasion is present the deduction will be limited to that portion of the principal which is exempt from the exercise of the power. The Supreme Court has upheld these regulations, which have since been somewhat amended, as appropriate implementations of the statute. Merchants Nat. Bank of Boston v. Commissioner, 1943, 320 U.S. 256, 260, 64 S.Ct. 108, 88 L.Ed. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">It would seem that a proper analysis of these powers of invasion cases in conformity with the statute and the regulations must rest on a consideration of two basic propositions. The first problem would concern the measurability of the possible exercise of the power in terms of a definitely ascertainable standard. When no calculable standard is present, no deduction should be allowed since the value of the charitable remainder cannot then be ascertained. If a fixed standard is ascertainable, then as the second step in any analysis it becomes necessary to examine the remoteness of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>vasion, or the extent of possible invasion, in terms of the standard, to determine the likelihood that the charity will take and the value of what it will receive. See Paul, Federal Estate and Gift Taxation (1946 Supp.) p. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Where the power of invasion is limited to the maintenance of the widow in her former station of life the standard is \u201cfixed in fact and capable of being stated in definite terms of money.\u201d Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 1929, 279 U.S. 151, 154, 49 S.Ct. 291, 73 L.Ed. 647. But, on the other hand, where non-measurable sums may be expended from the corpus, the power of invasion is not restricted to a fixed standard and the value of the charitable remainder is not \u201cpresently ascertainable.\u201d Merchants Nat. Bank v. Commissioner, supra. Whether a particular power of invasion falls into one class or the other depends upon the terms of the power and the proper construction to be placed thereon by the law of the state which would have jurisdiction to construe the will or trust in question. Thus, the Ithaca case allowed invasion \u201cnecessary to suitably maintain her in as much comfort as she now enjoys.\u201d Similarly, where invasion was permitted \u201cif in the judgment of the said trustee, the best interests of my sister should so require\u201d and the trustee testified that in his judgment the best interests of the beneficiary was to maintain her according to her past standards of living, the deduction was allowed. Commissioner v. Robertson\u2019s Estate, 4 Cir, 1944, 141 F.2d 855, 856. The terms \u201ccomfort, maintenance and support\u201d have also been held to provide a fixed standard under which the value of the charitable remainder is ascertainable and deductible. Lucas v. Mercantile Trust Co, 8 Cir, 1930, 43 F.2d 39, 40. See also Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. v. Eaton, 2 Cir, 1929, 36 F.2d 710; First Nat. Bank of Birmingham, Ala. v. Snead, 5 Cir, 1928, 24 F.2d 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\"> On the other hand a fixed standard has been found wanting where the terms used are vague and uncertain and do not restrict invasion to maintain a prior mode of living or to definitely ascertainable amounts. Thus, in the Merchants Nat. Bank case [320 U.S. 56, 260, 64 S.Ct. 110] the principal could have been used for the \u201ccomfort, support, maintenance, and/or happiness\u201d of the widow, and in Industrial Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 1 Cir, 1945, 151 F.2d 592, 593, certiorari denied, 327 U.S. 788, 66 S.Ct. 807 for her \u201ccomfort and pleasure.\u201d Likewise \u201cneed or desire\u201d of the life tenant has been held not limited to a prior mode of life or any other fixed and ascertainable standard. Gammons v. Hassett, 1 Cir, 1941, 121 F.2d 229, 230, certiorari denied 1941, 314 U.S. 673, 62 S. Ct. 136, 86 L.Ed. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In our present case the Tax Court held that \u201cuse and benefit of my said wife\u201d did not refer to the widow\u2019s previous standard of living and that no other standard of expenditure was prescribed in terms of which the possibility or extent of invasion could be appraised. We agree with this holding. \u201cUse and benefit\u201d .considered conjunctively or disjunctively connote considerably more than the maintenance of a standard of living and to our mind payments for such a purpose or purposes could not lend themselves to predetermined measurement or a measurable standard. We do agree with the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the terms \u201cdesire\u201d, \u201chappiness\u201d and \u201cpleasure\u201d are of much broader import \"than \u201cuse and benefit\u201d, but the taxpayer\u2019s problem here is not solved by a comparison but rather he must show affirmatively that the words used indicate an objective standard ascertainable in money. Undoubtedly a court of equity would disallow certain expenditures from principal under the terms of this trust which expenditures might readily be allowed where the broader terms were used. But within the area of permissible principal invasions here, it is impossible to predetermine just how much would be expended for \u201cuse and benefit\u201d or even to set a dollars and cents maximum. The term \u201cbenefit\u201d has been said to mean \u201cwhatever promotes welfare; advantage, profit.\u201d See Helvering v. Evans, 3 Cir, 1942, 126 F.2d 270, 272, certiorari denied 1942, 317 U.S. 638, 63 S.Ct. 30, 87 L.Ed. 514; Stowell v. Stowell\u2019s Executor, 1887, 59 Vt. 494, 8 A. 738, 59 Am.St.Rep. 748. This alone should serve to point out the indefiniteness of the terms here employed. Granting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>this power of invasion does not bestow an unrestricted right to consume the principal, we are still unable to make more than an inaccurate guess at the extent of the power of invasion. Thus the need for an ascertainable standard becomes self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The Massachusetts cases cited to us do not seem ' to support the taxpayer\u2019s position. The two cases which construed \u201cuse and benefit\u201d determined that a gift of all the testator\u2019s property to his wife for her \u201cuse and benefit\u201d during life or until remarriage created only a life estate in the widow. Lewis v. Shattuck, 1899, 173 Mass. 486, 53 N.E. 912; Fuller v. Wilbur, 1898, 170 Mass. 506, 49 N.E. 916. As we said previously we agree with the taxpayer when 'it says that \u201cuse and benefit\u201d imply limitations, but the difficulty remains \u2014 that payments for \u201cuse and benefit\u201d are not susceptible of previously ascertainable measurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Since a standard for the power of invasion is not ascertainable in the instant case, no occasion exists for examining the possibility of invasion and the remoteness thereof. Without such' \u00e1 standard, any calculation of the possibility of invasion could only be highly conjectural. Thus this second question only becomes pertinent when the standard is found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The taxpayer makes a further argument in favor of the deductibility of the charitable-remainder. Assuming that the power of invasion would be a power to inyade the entire corpus, the taxpayer argues that no invasion of principal is permitted until the brother\u2019s death since under the terms of the father\u2019s. will the decedent had no power over the cprpus until that 'event occurred. 'In other words, he would grant that if the brother predeceased the widow, the widow\u2019s power of invasion would defeat the gift to charity and its deductibility; but if the widow should predecease the brother then the charity would get the remainder interest in toto! The 'taxpayer would have the actuarial value of the contingent charitable interest computed, and as so computed be considered definitely ascertained and deductible. This argument was rejected by the Tax Court with this statement: \u201c-Whether the brother or the widow will die first is purely speculative and is not a matter upon which an actuarial computation for tax purposes can be made. Cf. Humes et al. v. United States, 1928, 276 U.S. 487, 48 S.Ct. 347, 72 L.Ed. 667.\u201d The Tax Court likewise held, that\u2019under the powers given to. the testamentary trustee, ,it could anticipate the receipt of principal upon the brother\u2019s death, and, by mortgage or sale of the right to receive the corpus upon the termination of the father\u2019s trust it could now provide the widow with funds over the amount of the income for her use and benefit by such indirect invasion of the principal prior to the death of the brother. We have some difficulty in accepting this latter argument of the Tax Court. It may well be that upon a proper construction of the terms of the decedent\u2019s will the trustee may have the power to hypothecate now the right to receive the corpus of the' father\u2019s trust upon the brother\u2019s death and thus effectively diminish the remainder regardless of whether the widow or brother died first. On the other hand, it may be that a transferee \u00a1could only realize on this interest if the brother predeceased the widow; in other words, the effectiveness of any exercise of the power of invasion would be contingent on the survivorship of the widow. Since the proper construction of the decedent\u2019s will and the father\u2019s trust is, thus sufficiently in doubt we hesitate to place our decision on the same ground as the Tax Court and, therefore, we shall consider the taxpayer\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We are inclined to agree with the result reached by the Tax Court but for a different reason. The taxpayer suggests that the point in issue may be stated thus: a trust to pay the income to A for life and upon the death of A remainder to B, if B survives A, and if B does not survive A then over to charity. We have no hesitation in saying that the value of the contingent charitable gift may be mathematically or actuarially computed. The value of such an interest contingent on survivorship may be computed on the basis of experience tables. Cf. Treas. Reg. 108, \u00a7 86.19 (Gift Tax); Robinette v. Helver-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ing, 1943, 318 U.S. 184, 188, 63 S.Ct. 540, 87 L.Ed. 700. From this the taxpayer argues that by using the nearest ages of the widow and the brother (a required practice in the use of mortality tables) we find that for computation purposes they both have the same age, i.e. 68 years, and therefore the same life expectancy. Consequently, it says that the chances of one surviving the other are 50% and with that factor the value of the gift to charity may be computed. We do not question the correctness of this computation, nor its use in other situations; but on turning to the Regulations for the correct solution we find this method inapplicable here. Section 81.46 of Treas. Reg. 105 reads in part as follows: <em>\u201cConditional Bequests: </em>\u2014 If as of the date of decedent\u2019s death the transfer to charity is dependent upon the performance of some act or the happening of a precedent event in order that it might become effective, <em>no deduction is allowable unless the possibility that charity will not take is so remote as to be negligible. </em>If an estate or interest has passed to or is vested in charity at the time of decedent\u2019s death and such right or interest would be defeated by the performance of some act or the happening of some event which appeared to have been <em>highly improbable </em>at the time of decedent\u2019s death, the deduction is allowable.\u201d [Italics supplied.] Here it is not certain that the charity will take 50% of the corpus; only that it has a 50-50 chance of getting all or nothing. The Regulation says that the chance that charity will hot take must be so remote as to be negligible. The chance that the charity here will not take is far from being so remote as to be negligible nor is it highly improbable; in fact, even taxpayer\u2019s own computations admit that there is an even chance that charity will not take. Under our analysis no deduction whatever is therefore allowed for the gift to charity. If, however, the chance that charity will not take<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is so remote as to be negligible, then actuarial computations are permissible to evaluate the amount of the deduction to be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Therefore, under this view if the widow were aged 30 and the brother aged 90, the chance that the charity would not take would be very good and not extremely remote. If, however, the brother were aged 30 and the widow aged . 90, the charity\u2019s chance of not taking might be said to be so remote as to be negligible and the deduction would seem to be allowable. Even where great differences in age exist, it must be recognized that life expectancies of individuals computed by mortality tables seldom approximate reality in any given case. That might constitute the remote chance that charity would not take, but the probabilities are that the older person would predecease the .younger. Here, where the same age is attributed to both persons we find that both have the same life expectancy. Not only will neither probably approximate the computed expectancy but any determination of sur-vivorship, based on actuarial computation, between persons whose age difference is relatively slight, is fraught with conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">; [10] We have been referred to the case of Meierhof v. Higgins, 2 Cir., 1942, 129 F. 2d 1002 as authority for the position that the value of a contingent remainder to charity should be actuarially computed and allowed as a deduction. There, if the wife aged 71 should survive the other two life tenants aged 74 and 79 the gift to charity would have been defeated. The court based its decision in large part on \u00a7 81.44 of the Regulations which reads in part as follows: \u201cIf a trust is created for both a charitable and a private purpose, deduction may be taken of the value of the beneficial interest in favor of the former only insofar as such interest is presently ascertainable and hence severable from the interest in favor of the private use.\u201d The court construed \u201cboth a charitable and a private purpose\u201d to include an alternative gift to charity, but doubt has been cast on the validity of this interpretation. See Paul, supra, at p. 426. Moreover, Regulations 105, \u00a7 81.46 as it now reads was not then in effect. Paul, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>at p. 427, states the Treasury\u2019s position to be that the mere fact that a gift to charity may be actuarially computed does not conclusively establish its deductibility. We agree with this interpretation of the Regulation'and find\u2019no reason for denying the validity of the Regulation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In Gardiner v. Ilassett, D.C.Mass.1945, 63 F.Supp. 853,\u2019 856 the gift to charity depended on the survivorship of a person aged 84 as against two life tenants aged 60 arid 64. The court following :Meierhof v. Higgins, and again using the older Regulations, said \u201c * * * ' there was far more than a reasonable certainty the charitable bequests would vest. 'In fact it was extremely likely the bequest to the charities would take effect.\u201d And'again:: \u201cThis court is compelled to make a finding that the contingency upon which the bequests to the charities were to take effect was far more than a probability.\u201d This language it seems to us is not in accord with \u00a7 81.46 of the new regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">On the basis, therefore, of Treas. Reg. 105, \u00a7 81.46 we agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the actuarial value of the charitable remainder is not allowable as a deduction. Cf. Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust. Co. v. Commissioner, 1934, 30 B.T. A. 679 dismissed without opinion C.C.A. 1st, Dec. 10, 1934. -Moreover, we believe that -this- analysis does not conflict with United States v. Provident Trust Co., 1934, 291 U.S. 272, 54 S.Ct. 389, 78 L.Ed 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The final problem deals with the valuation of the property passing under the power of appointment. \u25a0\u2018We agree with the Tax Court that decedent in effect exercised two powers, one to appoint one-half of the income of his father\u2019s trust for the life of his brother, and the other to appoint one-half of the corpus of his father\u2019s trust on the death of his brother. The appointee of the corpus would not acquire the possession or use of the corpus until some future date. Even though the same appointee received the benefit' of the income during the continuance of the trust'set up by the father, it does not seem to us that the present value of these combined rights should have the same value as a corpus transferred at the death of decedent. The restriction on the use of the corpus affects the value of the rights passing under the exercise of the powers and should, we think, make that combined value less than the present value of the corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\"> I.R.O. \u00a7 812, 26 U.S.C.A.
