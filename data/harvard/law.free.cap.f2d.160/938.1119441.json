On appeal she argues that the court erred in overruling this defense. But before reaching that question we must determine whether the order is appealable. Obviously it is not a final order. See Rutherford v. Fisher, 4 Dali., Pa., 22, 1 L.Ed. 724 (overruling a plea of limitations). As an interlocutory order in admiralty it is appealable only if it determines \u201cthe rights and liabilities of the parties.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 227; Schoenamsgruber v. Hamburg American Line, 294 U.S. 454, 458, 55 S.Ct. 475, <em>79 </em>L.Ed. 989; Barbarino v. Stanhope S. S. Co., 2 Cir., 151 F.2d 553, 555. The order on appeal determined nothing as to the rights of the appellant; she may win the case when it comes to trial. Under some circumstances an order denying intervention may finally determine the petitioner's rights and may therefore be appealable \u2019by him. See United States v. Radice, 2 Cir., 40 F.2d 445 ; In re Dolcater, 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 30, 32. But neither principle nor authority supports the appellant\u2019s contention that she may appeal from an order which merely allows another claimant to intervene. The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
