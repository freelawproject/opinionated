According to him, the-prices at which his corporation sold lighters-after March 1942, as of which time prices, generally were frozen, were $5.40 per dozen\u00bb to jobbers; $7.20 to retailers, and the latter were supposed to supply the users of the-items at $1 a piece. The manufacturer advertised its wares in the October issues of two local trade publications, known as \u2018The-Tobacco Jobber\u2019 and \u2018The Retail Tobacconist,\u2019 respectively and specifically declared., that the retail price of the lighter was unchanged at $1. each. Letters and price-sheets to the same effect, and of earlier-dates, were widely distributed throughout, the trade. The corporation endeavored to\u00bb sell its products only to merchants who&gt; maintained its price list. Subsequent to-March 1942, the company had but two domestic competitors, and each of them sold, its lighters at prices less than those charged, by the Regens Company. Dismas, however,, \"stated that\u2019 he could not, in all instances,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>quote jobber\u2019s prices for lighters after March 1942, because of the existence of a black market in the trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\">\u201cSection 1499.2 of the General Maximum Price Regulation sets the maximum price of an article offered for sale at \u2018the highest price charged by the seller during March 1942, for the same commodity\u2019 or \u2018for the \u25a0similar commodity most nearly like it\u2019 or at the highest price charged during March, 1942 by the \u2018most closely competitive seller of the same class for the same commodity.\u2019 The testimony of Dismas was offered by plaintiff in order to prove the ceiling prices on Regens Lighters that had been established by defendant\u2019s \u2018most closely competitive seller,\u2019 which price, in the absence of a price established by defendant in March, 1942, would tend to place a limitation on the amount he might charge for the same item. While there is no direct showing that defendant saw or knew of any of the advertising matter issued by Regens Lighter Corporation-, it is reasonable to suppose that \u25a0defendant, as an experienced trader, when he undertook to deal in Regens Lighters, would inform himself of what the company charged for the merchandise he was handling. For him to have done so would seem to be a natural course of procedure in the business in which he was engaged. He, the same as every trader, was charged with knowledge of the price -regulations of the Administrator, and it became his duty to inform himself of the restrictions applicable to his line of business. For this reason, it is fair to assume that he either knew or should have known that the ceiling prices of Regens Lighter Corporation were also prices by which he might be bound. If I am correct in this, Leventhal must bear the burden of showing that his established ceiling price in March 1942 (if he had one) -differed from that of the manufacturer of the Regens Lighter.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-5\">George Moncharsh, David London, Albert M.

Therefore, plaintiff, in order to win, had to show facts which directly proved, or from which it could reasonably be inferred, that defendant\u2019s \u201cmost closely competitive seller\u201d sold Regens-made lighters during March 1942 at prices below the prices at which defendant sold in 1943 (i.e., between $2.75 and $3.75 each). This plaintiff sought to do by proof that Regens, the sole manufacturer of such lighters, sold them during March 1942 to both jobbers and retailers, and that Regens\u2019 price to jobbers was then 45{i a piece, and to retailers was then 60fS.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">But from those facts alone it cannot reasonably be inferred that Regens\u2019 prices were those of defendant\u2019s \u201cmost closely competitive seller.\u201d As there was undisputed evidence that during March 1942 Regens was not the only jobber, it was necessary, in order to justify such an inference, also to show, as of that date, either (a) that Regens was the principal jobber; or (b) that Regens was, for other reasons, the \u201cmost closely competitive seller\u201d; or (c) that someone who occupied that status, or the jobbers selling most of such lighters, then sold below the price-range at which defendant later sold in 1943. The evidence does not establish, directly or indirectly, that Regens was the principal jobber; and, for all we know from the evidence, the great bulk of Regens-made lighters was sold during March 1942 by jobbers other than Regens at prices equal to, or above, those at which defendant sold in 1943. Proof that one jobber, Regens, sold at certain prices in March 1942 does not suffice to make out a prima facie case that that jobber was defendant\u2019s \u201cmost closely competitive seller,\u201d or that whatever jobber occupied that position sold at those prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Plaintiff suggests in effect that it is reasonable to infer that other jobbers did not sell above Regens\u2019 price as jobber because competition would necessarily keep the prices down <em>to </em>Regens\u2019 prices. That argument would be sound, (1) if Regens\u2019 supply had been plentiful during March 1942, and (2) if taost retailers had known of Regens\u2019 price. But the evidence is that, because of the restrictions imposed by the War Production Board, Regens\u2019 supply was not then plentiful. There is no evidence from which it may properly be inferred that Regens was then supplying most of the retailers or from which it can be ascertained to what extent the demand was being met by other jobbers; who had previously acquired RegenS-made lighters from Regens or from Regens\u2019 jobber-customers. Moreover, we find it impossible to believe, absent proof thereof, that the numerous scattered small retailers dealing in such a commodity then knew of Regens\u2019 prices; and there is no such proof. In addition, there is evidence that Regens-made lighters were then sold at retail at prices ranging from $2.75 to $5. each.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Plaintiff points to the evidence that Regens, as sole manufacturer, was the original source of supply, and that Regens, in making its sales to other jobbers, endeavored to have them resell to retailers at not above $7.20 a dozen, and also to have them arrange with retailers that the retail price was to be maintained at approximately $1.00 a piece. But from those facts one cannot reasonably infer that in March 1942 such other Jobbers \u2014 and therefore defendant\u2019s \u201cmost closely competitive seller\u201d\u2014 sold at a range less than $2.75 to $3.75 each. For anyone who bought from Regens was free to sell at any price he chose to jobbers or retailers, since Regens imposed no contractual obligations as to resale prices, and the record contains no evidence that its efforts to maintain prices were successful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Plaintiff asserts that data showing the prices in March 1942 of the defendant\u2019s \u201cmost closely competitive seller\u201d were peculiarly accessible to defendant. Whether that is true may perhaps be doubted, considering plaintiff\u2019s statutory powers to obtain evidence, from all sellers. But assuming arguendo that the data were .peculiarly available to defendant, we still could not agree that defendant had either the burden of proof or of \u201cgoing forward.\u201d Nor do we regard as apposite cases cited by plaintiff such as Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 66 S.Ct. 1187. In such cases, the plaintiff proved that defendant had violated a legal duty owed to the plaintiff, but, because of the nature of defendant\u2019s wrong, the plaintiff was unable to show the amount of the resultant damages; the \u201cfact\u201d that damages occurred was certain.'but-uncertainty existed as to their amount; in those circumstances, the amount of the damages may be estimated \u201cUpon probable and inferential as well as direct and positive <em>proof.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the instant case we do not reach the question of the amount of damages, since the plaintiff did not show that the defendant had done the wrong of which plaintiff complains, i.e., charged prices in violation of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\"> That defendant violated the regulations in not preparing the required \u201cbase period statement\u201d is. not here material. For that violation the statutory remedy was an injunction; such an injunction issued. That defendant used an improper method in determining its prices is not proof that its prices were excessive. Injunction constitutes the remedy against wrong pricing-methods; an action for damages, like that here, for excessive prices. Even if defendant had thrown dice to arrive at its prices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>they might nevertheless have been no higher than those of the most closely competitive seller. To prove that they were higher was plaintiff\u2019s burden, and that burden it did not discharge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We conclude that, on the evidence, judgment should not have been entered against defendant. However, \u201cin order that injustice may not be done,\u201d we reverse and remand so that plaintiff, if he so desires, may try to offer further proof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since, as a consequence of such further proof, the judge may find that defendant overcharged, we think it desirable to make this comment concerning the assessment of treble damages: Assuming, arguendo, that we have any authority to review as to such an issue, we think that, had there been proof of overcharges by defendant, the judge would not have abused his discretion in assessing treble damages, in the light of defendant\u2019s method of arriving at his prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\"> Regens\u2019 letter of February 2, 1942, sent to certain jobbers, merely expressed a hope or wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Regens\u2019 advertisement published in October 1943, which expressed a similar desire, is, of course, not relevant as to prices in March 1942.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> Story Parchment Co. v.
