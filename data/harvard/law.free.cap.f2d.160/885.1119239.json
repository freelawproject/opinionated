The issue presented was whether the taxpayer was entitled under section 23(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 23(b), to deduct interest accrued within the taxable years on its outstanding debentures. The Tax Court denied deduction on the ground that the evidence did not show that \u201cthe debentures were, or were intended ta be, evidences of indebtedness\u201d; they were \u201cmore nearly like preferred stock than indebtedness.\u201d These conclusions are not within the scope of our judicial review. John Kelley Co. v. Commissioner, 326 U. S. 521, 698, 66 S.Ct. 299; Elliott-Lewis Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 154 F.2d 292. We may add, however, that, if the question were open to us, we should reach the same result as did the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-24\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
