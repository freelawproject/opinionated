Trial was had. On December 11, 1945, a memorandum opinion was filed by the District Court in which the Court stated, inter alia: \u201cDamages denied. Petition for injunction granted.\u201d Thereafter on January 3, 1946, a final decree was entered which, after reciting that the parties had agreed that the memorandum opinion should serve as findings of fact and conclusions'of law, enjoined appellee from selling garments above ceiling prices, but the decree contained no provision with respect to the claim for damages. On March 25, 1946, the Price Administrator appealed \u201cfrom that portion of the judgment of this Court which denied the Administrator relief under Section 205(e) [i. e., damages] of. the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 925(e), entered on the. 3rd day of January 1946, in favor of Jo Van Der Loo against Paul A. Porter\u2019s predecessor as Administrator of the Office of Price Administration, Chester Bowles.\u201d <em>\u2019\u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-27\">There has been no judgment entered upon the claim for damages.
