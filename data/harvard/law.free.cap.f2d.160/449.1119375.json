It employs several thousand persons in the manufacture of wood pulp, paper, various paper products, and chemicals, a large proportion of which it ships in interstate commerce. The Board\u2019s jurisdiction in the premises under \u00a7 10(a) and \u00a7 2(6, 7) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>160(a) and 152(6, 7), cannot be successfully disputed and in fact is stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The Board\u2019s action rests upon a charge made by the Regional Director in Boston of United Mine Workers of America District 50. In its complaint based upon this charge the Board alleged in substance that the respondent on or about October 3, 1944, warned certain of its employees that working conditions would be \u201cworsened\u201d if the Union won an election then pending among certain of its employees and on or about January 11, 1945, warned certain of its employees not to vote in that election, and, in addition, that since November 5, 1944 it had assisted, dominated, encouraged, contributed to the support of and interfered with the administration of the Brown Company Office Workers Association in six specified ways. It is alleged specifically that the respondent (1) permitted its supervisory employees to be active in the formation of the Association, (2) permitted them to solicit membership therein, (3) permitted the solicitation of memberships in the Association on Company time and prop^ erty, (4) permitted certain of its employees to take time away from their work for the purpose of soliciting mei\u00f1berships in the Association, (5) permitted the use of its office facilities, including its telephone system and photostatic equipment, for the purpose of aiding the Association and carrying on its business, and (6) suggested to certain of its employees that they consult an attorney named by it for the purpose of procuring advice as to the formation of the Association. The Association was allowed to intervene at the hearing held on this complaint before a trial examiner. Only the Board elected to call witnesses at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Following the hearing the trial examiner dismissed the complaint for lack of supporting evidence insofar as it charged that the respondent had warned some of its employees that working conditions would deteriorate in the event that the Union won an election then pending ajid had warned certain of its employees that they should not vote for the Union in. that election. The trial examiner found, however, that the respondent had been guilty of unfair labor practices as defined in \u00a7 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157, by reason of assistance and support given by it to the Brown Company Office Workers Association. With one exception to be noted hereafter the Board adopted the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the trial examiner and affirmed his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The facts may be stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">United Mine Workers of America, District 50, A.F. of L., hereinafter referred to as the Union, organized the respondent\u2019s production and maintenance workers during 1940, and since 1941 it has represented and bargained with the Brown Company for that group of employees through an affiliate, Pulp, Sulphite and Chemical Workers Local Union No. 12175. Early in 1944 the Union organized the respondent\u2019s pulp wood truck drivers and it has represented them ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">There is no evidence that the Brown Company was in the slightest degree hostile to the Union at any time during the above 5 year period. On the contrary the president of the loeal union, when testifying as a witness for the Board in the \u00a7 10(b) proceedings underlying this petition said, and his testimony was neither contradicted nor questioned, that during that entire time, the respondent had never interfered with the Union\u2019s organizing activities; that after the establishment of the Union it had frequently consulted with the Union when it was under no contractual obligation to do so; and that there had always been \u201can attitude of mutual respect and confidence\u201d and \u201can attitude of friendly cooperation\u201d between the officers of the Union on the one hand and the management of the respondent on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">During the summer of 1944, following its organization of the respondent\u2019s pulp wood truck drivers, the Union took a few tentative steps toward organizing the respondent\u2019s office workers. In this group there were some 270 persons divided into 29 departments scattered throughout the various units of the respondent\u2019s plant which extends over an area some three miles in length. Each department was under the supervision of a department head and some of the departments in addition had assistant department heads. The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>contends that there were 19 persons who should properly be classified in this latter sub-category. It may be conceded that all 48 of these officials (department heads and assistant department heads) as a practical matter had the power to bring about the discharge of rank and file employees in their respective departments, although actual discharge was handled by the respondent\u2019s personnel director. It follows that all of them are to be classified as supervisory officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">We must infer, however, in spite of their somewhat high sounding titles, that they were \u201cnot high in the .factory hierarchy.\u201d International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, 311 U.S. 72, 80, 61 S.Ct. 83, 89, 85 L.Ed. 50. There were too many of them in proportion to the number of persons in the office worker group to warrant any other inference, (as one of the office workers testified \u201cThe place is full of supervisors\u201d) and there is no evidence that they had anything to do with formulating the respondent\u2019s corporate policy but were only entrusted with the allocation of work and other administrative details within their respective departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The order which the Board here seeks to have us enforce rests upon inferences drawn by the Board from findings made by it with respect to the participation of some of these supervisory officials in the organization of the Brown Company Office Workers Association which we shall now proceed to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The organizational activities of the Union with reference to the respondent\u2019s office workers, which began in the summer of 1944, culminated, and so far as the present record is concerned ended, with a meeting called by it on November 5. Notice of this meeting was given three days in advance by means of letters sent by the officers of the local union, who styled themselves therein the \u201cOrganizing Committee of the Brown Company,\u201d to some 50 or 60 office workers of their selection. In these letters, after giving the date and place of the meeting, its purpose was stated to be \u201cto acquaint you with your rights under the National Labor Relations Act.\u201d Following this some advantages of organization under the banner of the Union were suggested, and the letters closed with the request: \u201cPlease make a very special effort to attend this important conference and if possible bring an office worker friend with you that may not have received this invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">The Board found that immediately following this announcement by the Union two admittedly rank and file office workers named Tourangeau and Oleson, neither of whom had received the Union\u2019s letter, \u201copenly, on the respondent\u2019s time and property, with full knowledge of the respondent\u2019s supervisors, embarked on a campaign designed to frustrate the Union.\u201d It found that approximately 175 of the respondent\u2019s office workers attended this meeting; that it was \u201c \u2018packed\u2019 with anti-union elements\u201d; and that among those in attendance were supervisory officials \u201cincluding the head of its accounting department, other department heads and various assistant department heads.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only evidence in the record, however, is that only two supervisory officials attended \u2014 one the head of the accounting department and the other one of two female supervisors of the stenographic pool- \u2014 and there is no evidence that either of them were more than passive observers.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Some of the rank and file office employees, however, particularly Tourangeau and Oleson, were outspoken at this meeting in opposition to the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The Board found that during the meeting both of the latter asked questions of the chairman which indicated their hostility to the Union, and 'that eventually Oleson offered a motion to the effect that it was the sense of the gathering not to affiliate with the Union. On the refusal of the chair to entertain this motion the meeting broke up. Immediately thereafter a small group of office workers headed by Tourangeau and Oleson met at the latter\u2019s house and decided to form an independent labor organization. There is no evidence or find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ing that any supervisory official suggested this gathering, attended it, or had anything whatever to do with it <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the following day Tourganeau and Oleson prepared a letter setting forth their aims which we reproduce in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This letter was printed at Tourganeau\u2019s expense and distributed the next day under circumstances to be described presently.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">On the day the letter was written (November 6) Tourangeau and Oleson called upon the respondent\u2019s resident attorney, told him that they intended to form an independent labor organization, and sought his advice and guidance. They were told by the attorney that since he represented the respondent he could not advise them but he suggested that they retain counsel. Apparently several if not all of the members of the local bar were named in the course of the discussion which followed, but .there is no evidence or finding that any particular one was singled) out for recommendation. The Association subsequently retained the City Solicitor of Berlin who had no connection whatever with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">On November 7 Tourangeau and Oleson and the latter\u2019s brother Warren, also a rank and file office worker, prepared a petition worded \u201cWe, the undersigned, are desirous of forming a local office workers Protective Association.\u201d It appears that this petition was drawn by Warren Oleson in the respondent\u2019s office during working time. Then Tourangeau and Oleson, assisted by Warren Oleson, at once began to circulate separate copies of the petition for signature by the office employees, and as they circulated the petition they also distributed copies of the letter which had been printed the preceding day.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Solicitation was open, during working hours, and with full knowledge of supervision. At first it was on the respondent\u2019s time, but later in the day the solicitors were told by their supervisors to circulate the petition on their own time. They immediately asked for time off, their request was granted, and they then proceeded as before with their circulation of the petition. It appears that the solicitors\u2019 time off was not deducted from their pay, but that they were required to make it up, that this was in accordance with respondent\u2019s customary practice whenever office workers requested and were given time off to attend to their personal affairs. Furthermore it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>appears that ordinarily office workers were given time off whenever they asked for it. The petition was openly circulated throughout the various buildings of the respondent\u2019s plant, contact with employees being made while at their work, and the solicitors were neither stopped, reprimanded, nor interfered with in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">From November 7 to November 9 the circulators of the petition obtained the signatures of about 250 employees, including seven department heads and 12<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> assistant department heads. One department head asked to be allowed to sign the petition;\u2014 the others all signed upon solicitation by some rank and file office worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">On November 9 a general meeting of the signers of the petition and other office employees of the respondent was held for the purpose of perfecting the Association\u2019s organization. The Board found that some of the supervisors who signed the petition were present at this meeting; that the petition was used as a roll, the names being read and a record of attendance made; and that Tourangeau and Oleson were elected co-chairman of the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">After this meeting, on November 18, pursuant to appointment, the officers of the Association and their attorney met with representatives of the .respondent\u2019s management for the express purpose of obtaining recognition. The original petition, fully signed, was presented as evidence of the Association\u2019s majority, but the respondent, objecting to the presence of some of its supervisory employees in the Association\u2019s membership, refused to recognize it until it had been certified by the Board. The Association has never been certified and the Board found that the respondent has never either recognized the Association or dealt with it in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Following this conference the Association on November 24 circulated a second petition prepared by its attorney in the form ordinarily used in New Hampshire in the formation of a voluntary corporation not organized for profit (R.L.N.H. Ch. 272) entitled \u201cArticles of Agreement\u2014 Brown Company Office Workers\u2019 Association.\u201d The Board found that this petition was circulated and signatures to it were obtained by the same methods used when the first petition was circulated, and that, notwithstanding the respondent\u2019s objection to the fact that some of its supervisory officials\u2019 names appeared on the first petition, a majority of the supervisors who signed the first petition also signed the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">On January 4, 1945, the Association held a formal meeting at which officers were elected, and at this meeting two of the respondent\u2019s supervisory officials participated to the extent of each moving the election' of a director. It does not appear that any supervisory official ever held office in the Association or ever, either directly or indirectly, influenced or attempted to influence its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">The only evidence having any tendency to show hostility on the part of any supervisory official to the Union is certain testimony of the President of the Local Union with reference to a conversation he had with Alfred Watt, the respondent\u2019s personnel director, which the trial examiner referred to in a footnote appended to his report. It appears from this footnote that one Robert Murphy, who had been a production worker and as such a member of the Union, had at his own request been transferred by the respondent to office work and that after his transfer had retained his Union membership. It does not appear that the respondent objected to his remaining a member of the Union, but the local union\u2019s president when asked to report a conversation he had with Alfred Watt in the latter\u2019s office said: \u201cMerely we mentioned the office workers\u2019 organization, as I recall it, and A1 said he didn\u2019t think it was quite proper or quite right for Bob Murphy to help to organize the office workers under the United Mine Workers after the way the company treated Bob in giving him an office job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>On the basis of the foregoing, the Board, affirming the trial examiner,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concluded \"that the respondent has dominated and interfered with- the formation and administration of the Brown Company Office Workers\u2019 Association, Incorporated, and has contributed support thereto, and that thereby the respondent has interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The question presented is whether the foregoing finding rests upon substantial evidence. A careful study of the record leads us to the conclusion that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In the first place no ultimate finding of an unfair labor practice can properly be predicated upon the subsidiary finding that the respondent permitted the Association to organize in its plant, on its time, and with the aid of its telephone and other facilities. The reason for this is that there is no evidence that the Union requested and was denied similar privileges, and there is clear and undisputed evidence that the respondent gave the Union in its organization of the production and maintenance workers and pulp wood track drivers the identical privileges which it later extended to the Association when it organized the office workers. Both the Association and the Union are conceded to be labor organizations and as such under the Act the respondent must accord them the same treatment. Ballston-Stillwater Knitting Co. v. Labor Board, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 758, 762. Certainly it cannot be said that when the respondent gave the rival labor\" organizations equal privileges, it disobeyed the Act by favoring one of them over the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In the second place there is no finding, or evidence to support a finding, that the respondent or any of its supervisory officials had ever adopted a hostile attitude either toward unions in general or toward outside unions in particular. There is no evidence that the respondent ever spied upon the Union or interfered in any way with its organizational or other activities, or that it had ever discharged, demoted, discriminated against, threatened, censured or even criticized any employee for joining the Union or promoting its interests. Furthermore it has never recognized the Association. There is only evidence from which it might be inferred that Tourangeau and Oleson, and possibly some others in their grade of employment, were hostile to outside unions. But concededly these opponents of the Union were all rank and file employees and as such their attitude is not attributable to Ihe respondent. In fact their hostility to the Union was a matter with which the respondent could not concern itself without violating the Act. The only testimony having the slightest tendency to indicate Union hostility on the part of any supervisory official is that of the Union\u2019s president with reference to his conversation about Bob Murphy with the respondent\u2019s personnel director to which we have already referred. But at the most the statement attributed to the latter is colorless, (the trial examiner evidently so regarded it.since he referred to it only in a footnote, and then only as evidence without using it as the basis for a finding) and furthermore the statement fades into insignificance in the light of the Union president\u2019s testimony that his relations with the respondent\u2019s personnel director on Union matters had always been of the \u201cvery best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"abx-dedup-0\">On the other hand there is clear, abundant and uncontradicted positive evidence that from the beginning the respondent had consistently shown a friendly and cooperative spirit in its dealings with the Union and its officers. On such a record as this, since \u201cThe employer\u2019s attitude toward unions is relevant\u201d (N.L.R.B. v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584-588, 61 S.Ct. 358, 361, 85 L.Ed. 368), we feel that in spite of the Board\u2019s refusal on request to make a positive finding we must conclude that the respondent\u2019s attitude towards unions in general and the outside Union here involved in particular has always been friendly, or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>least neutral. Thus the specific acts of the respondent\u2019s supervisory officials, to which we now turn, which the Board found to have constituted unfair labor practices, must be viewed against a background of five years of harmonious relations with the charging Union.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">At this point it is to be borne in mind that there is no evidence or finding that any supervisory official either opposed the Union\u2019s organizational activities or advocated the formation of the Association. If attendance at the Union\u2019s meeting of November 5 was drummed up, and if that meeting was \u201c \u2018packed\u2019 with anti-union elements\u201d that was the work of rank and file employees, particularly the work of Tourangeau and Oleson. And the idea of forming the Association was also theirs. In view of the respondent\u2019s friendly relations with the Union, there is not even room for the inference that in doing what they did Tourangeau and Oleson hoped to curry favor with the respondent. For all that appears both men acted independently and on their own initiative in opposing the Union and advocating the Association. It is therefore clear that no conclusion of interference by the respondent with its employees\u2019 right id self-organization can rest upon the activities of these two men.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Furthermore is must be borne in mind that there is no evidence, or finding, that any supervisory official ever solicited memberships in the Association or even spoke in favor of it. Thus all that appears is that two supervisors of the respondent\u2019s office workers, without objection, attended the Union\u2019s meeting of November 5 but took no part in it, and that approximately one-third of these supervisory officials passively participated in the formation of the Association by signing petitions circulated by rank and file workers \u2014 one signing at his own request and the others upon solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The Board contends that special significance derives from the positions in which some of the supervisors\u2019 names appear on the petitions. It is true that one supervisor signed under Maurice Oleson\u2019s name at the top of one petition, that another supervisor signed fifth on another copy of it, and that the names of two supervisors appear first and second on still a third copy of the petition. But it is to be noted that their signatures on this third copy of the petition were not on the petition itself, but on a sheet without heading attached thereto for the accommodation of additional signatures. The places in which the supervisors signed seem to us of trifling importance. What is important is that they signed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Perhaps as an abstract proposition it might be inferred that signatures of supervisory officials on petitions like those circulated by Tourangeau and Oleson would have some tendency to influence rank and file employees to sign also. But \u00a7 8 (1, 2) of the Act uses stronger words than \u201cinfluence\u201d. It condemns as unfair labor practices \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce\u201d employees in the exercise of the right given to them by \u00a7 7 of the Act to form, join or assist labor organizations of their own choosing, and \u201cto dominate or interfere with\u201d the formation or administration of such an organization. Furthermore acts of supervisory officials are not to be viewed in vacuo. Instead they are to be \u201ctaken in their setting\u201d (N.L.R.B. v. LinkBelt Co., supra, 311 U.S. 599, 61 S.Ct. 366, 85 L.Ed. 368) and so taken we think the inference drawn by the Board from the acts of the respondent\u2019s supervisory employees is too tenuous to constitute substantial evidence that the rank and file office workers were even influenced to join the Association. That is to say, we think the fact that some of the respondent\u2019s supervisors signed the petitions, standing by itself against a background of years of harmonious if not cordial relations between the respondent and the Union, cannot in reason be regarded as substantial evidence of an unfair labor practice. Instead we think the supervisors\u2019 signatures can at the most be considered as constituting only a scintilla of evidence, or as only evidence enough to raise a suspicion, (N.L.R.B. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Columbian Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660) that the office workers in. fact were influenced, to say nothing of interfered with, restrained, coerced or dominated, by the respondent in their choice of a labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Decided cases bear out this conclusion. Naturally cases of this sort vary greatly on their facts and so of necessity each one must be decided largely as an individual instance. Nevertheless it seems to us pertinent to note that there has come to our attention no case involving acts of supervisory officials in which a court has enforced or affirmed a cease and desist order of the Board except cases in which there was either a record of hostility toward the outside union, or else evidence of discriminatory discharges or of active solicitation by supervisors, or some other pointed indication of the employer\u2019s anti-union sentiment. See International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Labor Board, 311 U.S. 72, 61 S.Ct. 83, 85 L.Ed. 50; H. J. Heinz Co. v. Labor Board, 311 U.S. 514, 61 S.Ct. 320, 85 L.Ed. 309; National Labor Board v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368; New Idea v. Labor Board, 7 Cir., 117 F.2d 517; National Labor Board v. Moench Tanning Co., 2 Cir., 121 F.2d 951; National Labor Board v.

Clemens Pottery Co., 6 Cir., 147 F. 2d 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On the other hand, there are cases in which courts have refused to enforce Board orders in situations comparable to the present even though there had been, as there were not here, isolated instances of aggressive anti-union activity by supervisory officers. See National Labor Board v. Swank Products, Inc., 3 Cir., 108 F.2d 872; National Labor Board v. Mathieson Alkali Works, 4 Cir., 114 F.2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The case closest to the present on the facts which has come to our notice is National Labor Board v. Sun Shipbuilding, etc., Co., 135 F.2d 15, and in it the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit refused to enforce the order of the Board. In so far as any other decision is authority, this is, and on it as well as for the reasons stated in this opinion we conclude that in the exercise of our powers under the Act we ought not to enter a decree enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">A decree will be entered dismissing the Board\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\"> It appears that the presence of these supervisory officials at the meeting was known to the Union organizers, but it does not appear that they objected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\"> Tourangeau and Oleson both testified, <em>but the </em>Board, although requested, declined to find, that their reason for calling this gathering was antagonism to the Union for the reason that one of its out of town speakers after the meeting said to them, and to some other office workers standing near them in a group, that the Union was going to organize (hem whether they liked it or not.

The threat to us, in deliberately pointing at us and saying, \u2018'Whether or not you like it, we will go ahead and organize you.\u2019 We took it as a threat.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b504-14\"> \u201cNovember 6, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"AbS6\">\u201cFellow Co-Worker:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">\u201cA United Mine Workers meeting was held at the Costello Hotel Sunday afternoon at three o\u2019clock. The union presented their policies, which offered the salaried office worker nothing. It appeared to be the impression of the majority of those attending the meeting that the Union fee of one dollar a month or twelve dollars a year, of which 75% goes to the national headquarters, would be wasted.</p>\n<p id=\"aya-dedup-0\">\u201cWe therefore feel that in order to better protect and maintain present benefits and advantages, of which we are interested in locally, that it would be to our best interests to form a protective group interested solely in our problems. This group would meet and elect a committee who would serve as representatives of the office workers. This group would function if and when an individual wishes the handling of his or her case through the usual procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">\u201cThe cost of such an organization of our own would be nominal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-19\">\u201cAlfred Tourangeau</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">\u201cMaurice Oleson.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\"> It may be that 3 others with powers equal to assistant department heads should be added to this number. The record is not clear. But in the view we take this is unimportant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> It corrected one of his findings, however. The trial examiner found that the Association had made no provision for the collection of dues but had obtained funds through a bank loan endorsed by \u00bb. opondent\u2019s officers and its attorney. The Board referred to this finding as inadvertent and corrected it by saying, \u201cHowever, the record shows and we find that the loan was endorsed by the officers and attorney of the Association and not those of the respondent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> We pass, as counsel for the Board has passed, the allegation with respect to the recommendation hy the respondent of a particular attorney to represent the Association since it is obvious from the evidence that the respondent only advised the officers of the Association to obtain legal advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b508-9\">FORD, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AtM\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">I find myself in disagreement with my colleagues and must dissent for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The principal issue before the Board was whether the employees had just cause to believe that the supervisors were acting for and on behalf of the management. Cf. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Labor Board, 311 U.S. 72, 80, 61 S.Ct. 83, 85 L. Ed. 50. Admittedly, the employer\u2019s opposition to unionism has generally been one of the factors on Which the Board has based its order in this type of case. So where an employer has previously complied with the provisions and spirit of the Wagner Act, there is absent a common basis for an inference that the employees had just cause for such a belief. But there may be other bases. For the strict \u201chands off\u201d policy enunciated by the Supreme Court in the International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, 311 U.S. 72, 61 S.Ct. 83, 85 L.Ed. 50, H. J. Heinz Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, <em>311 </em>U.S. 514, 61 S.Ct. 320, 85 L.Ed. 309, and National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368, cases cited in the majority opinion, embraces all labor organization, whether conducted against a background of peaceful or antagonistic labor relations. In those cases there existed the definite possibility that the minor supervisory employees, <em>none </em>of whom had the power to hire and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>fire, were acting individually as prospective union members and not as representatives of the management. The chief significance of the employers\u2019 anti-union attitude was in linking the activities of the minor supervisory employees to the management. Here we have a different situation. Recommendations for discharge by eight of the active supervisors were unquestioned by the management. Surely none of these men was a prospective proper member of a union of office workers. Therefore, the respondent\u2019s attitude while concededly benevolent toward the unionization of its factory workers, is less significant than in the Supreme Court cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">In International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Labor Board, 311 U.S. page 80, 61 S.Ct. 88, 85 L.Ed. 50, Mr. Justice Douglas cautioned that subtle factors may restrain the \u201ccomplete and unhampered freedom of choice which the Act contemplates.\u201d The respondent\u2019s supervisory employees seem by their conduct to have exerted such subtle 'restraint in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The ratio of supervisors to office workers signing the first petition was 1 to 13. Eight of them had the authority to effect the immediate discharge of their subordinates ; the remaining eleven had the power to recommend discharges. All but one attended the first organizational meeting, held after 247 of the 269 office workers had been signed up within two or three days. Their very presence would have the tendency to restrain the employees\u2019 choice and thus affect the employees\u2019 rights of self-organization. After all, the question of interference or coercion should be looked at from the employees\u2019 standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">It is true that when the bargaining committee of the Association presented the petition to respondent for the purpose of obtaining recognition, respondent objected to the membership of department heads, supervisors in the stenographic pool, and certain other confidential employees. But a week later, 15 supervisors signed the \u201cArticles of Agreement\u201d. Five weeks thereafter, supervisors moved the nomination of two directors at a meeting to elect the Association\u2019s officers and directors. At no time did the respondent declare its neutrality to the employees as a whole. These facts might well persuade the ordinary employee, having in mind the actual authority of the supervisors, that their participation in the formation of the Association had the approval of the management. H. J. Heinz Co. v. Labor Board, supra, 311 U.S. page 521, 61 S.Ct. 320, 85 L.Ed. 309; National Labor Board v. Link-Belt Co., supra, 311 U.S. page 599, 61 S.Ct 358, 85 L.Ed. 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Our scope of review here is narrow and it is my view there was substantial support in the evidence for the finding of the Board that the respondent has interfered with its employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act and is thereby guilty of an unfair labor practice as defined by Section 8(1) of the Act. I would enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
