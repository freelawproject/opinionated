This right of set-off is subject to the condition that, if one third of the \u201ccargo damage claims\u201d is greater than that value to which the Conners Company may limit its liability, the amount of the set-off will be correspondingly limited. The right of the Conners Company so to limit its liability may be litigated before the commissioner in this proceeding. So far as the Conners Company succeeds in limiting the right of set-off of the Carroll Company against it, the Carroll Company\u2019s right o fset-off against the Grace Line will be increased by half the amount by which the right of limitation of the Conners Company has reduced the set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Should the value of the tug, \u201cCarroll,\u201d prove not to be enough to pay the \u201ccargo damage claims\u201d and the claims of the Grace Line and the Conners Company, the commissioner will determine the proper distribution of the fund and any incidental questions that may\u2019 arise. These questions have not been argued and may never arise; we will not consider them at the present stage of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The costs of the appeal in the limitation proceeding and of the appeal in the libel of the Conners Company, will be added together, and one third of the sum will be borne by the Carroll Company, the Grace Line and the Conners Company, each.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">By \u201ccargo damage claims\u201d we mean the claim of the United States for the loss of its flour, which the Pennsylvania Railroad has paid, and the proper award to the railroad as salvor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
