Thereafter, on May 10, 1945, appellee commenced this action, claiming that, prior to the payment of the $8,200, the amount due him under the policy was $30,695,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the amount due him after crediting the payment was $22,495. He prayed judgment for that amount, with interest from May 9, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-26\">The complaint alleged that the destroyed articles were in storage rooms of appellee when destroyed. The answer denied this allegation. The District Court found that 75% of the. destroyed articles were in a storage room of appellee when destroyed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>This finding is challenged by appellant and is clearly erroneous. The evidence shows that none of the destroyed articles was in a storage room when destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Appellee's storage room \u2014 the only one he had \u2014 was on the second floor of the Barnes-Woodin building. The destroyed articles were not on the second floor, but were on the mezzanine floor of the BarnesWoodin building when destroyed. The mezzanine floor was not, nor was any part thereof, a storage room, within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">A part of the mezzanine floor was used by appellee in cleaning, repairing, altering and remodeling furs and garments trimmed with fur. In his testimony, appellee called that part of the mezzanine floor a work room. A part of the mezzanine floor was occupied by racks on which appellee hung furs and garments trimmed with fur which had been or were to be cleaned, repaired, altered or remodeled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his testimony, appellee called that part of the mezzanine floor a storage room. Actually, the part which he called a work room and the part which he called a storage room were one and the same room, there being no door or partition between them; and, regardless of appellee\u2019s characterization of them, neither part was a storage room within the meaning of the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">The evidence shows that all of the destroyed articles were outside of storage rooms, vaults and safes when destroyed. Therefore, prior to the payment of the $8,200 mentioned above, appellant was liable under the policy for $10,000, with interest from May 9, 1944, and no more. After that payment, appellant was liable for a balance of $1,800, with interest as aforesaid. The answer admitted that appellant was liable for $1,800, but, in a so-called counterclaim for interpleader, alleged that Harbin, McClure, Ray, Riggs and Smith were claiming to be entitled to, and had demanded, payment from appellant under the policy, and that appellant was therefore in doubt as to who was entitled to the $1,800. These allegations were denied and not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Appellant did not, in its so-called counter-claim for interpleader, set up any matter entitling it to proceed under \u00a7 24(26) (e) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(26) (e), or under Rule 22(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S. C.A. following section 723c. It did, however, obtain an order making Harbin, McClure, Ray, Riggs and Smith third-party defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They were served - with process, but defaulted. The judgment declares that they are barred and enjoined from asserting any claim against appellant or appellee \u201cfor any loss suffered from the loss of furs, fur coats or articles trimmed with furs, in that certain fire in the BarnesWoodin Fur Department<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on May 9, 1944.\u201d That part of the judgment is not challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">Appellant\u2019s brief states that, prior to the trial, it \u201cserved upon appellee an offer of judgment in said sum [of $1,800], which was not accepted.\u201d The brief does not state that the offer was served more than 10 days before the trial began.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record does not show that it was served at all. Appellee was therefore entitled to his costs in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">The judgment is modified by reducing the principal amount thereof to $1,800 and, as thus modified, is affirmed; appellant to recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-22\">Appellee did business as Barnes-Woodin Fur Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-27\"> Instead of the $29,785 claimed in the proof of loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b993-8\"> Some of the destroyed articles were on the racks when destroyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\"> Cf.
