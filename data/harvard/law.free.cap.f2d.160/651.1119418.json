Porter, Administrator of the Office of Price Administration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this action against J. E. Baggett, a used car dealer, doing business as Rex Motors, to recover statutory damages for past violations and to enjoin future violations of Maximum Price Regulation 540, 9 FR 6434 (pertaining to the sales of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment) issued under Section 2(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, 58 Stat. 632, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 et seq. After the action was filed the Administrator consented to the intervention of appellee, W. C. Allred, and disclaimed any right of recovery for the alleged \u201cover ceiling\u201d sale made to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-20\">Maximum Price Regulation 540, as amended March 1, 1945, contained the following provisions at the time material to this action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-21\">\u201cSec. 15. Definitions. When used in this regulation, the term: * * * \u2018Dealer\u2019 is a person who has received an order from the Office of Price Administration authorizing him to charge for a warranted used car defined in section 7 a warranted maximum price permitted by section 5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-23\">\u201c(v) Requirements for grant of application by District Director. An application for authorization to sell as a dealer shall be granted if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201c(a) The applicant is generally engaged in the business of acquiring for sale, selling, displaying, repairing and reconditioning used cars; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">\u201c(b) The applicant has a place for selling and displaying used cars; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">\u201c(c) The applicant has a shop and equipment for reconditioning and repairing which in general are adequate for placing used cars in good operating condition as defined in section 7(b) and for fulfilling the terms of the warranty in section 7(c). * * * but,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">\u201c(d) In the case of an applicant who does not have the facilities described in (c) above, as a substitute for them, he may have a working arrangement, evidenced by a written contract, with a service supplier, who has the adequate reconditioning and repairing facilities described in (c) above, whereby the service supplier will perform the reconditioning and make the replacements the applicant, as a dealer, is required to make to place a used car in good operating condition as defined in section 7(b) or to fulfill the terms of the warranty in section 7(c); * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">\u201cSec. 7. * * * A warranted used car is a used car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\u201c(1) Which is in good operating condition as defined in paragraph (b) ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">\u201c(2) For which a dealer (as defined in section 15(b)) furnishes in writing to his purchaser at the time of sale the warranty [prescribed by the regulation]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">\u201c(3) In the case of a dealer who does not have adequate facilities for repairing or reconditioning used cars, it shall be a used car which, in addition to satisfying the conditions of (1) and (2), is one for which the service supplier that makes the repairs or replacements for the dealer in accordance with section 15(b) guarantees in writing the making of the repairs or replacements the dealer is obliged to make under his warranty. The guaranty shall be made in the manner [prescribed by the regulation] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\">\u201c(d) Service supplier\u2019s guaranty. The guaranty which a service supplier shall furnish in connection with the sale of a warranted used car shall be a part of the same document that contains the \u2018Dealer\u2019s Warranty\u2019 for such a used car, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">During the time of the alleged violations Baggett was an authorized dealer in used automobiles, having been approved as a dealer by the Office of Price Administration. He did not have adequate facilities to repair and recondition used cars, as required by Section 7(c), but he had been approved as a dealer after furnishing satisfactory evidence, provided in Section 15 (d), that he was in a financial position to maintain a working arrangement with a service supplier for reconditioning and repairing used automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">Acting as an authorized dealer, Baggett made the sales which are the basis of this suit. The cars were sold as \u201cwarranted used cars\u201d and the maximum , price allowed under Section 5 was received for each car. When the sales were made Bag-gett signed the warranty as dealer. He did not, however, secure the written warranty of his service supplier, as required by Section 7(3), but executed the same in his own name or in his trade name, Rex Motors. The Administrator contends that since Baggett did not secure the written guaranty of his service supplier, the cars were not \u201cwarranted used cars\u201d and any price charged over and above the maximum price permitted for a \u201cnon-warranted\u201d car was an overcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">The trial court found that the functional and non-functional parts of each car sold had been in good operating condition, and that any car which had been returned to appellant during the time specified in the warranty was repaired and reconditioned as required by the written warranty. But, the court also found that appellant was not qualified under his dealer\u2019s authority to act as his own service supplier, and that his individual equipment for repairing and reconditioning used cars was insufficient to qualify him as a service supplier in fact. The record conclusively shows that the appellant had qualified as an authorized dealer with a \u201cservice supplier\u201d under Section 15(d). Accordingly, the court concluded that since the cars were sold with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>out the written warranty of the dealer\u2019s \u201cservice supplier\u201d they were not \u201cwarranted used cars\u201d within the definition of Section <em>7, </em>and the dealer was, therefore, not authorized to charge any sum in excess of the maximum price for a non-warranted car.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Appellant admits the alleged sales at \u201cwarranted used car\u201d prices, without the service supplier\u2019s written warranty. He contends, however, that since the cars were .warrantable as required by Section 7(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, and he had ample facilities in his own shop to repair each and every car he sold under warranty, and did properly repair and recondition each car returned for that purpose, he at least substantially complied with the Regulation, and the cars were therefore \u201cwarranted used cars\u201d within the definition of Section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"> In order for a dealer to be entitled to charge the warranted maximum price permitted by Section 5, the automobile must be a \u201cwarranted used car\u201d as defined by Section 7. Section 7 plainly defines a \u201cwarranted used car\u201d and the conditions under which an authorized dealer shall be permitted to charge the maximum warranted price. Admittedly, the appellant did not strictly comply with the Regulation. Whether he substantially complied, we have no occasion to decide, because it is now established beyond doubt that a strict compliance with Price Control Regulations is prerequisite to the right to charge the prices fixed by the regulation. Cf. Porter v. Rumsey, 10 Cir., 1947, 180 F.2d 159; Porter v. Nowak, 1 Cir., 157 F.2d 824; United States v. Stein, 2 Cir., 154 F. 2d 254; Bowles v. Murphy, D.C., 62 F. Supp. 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">If the Regulation seems harsh, and unreasonable, relief lies elsewhere. We have only the province and the duty to interpret, and, as interpreted, enforce it according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-13\"> Philip B.
