Defendant moved for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and again at the close of its evidence. These motions were denied. After the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and judgment was entered thereon, defendant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict which was denied. Defendant, as appellant here, urges that this action of the trial court was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-30\">Considering the case as we do, it presents a single question which can only be answered by an analysis of the evidence. If the evidence, construed most favorably to the plaintiffs, is insufficient to form \"a basis for a verdict for plaintiffs, the court erred in submitting the case to the jury. We agree with the contention presented by appellant that the court should have directed a verdict in its favor at the close of the evidence. While we are of opinion that defendant\u2019s motion made at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence should have been granted, defendant\u2019s introduction of evidence was a waiver of that motion and the court\u2019s failure to grant it cannot be alleged as error on appeal. See Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed. 1940) \u00a7 2496. However, defendant\u2019s evidence in no way strengthened plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>case and plaintiffs are in no better position as a result of it than they were at the termination of their own presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Appellant\u2019s streetcar was proceeding west in the 1200 block of C Street, Northeast, a one-way street thirty-two feet wide with a single streetcar track four feet eight inches wide laid in the center. Along side the south sidewalk and curb of the street was stacked furniture extending from in front of the premises 1209 C Street east to 1213 or 1215 C Street. Peggy Ann Gamble, an infant five years of age at the time of the accident, had been playing on the sidewalk along the south side of the street when she ran from the curb in front of the premises at 1209 C Street directly into the left front side of appellant\u2019s streetcar.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Mrs. Massicotte, plaintiffs\u2019 only eyewitness, testified that she was knocking at the door of 1209 C Street and that she turned around just in time to see the child \u201crun directly into the trolley car\u201d; that she saw the streetcar prior to the time it struck the child; that she \u201cknew she (the child) was going to be hit with the streetcar\u201d; that she wouldn\u2019t estimate how far away the streetcar was when she saw the child start from the curb but that in reference to the furniture piled on the sidewalk the \u201cstreetcar might have been about maybe around 1213, 1211; it wasn\u2019t very far\u201d; that the child was running fast; that when she saw the child run off the curb she knew she was going to be hit because the trolley car was so close; that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t escape if she was going to keep right on going\u201d; that she did not become aware of the fact that brakes on the streetcar were being applied until after the child was hit; that she didn\u2019t know how far the streetcar went after it struck the child before it came to a complete stop but that \u201cit didn\u2019t go very far.\u201d Other witnesses for plaintiffs who came upon the scene after the accident happened testified that the child was lying, with respect to the streetcar, \u201cjust to the rear of the front trucks\u201d, or \u201cabout mid-dleway of the car\u201d; that the width of the houses along the street was from 12 to 14 feet (the exact measurement was not given) ; that the rear of the streetcar when stopped was at 1215 C Street; that the streetcar was about 35 feet long.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We are of opinion that the evidence adduced by plaintiffs, considered with all the inferences which justifiably can be drawn from it in their favor, is not sufficient to properly support a verdict for them. \u201cWhen a plaintiff produces evidence that is consistent with an hypothesis that the defendant is not negligent, and also with one that he is, his proof tends to establish neither.\u201d Gunning v. Cooley, 281 U.S. 90, 50 S.Ct. 231, 232, 74 L.Ed. 720; Kelly Furniture Co. v. Washington Ry., 64 App.D.C. 215, 76 F.2d 985; Ewing v. Goode, C. C., 78 F. 442, 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> One undisputed fact which is entirely apart from the estimates by witnesses of speeds and distances, seems to answer the question of negligence by the motorman. The child, running fast, darted from behind the stack of furniture and ran a little less than thirteen feet into the side of the car just to the rear of its curved front. So the maximum time which the motorman had to avoid the accident was a little less than the time it took the child to run fast the thirteen feet. We say a little less time, because to avoid the accident he would have had to stop the car before it reached the spot where the child was, which, as we have said, was slightly to the rear of the front of the car. Anything less than a complete stop before the spot of the collision would have brought the child into the front of the car instead of into its side. We cannot see how the motorman could possibly be held to have been negligent in failing to stop in so brief a moment of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">It was strongly urged on the part of ap-pellee that a child of five could not be guilty of contributory negligence. There is conflict of authority on this point and we understand the rule to be that the question of the ability of a child of five to be guilty of contributory negligence depends on the child and the degree of intelligence it is shown to have possessed. But where, as here, the evidence as to primary negligence produced by the plaintiff is so weak that to submit it to a jury would be to allow them to speculate as to the defendant\u2019s negligence the question of contributory negligence does not enter and the court should rightfully exercise its lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>discretion and withhold that evidence from the jury. Appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict made at the conclusion of the evidence should have been granted. Failing this, the court should have granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The judgment is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint. See Cone v. West Virginia Pulp and Paper Co., 67 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
