MILLER, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b629-32\">The appellant, Mrs. Hazel Weber, seeks reversal of a judgment against her for $8,-000 awarded to Mrs. Gertrude M. Eaton, the appellee, by the District Court of the United States pursuant to the verdict of a jury. Mrs. Eaton was injured on the evening of February 22, 1944, while she was riding in Mrs. Weber\u2019s automobile on Wisconsin Avenue in the District of Columbia. Mrs. Weber was in Florida. Her husband, Herbert E. Weber, used his wife\u2019s car in calling- at the Westchester Apartments for Mrs. Eaton in order to take her to a dinner or bridge party to which they both testified they had been invited. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>raining, or had been raining, and the streets were wet and slick.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">After leaving the Westchester, Weber turned into Wisconsin Avenue and proceeded toward the south. While the car was traveling at what both he and Mrs. Eaton described as a moderate rate of speed, and just after passing a streetcar - which was moving in the same direction, the automobile suddenly turned or skidded in front of and was struck by the southbound streetcar, and almost immediately was hit by another streetcar which was northbound. The automobile was sandwiched in between the two cars and it was then that Mrs. Eaton was hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">She and Weber were taken to a hospital and Weber was released as soon as his injuries had been dressed. A police officer who was investigating the accident then returned him to the scene and there interrogated him. He testified, without objection, that when asked the reason for the odor of alcohol on his breath, Weber said he had taken two cocktails or two drinks just prior to the collision and, as the officer understood, at Mrs. Eaton\u2019s apartment. With reference to the accident, Weber first said that he thought he had struck the curb and skidded, but afterward said he did not know what happened. He acknowledged fault, the officer said, and asked him to \u201cjust forget the whole thing.\u201d Weber said from the witness stand that he was driving carefully, did not turn the wheel, and did not know what caused the car to skid.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Another police officer, who also noticed the odor of alcohol on his breath, testified, without objection, that Weber said he had had \u201ca couple of drinks\u201d at an \u201capartment with the lady who was in the car with him.\u201d He also said to the second officer he \u201cguessed he skidded\u201d and added that he was not sure whether or not he made a lefthand turn. Weber and Mrs. Eaton both denied the drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Two pedestrians on Wisconsin Avenue testified that \u201cthe automobile apparently tried to pass the streetcar. It seemed to hit the curb while being abreast of the streetcar and then turn or skid in front of the streetcar.\u201d The two motormen said the automobile turned so suddenly to its left onto the car tracks that they could do nothing to prevent the streetcars from striking \u2022it. Another witness was Mrs. Mary Gibb who, according to Weber and Mrs. Eaton, was to have been their hostess for the evening. She testified that she was ill in bed on February 22, 1944, that she had not invited Weber and Mrs. Eaton to her home that evening, that she had not expected them to call, and that she did not know Mrs. Eaton.</p>\n<p id=\"ax-dedup-0\">Mrs. Eaton sought damages from Mrs. Weber for the injuries she suffered because of what she said was the \u201creckless and careless manner\u201d in which her car was operated by her agent, Herbert E. Weber.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She joined Capital Transit Company as a defendant', charging it with negligent operation of its streetcars. The verdict was against Mrs.Weber only and she appeals, saying that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on contributory negligence, assumed risk and unavoidable accident. She complains also of an instruction absolving the appellee of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Although the appellant requested instructions on assumed risk and contributory negligence, her argument before us is in the alternative, as though she regarded the two defenses as identical or so substantiajly similar that she would have been <em>content </em>had she been afforded the benefit of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Contributory negligence and assumed risk are so closely related as sometimes to be almost, if not entirely, indistinguishable. In cases which do not arise between master and servant, the two terms may well be considered synonymous in the sense that one who voluntarily places himself in a perilous position, when the potential danger is apparent, is not exercising ordinary care for his own safety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But in another sense a difference between contributory negligence and assumed risk is easily discerned, since the former depends entirely upon conduct and the latter in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>volves a mental state of willingness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This case affords an example of that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In his essay on \u201cVoluntary Assumption of Risk,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bohlen says, \u201cThe defense of contributory negligence is quite distinct. Negligence involves the idea of misconduct, a failure to measure up to the standard of that ideal personage the normal social man; assumption of risk does not.\u201d The same author, in an article on \u201cContributory Negligence,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> distinguishes between that defense and the defense of assumed risk in this manner : \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s inability to recover where the danger being known is voluntarily encountered is not based upon any thought that in so doing he has acted improperly, or has fallen away from the normal standard of proper behavior.\u201d He adds that, \u201cContributory negligence excludes the idea of deliberation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axy\">Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Supreme Court in Schlemmer v. Buffalo, Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh R. Co., 205 U.S. 1, 12, 27 S.Ct. 407, 409, 51 L.Ed. 681, distinguishes in quite a different way between assumption of risk and contributory negligence : \u201c * * * the practical difference of the two ideas is in the degree of their proximity to the particular harm. The preliminary conduct of getting into the dangerous employment or relation is said to be accompanied by assumption of the risk. The act more immediately leading to a specific accident is called negligent. But the difference between the two is one of degree rather than of kind; * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although there is no evidence in the record that Mrs. Eaton was guilty of any act or omission which contxfibuted immediately to the happening of the accident, there was evidence before the jury from which it could have concluded that Weber\u2019s negligence caused the injuries, that his negligence was brought about by the drinks which he had taken a short time before the accident, and she knew of his drinking when she entered the car. The jury should have been told, therefore, that if it believed the evidence and drew therefrom the conclusions to which reference has just been made, it could not find a verdict for Mrs. Eaton.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Whether her act of entering the car, knowing the driver\u2019s condition, could properly be called contributory negligence under the proximity test of the Schlemmer case is unimportant in the facts of this case. It amounted to what the learned Justice called \u201cthe preliminary conduct of getting into the dangerous * * * relation.\u201d All authorities would agree that if Mrs. Eaton accompanied Weber when she knew of his drinking and was injured through negligence on his part brought about by the alcohol he had taken, she assumed the risk when she voluntarily rode with him. It was error not to instruct the jury to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">Since Weber and Mrs Eaton testified that he was driving slowly and carefully, and since he said that he did not turn onto the car tracks and knew of no reason for the skid, it would not have been improper to give an unavoidable accident instruction by informing the jury that if the accident was merely the result of misadventure, without fault on the part of anybody, there could be no recovery. But we do not regard the omission of such an instruction, in the factual situation herein involved, as reversible error. Counsel were allowed to argue to the jury that the accident was unavoidable. Such an argument necessarily was to the effect that nobody had been negligent. The jury understood from the court that the appellant could not be liable unless her agent\u2019s negligence caused the injuries, so the appellant had the benefit of the unavoidable accident theory;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">The appellant also asserts that the court erred in imperatively telling the jury to find that Mrs. Eaton could not have been contributorily negligent because the negligence of the driver, if any, could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>be imputed to her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A passenger in an automobile may be contributorily negligent because of his own failure to use due care, quit\u00e9 apart from the imputation to him of the driver\u2019s, negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The instruction, therefore, was not a correa statement of the law. Moreover, such an instruction was, in the facts of this case, not only unnecessary hut also plainly prejudicial to the appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Because of the errors which we have pointed out, it is necessary that the judgment of the District Court be set aside and that the cause be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Reversed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\"> It is alleged in the complaint and admitted by Mrs. Weber\u2019s answer that Weber was his wife\u2019s agent in operating th\u201ce car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"avl-dedup-0\"> Poole v.
