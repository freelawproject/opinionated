This appeal is brought by Radio Communications, Inc. (RCI) \u2014 a \u201cradio common carrier\u201d \u2014 from an order of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirming a decision of the Public Service Commission of Maryland (the Commission), one of several appellees. The remaining appellees (the intervenors) are also radio common carriers who initially entered this case by intervening in the proceedings before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Prior to July 1, 1971, radio common carriers were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>regulated in the State of Maryland. In that year, the General Assembly enacted Chapter 543 of the Laws of 1971 \u2014 the source of this controversy \u2014 which brought companies engaged in that field of communications under state regulation for the first time. This resulted in dual control, since the medium had already been under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prior to 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Chapter 543 achieved a threefold purpose, all within the framework of Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Cum. Supp.) Art. 78. First, it amended \u00a7 2 (o) of Art. 78, so as to embrace \u201cradio common carrier[sj\u201d within the definition of \u201c \u2018public service companies].\u2019 \u201d Second, it added a subsection (ii) to \u00a7 2, defining a \u201c \u2018Radio common carrier\u2019 \u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201c. .. every public service company operating or managing a radio common carrier engaged in the business of providing a service of one-way or two-way radio communications and licensed as a miscellaneous common carrier by the Federal Communications Commission, but not engaged in the business of providing a public land line message telephone service or a public message telegraph service. The terms \u2018telegraph company,\u2019 \u2018telephone company,\u2019 or \u2018a person operating telegraph or telephone lines\u2019 when used in this article, shall not be construed to include radio common carriers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Third, Chapter 543 added \u00a7 55A to Art. 78. This is the vehicle by which such carriers were for the first time brought under state regulation. Since they are material to the disposition of this case, we repeat here subsections (a), (b) and (d) of \u00a7 55A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201c(a) <em>When certificate required; rules and regulations. </em>\u2014 No radio common carrier shall begin or continue the construction or operation of any radio common carrier system or any extension thereof, either directly or indirectly, without first obtaining from the Commission a certificate that the public convenience and necessity required such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>construction, operation or extension. However, this article shall not require nor shall it be so construed to require any carrier to secure a certificate for any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\u201c(1) An extension within any authorized service area within which the carrier has heretofore lawfully commenced operations, (2) any extension within or to territory already served by the carrier, necessary in the ordinary course of business, (3) substitute facilities within or to any authorized service area or territory already served by such carrier, (4) any extension into territory contiguous to that already served by the carrier and not receiving similar service from another carrier when no certificate of convenience and necessity has been issued to or applied for by any other radio common carrier, and (5) the acquisition, construction and operation of any plant or system heretofore constructed under authority of a certificate of convenience and necessity hereafter issued. The Commission is authorized to prescribe appropriate and reasonable rules and regulations governing the issuance of the certificates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Certification of carriers licensed by Federal Communications Commission. </em>\u2014 Any company not presently franchised or certificated by the Commission as a radio common carrier but engaged in the operation of any radio common carrier system licensed by the Federal Communications Commission on July 1, 1971, shall, upon qualification as a public service company receive a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Commission authorizing the company to continue the operation of the radio common carrier in the territory <em>professed to be served </em>by tha+ company on July 1, 1971, if, within ninety days after this act becomes effective, that company shall file with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Commission an application for the certificate, including copies of any license or licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission to that company, showing the area <em>professed to be served </em>by that company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">\u201c(d) <em>Duplication of or competition with existing services. </em>\u2014 The Commission shall not grant a certificate for a proposed radio common carrier operation or extension thereof into the established service area which will be in competition with or duplication of any other certificated radio common carrier unless it shall first determine that the existing service is <em>inadequate to meet the reasonable needs of the public </em>and that the carrier operating the same is unable to, refuses or neglects, after hearing on reasonable notice, to provide reasonably adequate service.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The evidence discloses that mobile radio communications is a rapidly expanding branch of the communications field. Essentially, radio common carriers provide a mobile communications service, either by two-way transmission or one-way signalling. They operate base stations at which are located transmitters and receivers. The control point or message center, however, is the actual hub of the operation. The carrier operates its transmitters and receivers on channels or frequencies assigned by the FCC within a band allocated for that purpose. In Maryland, there are only two instances of co-channels, an arrangement under which a single radio frequency is shared by two or more radio common carriers. RCI participates in one of those co-channels. They are permitted by the FCC when agreed to by the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Those who subscribe to a mobile communications service purchase or lease a mobile radio set, which may include a transmitting and receiving device for two-way communications or simply a receiver if only a one-way signalling service is desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Prior to 1971, radio common carriers were regulated only if they provided services utilizing \u201cinterconnections\u201d with \u201cland line\u201d telephone systems. The most frequently cited illustration of hew this interconnection operates is the placement of a call from a subscriber\u2019s office to one of its mobile units in the field. The caller, by a regular telephone call, reaches the control point operated by the radio common carrier, which then completes the call to the mobile unit by radio. Although there are calls made completely by radio, for example, from one mobile unit to another, it is apparent that the \u201cinterconnection\u201d with regular telephone systems is the most prominent phase of this communications field.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">It is this interconnection with land line telephone systems that first brought radio common carriers under limited scrutiny of the Commission. Even prior to 1971, radio common carriers were required to obtain Commission approval of services utilizing such interconnections. Thus, shortly after its formation in 1960, RCI applied to the Commission for the right to exercise its \u201cfranchise\u201d in the seven counties in which it was then operating as a radio common carrier: Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's and St. Mary\u2019s. In March 1963, the Commission issued an order authorizing RCI \u201cto exercise franchises and rights, including the franchise granted to the said company by its certificate of incorporation for the operation of a radio communications system in the State of Maryland ... as and to the extent set forth and described in this proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">After Chapter 543 became effective, the Commission held a hearing on August 4, 1971, following which, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the authority expressly conferred by \u00a7 64 of Art. 78 and subsection (a) of \u00a7 55A, it promulgated by an order dated September 27, 1971, \u201c. . . rules and regulations [effective September 29, 1971] governing the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity for radio common carriers under Section 55A . . . .\u201d Pursuant to those rules and \u00a7 55A, RCI and other radio common carriers \u2014 including intervenors \u2014 promptly filed applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In its application, RCI sought to exercise a franchise for the following political subdivisions of the state: the City of Baltimore and the counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Carroll, Cecil, Charles, Caroline, Dorchester, Frederick, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s, Queen Anne\u2019s, Somerset, St. Mary\u2019s, Talbot, Washington and Wicomico. The intervenors took a rather dim view of this preemptive bid and, regarding it as a flagrantly expansionist move by RCI, leaped into the affray. Several hearings ensued, which were characterized by polemics on the part of the protagonists and admirable restraint on the part of the Commission. Thus, merely two witnesses managed to produce three substantial volumes of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The sole witness who testified for RCI was its president, Boyd King (King); and for the intervenors, John E. Dettra, Jr., (Dettra), a radio engineer. Since most of this evidence is not material to the disposition of this appeal, no useful purpose could possibly be served by an extensive summary of the testimony. Indeed, because of its highly technical nature, merely undertaking a limited review presents a formidable task.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In brief, King testified that RCI operated five base stations on July 1, 1971, two at Bethesda, and one at each of the following sites: Prince Frederick, Upper Marlboro, and Annapolis. For each of those locations, maps were introduced with circles depicting the area in which RCI transmitted and received radio communications to and from mobile units. King emphasized that these circles were drawn on the basis of where RCI could \u201cput\u201d a signal and could communicate with mobile units from the particular base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>station encircled on the map. In this manner. RCI transmitted and received signals as a radio common carrier on July 1, 1971, in each of the 21 subdivisions for which it was seeking certification. King explained that RCI\u2019s operations had expanded from the seven counties approved in the telephone interconnection context by the 1963 Commission order, mainly because of its improved technical facilities. These consisted of a change from low to high power transmitters and significant increases in antenna height.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The role of the FCC in regulating radio common carriers was explained by King: He stated that the purpose of the FCC license issued to such carriers is limited to the approval of the construction and operation of transmitters and companion mobile units. In other words, the license simply confers authority to establish and operate a base station at a particular site. Once the license is issued, the FCC permits licensees to operate wherever their signal penetrates. In short, according to King, under the FCC license, the carrier may broadcast or receive within a territory defined solely by the capability of its equipment and antennae. An \u201ceffective signal\u201d was described by King as one which permits the base station to reach by radio a subscriber in a mobile unit within the area designated on each of the maps.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Needless to say, intervenors vigorously dispute these claims; indeed, their entire approach to this case, including the testimony of Dettra, varies sharply from the premise on which RCI presented its case. Their position was ultimately adopted by the Commission in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The gravamen of Dettra\u2019s testimony is a standard called the \u201creliable service area\u201d of a radio common carrier. It is determined by a plotted contour line known as 37 DBU (decibel units); this delineates an area in which service is generally expected to have an average reliability of not less than 90 per cent. This standard originated in a study that is commonly referred to as the \u201cBoese Report,\u201d prepared for the FCC in 1951 by one of its engineers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>This testimony by Dettra was accompanied by a series of maps on which are drawn the 37 DBU contours for each of the base stations operated by RCI. Dettra explained that under FCC policy, the base station of a radio common carrier is expected to be within the toll-free telephone area of the community which it serves, so that the subscriber and the public generally may gain access to the transmitter by non-toll telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In sum, although the intervenors conceded that the effective range of the RCI transmitters might sporadically extend beyond the 37 DBU contour, Dettra\u2019s thesis was that beyond this area, the signal would not meet the <em>907 </em>reliability test fostered by the FCC. For this reason, he testified, RCI cannot render \u201creasonably adequate\u201d service in each of the entire 21 subdivisions for which it requests certification. He did concede that it could do so in parts of the counties of Dorchester, Frederick, Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s, Talbot and Wicomico, in addition to the seven counties which it had already served since 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">As we have indicated, the Commission basically adopted the test advanced by Dettra in passing its order of February 9, 1972. It ruled that it was required to grant \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights under subsection (b) of fj 55A to radio common carriers licensed by the FCC \u201cwhere they were legally rendering service <em>adequate to meet the reasonable needs of the public </em>on the effective date of the Act.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Thus, the Commission found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201c(2) That for the sole purpose of establishing the reliable service area of a radio common carrier public service company pursuant to Section 55A of Article 78, the Commission should consider the FCC prescribed decibel contour of a company\u2019s station plus a deviation of five (5) statute miles beyond said contour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">\u201c(3) That the Commission should consider the reliable service area so determined as the only area in which a Radio Common Carrier may render a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>satisfactory service, free of electrical inference [sic] or competitive economic injury, subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">\u201c(a) service to existing customers <em>will not </em>be impaired by the service area so determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201c(b) customers garaged in an area of overlap between two or more carriers <em>mil have </em>the benefit of service from such carriers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201c(c) the service area should not in any way limit or restrict the carrier of radio communications by telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201c(d) the carriers should formulate a mutual agreement whereby the user of a mobile radio telephone who travels within a particular county or counties or throughout the State would not be restricted of normal communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201c(4) That the reliable service area of Radio Communications, Inc., is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\n<em>In its entirety:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">Montgomery County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aso\">Calvert County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsI\">Prince George\u2019s County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asb\">St. Mary\u2019s County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">\n<em>Portions of the following Counties in Maryland, in accordance with the delineations on mays which are on file with this Commission:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">Howard County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV0\">Anne Arundel County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8J\">Kent County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acl\">Queen Anne\u2019s County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A66\">Talbot County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADy\">Dorchester County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFv\">Charles County\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">This order was affirmed on appeal to the circuit court which followed the lead set by the Commission in applying the \u201creasonably adequate service\u201d standard contained in Art. 78, \u00a7 55A <em>(d) </em>to RGBs application, which, however, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>filed pursuant to \u00a7 55A <em>(b). </em>The court also took note of the Commission\u2019s \u201cspecial type of expertise\u201d and held that its decision was not \u201carbitrary, capricious or illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Commission\u2019s decision is attacked by RCI on these grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">(1) The first, and by far the primary, contention urged for reversal is that the Commission erred in ignoring the simple requirement set forth in (b) for \u201cgrandfather\u201d carriers, \u201cthe territory professed to be served\u201d; and instead engrafted upon subsection (b) the test contained in (d), which is applicable only to \u201cproposed\u201d carriers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">(2) Even assuming that the Commission applied the correct test, its decision is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d and is therefore arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">(3) That the Commission \u201cerred in failing to award\u201d RCI \u201cthe entire counties in which it was previously certificated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">(4) The Commission erred in \u201capparently\u201d attaching certain conditions to the certificate which it did grant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In the view we take of this case, it is necessary that we reach only the first issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">In arguing that the Commission failed to interpret subsection (b) of \u00a7 55A correctly, and thus applied an improper test for a \u201cgrandfather\u201d application filed thereunder, RCI maintains that it met the requirements of (b) by merely \u201cprofessing to serve\u201d the 21 subdivisions for which it sought a certificate. But it also contends that it actually proved it did serve those 21 subdivisions; and that this evidence was not contradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The intervenors, on the other hand, argue not implausibly that the legislature never intended that a carrier seeking \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights could obtain them by simply making a bald assertion that it \u201cprofessed\u201d to serve the area being sought. Yet, while acknowledging that this case is controlled by subsection (b), they also argue that, as set forth in (d) for <em>proposed </em>carriers, RCI should receive a certificate only for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>those areas where it could provide service adequate \u201c. . . to meet the reasonable needs of the public . . . .\u201d Hence, they maintain, since the \u201creliable service area of a radio common carrier\u201d \u2014 Dettra\u2019s test for meeting those \u201cneeds\u201d \u2014 is established by the 37 DBU contour, RCI is not entitled to a certificate beyond those limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We think the disposition of this case lies between these respective contentions. Although we find ourselves lacking complete agreement with either position, we are of the view that the Commission \u2014 and, hence, the circuit court in affirming it \u2014 applied an incorrect standard, and thus erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 55A.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">What the legislature intended as the standard for carriers seeking \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights under \u00a7 55A (b) must be determined in the first instance by a careful examination of the statute itself, since the cardinal rule of construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention, <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>269 Md. 390, 393, 306 A. 2d 534 (1973); <em>Silberman v. Jacobs, </em>259 Md. 1, 267 A. 2d 209 (1970); <em>Atlantic, Gulf v. Dep\u2019t of Assess. </em>&amp; <em>T., </em>252 Md. 173, 249 A. 2d 180 (1969); <em>Equitable v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>251 Md. 143, 246 A. 2d 604 (1968); and in ascertaining that intention, the Court considers the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification, <em>Germenko v. Pub. Service Comm., </em>226 Md. 295, 301-02, 173 A. 2d 362 (1961); <em>Height v. State, </em>225 Md. 251, 257, 170 A. 2d 212 (1961). Thus it is necessary and proper to construe a statute only when it is ambiguous and of doubtful meaning, <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, supra; Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 237 A. 2d 35 (1968); <em>Falcone v. Palmer Ford, </em>242 Md. 487, 219 A. 2d 808 (1966). If there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the legislature, <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, supra; Maryland Nat\u2019l Bk. v. Comptroller, </em>264 Md. 536, 287 A. 2d 291 (1972); <em>Atlantic, Gulf v. Dep\u2019t of Assess. &amp; T., supra; Department v. Greyhound, </em>247 Md. 662, 234 A. 2d 255 (1967); <em>Md. Medical Service v. Carver, </em>238 Md. 466, 209 A. 2d 582 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">It is immediately apparent that \u00a7 55A is a carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>conceived statutory scheme for the regulation of all radio common carriers in Maryland. Likewise, it is plain that subsection (b) was intended to regulate the issuance of certificates to all such carriers who were \u201cengaged in the operation of any radio common carrier system licensed by the Federal Communications Commission on July 1, 1971,\u201d otherwise known as \u201cgrandfather\u201d carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">It is equally clear that those seeking certificates who do not meet the requirements of subsection (b) for \u201cgrandfather\u201d status, must file an application as a \u201cproposed\u201d carrier under (d). Should a carrier be certificated under (b) and then be challenged by a \u201cproposed\u201d carrier asserting \u201cinadequate\u201d service on the part of the \u201cgrandfather\u201d carrier, the standard in (d) must then be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It follows that the legislature, having opted for this dichotomy in the statutory scheme, intended entirely separate tests for certification under the two subsections. The statutory distinction would completely lose its significance if a carrier operating prior to July 1, 1971, were expected to meet the same standard as that confronting a \u201cproposed\u201d carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">By reading into subsection (b) the standard set forth in (d), the Commission erred in undertaking to insert words in (b) which, in our view, were deliberately omitted by the legislature. Construing a statute liberally and adding to it, by judicial fiat, a provision which the legislature did not see fit to include are not one and the same thing, <em>Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Phares, </em>268 Md. 344, 348, 302 A. 2d 1 (1973); <em>Amalgamated Ins. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 212 A. 2d 311 (1965). As a general rule, a court may not surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute, nor insert or omit words to make the statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form, <em>Amalgamated Ins. v. Helms, supra </em>at 535; see also <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, 102 A. 2d 821 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Therefore, in the absence of ambiguity, the Courts should, as a general rule, confine themselves to a construction of a statute as written, and not attempt, under the guise of construction, to supply omissions or remedy possible defects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>in the statute, or to insert exceptions not made by the legislature, <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller; Amalgamated Ins. v. Helms, </em>both <em>supra. </em>As so aptly stated by Justice Brand\u00e9is in <em>Iselin v. United States, </em>270 U.S. 245, 251, 46 S. Ct. 248, 70 L. Ed. 566 (1926):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">. . What the Government asks is not a construction of a statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope. To supply omissions transcends the judicial function</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In addressing themselves to the question of what standard was intended by the legislature in enacting subsection (b), the parties have cited a number of our prior decisions involving appeals from the Public Service Commission, including several in which we have touched on the subject of \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights in other categories. The difficulty which stems from relying upon those authorities is that in none of them were we dealing with statutory language similar to that confronting us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">RCI claims it is sufficient for purposes of obtaining \u201cgrandfather\u201d certification in the 21 subdivisions if it merely \u201cprofesses\u201d to serve them. Appellees argue, with considerable logic, that this would reduce the Commission\u2019s role in this proceeding to that of a \u201crubber stamp.\u201d We agree that while the standards in (d) do not apply, RCI must nevertheless do more than merely \u201cprofess\u201d to serve. It contends, however, that it did so by proving that it had communicated with mobile units in the 21 subdivisions from one or more of its base stations; and that this testimony was not effectively disputed by any of the intervenors.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We read subsection (b) to say that those who assert \u201cgrandfather\u201d status cannot obtain certification by merely \u201cprofessing to serve\u201d a given area or county. Subsection (b) provides for certification of a radio common carrier <em>\u201cengaged in the operation </em>of any radio common carrier system . . . .\u201d By obtaining certification, a carrier is expected \u201c. . . to <em>continue the operation </em>... in the territory professed to be served . . . .\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the application of a subsection (b) radio common carrier professing to have served an area is challenged, that carrier must then prove that, in fact, it did serve that area, <em>i.e., </em>that on July 1, 1971, it was \u201cengaged in the operation\u201d of a radio common carrier system in each subdivision for which certification is sought. As we have already held, that requirement may not be embellished with any other standard not found in the language of subsection (b) itself. All parts and sections of a statute must be read and considered together in arriving at the true intention of the Legislature since they form part of a general system or scheme. <em>Parker v. Junior Press Printing, </em>266 Md. 721, 725, 296 A. 2d 377 (1972); <em>Height v. State, </em>225 Md. 251, 257, 170 A. 2d 212 (1961); <em>Thomas v. Police Commissioner of Baltimore City, </em>211 Md. 357, 361, 127 A. 2d 625 (1956); <em>State v. Petrushansky, </em>183 Md. 67, 71, 36 A. 2d 533 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Although RCI did endeavor to furnish the proof required by (b), the Commission was preoccupied with the premise that the subsection (d) standard controlled. We think the case should be remanded to the Commission for further proceedings, including the introduction of such additional evidence as the Commission may require, in order that RCI may be afforded the opportunity of establishing in what areas it did actually provide service, and for which it seeks certification under subsection (b); and so that intervenors may have the opportunity to present contrary evidence. In so ' holding, we carefully refrain from expressing any opinion on whether the 37 DBU contour is a proper standard for \u201cproposed\u201d carriers seeking certification under subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Order reversed; remanded for further proceedings before the Public Service Commission of Maryland; costs to be paid equally by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\">.

Indeed, I only dissent in the conclusion reached by the majority in the last three paragraphs of its opinion and in that portion of the mandate which remands the case for further proceedings before the Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In my opinion, the majority in its construction of subsection (b) has departed from the principles of statutory construction so ably and carefully articulated in its opinion by, in effect, <em>adding words </em>to that subsection which are not in it, <em>i.e., </em>by striking out the period and adding at the end of the subsection the words \u201cand in which it did actually provide service.\u201d As I see it, however, the language of subsection (b) is not ambiguous, so that there is no need for using the principles of statutory construction applicable in the event of ambiguity in the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Judge Sybert, for the Court, stated in <em>Germenko v. Public Service Commission, </em>226 Md. 295, 301-02, 173 A. 2d 362, 365-66 (1961) \u2014 cited in the majority opinion \u2014 involving a \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause relating to contract carriers of flammable liquids in bulk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201cThe cardinal rule in the construction of statutes is to give effect to the intention of the legislature, and in determining that intention the Court considers the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification, and, if there is no ambiguity on the face of it, there is no need for construction and the Court will give to the language used its apparent meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Judge Sybert further aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\u201cWe might add that the interpretation contended for by appellants would require reading into the 1959 statute some such limiting words as \u2018carriers operating <em>under permit\u2019. </em>However, courts are \u2018generally not at liberty to surmise a legislative intent contrary to the letter of the statute, or to indulge in the license of inserting or omitting words with the view of making the statute express an intent which is not evidenced in the original form\u2019. <em>Tax Comm. v. Power Company, </em>182 Md. 111, 116, 32 A. 2d 382 (1943).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In subsection (b), the words \u201cengaged in the operation\u201d are followed by the words \u201cof any radio common carrier system licensed by the Federal Communications Commission on July 1, 1971.\u201d There is no limitation on <em>how </em>the system is operated nor any provision in regard to the <em>extent </em>of its operation. There is no question whatever that RCI was \u201cengaged in the operation\u201d of a \u201cradio common carrier system\u201d and was \u201clicensed by the Federal Communications Commission on July 1, 1971.\u201d It is qualified as a public service company, so that by the plain, clear and unambiguous language of subsection (b), it \u201cs/ia\u00a3\u00a3\u201d(emphasis added) receive a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PSC authorizing the company <em>\u201cto continue the operation\u201d </em>(emphasis added) of the carrier in the territory \u201cprofessed to be served by that company on July 1, 1971. . . .\u201d The plain and ordinary meaning of the key word \u201cprofessed\u201d is \u201copenly declared, avowed, acknowledged, or claimed,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1975 (2d ed. 1944), and see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1375 (4th ed. 1951), defining \u201cprofess\u201d as \u201c[t]o make open declaration of, to make public declaration or avowal.\u201d See also 34 Words and Phrases, \u201cProfess; Professedly,\u201d at 378-79. The words \u201cby that company\u201d following the words \u201cprofessed to be served\u201d clearly indicate to me that the profession is to be made <em>by the applying company </em>and there is no contention that RCI did not profess to serve the subdivisions mentioned by it in its grandfather application. \u201c[P]rofessed to be served\u201d does not mean that the company must show, as a condition precedent to obtaining the certificate, that it provided \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201creasonably adequate\u201d service in the areas listed by it in its application. Doubtlessly, if the General Assembly had so intended, it would have used appropriate language to that effect as indeed, in effect, it did ixi subsection '(d) of Section 55A of Art. 78. As <em>Germenko </em>\u2022 plainly teaches, we are not permitted to supply any additional words to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The language in subsection (b) in regard to the issuance of the certificate by PSC is mandatory \u2014 \u201cshall\u201d \u2014 and not permissive or discretionary. See 60 C.J.S. <em>Motor Vehicles </em>\u00a7 85(2), at 474 (1969) where it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201cUnlike the granting of a certificate of public convenience and necessity in the ordinary case, as considered infra \u00a7 86, where applicant seeks a certificate as an existing carrier and complies with the requirements of the statute, the commission has no discretion to deny the certificate, but its powers and duties are ministerial and mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">If RCI, after receiving its grandfather certificate of convenience and necessity, is unable to supply service which is adequate \u201cto meet the reasonable needs of the public\u201d in the areas it professes to serve, then appropriate proceedings by those aggrieved may be instituted under subsection (d) or under other appropriate provisions of Art. 78. It strikes me that this is a far wiser method of procedure than the one pursued by the PSC in this case and the one which it apparently will pursue as a result of the decision and remand by the majority. In the method of procedure which the statute envisions, as I believe the statute should be construed, the specific issues of the reasonable needs of the public in the particular area involved and the quality of the service may be explored in a specific area with definite persons aggrieved rather than in a most general proceeding employing a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach \u2014 a single trapeze act rather than a three-ring circus.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The difference is substantial and not merely a question of semantics. If it is required that questions of the quality of service and the reasonable needs of the public be considered in a post-grandfather certificate proceeding, the persons complaining of inadequate service will have the burden of coming forward with the pleadings and proof rather than the grandfather carrier. However, this burden, I fear, will come upon RCI as a result of the remand. To me, it is most incongruous that the grandfather carrier, by applying for a certificate under subsection (b), has immediately precipitated hearings and litigation as a condition precedent to receiving its certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">There is nothing unusual or unjust in a provision which gives a person or company operating first in a given field the advantage of his first position. Indeed, one of the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>maxims of equity is <em>qui prior est tempore potior est jure </em>\u2014 he who is prior in time has priority in right. <em>See May v. Buckhannon River Lumber Co., </em>70 Md. 448, 450, 17 A. 274, 275 (1889) where Judge Yellott, speaking for the Court, after referring to the maxim, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">\u201cThis maxim, though perhaps as old as our system of jurisprudence, is just as applicable now as when first promulgated by the English courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">See <em>Co. Litt. </em>14(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">This incongruity is compounded, as it were, in view of the prior decisions of the Court in <em>Baltimore Tank Lines v. Public Service Commission, </em>215 Md. 125, 137 A. 2d 187 (1957) and in <em>Germenko, supra, </em>which followed the decision in <em>Baltimore Tank Lines. </em>In short, the procedure which I think the General Assembly established in the legislation under consideration in the present case is quite analogous to procedures previously adopted by the General Assembly in prior legislation relating to grandfather situations. Our prior decisions and the clear meaning of subsection (b) are, like the old-time religion, good enough for me.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">I would reverse, but I would not remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">I am authorized to state that Judge Digges concurs in the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
