J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arv\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Howard Research and Development Corporation (HRD) owns and operates the Columbia Mall shopping center in Columbia, Maryland. Opened on August 2, 1971, the Columbia Mall is an enclosed facility consisting of two major department stores and approximately 100 smaller retail stores. During development of the Columbia Mall, and when the leases were executed between HRD and its tenants, there was on file with the Public Service Commission, as there is now, an electric service tariff of the Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company (BG&amp;E) the public service company supplying the area with electricity, setting forth the terms upon which a customer of BG&amp;E would be allowed to purchase electricity and distribute it to its own tenants. The tariff provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201c\u00a7 3.1 General: The Company will undertake to furnish service to the Customer, who shall be one individual, firm, corporation or organization, for use only in or on the premises owned, leased to, occupied or managed by the Customer. The service furnished may not be remetered or sub-metered by the Customer for resale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Service furnished to the Customer may be, in turn, furnished by him to a tenant or occupant of such premises where charged for by him on one of the following bases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">(a) As an unspecified amount, to be included as part of the rent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">(b) As a specified amount which does not vary with the quantity of service used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">(c) As an unspecified amount varying with the quantity of service used by the tenant or occupant as shown by the Company\u2019s indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>vidual metering in the Customer\u2019s name, but not exceeding the charge made to such Customer by the Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">To avail itself of the provisions of the tariff, HRD installed transformers and other electrical equipment at a cost of approximately $350,000 to enable it to reduce high voltage current to a voltage suitable for use by its tenants, and to thereafter transmit the electric current to the separate premises of the tenants. HRD made arrangements with BG&amp;E to purchase current at a wholesale rate, and negotiated leases with each of its tenants whereby, as authorized by \u00a7 3.1 (b) of the tariff, it agreed to furnish electricity to them and to make a separate flat monthly charge to each tenant therefor, not included as part of the rent, in an amount estimated to be that which the tenant would pay to purchase electricity directly from BG&amp;E. HRD believed that this method of distributing electricity to its tenants was more suitable than including the electricity charges in the rent, as permitted by \u00a7 3.1 (a) of the tariff, because occupants of shopping centers conduct a variety of retail businesses differing greatly in their daily consumption of electricity. Therefore, HRD thought that the charge for electricity would be more acceptable to tenants if shown as a separate figure representing the estimated consumption of that particular tenant\u2019s type of retail operation. According to HRD, in reliance upon the tariff, it negotiated long-term leases with the expectation that it would be receiving from its tenants, over the full term of the lease, a profit on the sale of the electricity which would supplement the separate amounts to be received as rent. It claimed that the leases were negotiated with full awareness on both sides that HRD would receive from the tenant not only the rent, but also a substantial profit from the electric revenues; that the tenants in Columbia Mall are mainly large national or regional retail chains that have rented stores in hundreds of shopping centers in many different states; that these sophisticated retailers knew that if the landlord of a shopping center could make a profit on the electricity sold to them, and at the same time charge them no more than they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>would have to pay for the electricity from the local utility, they could allow for that profit as an appreciable credit in bargaining for what the landlord must receive as rent for the premises. By distributing electricity to its Columbia Mall tenants by the method authorized by \u00a7 3.1 (b) of the tariff, HRD realizes a profit on sales of electricity of approximately $100,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">By order dated September 14, 1972, the Public Service Commission directed that an investigation be instituted \u201cto review the arrangements under which . . . [HRD] charges its tenants for electric service. ...\u201d A hearing was held on October 30, 1972 before the Commission\u2019s Chief Hearing Examiner, at the conclusion of which the examiner made these findings: that HRD buys electricity at a wholesale rate and resells it to its commercial tenants at individually specified amounts that do not vary with consumption as permitted by \u00a7 3.1 (b) of the tariff; that the electric charge made by HRD to its tenants is separately stated from the rental charge; that while the tariff provision does not limit the charge that HRD could make to its tenants, the leases between HRD and its tenants provide that the charge shall not exceed what the tenant would pay if billed direct by BG&amp;E; that in the installation of its electric system, HRD provided check metering outlets to the tenants\u2019 premises to measure actual consumption and to provide a more accurate basis for determining the specified amount to be billed; and that the specified amount in present billings is on an adjusted basis developed by the check metering. The examiner concluded that while the method employed by HRD was in accordance with \u00a7 3.1 (b) of the tariff, it nevertheless violated The Public Service Commission Law (Maryland Code, 1969 Repl. Vol., Article 78) and necessitated modification of the provisions of BG&amp;E\u2019s electric service tariff. The examiner noted that the terms \u201cElectric company\u201d and \u201cElectric plant\u201d were defined in sections 2 (f) and (g) of The Public Service Commission Law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201c(f) \u2018Electric company\u2019 means and includes any public service company, other than a company generating and/or transmitting. electricity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>exclusively for its own use (1) which (A) owns any electric plant and (B) transmits, sells, or distributes electricity, or generates electricity for distribution or sale; or (2) any such company which is authorized to erect, lay down or maintain wires, pipes, conduits, ducts or other fixtures in, over, or under streets for furnishing or distributing electricity, or to maintain underground conduits or ducts for electrical conductors; or (3) every municipal corporation in the business of supplying electricity for other than municipal purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">(g) \u2018Electric plant\u2019 means plant owned by an electric company and includes but is not limited to batteries, boilers, buildings, cables, conduits, converters, dams, ducts (or other devices for containing or carrying electrical conductors), dynamos, easements, lamps, meters, motors, poles, power stations, real estate, services, transformers, waterfalls, water plant and water property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">From these definitions, the examiner concluded that an electric company was one which owned an electric plant and sold or distributed electricity; and that an electric plant includes transformers. By making a separate charge at a specified amount, the examiner found that HRD \u201csells electricity and since it owns transformers, it owns [an] electric plant.\u201d The examiner found that the arrangement under which electric service was furnished by HRD to its tenants required \u201ca public service company status under the Public Service Commission Law\u201d; that, in effect, the tariff permitted ITRD to act as an electric company without regulation by the Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The examiner recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>that \u00a7 3.1 (b) be modified to exclude from its operation any \u201ccustomer\u201d owning an \u201celectric plant\u201d and to require that the \u201cspecified amounts charged by the customer may not exceed what the tenants would pay separately or in the aggregate to the utility if billed direct.\u201d The examiner concluded with these findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">\u201c(1) that Section 3.1 (b) of the electric service tariff of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company can permit an arrangement that violates The Public Service Commission Law and, therefore, should be modified as hereinbefore stated; (2) that Howard Research and Development Corporation is not a public service company; (3) that the arrangement under which Howard Research and Development Corporation furnishes electricity to its tenants requires public service company status; (4) that Howard Research and Development Corporation must cease its present method of furnishing electricity as promptly as possible and utilize the provisions of Section 3.1 (a) of the said electric tariff, or Baltimore Gas and Electric Company must assume direct billing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">It was the view of the examiner that HRD would not violate the law if it utilized the provisions of \u00a7 3.1 (a) because electricity furnished to tenants under that sub-section \u201cbecomes a part of the total conveniences and necessities that a landlord decides to provide in order to attract tenants and to place them in a position where, generally, their total cost of occupancy is known.\u201d He said that \u201c[S]uch an arrangement does not contemplate a sale of electricity\u201d under Art. 78, \u00a7 2f.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">On January 10, 1973 the Commission adopted the examiner\u2019s findings and ordered BG&amp;E to modify \u00a7 3.1 (b) of its tariff \u201cso that application of its provisions will not conflict with The Public Service Commission Law and that the ultimate consumer shall not pay more than if billed direct by it.\u201d The Commission directed that BG&amp;E furnish electric service direct to the tenants at Columbia Mall \u201cif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>[HRD] does not take steps as promptly as possible to change from its present method of furnishing electricity to one that will not conflict with The Public Service Commission Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">On February 1, 1973, HRD filed a petition of appeal and for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City. It claimed that the Commission\u2019s order was erroneous \u201cin that . . . [HRD\u2019s] sales of electricity to its tenants and only to its tenants are incidental to the landlord-tenant relationship and are therefore private, as distinguished from public, sales of electricity not subject to regulation by the . . . Commission and not constituting a violation of The Public Service Commission Law.\u201d HRD sought a declaration that its method of charging for electrical services, in its leases with its tenants, was a lawful practice and not inconsistent with the BG&amp;E tariff. And it sought an order enjoining the Commission from interfering with its contractual rights to charge its tenants for electrical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The court (Ross, J.) reversed the Commission\u2019s order. It held that HRD\u2019s distribution of electricity to its tenants and its method of charging them for that service did not violate The Public Service Commission Law and, that the Commission\u2019s order requiring BG&amp;E to modify \u00a7 3.1 (b) of its tariff, and to furnish electricity directly to the tenants in Columbia Mall, was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law. The court noted that although The Public Service Commission Law did not make a \u201cspecific or express distinction between public and private sales,\u201d it had been construed since its inception in 1910 as regulating only services provided to the public. The court said: \u201cPublic sales are regulated and private sales are not.\u201d It stated that either a \u201cgloss\u201d had been imposed on the statute, limiting its application to public service companies engaged in sales to the public, or that the exclusion from the definition of an \u201celectric company\u201d in \u00a7 2 (f) of a company transmitting electricity \u201cexclusively for its own use\u201d could be read to apply to the sale of electricity by a landlord to his tenants. The court held that the tariff was not illegal because HRD\u2019s sales were not made to the public; it based its decision on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>administrative and judicial construction placed upon The Public Service Commission Law in <em>Yeatman v. Public Service Commission, </em>126 Md. 513, 95 A. 158 (1915), by the Commission\u2019s General Counsel in an opinion rendered in 1913 in the case of <em>In the Matter of Charles B. Clark v. Marlborough Apartment House Company, </em>4 PSC 568, and the long-standing existence of \u00a7 3.1 of the tariff which had been on file with the Commission since 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Appealing from the court\u2019s order, the Commission reasserts its position that \u00a7 3.1 (b) of the tariff is in violation of The Public Service Commission Law in that HRD\u2019s ownership of an electric plant and its sale of electricity to its tenants has the effect of HRD acting as an electric company and thus a non-regulated public service company. The Commission claims that because HRD is supplying electricity to over 100 of its tenants, its service is a public, and not a private one, a conclusion which it deems supported by our decision in <em>Yeatman v. Public Service Commission, supra. </em>But, it maintains, the \u201cpublic v. private\u201d use test is not the measure of the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction under the present statute. Claiming that The Public Service Commission Law \u201cis distinctly silent on the public v. private theory,\u201d the Commission argues that we must strictly construe the statute \u201cso as to eliminate this distinction.\u201d The Commission maintains that the legislative intent to regulate the \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d in services provided by public utilities, manifest in The Public Service Commission Law, is fulfilled by the regulation of HRD, which, it contends, has not only an \u201cactual monopoly on the sale of electricity to its tenants, but [whose] sales and service incident thereto are unregulated by any public authority.\u201d It argues that \u201cHRD is not supplying electricity to its tenants as a mere incident to its business of landlord but by its own admission it is making a profit on the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">HRD contends that its activities are not subject to the Commission\u2019s regulation. It maintains that public sales of electricity are subject to regulation and that private sales are not, and that this distinction is well established in this state by a long-standing judicial and administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>construction of The Public Service Commission Law. It argues that it has no monopoly in its sales of electricity, as those sales are made as an incident to the competitive business of the rental of commercial space.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The Commission is charged by law with the regulation of \u201call public service companies . . . engaged in or operating a utility business in this State.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission under its authority, establish prerequisites to and restrictions upon the operation of those public service companies. We hold that the requirements imposed upon public service companies by The Public Service Commission Law do not apply to the electric services provided by HRD to its tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Yeatman, </em>the jurisdiction of the Commission was construed, at a time when the law was in its \u201cembryonic state,\u201d to extend only to a public service. In that case, one Blackshere purchased a tract of land from Griffin for the purpose of constructing houses thereon. At the time of the sale there was no water supply available for the proposed houses and Griffin contracted to furnish water at a specified rate for \u201call the buildings, in number about one hundred\u201d to be built by Blackshere. He constructed a water plant for this purpose, which he later sold to the Park Heights Water Company who in turn sold it to the Suburban Water Company. Fifteen of the houses built by Blackshere became the property of Yeatman. Following an order passed by the Commission setting Suburban\u2019s rates at a price greater than that specified by Griffin in the original contract, Yeatman sought to enjoin the operation of the Commission\u2019s order, arguing that the original contract between Griffin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Blackshere could not be abrogated and that because the agreement was \u201cbetween individuals, and related to a private rather than a public service,\u201d it was outside of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. We held that Suburban\u2019s sale of water to these houses was a public service subject to the Commission's regulation. We said that it was immaterial whether the water supply was being furnished by Griffin or by one of the corporations named since, under The Public Service Commission Law, each would be a water company subject to the Commission\u2019s regulation if it were engaged \u201cin a public as distinguished from a private service.\u201d It was conceded that the water plant was constructed for the purpose of supplying water to about 100 dwellings. As to this, we said, at 517:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201cIf this is to be regarded as constituting a private service, how many are necessary to transform it into a public service? Griffin was not limited in his agreement with Blackshere to supply only a definite, limited number, nor was the undertaking one to supply only some of the occupants of the houses to be erected, but all; this was therefore distinctly a public service ... .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Thus, we found that the water company engaged in a public service not merely because it supplied water, but rather because its sales were made to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>Yeatman </em>is in harmony with the long-standing administrative construction of The Public Service Commission Law. The 1913 opinion of the Commission\u2019s General Counsel in the <em>Matter of Charles B. Clark v. Marlborough Apartment House Company, supra, </em>concluded that the Commission had no jurisdiction over a company which sold electricity to its apartment tenants at a profit. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cIn my opinion the apartment house cannot be said to own, operate, manage or control any plant or property even for selling or distributing electricity for light within the meaning of these provisions. As I understand it, it furnishes electric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>current solely to tenants of its own rooms, and this current it obtains from the plant of the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company just as every other customer does. It is not holding itself out as prepared to sell and distribute current to the general public and it is supplying current to the occupants of its apartment house merely as an incident of its business as the manager of an apartment house. If the profit that it is making from the electric current supplied by it to a tenant is felt by the tenant to be unduly onerous, he can escape the burden by giving up his apartment or apartments and going elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Commission\u2019s General Counsel thus recognized that the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction extended only to sales of electricity made to the \u201cgeneral public,\u201d and not to sales made by a landlord to a limited group \u2014 his tenants \u2014 as an incident to their relation as landlord and tenant. The Commission argues that the opinion should not be considered persuasive today because when rendered in 1913 the term \u201celectrical corporation\u201d was defined in the statute to include a company owning a plant for generating or distributing electricity \u201cfor light, heat, or power or for the transmission of electric current for such purposes, <em>or for any public use whatever.\u201d </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). We note that the italicized portion of this definition was not part of the definition of a \u201cwater company\u201d considered by us in construing the law in <em>Yeatman. </em>More persuasive, however, is the fact that \u00a7 3.1 of the tariff, which allows a landlord to provide electricity to its tenants and to charge them for that service, either as a part of the rent or by a separate charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>has been on file with the Commission since 1929.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission concedes that although it has always had the power to change or suspend the operation of any tariff filed with it, \u00a7 3.1 of BG&amp;E\u2019s tariff, and particularly \u00a7 3.1 (b), has been in existence for over forty years without substantial change by the Commission. It is well settled that the construction of a law by the agency charged with its enforcement, acquiesced in by the legislature, is entitled to great weight and should not be disregarded except for the strongest and most urgent reasons. See <em>Palm Oil Recovery v. Comptroller, </em>266 Md. 148, 291 A. 2d 681 (1972); <em>Frank J. Klein &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>233 Md. 490, 197 A. 2d 243 (1964); <em>Comptroller v. M. E. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 107 A. 2d 93 (1954); <em>Dept. of Tide. Fisheries v. Sollers, </em>201 Md. 603, 95 A. 2d 306 (1953). Accordingly, we find no merit in the Commission\u2019s argument that we must construe The Public Service Commission Law without regard to whether HRD\u2019s sales were made to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The Commission admits that it treats a landlord\u2019s act of furnishing electricity to its tenants and charging them for that service as a part of the rent, as a lawful practice, not subject to regulation. Although it admits \u00a7 3.1 is valid insofar as it permits such an arrangement, it contends that it is invalid to the extent that it allows a landlord to make a separate charge for electricity. This conclusion cannot be justified under the Commission\u2019s own argument that a literal construction of The Public Service Commission Law must be made to determine its applicability, as both transactions fall under the definition of \u201celectrical company\u201d in Article 78, \u00a7 2 f. The hearing examiner concluded that electricity furnished and charged for as a part of the rent was not a sale within the definition of \u201celectrical company\u201d and the Commission now maintains that the landlord in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>such a transaction is gambling on the fact that the price of electricity will not be increased, and, therefore, is not selling electricity in the same manner as BG&amp;E. We note that the sale of electricity by a company is not a prerequisite to its being deemed an \u201celectrical company\u201d within \u00a7 2 f, as any company that owns a plant and transmits electricity is within the literal definition of that sub-section. The distinction offered by the Commission provides no basis for differentiating between separate charges and those included in the rent. The \u201cgamble\u201d taken by a landlord is irrelevant to the question of whether his activities are subject to regulation \u2014 a charge for electricity included in the rent is no less a sale than a charge made separate therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">We hold that The Public Service Commission Law does not extend to sales of electricity made by a landlord to its tenants as an incident to that relation. Our decision is, we think, wholly consonant with both the limits placed upon the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction in \u00a7 1 of Article 78,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the considerable weight of authority from other jurisdictions.5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>*8</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We conclude, therefore, that HRD is not providing a public service subject to regulation under The Public Service Commission Law. The Commission notes that like, the service provided in <em>Yeatman, </em>HRD services \u201cover one hundred customers\u201d and argues, therefore, that it performs a public service and makes public sales. In <em>Yeatman, </em>there was no landlord-tenant relation. Griffin conveyed the tract to Blackshere and retained no control over it. He was not \u201climited in his agreement to supply only a definite limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>number\u201d of houses on the tract, nor was he prohibited by that agreement from supplying other homes. He agreed to supply water to all the houses to be built on the tract, and his sales were made to the general public. HRD, however, is making a private sale, limited to its tenants, and made as an incident to the business of renting commercial space. The fact that HRD is making a profit on the transaction does not change the \u201cincidental\u201d nature of the sale. The Commission argues that the legislative intent behind The Public Service Commission Law, to regulate the monopoly of sales and services of public utilities, merits the regulation of HRD. However, the price and quality of the service furnished by HRD in providing its tenants with electricity is not separable from its business of renting commercial space; it is but a part of the overall cost of occupancy. Both the price of the electricity supplied, and the quality of service incidental thereto, must of necessity be competitive with that of other landlords. As noted in the 1913 opinion of the Commission\u2019s General Counsel, the tenant can \u201cescape the burden\u201d of an unduly onerous charge by going elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. The examiner stated: \u201cPublic service companies are not created by operations under tariff provisions of a utility with public service company status. Rather they must meet the requirements of The Public Service Commission Law. If HRD is to sell electricity, its corporate charter must provide for operation as an electric company in the City of Columbia and under Section 24(a) of The Public Service Commission Law it must obtain our permission to exercise, in the public interest, such franchise as is granted by lawn Thereafter, HRD would have to comply with all of the provisions of The Public Service Commission Law including, but not limited to, rates, service, issuance of securities and reporting.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\">. Maryland Code (1969 Repl. Volj, Article 78, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cThe jurisdiction and powers of the Public Service Commission shall extend to all public service companies, as hereinafter defined, engaged in or operating a utility business in this State, and to certain additional motor carriers, as hereinafter provided, to the full extent permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

The definition of the term \u201celectrical corporation\u201d included the reference \u201cor for any public use whatsoever\" until The Public Service Commission Law was repealed and completely revised by the enactment of Chapter 441, Acts of 1955. Nothing in that Act indicates an intent on the part of the legislature to eliminate the distinction between public and private sales of electricity or to withdraw its recognition, evidenced by a long-continued acquiescence in the Commission\u2019s construction and enforcement of The Public Service Commission Law, of the fact that such sales made by a landlord to its tenants are not subject to regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b186-5\">. Section 3.1 of the tariff, in its original form, allowed a landlord renting space for domestic use to furnish electricity to its tenants and charge them either as a part of the rent or by a separate charge.
