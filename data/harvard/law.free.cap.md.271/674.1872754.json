Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 8 (2), 14 (b) (2)-* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">Greyhound rests its challenge on three arguments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">(i) Software is not tangible personal property subject to tax;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">(ii) The Department may not assess software <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u2014having substantial value\u2014as if it were tangible personal property merely because certain elements of the software have been placed upon or relate to certain tangible items like cards or magnetic tapes which have insignificant value; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5o\">(iii) The tax court\u2019s finding that \u201csoftware\u201d was not severable from, and was an integral part of, hardware is unsupported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Because we have concluded that there is a legal infirmity in the result reached by the tax court, we shall deal only tangentially with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The tax court seems to have had no difficulty in affirming the Department\u2019s assessment which had been based on the purchase price paid IBM for a \u201cbundle\u201d of computer hardware and software, less an appropriate allowance for depreciation. The court noted that the data processing equipment \u2014 computer hardware \u2014 was inoperable without the programming and services \u2014 the software \u2014 which were a part of the package. The court also found that the value of the software had not been separately recorded on Greyhound\u2019s books.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">As a result, the only estimate of the value of the software came from Walter Misdom, a consultant in the field of computer market research, who was the only witness. Mr. Misdom testified that when IBM in 1969 abandoned its policy of bundling hardware and some of the software, the sale price of its computer hardware dropped about 3%. However, by utilizing what he estimated IBM\u2019s budget allocations for the year 1968 to have been, he concluded that about 33% of the purchase price paid IBM by Greyhound was properly allocable to software. The tax court concluded, however, that the software was simply not severable from the hardware for purposes of assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">What is troublesome about this approach is the fact that while a substantial portion of the software is of a tangible nature, <em>i.e., </em>punched cards, magnetic tapes, instructions covering operation or applications, and thus might well be subject to assessment and taxation under Code (1957, 1969 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Repl. Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 8 (2), the remainder consists of personal services to be rendered after purchase which were characterized by the tax court in this manner:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\"><em>\u201cSYSTEMS ENGINEERING SERVICES: </em>services provided by the software developer to evaluate and meet the problem solving needs of electronic data processing equipment, including the preparation of feasibility studies, systems analysis and design services, the planning and writing of basic operations programs and application programs, and the debugging testing documentation development and the improvement of these programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\"><em>\u201cEDUCATIONAL SERVICES: </em>training and instruction in the use of electronic data processing equipment provided to the user thereof, such as on site education, classroom instructions and educational publications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\"><em>\u201cMAINTENANCE: </em>tests, measurements, replacements, adjustments and repairs intended to keep data processing equipment in satisfactory working condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">A tenable argument may be made in support of the notion that at least that part of the tangible software which constitutes the operational program, without which a computer cannot operate, may have a value far in excess of that of the cards and tapes themselves, a value which represents large amounts expended by the manufacturer before the sale could take place for research, development, engineering, and the acquisition of expertise and skills.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So much of the software as consists of services to be rendered after the purchase is not only intangible in nature, but is beyond the reach of Code (1957,1969 Repl. Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>(c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> dealing primarily with the taxation of intangibles, which generally permits only the taxation of bonds, certificates of indebtedness or evidence of debt owned by certain corporations. However, it cannot be ascertained from the record before us that portion of the purchase price attributable to such of the software as is tangible, or that portion attributable to that which is intangible.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The difference between the two categories can best be delineated by a simple illustration. A privately commissioned recording, with no restriction on use, of a symphony played by a noted orchestra, has a value far in excess of that of the plastic disc or tape on which it is recorded, and would be subject to assessment for tax purposes at its full cash value. A privately commissioned performance of the same symphony by the same orchestra, however, although it might entail the same expenditure, would produce nothing tangible that could be reached by a tax on personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Another apt analogy may be found in <em>Michael Todd Co. v. County of Los Angeles, </em>57 Cal. 2d 684, 371 P. 2d 340, 21 Cal. Rptr. 604 (1962), where the Supreme Court of California held that the assessment, for purposes of a tax on tangible personal property, of the negatives of the motion picture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>\u201cAround The World In Eighty Days\u201d was not limited to the value of the film on which it had been recorded, in a case where possession of the negative was coupled with a right of reproduction. <em>See also District of Columbia v. Norwood Studios, Inc., </em>336 F. 2d 746 (D.C. Cir. 1964). For a challenge to this analogy, <em>see </em>Heinzman, <em>Computer software: Should it be treated as tangible property for ad valorem tax?, </em>37 J. Taxation 184,185-86 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The problem posed by this case is of relatively recent vintage, encountered with increasing frequency in a rapidly expanding field, Bryant &amp; Mather, <em>Property Taxation of Computer Software, </em>18 N.Y.L.F. 59 (1972). While most states permit some form of taxation on business personal property, policies with respect to the taxation of intangibles vary widely, because such a tax is less uniformly imposed than a tax on tangibles, Bryant &amp; Mather, <em>supra, </em>18 N.Y.L.F. at 59-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">It appears that the few courts which have dealt with the taxation of computer software have rejected the idea that software can be reached by a tax on tangible property, <em>District of Columbia v. Universal Computer Associates, Inc., </em>465 F. 2d 615 (D.C. Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See also County of Sacramento v. Assessment Appeals Bd., </em>32 Cal. App. 3d 654, 671, 108 Cal. Rptr. 434, 446 (1973), where the court remanded the cases in order that revaluations of data processing systems be made for purposes of assessing a property tax against the lessor of those systems, excluding the value of \u201cservice or \u2018software\u2019 intangibles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Since 1972, California has, by statute, provided for the valuation, for tax purposes, of storage media, <em>i.e., </em>punched cards, tapes, discs or drums, for computer programs as if there were no programs on such media except basic operational programs. Cal. Revenue &amp; Taxation Code \u00a7 995 (West Supp. 1974), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cStorage media for computer programs shall be valued ... as if there were no computer program on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>such media except basic operational programs. Otherwise, computer programs shall not be valued for purpose of property taxation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Application programs, <em>inter alia, </em>are specifically exempt from valuation for purposes of property taxation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Cal. Revenue &amp; Taxation Code \u00a7\u00a7 995, 995.1, 995.2 (West Supp. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We note that the Internal Revenue Service permits a taxpayer to differentiate between hardware and software for purposes of depreciation. Rev. Proc. 69-21, 1969-2 Cum. Bull. 303, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201cSec. 4. Costs of Purchased Software.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">\u201c0.1 With respect to costs of purchased software, the Service will not disturb the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of such costs if the following practices are consistently followed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\u201c1. Where such costs are included, without being separately stated, in the cost of the hardware (computer) and such costs are treated as a part of the cost of the hardware that is capitalized and depreciated; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">\u201c2. Where such costs are separately stated, and the software is treated by the taxpayer as an intangible asset the cost of which is to be recovered by amortization deductions ratably over a period of five years or such shorter period as can be established by the taxpayer as appropriate in any particular case if the useful life of the software in his hands will be less than five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">This leads us to believe that the tax court erred, as a matter of law, when it decided that the cost of the software <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>was inseparable from that of the hardware, and, on this premise, determined to affirm an assessment based on the aggregate purchase price, less depreciation, which was designed to establish the full cash value mandated by Code (1957,1969 Repl. Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 14 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">We recognize that the burden of showing error in the assessment was Greyhound\u2019s, <em>Fairchild Hiller Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>267 Md. 519, 523, 298 A. 2d 148, 150 (1973). Certainly Mr. Misdom\u2019s testimony in this area provided scant predicate for an incisive factual determination. There was testimony, however, that some software can now be purchased separately, so that it may well be possible to establish the cost of a software package comparable to that provided by IBM, and then to allocate that cost between the tangible property which is acquired and the services which are to be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We shall therefore remand the cases in order to give Greyhound and LMC an opportunity to establish by competent evidence, the cost or value of the several items of software, leaving to the tax court the determination of a proper assessable basis for the tangible software.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\n<em>Tax Court Case TP-C 356, Greyhound Computer Corporation v. State Department of Assessments and Taxation,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\n<em>and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">\n<em>Tax Court Case TP-C 359, LMC Leasing Corporation v. State Department of Assessments and Taxation, remanded as permitted by Maryland Rule 871 a, 'without affirmance or reversal, for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">\n<em>Costs of this appeal to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\">. International Business Machines Corporation, the manufacturer of the equipment, had charged Greyhound approximately $2,646,000.00 for both the data processing equipment (\u201ccomputer hardware\u201d), and the programs and educational and engineering service (\u201ccomputer software\u201d). When the sale was made, it was the manufacturer\u2019s policy to \u201cbundle\u201d the cost of hardware and software. This policy was changed, commencing in June of 1969, when some software was \u201cunbundled\u201d from hardware.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">. Both appeals are siblings of State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Greyhound Computer Corp., 271 Md. 575, 320 A. 2d 40 (1974), in which the same parties, the same computers, but different issues, were involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">. \u201cAfter hearing the evidence in this case the first finding the court is constrained to make is that, in the computer age, lawyers and courts need no longer feel ashamed or even sensitive about the charge, often made, that they confuse the issue by resort to legal jargon, law Latin or Norman French. By comparison, the misnomers and industrial shorthand of the computer world make the most esoteric legal writing seem as clear and lucid as the Ten Commandments or the Gettysburg Address; and to add to this Babel, the experts in the computer field, while using exactly the same words, uniformly disagree as to precisely what they mean. Such being the state of the art, the court concludes that ... it should make at least a preliminary attempt at computer definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">\u201cPerhaps the best recognized and most easily understood dichotomy in the trade is between \u2018hardware\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018software\u2019 on the other, and even here the experts do not always agree as to whether a particular item falls in one category or the other. Generally speaking, \u2018hardware\u2019 refers to the naked, tangible parts of the machinery itself, while \u2018software\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>denotes the information loaded into the machine and the directions given to the machine (usually by card or teleprompter) as to what it is to do and upon what command. \u2018Software\u2019 is also frequently used to include \u2018support\u2019 \u2014 that is, advice, assistance, counseling, and sometimes even expert engineering help furnished by the vendor in loading the machine for a certain program such as inventory control or preparation of payroll.\u201d Honeywell, Inc. v.
