There is no dispute as to the material facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">The appellee Castlewood Realty Company, Inc., controlled by majority shareholders Walter L. McManus, Sr. and Walter L. McManus, Jr., owned a tract of land situated partly in Baltimore City and partly in Baltimore County. On May 6, 1965, the McManuses, through another corporation controlled by them, entered into a lease agreement with Food Fair Stores, Inc. Under the lease agreement with Food Fair, the McManuses agreed to construct a shopping center on the tract and to lease a portion of it to Food Fair for a supermarket. Thereafter, the McManuses actively sought a purchaser for the land and entered into negotiations with Food Fair. As a result of these negotiations, Food Fair claimed that the parties had entered into a binding contract whereby Food Fair would purchase the tract of land. When it appeared that the McManuses did not share their view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Food Fair sought specific performance of either the agreement to construct a shopping center or the alleged agreement to sell them the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">While the Food Fair suit was in litigation, the McManuses leased the property, subject to several conditions, to another company, the Padonia Land Company, Inc. The lease between the McManuses and the Padonia Land Company resulted, to a large extent, from the efforts of appellant W. C. Pinkard &amp; Company, Inc., a real estate broker. One of the stipulated conditions before the lease with the Padonia Land Company could become operative, was that the McManuses successfully defend the Food Fair suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Three months after the execution of the Padonia lease, the appellant W. C. Pinkard &amp; Company and the appellee Castlewood Realty Company entered into a commission agreement, which provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201cIn accordance with our discussions our commission in connection with this transaction only becomes due when the ground lease becomes operative. In that event you will pay to the W. C. Pinkard &amp; Company TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ($25,000) DOLLARS in three equal annual installments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On September 30, 1970, the Circuit Court of Baltimore City rendered an opinion upholding Food Fair\u2019s contention that it had contracted for the purchase of the tract of. land, and the court ordered specific performance of the contract. On March 4, 1971, the McManuses and the Padonia Land Company entered into a termination agreement, the terms of which cancelled the lease agreement between them and discharged their respective liabilities under that agreement. The termination agreement resulted from the decision by the McManuses and the Padonia Land Company, after consultation with their attorneys, that the chances of a successful appeal of the Food Fair litigation were minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Thereafter, the broker W. C. Pinkard &amp; Company brought this action against Castlewood in the Superior Court of Baltimore City, claiming a right to a $25,000 commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>under the brokerage agreement, even though the ground lease with the Padonia Land Company did not become \u201coperative.\u201d Based on an agreed statement of facts, the trial judge (Carter, J.) concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission, and judgment was awarded in favor of the defendant Castlewood.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Since the broker and Castlewood entered into a brokerage agreement containing provisions as to when the broker\u2019s right to a commission accrued, the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.), Art. 21, \u00a7 14-105, are inapplicable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The terms of the contract, specifying when the broker was entitled to a commission, are controlling. <em>Snider Bros. v. Heft, </em>271 Md. 409, 317 A. 2d 848 (1974); <em>Prince George\u2019s Club v. Carr, </em>235 Md. 591, 603, 202 A. 2d 354 (1964); <em>Chasanow v. Willcox, </em>220 Md. 171, 176, 151 A. 2d 748 (1959); <em>Goss v. Hill, </em>219 Md. 304, 307-308, 149 A. 2d 10 (1959). The brokerage agreement h\u00e9re was explicit and unambiguous. Appellant was to be awarded its commission \u201conly ... when the ground lease becomes operative.\u201d By virtue of the termination agreement between the McManuses and the Padonia Land Company, described above, the ground lease never became \u201coperative.\u201d The condition specified in the brokerage agreement failed to materialize. Consequently, under the terms of the brokerage agreement, appellant has no right to a commission. <em>Prince George\u2019s Club v. Carr, supra; Chasanow v. Willcox, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">However, the appellant broker argues that the voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>act of the McManuses eliminated any possibility that the required condition would occur. It is contended that the McManuses owed a duty to the broker to appeal the Food Fair suit so as to save the condition from failing. Reliance is placed on the principle set forth in 3A Corbin, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 768, p. 548 (1960), that a principal cannot defeat his real estate broker\u2019s right to a commission by preventing the occurrence of a condition by \u201crefusing to make the conveyance\u201d or \u201cby a voluntary rescission\u201d of the transaction. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the McManuses could not defeat the broker\u2019s right to a commission by refusing to consummate or voluntarily 'rescinding the agreement with the Padonia Land Company, we think it clear that the McManuses\u2019 actions did not constitute a refusal to consummate or a voluntary rescission. The ground lease with the Padonia Land Company did not become operative because of the vigorously contested litigation with Food Fair. The decision not to appeal the result of such litigation, after advice of counsel that an appeal would probably not be successful, does not constitute a refusal to consummate or a voluntary rescission of the agreement with the Padonia Land Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">.
