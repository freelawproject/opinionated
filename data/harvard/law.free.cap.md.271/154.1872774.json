(Dominion), appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Jenifer, J.) which affirmed the judgment of the lower court. Dominion then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court. We granted the writ so that we might consider the question this case presents under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which requires an interpretation of Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.) Art. 95B, \u00a7 3-406.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">In 1971, Dominion entered into a contract with the Baltimore County Board of Education to construct the Randallstown Elementary School. It then entered into a subcontract with \u201cTown &amp; Country Decorating, Inc.\u201d (Town &amp; Country) for the performance of the tile work on that project. Town &amp; Country purchased materials for the job from Conwed Corporation (Conwed). On June 22, 1971, the three corporations entered into what the parties here have labeled a \u201cjoint pay agreement.\u201d Actually, the arrangement merely consisted of a letter from Conwed [Corporation] to Dominion requesting the latter to \u201center into a joint pay agreement with Town &amp; Country Decorating, Inc.,\u201d and notifying Dominion of the charges then due from Town &amp; Country to Conwed for materials furnished on the school project.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Each of the companies apparently understood that a \u201cjoint pay agreement\u201d connoted payment of Town &amp; Country\u2019s account, under its subcontract, by a check from Dominion payable jointly to Town &amp; Country [the subcontractor] and Conwed [the materialman]. Such arrangements\u2014designed to protect the general contractor and materialman \u2014 are not uncommon in the construction industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">On July 27, 1971, Dominion issued a check drawn upon First National in the amount of $3,933.20 \u2014 the amount which it then owed Town <em>&amp; </em>Country \u2014 payable to \u201cTown &amp; Country Decorating and Conwed.\u201d First National was not advised of the \u201cjoint pay agreement.\u201d The check was delivered to one Charles Gabriszeski (Gabriszeski), an employee of Town &amp; Country assigned to the project. On the same day, Gabriszeski, without authorization, took the check to a suburban branch office of First National, where he opened a business checking account in the name of \u201cCharles Gabriszeski T/A Town &amp; Country Decorating &amp; Conwed.\u201d The check was deposited in that account. He indicated on the signature card that he was a self-employed acoustical tile contractor; he also furnished addresses and telephone numbers for both \u201chome\u201d and \u201cbusiness,\u201d a bank reference and his social security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">At the trial, the assistant branch manager who handled the transaction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cWhen I took the check from Mr. Gabriszeski, I read the name and said this is a most unusual name why do you use this. And he said because I use the products of Conwed and I like the name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">She also testified that when a check is made payable to two persons, the endorsement of each is required. When asked whether this check put her \u201con notice of the fact that maybe it was payable to different people,\u201d she replied \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The bank employee explained that she did not call Dominion because \u201cI accepted the check from Mr. Gabriszeski for deposit. If I would attempt to call everyone that gives me a check for deposit, I\u2019d be all day.\u201d She also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>testified, \u201cTown &amp; Country and Decorating [sic] could be a trading as name. I took it as such. Conwed itself is an unusual name but not to have two names in a title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Another bank representative testified that when it was brought to his attention by Dominion that the check had been accepted on July 27 without a personal endorsement, he called Gabriszeski who returned on September 21, 1971, and placed his personal signature below the \u201ctrade name.\u201d He also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cHe signed it and I said this is a trading as account and he said it is. I questioned him what is Town &amp; Country Decorating and Conwed and he said I use the name of Conwed to let my clients know that I use this product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Suffice it to say that by the time Gabriszeski returned on September 21 to personally endorse the check, there were no longer any funds remaining in the recently opened account. The result of these events was that Conwed did not receive the amount then owed to it by Town &amp; Country \u2014 $2,908.84. Hence, it made a claim in that sum against a performance bond which had been issued to Dominion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Having reimbursed Conwed for this loss, Dominion brought suit against First National for the $2,908.84, alleging that the latter had breached its duty \u201cnot to cash or pass such a check except for the endorsement of the designated payees.\u201d The case came on for trial before Judge Buzzell of the District Court of Maryland for District 8 (Baltimore County) who found in favor of First National. He held that Dominion had been guilty of negligence which \u201ccontributed substantially\u201d to the making of an unauthorized signature by Gabriszeski and the resulting payment of the proceeds to him. On appeal to the circuit court, the district court decision was affirmed by Judge Jenifer who also held that Dominion\u2019s manner of drawing the check constituted negligence which \u201csubstantially contributed to the negotiation of the instrument by Gabriszeski.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The single question presented therefore is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>two courts below correctly interpreted and applied \u00a7 3-406 of Art. 95B, the UCC, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">\u201cAny person who <em>by his negligence substantially contributes </em>to a material alteration of the instrument or <em>to the making of an unauthorized signature </em>is precluded from asserting the alteration or lack of authority against a holder in due course or against a drawee or other payor who pays the instrument <em>in good faith </em>and in accordance with the <em>reasonable commercial standards </em>of the drawee\u2019s or payor\u2019s business.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We think the decisions reached by both the circuit court and the district court were correct; hence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Three questions arise in the application of \u00a7 3-406 to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">(1) Did the actions of Dominion, in drawing the checks as it did, constitute negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">(2) Did the negligence of Dominion, if any, substantially contribute to the unauthorized signatures by Gabriszeski?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">(3) If the first two issues are answered affirmatively, did First National pay the check \u201cin accordance with . . . reasonable commercial standards of [its] business\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Although a drawee in such circumstances is required to act \u201cin good faith,\u201d that element of \u00a7 3-406 is not an issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">In attacking the trial judge\u2019s finding of negligence, Dominion contends that its failure to designate the payees correctly on the check may have been a \u201ctechnical\u201d error, but rose no higher than \u201cmere laxity,\u201d and therefore was not \u201cnegligence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3-406.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Since neither \u00a7 3-406 nor any other part of the UCC defines \u201cnegligence,\u201d we look to the Official Comment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>guidance. At the very outset, it points out that \u00a7 3-406 has no statutory antecedent. Comment 3 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">\u201cNo attempt is made to define negligence which will contribute to an alteration. The question is left to the court or the jury upon the circumstances of the particular cases .. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Comment 7 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201c The section applies the same rule to negligence which contributes to a forgery or other unauthorized signature, as defined in this Act (Section 1-201). ... As in the case of alteration, no attempt is made to specify what is negligence, and the question is one for the court or the jury on the .facts of the particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">While \u00a7 3-406 itself is a creature of the UCC, the question whether under given circumstances one has negligently brought about an alteration or unauthorized signature is not wholly without precedent in Maryland. <em>See Martin Co. v. Fidelity Bank, </em>218 Md. 28, 145 A. 2d 267 (1958), where we were concerned with the application of Section 23 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (\u00a7 3-404 of the UCC). In that case, the Martin Company had conducted business relationships with two companies bearing the same names. A group of six checks was drawn payable to the wrong one; even the address of the wrong company appeared on the face of each check. They were then mailed to the wrong payee which obtained payment by forged endorsements.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">On being sued by the drawer, the bank contended that the former was precluded from asserting the forgeries because of its negligence. The finding of the trial court that the drawer was negligent in drawing and in mailing the checks to the wrong payee was affirmed on appeal to this Court. While we did not expressly so state, that we there applied the standard of ordinary care is implicit in our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">It is no longer open to question that the term, \u201cnegligence,\u201d as used in \u00a7 3-406, means the failure to exercise ordinary care, <em>Gast v. American Casualty Company </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>of Reading, Pa., </em>99 N. J. Super. 538, 240 A. 2d 682, 685 (1968); <em>Exchange Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Kidwell Constr. Co., </em>463 S.W.2d 465, 469 (Tex. Civ. App. 1971), <em>aff'd </em>472 S.W.2d 117 (Tex. 1971); <em>Terry v. Puget Sound National Bank, </em>80 Wash. 2d 157, 492 P. 2d 534, 535 (1972); see <em>Bagby v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>348 F. Supp. 969, 977 (W. D. Mo. 1972). <em>But see National Bank </em>&amp; Tr. <em>Co. of Cent. Pa. v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Pa. Cmwlth. 358, 305 A. 2d 769 (1973), where a sharply divided Court rejected the standard of ordinary care in applying \u00a7 3-406, concluding \u201cthat a finding of more than ordinary negligence is necessary under the language of \u00a7 3-406 before that section operates to preclude recovery on a forged endorsement,\u201d 305 A. 2d at 772. We decline to follow that isolated decision which departs from the overwhelming weight of authority. The sounder view is reflected by the well-reasoned dissenting opinion in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Although the trial judge rested his finding of negligence primarily on Dominion\u2019s failure to identify each of the intended payees as corporations, it is apparent from the record that, in reaching that decision, he also considered these additional facts which were uncontradicted: That Dominion failed to advise First National of the \u201cjoint pay agreement,\u201d and that it failed to draw the check so as to make it properly payable to joint payees. Oddly enough, Dominion incorrectly named the very payee who had requested the joint payment. We need not decide whether any of these acts or omissions, taken individually, would have been sufficient to support the court\u2019s ruling; in the aggregate they were. The finding of negligence, therefore, was amply supported by the totality of the evidence. As such, it was in accord with the statement in Official Comment 7 that the determination of negligence <em>vel non </em>should turn \u201con the facts of the particular case.\u201d We cannot say that the judgment, insofar as it rested on this determination, was clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Moving to the next requirement of \u00a7 3-406, Dominion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>contends that the words, \u201csubstantially contributes,\u201d as used therein, mean that \u201cthe negligence of the drawer must directly and proximately cause\u201d the unauthorized signature for the preclusion to be invoked under the statute. It maintains, of course, that First National has failed to sustain its burden of proof in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Unquestionably \u201cproximate cause\u201d was the generally applied rule prior to the adoption of the UCC, <em>Martin Co. v. Fidelity Bank, supra; cf. Fargo National Bank v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>400 F. 2d 223, 227 (8th Cir. 1968). In some cases, it has been followed even under the UCC. <em>See e.g., Society Nat. Bank of Cleveland v. Capital Nat. Bank, </em>30 Ohio App. 2d 1, 281 N.E.2d 563, 566 (1972). The majority of courts which have had occasion to consider the question, however, do not equate \u201csubstantially contributes\u201d with \u201cproximate <em>cause,\u201d Bagby v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner </em>&amp; <em>Smith, Inc., supra; Gast v. American Casualty Company of Reading, Pa., supra; Fidelity </em>&amp; <em>Deposit Co. of Md. v. Chemical Bank of N. Y. T. Co., </em>65 Misc. 2d 619, 318 N.Y.S.2d 957 (1970) <em>aff'd mem., </em>333 N.Y.S.2d 726 (1972); <em>Gresham State Bank v. O and K Construction Co., </em>231 Ore. 106, 370 P. 2d 726, 100 A.L.R.2d 654 (1962); <em>opinion clarified, rehearing denied, </em>231 Ore. 106, 372 P. 2d 187 (1962); <em>Thompson Maple Products v. Citizens National Bank, </em>211 Pa. Super. 42, 234 A. 2d 32,34 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In <em>Fidelity, supra, </em>the court quoted with approval from <em>Thompson, supra, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201cThis section [\u00a7 3-406] abandons the language of the older cases (negligence which directly and proximately affects the conduct of the bank in passing the forgery), shortened the chain of causation and modified the doctrine by specifying negligence which substantially contributes to the making of an unauthorized signature. . . . McKinney\u2019s UCC 3-406 Practice Commentary indicates that the section gives statutory sanction to the duty of the drawer to protect the drawee against forgeries, imposes additional duties on a bank\u2019s customer and will increase the duty of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>owed to the drawee by the one who sets the instrument in motion.\u201d 318 N.Y.S.2d at 959.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The common thread running through these cases is that the substantial contribution test under the UCC includes negligent conduct on the part of the drawer which previously had been viewed as too remote in the chain of causation to preclude recovery. The new standard has replaced \u201cproximate cause\u201d with the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test enunciated in Restatement, Second, Torts \u00a7 431 (1965). The discussion of the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test in Prosser, Torts \u00a7 41 (4th ed. 1971) leaves no doubt that it is broader than the \u201cbut for\u201d formula traditionally applied in deciding questions of \u201cproximate cause,\u201d <em>Bagby v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner </em>&amp; <em>Smith, Inc., supra, </em>at 978, nn. 6, 7; <em>Gast v. American Casualty Company of Reading, Pa., supra, </em>at 685; <em>Gresham State Bank v. O and K Construction Co., supra, </em>at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The phrase, \u201csubstantially contributes,\u201d in \u00a7 3-406 has been applied in an assortment of factual situations with equally varied results. Since it is generally regarded as broader than the \u201cbut for\u201d test, it follows that if an act is a substantial factor in causing a particular result, the negligent person will not be absolved from liability merely because other elements may have contributed to that result. In the case at bar, however, the trier of fact could even have found under the evidence that \u201cbut for\u201d Dominion\u2019s negligence, there would have been no unauthorized signature. At the very least, therefore, whether Dominion\u2019s negligence \u2014 as previously explicated \u2014 was a substantial factor in causing the forgery presented a question of fact. Hence, we will not disturb the trial judge\u2019s decision on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Lastly, we consider Dominion\u2019s argument that notwithstanding its own conduct in drawing the check, it is not precluded from contesting the unauthorized signature because First National paid the check contrary to \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d of the banking business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Specifically, it urges that the word \u201cand,\u201d instead of the ampersand (\u201c&amp;\u201d) in the designation of the payee should have put the bank employee on notice of a \u201cjoint pay\u201d check; and that she should have been on \u201csufficient notice to make that one phone call.\u201d The district court did not decide this issue, undoubtedly because Dominion presented no evidence of what was required by ordinary banking standards. Dominion\u2019s argument was rejected by the circuit court for the same reason. While we question whether the issue has been properly preserved for appellate review, Rule 885, we shall nevertheless consider it because of its importance to a thorough application of \u00a7 3-406.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The requirement of \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d in the context of \u00a7 3-406 has been considered by only a few courts. In <em>Gresham State Bank v. O and K Construction Co., supra, </em>a bookkeeper in a construction office received a number of checks payable to his employer, on which, by the use of a rubber stamp supplied by the employer, he was able to endorse \u201c0 &amp; K Construction Co., Route 1, Gresham, Oregon\u201d; beneath that he signed his name followed by the designation \u201cOffice Manager.\u201d Over a period of three years, he cashed 30 checks at a store located a half block from the construction company. The store made no inquiry concerning the employee\u2019s right to endorse and cash the checks. In holding that the store did not make payment in accordance with the reasonable commercial standards of its business, the Oregon court noted that the employee did not cash the checks in connection with any purchase of items on behalf of the construction company, and that he received in cash the whole amount of each check, some of which were for substantial sums. <em>See Salsman v. National Community Bank of Rutherford, </em>102 N. J. Super. 482, 246 A. 2d 162, 168 (1968), <em>aff'd </em>105 N. J. Super. 164, 251 A. 2d 460 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In <em>Cooper v. Union Bank, </em>107 Cal. Rptr. 1, 507 P. 2d 609 (1973), also a case involving forged endorsements by a dishonest employee, the court appropriately observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201c . . . Nothing on the face of the instruments would have led the bank to suspect they were irregular in any way. A single branch of a large bank,' as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>testimony indicated, may handle several thousand instruments bearing third party indorsements in a single day. Considering this burden, it would be commercially unreasonable to expect payor banks to undertake foolproof efforts to verify ostensibly valid indorsements.\u201d 507 P. 2d at 620.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Cf. Feldman Construction Company v. Union Bank, </em>28 Cal. App. 3d 731, 104 Cal. Rptr. 912 (1972), where a check was drawn payable to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cInterstate Steel Corp. General Pipe &amp; Supply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">On the back of the check, above where endorsements were to be placed, was written the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\u201cEndorsement of this check acknowledges payment as of this date all material and labor at A.I.C. Bldg. 8060 Florence Ave. Downey, Calif.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The check was deposited by Interstate Steel in its checking account bearing only its endorsement and that of its president; there was no endorsement by General Pipe &amp; Supply Company. In holding that the bank had b\u00e9en negligent in making payment on the improperly endorsed check, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">\u201c . . . [T]hat the check was payable jointly to two payees and required the endorsement of both. The two payees were identified on the face of the check as separate entities, one by \u2018Corp.\u2019 and one by \u2018Co.\u2019, the one name placed on top of the other on separate lines. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">\u201cIn addition, the endorsement on the back of the check made it clear what type of transaction was in progress; it was payment by a general contractor to a subcontractor and the materialman who had supplied the subcontractor. Although direct evidence was not taken below concerning ordinary business practices in the building industry, the notation on the check itself provides evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>drawer\u2019s intent to pay two parties jointly (citation omitted); he was discharging a debt owed to the subcontractor while protecting the company against the lien of an unpaid materialman. . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">28 Cal. App. 3d at 734-35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In <em>Thompson Maple Products v. Citizens National Bank, supra, </em>the wrongdoer was entrusted with a number of checks over a period of some three years, ostensibly for the purpose of delivering them to the rightful payees. He then forged the payee\u2019s signature on each check and either cashed or deposited them in his bank account. The court there answered the contention that the checks were not paid in accordance with \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d by observing that \u201cthe checks were regular on their face and bore the purported endorsement of the named payee.\u201d 234 A. 2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In the final analysis, as with the other components of \u00a7 3-406, what constitutes a breach of \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d must be decided in the context of a specific set of facts, Note, <em>Forgeries and Material Alterations: Allocation of Risks Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 50 </em>Boston Univ. L. Rev. 536, 547 (1970). Here, the bank employee who handled the transaction with Gabriszeski questioned him concerning the use of two names in his trade name, and received what was a reasonable explanation under the circumstances. Gabriszeski then filled out a signature card with his name, addresses and telephone numbers for home and business; and also furnished his social security number. He told the employee he was an acoustical tile contractor and deposited the check in the new account under the trade name. We might also note in passing that it was not improper for her to accept the check for deposit without requiring his personal endorsement, Art. 95B, \u00a7 4-205.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">This was not a case in which the check reasonably appeared to be payable to joint payees; nor was First National made aware, either by the manner in which the check was drawn or by notification of the \u201cjoint pay agreement,\u201d of any intention to make the check jointly payable to the subcontractor and the materialman. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was nothing on the face of the check to justifiably arouse any suspicion on the part of First National, nor was there any other irregularity in the transaction. Considering that this was a <em>deposit </em>of the check by an ostensible payee who freely identified himself \u2014 and not a case involving a forgery of the drawer\u2019s signature \u2014 Dominion failed to establish sufficient facts from which the court below could have found that First National acted contrary to \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d of the banking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">By its negligence, Dominion substantially contributed to the making of the unauthorized signature; and since First National acted in accordance with \u201creasonable commercial standards,\u201d Dominion is precluded by \u00a7 3-406 from asserting the forgery. Thus, the circuit court correctly affirmed the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
