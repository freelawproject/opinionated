J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWs\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Appellee Xerox Corporation manufactures duplicating equipment and appellees Xerox Data Systems, Inc. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Sperry Rand Corporation manufacture data processing equipment; each manufacturer leases the equipment to its customers. Appellees LMC Leasing Corporation and Greyhound Computer Corporation are \u201cnon-manufacturers\u201d who purchase and thereafter lease data processing equipment to their customers. For a number of years prior to the tax year 1970, the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the Department) had assessed the equipment of the appellees on the basis of the lesser of its \u201ccost to the taxpayer,\u201d or its market value (if the taxpayer could demonstrate that market value was less than the original cost of acquisition), less an allowance for depreciation. Thus the property manufactured and leased by Xerox, Xerox Data and Sperry Rand was assessed, in years prior to 1970, at its cost of manufacture while like property purchased and leased by LMC and Greyhound was assessed on the higher valuation basis of its purchase price.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Consistent with this long-standing assessment practice, the Department, for the 1969 tax year, assessed data processing equipment owned by the Boothe Computer Corporation, which Boothe had purchased from a lessee of the IBM Corporation and had thereafter leased to its customers, on the basis of its purchase price. Boothe protested the assessment in October of 1969, maintaining that the \u201ccost to the taxpayer\u201d basis of assessment resulted in nonuniform assessments of identical property in that the assessment of its equipment, based on its purchase price, was five times higher than the assessment of identical equipment owned by IBM \u2014 a manufacturer of data processing equipment who leased it to its customers and who was assessed on the lower basis of its cost of manufacture. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Pending decision of the issue presented by Boothe\u2019s protest, the Department, prior to January 1, 1970, instructed its assessors not to levy assessments for the 1970 tax year on equipment leased by manufacturers; it reasoned that if Boothe\u2019s position was ultimately upheld, the proper method to achieve uniformity would be to increase the assessment of Boothe\u2019s competitors \u2014 the \u201cmanufacturer-lessors.\u201d On January 23, 1970, following a hearing before the Department on Boothe\u2019s protest, Boothe\u2019s assessment was finalized and it appealed to the Maryland Tax Court. That court, on July 16, 1970, concluded that \u201cthe practice of the Department in assessing leased equipment owned by a manufacturer-lessor at manufacturer\u2019s cost, while assessing the same equipment owned by a nonmanufacturer-lessor at the purchase price is intentional, arbitrary and systematic\u201d; [and that the Department\u2019s action] \u201cviolates the requirement of the Maryland Constitution, Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights, that all taxes shall be uniform within each class, and also denied to the Petitioner the equal protection guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d The Tax Court held that Boothe was \u201centitled to have its property assessed on the same basis as that of similar property in the same subclassification <em>i.e., </em>at manufacturer\u2019s cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Immediately following the Tax Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boothe, </em>the Department determined that for the 1970 tax year all personal property leased by its manufacturer would be assessed at the selling price which the manufacturer would have charged for that equipment at the time its leases were consummated, less an allowance for depreciation. After reviewing the personal property tax returns of thousands of corporations on record, the Department sent letters in early September of 1970 to those corporations which it had determined might lease property which they manufactured. The letter briefly summarized the decision in <em>Boothe </em>and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">in order to obtain uniformity of assessments, that beginning with the tax year 1970, that such manufactured property as leased by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>manufacturer shall be assessed on the same basis as if said property had been sold to the lessee. By this d\u00e9cision then, manufactured property being leased by a manufacturer will no longer be assessed on the basis of cost to the manufacturer, but rather on the basis of what the purchaser of said property would have paid in the year the lease was consummated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The letter concluded with a request that \u201c[i]f your corporation is leasing property which it manufactures, you are to furnish a new listing of all such leased property at the cost it would have charged said lessee in the year the lease contract was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Xerox, Xerox Data and Sperry Rand received such letters, supplied the information under protest, and the equipment which they manufactured and leased was assessed on the basis of its selling price, less an appropriate allowance for depreciation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Department continued its practice for the tax year 1970 of assessing personal property which had been purchased and leased, including that of Greyhound and LMC, on the basis of its purchase price, less depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The appellees unsuccessfully protested their 1970 assessments and each thereafter appealed to the Maryland Tax Court where the cases were consolidated for a hearing on common issues. The Tax Court held that the Department, in instituting a new standard of valuation based on \u201cselling price\u201d for equipment manufactured and leased by manufacturers, while applying the established standard based on cost to the taxpayer for other personal property, had violated Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by creating an unauthorized subclass of personal property and assessing property within the same subclass in a nonuniform manner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The Department has appealed from the order of the Tax Court, remanding the cases for reassessments for the tax year 1970 \u201cat [manufacturer\u2019s] cost less depreciation or market value, whichever is lower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201c. . . [T]he General Assembly shall, by uniform rules, provide for the separate assessment, classification and sub-classification of land, improvements on land and personal property, as it may deem proper; and all taxes thereafter provided to be levied by the State for the support of the general State Government, and by the Counties and by the City of Baltimore for their respective purposes, shall be uniform within each class or sub-class of land, improvements on land and personal property which the respective taxing powers may have directed to be subjected to the tax levy;____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Consistent with this constitutional mandate, the Legislature, by Chapter 73 of the Acts of 1958, made provision for the separate classification of real and personal property and for the sub-classification of personal property for assessment purposes. That Act, codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.), Article 81, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15, and 23 provided in 1970 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">\u201c\u00a7 14 (a) <em>Classificatum. </em>\u2014 Real and personal property shall be separately classified, and personal property separately subclassified for assessment purposes. The following shall be separately subclassified for the purposes of personal property assessments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">(1) Stock in business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">(2) Distilled spirits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">(3) All other personal property directed in this article to be assessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201c(b) <em>Valuation. </em>\u2014 Except as hereinafter provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">(1) All real property directed in this article to be assessed, shall be assessed at the full cash value thereof on the date of finality. The term full cash value as used in this subsection shall mean current value less an allowance for inflation, if in fact inflation exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">(2) All personal property directed in this article to be assessed, shall be assessed at the full cash value thereof on the date of finality. The term full cash value as used in this subsection shall mean current value without any allowance for inflation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Section 15 (a), pertaining to \u201cstock in business,\u201d provided in 1970:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">\u201c(a) <em>Stock in </em>business.\u2014The stock in business of every person, firm or corporation engaged in any manufacturing or commercial business in this State shall be valued and assessed to the owner thereof on the date of finality at its fair average value for the twelve months preceding the date of finality. The term fair average value as used in this section shall mean .cost or market value, whichever is lower, without any allowance for inflation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Section 23, pertaining to the assessment of \u201cdistilled spirits,\u201d provided in 1970 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">\u201c... said spirits shall be valued and assessed at fair value. The term fair value as used in this section shall mean cost oi market value, whichever is lower, without any allowance for inflation.. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">The Department contends that the appellees\u2019 property falls within the subclass \u201c[a]ll other personal property directed in this article to be assessed.\u201d The Department claims that its long-standing practice has been to so classify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the appellees\u2019 property and that the assessment thereof, utilizing selling price and purchase price as methods of valuation, achieves the statutory mandate of assessment at \u201cfull cash value\u201d on the date of finality, as required by \u00a7 14 (b) (2); and that all property within that subclass has been uniformly assessed upon that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">Xerox, Xerox Data and Sperry Rand contend, however, that the property falls within the class of \u201cstock in business,\u201d requiring assessment at its cost of manufacture, to fulfill the mandate of \u00a7 15 (a) that all such property be assessed on the basis of \u201ccost or market value, whichever is lower.\u201d They contend that even if their property is not \u201cstock in business,\u201d but rather is assessable at \u201cfull cash value\u201d under \u00a7 14 (b)(2), the term \u201cfull cash value\u201d has been judicially and administratively recognized as meaning cost or market value, whichever is lower, requiring assessment of their property at its cost of manufacture. They urge that the Department, in assessing their property at its selling price, while assessing the property of others within the same subclass at its cost of acquisition, has violated the uniformity requirements of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Department has illegally changed its standard of valuation without notice after the date of finality (specified in Article 81, \u00a7 29A (a) as January 1). It is also contended that the Department\u2019s assessment of the equipment manufactured and thereafter leased by the Bunker-Ramo Corporation at the cost of manufacture has established an administrative policy requiring the like assessment of the appellees\u2019 leased property. Greyhound and LMC contend that because the property of manufacturer-lessors must be assessed at its manufacturing cost, that same value must be attributed to their property for the purpose of assessing the identical equipment which they lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We find no merit in the appellees\u2019 contention that the property which they lease is \u201cstock in business\u201d within the contemplation of Article 81, \u00a7 14 (a)(1) and \u00a7 15 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Section 8 (5) of Article 81 specifies, for purposes of assessment for personal property taxation, that stock in business of manufacturing or commercial businesses in this State shall be deemed permanently located in the county or city where such business is carried on. The Department claims that \u201cstock in business,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 15 (a), applies only to goods held by a business at its place of business for sale, and not to goods which have left the taxpayer\u2019s possession and control and are being employed by the taxpayer\u2019s customer in the conduct of his business. The cases relied upon by the Department clearly tend to support this position. <em>See State Department of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Bendix Corp., </em>270 Md. 31, 310 A. 2d 43 (1973); <em>National Can Corp. v. State Tax Commission, </em>220 Md. 418, 153 A. 2d 287 (1959); <em>Alban Tractor Co. v. State Tax Commission, </em>219 Md. 593, 150 A. 2d 456 (1959); and <em>Hopkins v. Baker, </em>78 Md. 363, 28 A. 284 (1894). That it has been the long-standing practice of the Department (to which we accord great weight) to consider leased equipment as depreciable assets and not as \u201cstock in business\u201d is abundantly clear from the record; indeed, none of the appellees has ever reported leased equipment oh its return as \u201cstock in business\u201d or \u201cinventory,\u201d the two terms being synonymous for purposes of personal property taxation, <em>National Can Corporation v. State Tax Commission, supra, </em>and <em>Alban Tractor Co. v. State Tax Commission, supra. </em>Referring to stock in business in <em>National Can, </em>we said that \u201c[\u00a1Inventories are held for sale or resale in the hope and expectation of a quick turnover.\u201d 220 Md. at 434. Section 15 (a) provides that stock in business shall be assessed at its \u201cfair average value for the twelve months preceding the date of finality.\u201d This provision, we think, manifests a legislative intent to measure the value of property held for \u201csale or resale,\u201d rather than consumption and a recognition that such value cannot be derived by assessing the property at its value on a single day. The value of the appellees\u2019 property, being of a nature of fixed assets, may be determined without resort to such a formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The appellees rely on several Massachusetts cases to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>support their argument that property leased by a manufacturer or other lessor is properly to be considered as inventory or stock in business for purposes of personal property taxation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And they contend that the Uniform Commercial Code, Article 95B, \u00a7\u00a7 6-102 and 9-109, recognizes leased machinery as \u201cstock in business\u201d of the lessor, as does the Sales Tax Act, Article 81, \u00a7 324. We are not, however, persuaded by the Massachusetts authorities that leased equipment, not \u201cheld for sale or resale in the hope and expectation of a quick turnover\u201d <em>(National Can Corp. v. State Tax Commission, supra), </em>constitutes \u201cstock in business\u201d under \u00a7 15 (a). Nor do we think that the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or the Maryland Sales Tax Act, pertaining to stock in business, evidence a legislative intent to bring the equipment leased by the appellees within the ambit of the term \u201cstock in business,\u201d as used for purposes of personal property taxation in \u00a7 15 (a). See <em>County of Hennepin v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>Minn., 210 N.W.2d 38 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The appellees\u2019 property, being neither \u201cStock in business\u201d nor \u201cDistilled spirits,\u201d necessarily falls within subclass \u00a7 14 (a)(3)\u2014\u201cAll other personal property directed in this article to be assessed.\u201d As heretofore indicated, \u00a7 14 (b)(2) provides that such property \u201cshall be assessed at the full cash value thereof on the date of finality,\u201d the term \u201cfull cash value\u201d being defined in the subsection to mean \u201ccurrent value without any allowance for inflation.\u201d The Department maintains that \u201cfull cash value\u201d means the \u201cmarket value\u201d of the property. We agree. In <em>Schley v. Montgomery County, </em>106 Md. 407, 67 A. 250 (1907), our predecessors considered the validity of the State Tax Commission\u2019s assessment of corporate shares under what was then Article 81, \u00a7 159 of the Maryland Code. Although that section contained no specific direction as to the manner in which the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>shares was to be ascertained, we held that Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which at that time required that taxation be according to the taxpayers\u2019 \u201cactual worth,\u201d imposed a duty upon the Commission to assess the shares by a method that would reflect their \u201cactual value.\u201d We stated, 106 Md. at 410, that \u201c[t]he value of an article is ordinarily what it will bring at a fair sale in the market, unless it be of so special a nature that no market for it exists and then its intrinsic value must be ascertained by a consideration of its cost, nature, utility and other characteristics.\u201d Subsequent cases have relied on <em>Schley </em>to define the term \u201cfull cash value,\u201d as used in Article 81, \u00a7 14, to mean \u201cmarket value\u201d \u2014 what a willing purchaser would pay to a willing seller m the open market. <em>See Weil v. Supervisor of Assessments of Washington County, </em>266 Md. 238, 292 A. 2d 68 (1972); <em>Bornstein v. State Tax Commission, </em>227 Md. 331, 176 A. 2d 859 (1962); <em>Tax Commission v. Brandt Cabinet Works, </em>202 Md. 533, 97 A. 2d 290 (1953); <em>Rogan v. County Commissioners of Calvert County, </em>194 Md. 299, 71 A. 2d 47 (1950). We think that definition is consonant with the natural meaning of the term \u201cfull cash value\u201d; indeed, the weight of authority from other jurisdictions is in accord with this definition, and it was established precedent at the time of the enactment of Art. 81, \u00a7 14 in 1958.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Notwithstanding such precedent, the appellees contend that there is judicial, legislative and administrative authority for the proposition that \u201cfull cash value\u201d means \u201ccost or market value, whichever is lower,\u201d and that the assessment of their property must, therefore, be at the cost of manufacture. They argue that in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. State Tax Commission, </em>214 Md. 550, 186 A. 2d 567 (1957) \u2014 a case involving the assessment of a purchasing retailer\u2019s stock in business \u2014 we approved of that standard as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>proper method of determining the full cash value of <em>all </em>personal property. We held in <em>Sears </em>that under the then existing law, the assessment practice of the State Tax Commission of making a deduction from the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of real estate in order to allow for the effects of inflation, but of refusing to make any such deduction from the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of personal property consisting of stock in business, constituted an unconstitutional discrimination against the owner of such personal property violative of the uniformity provisions of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. At the time of the assessment involved in <em>Sears, </em>Article 81, \u00a7 14 provided that \u201c[ejxcept as hereinafter provided, all property [both real and personal] directed in this article to be assessed shall be assessed at the full cash value thereof on the date of finality.\u201d The method then provided by statute for valuing stock in business required the assessment thereof \u201cat its fair average value for the twelve months preceding the date of finality.\u201d (The \u201ccost or market value, whichever is lower\u201d standard of valuation for stock in business was not then part of the statute.) Referring to our holding in <em>May Stores v. State Tax Commission, </em>213 Md. 570, 132 A. 2d 593 (1957), a case involving the proper method for calculating the fair average value of a purchasing retailer\u2019s stock in business, we said that, for purposes of inventory valuation under the statute, the standard of cost or market value, whichever is lower, provided a fair indication of the reasonable value of inventory, provided that either the cost or the market value was established as of recent date. We said that the words \u201cfair average,\u201d as applied to stock in business, recognized the fact that the size of inventory fluctuates over the annual period and the value of the inventory should be based upon a representative amount and a representative price for the inventory, not according to the amount of stock on hand on the date of finality, but on the fair average for the twelve months preceding the date of finality. We said that fair average means an average typical of the amount and price of goods acquired over the twelve-month period. And we stated that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>substantial difference in meaning between \u201cfair value\u201d and \u201cfull cash value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Both in <em>May Stores </em>and <em>Sears, </em>we were dealing with the valuation of inventories purchased by retailers, and it was in that context that we expressed the view that the standard of \u201ccost or market value, whichever is lower\u201d could properly be used to arrive at the reasonable or current value of inventory. We did not approve of that test to determine the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of <em>all </em>personal property; our recognition of the appropriateness of the \u201ccost or market value\u201d test was limited to its use to determine the fair average value of inventory and does not compel us to further define or apply that test in the case at bar. Likewise, \u00a7 15 (a) of Article 81, which directs that stock in business be assessed at its fair average value, defined as \u201ccost or market value, whichever is lower,\u201d evidences a legislative intent to apply that test only to inventory. That intent is clear from the statutory framework of Article 81. Section 14 (b)(2) provides that \u201c[e]xcept as hereinafter provided,\u201d all personal property be assessed at its full cash value, defined as current value. Section 15 (a) then provides such an exception, stating that stock in business be assessed at its \u201cfair average value,\u201d defined as cost or market value, whichever is lower. In <em>National Can Corp., supra, </em>we noted that the \u201ccost or market\u201d standard in \u00a7 15 (a) affords the owner of inventory a hedge against inflation not given to owners of other personal property. Had the Legislature intended that the standard of cost or market value, whichever is lower, was synonymous with, and would constitute the measure of full cash value for all personal property, there would have been no necessity to separately subclassify stock in business from other personal property, and no need to differentiate between the basis of valuation applicable to each subclass of property. In any event, since we have determined that the appellees\u2019 property does not constitute stock in business, we need not decide if the Legislature, in separately subclassifying stock in business and prescribing the cost or market test as the method of assessing that property, intended to depart from the test of full cash value, or interpret that test to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>whether under that standard une appellees\u2019 property would have to be assessed at its cost of manufacture.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Xerox, Xerox Data and Sperry Rand argue, however, that it has been the Department\u2019s long-standing administrative practice to assess \u201c[a]ll other personal property\u201d at its cost to the taxpayer, and that consequently their property must be assessed at its cost of manufacture under that standard. It is well settled that the unvarying construction of a law by the agency charged with its enforcement over a long period of time is entitled to great weight and should not be disregarded except for the strongest and most urgent reasons. <em>See Palm Oil Recovery, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>266 Md. 148, 291 A. 2d 681 (1972); <em>Frank J. Klein </em>&amp; <em>Sons, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>233 Md. 490, 197 A. 2d 243 (1964). However, it is clear that such construction is not binding upon the Court and cannot override the plain meaning of the statute or extend its provisions beyond the clear import of the language employed. <em>See County Treasurer, Etc., For Caroline Co. v. State Tax Commission, </em>219 Md. 652, 150 A. 2d 452 (1959); <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. M. E. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 107 A. 2d 93 (1954); <em>State Tax Commission v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., </em>193 Md. 222, 66 A. 2d 477 (1949); <em>Rogan v. Baltimore </em>&amp; <em>Ohio Railroad, Co., </em>188 Md. 44, 52 A. 2d 261 (1947); <em>Bouse v. Hutzler, </em>180 Md. 682, 26 A. 2d 767 (1942). In <em>Pierce &amp; Hebner, Inc. v. State Tax Commission, </em>194 Md. 254, 71 A. 2d 6 (1950), we rejected the argument of the State Tax Commission that its long-standing practice of excluding a federal excise tax imposed on distilled spirits in assessing their value should not be repudiated. We there held, at 262, that the administrative practice did not fulfill the statutory mandate to assess the property at its \u201cfull cash value\u201d as the tax was \u201can essential element in the \u2018actual cash value\u2019 of the liquor assessed.\u201d We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cIt is true that this Court has stated many times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>that the unvarying construction of a statute for a long period of time should not be disregarded except for the most imperious reasons.. .. However, this Court has also frequently stated that even if there has been an unvarying practice we will not sanction a method of calculation which \u2018would tolerate an evasion of taxes\u2019. <em>Bouse v. Hutzler, </em>180 Md. 682, 687, 26 A. 2d 767, 141 A.L.R. 843. As said by this Court in the case of <em>Rogan et al. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, </em>188 Md. 44, at page 57, 52 A. 2d 261, at page 268, involving a tax against the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. \u2018* * * the railroad company was not given a vested right to a perpetual method of computation.\u2019 <em>Atkinson v. Sapperstein, </em>191 Md. 301, 60 A. 2d 737, 741. We see no reason to allow a former error of the State Tax Commission to overcome what we deem to be the intended method of assessment and thereby allow an evasion of taxes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The assessment of the property of Xerox, Xerox Data and Sperry Rand at its cost of manufacture does not comply with the statutory direction of assessment at \u201cfull cash value.\u201d While the Department may use any proper method of assessment, the result must be to arrive at the statutory requirement of \u201cfull cash value.\u201d <em>See Sears, Roebuck, supra; Seaboard Commercial Corp. v. State Tax Commission, </em>181 Md. 234, 29 A. 2d 294 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The question remains, however, whether the Department has applied the standard of \u201cfull cash value\u201d uniformly throughout the class \u201c[a]ll other personal property\u201d as required by \u00a7 14 (b)(2), Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights and the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The parties agree that Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights, directing that assessments within subclasses of property be uniform, requires that the same standard of value or economic yardstick must be used in making assessments within the same subclass. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>contended that the Department, through its policy of assessing the property of \u201cmanufacturer-lessors\u201d at its selling price, while assessing the property of \u201cpurchaser-lessors\u201d at its cost, <em>i.e.. </em>purchase price, has created an unauthorized subclass of personal property and directed nonuniform assessments. It is argued that the Department has considered \u201cappreciation\u201d of the equipment of Xerox, Xerox Data and Sperry Rand attributable to \u201cpotential sales\u201d but has not considered appreciation of property acquired by purchase. It has long been established that assessors have reasonable latitude in selecting any proper method of valuation that results in assessment at full cash value. <em>See Macht v. Dep\u2019t of Assessments, </em>266 Md. 602, 296 A. 2d 162 (1972); <em>Sears, Roebuck </em>&amp; <em>Co., supra; Seaboard Commercial Corp., supra. </em>Both methods employed by the Department \u2014 assessing property purchased and leased at its purchase price, and property manufactured and leased at its \u201cselling price\u201d \u2014 are calculated to fulfill the statutory mandate of assessment at full cash value.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The value of the property manufactured and leased by Xerox, Xerox Data and Sperry Rand due to \u201cpotential sales\u201d reflects its market value \u2014 its value to them as consumers, and not manufacturers. The use of purchase price to determine the full cash value of property acquired by purchase likewise results in its assessment at market value. No new subclass of personal property has been created and no inequality or lack of uniformity inheres in the Department\u2019s method of assessment of these two groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>It is further contended that the Department\u2019s lack of uniformity in assessing personal property within the subclass \u201c[a]ll other personal property\u201d is demonstrated by its assessment for the tax year 1970 of a number of manufacturer-lessors at the cost of manufacture. The record discloses that three manufacturer-lessors \u2014 Burroughs Corporation, Eastman Kodak Company, and Dennison Manufacturing Company \u2014 were inadvertently assessed on their leased equipment at the cost of manufacture for the 1970 tax year. In each instance, however, there was evidence indicating that the assessment was based on incomplete or inaccurate information provided on the corporations\u2019 tax returns; and the Department, upon discovering its error, reassessed each of them based on the selling price of its leased equipment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The procedure utilized by the Department in its effort to locate and assess all manufacturer-lessors at selling price for the 1970 tax year was not, as appellees claim, so haphazard, arbitrary or capricious as to constitute a denial of due process of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor do we think, in the circumstances of this case, that the Department\u2019s failure to assess the property of these three manufacturer-lessors at selling price represents an intentional or systematic violation of Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights or of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As we stated in <em>Weil v. Supervisor of Assessments, supra, </em>at pages 252-53, quoting from <em>Rogan v. County Commissioners of Calvert County, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201c The purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States is to protect every person within the State\u2019s jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by the provisions of a statute or by improper enforcement of a statute. Intentional and systematic undervaluation by assessors of other taxable property in the same class violates the constitutional right of a person taxed upon the full value of his property. However, mere errors of judgment on the part of State or County officials in making assessments will not support a claim of such discrimination. There must be something which in effect amounts to an intentional violation of the essential principle of practical uniformity. The good faith of such officials and the validity of their actions will be presumed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c \u2018We accept the rule, as adopted in other States, that the assessment of the property of others at a lower proportion of its value than that of a complaining taxpayer, which is not assessed at more than its fair cash value, does not make the tax on the latter invalid, unless the assessment was fraudulently made.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">A more serious problem is posed by the Department\u2019s assessment of equipment within the class \u201c[a]ll other personal property,\u201d which it determined was manufactured but not leased by the taxpayer. Of course, any method systematically designed and intentionally applied to assess such property at a standard other than \u201cfull cash value\u201d would violate \u00a7 14 (b)(2) and the constitutional protections invoked by the appellees. The Department\u2019s assessment of certain of the equipment manufactured by the Bunker-Ramo Corporation constitutes the only concrete evidence developed in the record of its actual assessment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>such personal property. Bunker-Ramo manufactures stock quotation boards which it installs on the premises of its customers under so-called \u201cservice agreements.\u201d The Department concluded that this equipment was used to \u25a0 furnish information to stockbrokers, and that because it remained under Bunker-Ramo\u2019s control, it had not been leased, even though located on the premises of its customers. It, therefore, assessed this equipment at its cost of manufacture. Other equipment manufactured by Bunker-Ramo, which it leased, was assessed at selling price. The Department maintains that ' its assessment of Bunker-Ramo\u2019s stock quotation equipment held under \u201cservice agreements\u201d is \u201cunique\u201d and that if the assessment of this property was in error, it was an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d not reaching constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">While it is clear from the record that as to Bunker-Ramo\u2019s stock quotation equipment the Department concluded that that corporation was not a manufacturer-lessor, the reasons underlying this determination are not at all clear. Whether this equipment was leased or not, the valuation basis applicable to it under \u00a7 14 (b)(2) was \u201cfull cash value\u201d (unless, of course, the Department considered that the equipment was stock in business). The Department does not argue that the cost of manufacture arrives at the market value of that property even under the allegedly \u201cunique\u201d facts surrounding Bunker-Ramo\u2019s operations. Consequently, if that assessment reflects and is representative of an <em>intentional </em>and <em>systematic </em>policy of the Department to assess all property within the subclass \u201c[a]ll other personal property\u201d that is manufactured but not leased at its cost of manufacture, the Department\u2019s method of assessment could appear to violate the statutory direction to assess all such property at full cash value and the constitutional imperatives of Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights and the Equal Protection clause. In that event, it might not be said that assessments made pursuant to such a deliberately adopted System constituted mere errors in judgment since the challenged discrimination would plainly be the result of a plan of assessment which was nonetheless systematic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>and intentional because of belief in its validity. <em>See Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Revision, </em>284 U. S. 23, 76 L. Ed. 146, 52 S. Ct. 48 (1931). The following testimony of John Rauh, the head of the Department\u2019s Foreign Corporation, Division, is the only evidence in the record which directly bears on the Department\u2019s assessment of personal property manufactured but not leased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201cQuestion: Now, under the Department\u2019s regulation making power, has the Department, at any time, adopted a regulation stating that its interpretation of full cash value in regard to property owned by manufacturing lessors was something other than cost minus depreciation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201cAnswer: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cQuestion: You have never adopted such a regulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cAnswer: Shaking head negatively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t adopt such a regulation, because the law itself says that it shall be assessed at its full cash value, and this is our interpretation of full cash value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201cQuestion: As to any other group or class or type of taxpayer other than manufacturers of property leased to lessees located within the State of Maryland, have you applied any assessment criterion other than cost less depreciation?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">\u201cAnswer: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">\u201cQuestion: So your only deviation from the general policy of applying cost was in the ease of manufacturers who leased property in the State of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">\u201cAnswer: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The Department notes that there is no hard evidence in the record that the property of any other taxpayer, ^ similarly situated with Bunker-Ramo, was assessed at its cost of manufacture.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In view of the state of the record before us, and the equivocal nature of Rauh\u2019s testimony on this vital point, we think the purposes of justice will be advanced by permitting further evidentiary proceedings in the Tax Court, pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Rule 871 a, to determine whether the Department\u2019s policy for the tax year 1970 of assessing the property of \u201cmanufacturer-lessors\u201d at its full cash value was, or was not, applied to taxable tangible personal property manufactured but not leased by its owner. If the valuation basis is, in fact, the same for all such property \u2014 full cash value \u2014 Bunker-Ramo\u2019s assessment at cost of manufacture might possibly be viewed as a mere error in judgment, not requiring that the appellees\u2019 assessments be reduced to the same valuation level. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. State Tax Commission, supra; National Can Corp. v. State Tax Commission, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">There is no merit in the argument of Xerox, Xerox Data, and Sperry Rand that the Department has changed the standard of valuation for their property after January 1, 1970, the date of finality for that tax year,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in violation of \u00a7 14 (b)(2), which requires that all personal property be assessed at its full cash value <em>on the date of finality. </em>They maintain that the Department did not change its policy of assessing their property at its cost to the taxpayer \u2014 <em>i.e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>manufacturing cost \u2014 until after the Tax Court rendered its decision in <em>Boothe, on </em>July 16, 1970, and that the Department, therefore, increased the value of their property long after the date on which such values were made binding tor tax purposes by the statute. They further contend that the Department has thereby unconstitutionally imposed additional retroactive taxes upon them for that tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Section 14 (b)(2) requires only that the value of property, subject to assessment, be determined on the date of finality of the tax year in question. The Department\u2019s assessment of the property of these manufacturer-lessors for the tax year 1970, on the date when such property was placed under lease, complies with the directive that such value be determined as of January 1 of that year. Indeed, the Department notes that under Article 81, \u00a7 251, the appellees were not required to file their tax returns for 1970 until April 15th of that year.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That statutory directive is manifestly inconsistent with the interpretation of \u00a7 14 (b)(2) urged by the appellees. Their reliance on <em>State Tax Commission v. Armco Steel Corporation, </em>226 Md. 533, 174 A. 2d 327 (1961), to support that interpretation is also misplaced. In <em>Armco, </em>we held that Baltimore City could not subject to taxation, for the years 1958 and 1959, tangible personal property exempt from taxation under the terms of the ordinances in effect on the dates of finality for those years. We noted that \u201c[property which was exempt on the date of finality is not subject to the tax for the ensuing taxable year.\u201d 226 Md. at 540. Our holding in <em>Armco </em>is consonant with our interpretation of \u00a7 14 (b)(2). The property involved in that case, as appellees admit, being exempt on the dates of finality, had <em>no value </em>for the purposes of taxation. Baltimore City could not, therefore, subsequently attribute value to that property not existing on the dates of finality by retroactively withdrawing those exemptions. The appellees\u2019 property, however, was not exempt from taxation, and had a market value on the date of finality. The full cash value of such property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>determined as of that date in accord with the statutory directive and no unconstitutional retroactive tax was imposed; only the method of assessment was changed to comply with the statutory mandate to assess at full cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">\n<em>Case remanded to the Maryland Tax Court without affirmance or reversal, pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Rule 871 a, for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion; costs to be paid one-half by the appellant and one-half by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\">.

We note that a serious constitutional question might arise if the Department were to construe \u00a7 15 (a) to authorize assessment of property held by its manufacturer for sale or resale at its cost of manufacture while assessing that of a purchaser of such goods at its purchase price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b625-4\">. That it has been the Department\u2019s admitted practice not to consider appreciation of personal property in determining its full cash value does not mean that it has, as a matter of policy, departed from the statutory standard of assessment at full cash value. The Department maintains that since tangible personal property being consumed through use \u2014 depreciable assets \u2014 will not ordinarily appreciate above original purchase cost or selling price, the practical administration of the tax laws reasonably permits utilization of the straight line or other accepted method of depreciation in arriving at full cash value. In the circumstances, we cannot say that the Department\u2019s action is unreasonable or violative of its statutory responsibility to levy assessments upon depreciable assets at full cash value. <em>See </em>New Departure Division of General Motors Corp. v. Town &amp; City of Bristol, 25 Conn. Sup. 37, 195 A. 2d 770 (1963); Maytag Co. v. Partridge, 210 N.W.2d 584 (Iowa 1973); W. L. Harper Co. v.

Each corporation protested the reassessment and the Department ultimately ruled that because the erroneous assessments had been finalized, they could not be changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b626-5\">. As heretofore indicated, the Department reviewed the personal property tax returns filed by all taxpayers in Maryland for the tax year 1970. Those returns required the taxpayer to state the nature of its business in Maryland and to file a schedule of property which it leased in this State. The Department thereby determined whether the corporation was manufacturing or leasing in .Maryland. The Department has admitted that this method did not reveal those manufacturer-iessors who manufactured equipment outside of Maryland, but leased it in the State, and those whose returns were faulty or incomplete. The assessor\u2019s general knowledge of corporations doing business in Maryland was relied on to discern these manufacturer-lessors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\">. Our holding that the Department\u2019s prior practice of assessing the appellees\u2019 property at its cost of manufacture does not require its continued assessment on that basis, provides a sufficient answer to Xerox\u2019s argument that the Department\u2019s assessment of-the property of B'tinker-Kamo,- under service agreements, at its cost of manufacture, requires, a luce assessment of its property. Assuming that the facts surrounding the assessment are not unique and that the Department has set a policy of assessing such property at its cost of manufacture, such administrative\u2019 construction cannot depart from .the standard of full cash value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. <em>See </em>Article 81, \u00a7 29A (a) and note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b631-5\">. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
