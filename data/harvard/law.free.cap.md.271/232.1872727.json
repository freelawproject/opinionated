J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Barnes, J., dissents and filed a dissenting opinion at page 242 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The appellants, owners of real estate in Montgomery County, Maryland, contest the assessment and taxation of their property in 1970 for the years 1967, 1968 and 1969 under Maryland\u2019s \u201cEscaped Property\u201d statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 34. It is claimed that the property was not \u201cescaped property\u201d within the meaning of the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The subject property consists of a 46.9 acre tract of land, improved by two houses and a garage, which appellants have owned for over forty years. Prior to 1967, appellants each year had paid the taxes imposed on the property. On May 1, 1967, appellants leased the property to an organization calling itself \u201cNational University.\u201d The lease was for a fifteen year term, and contained the proviso that after three years either party had an absolute right to terminate upon 90 days\u2019 notice. The lease also provided that the lessee was to pay the property taxes. The name of the lessee was later changed to \u201cPotomac University,\u201d and later changed again to \u201cNational Graduate University.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The lessee University on June 12, 1967, filed with the Supervisor of Assessments a petition for a tax exemption under what was then Art. 81, \u00a7 9(8) of the Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This section exempts from taxation real property \u201cowned and used exclusively\u201d by educational institutions. The petition was granted, and the property was treated as exempt for the years 1967,1968 and 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In early 1970, a question arose concerning the propriety of the tax exemption in light of the provision in the tax laws that the lessee shall not be treated as the owner of property for tax purposes unless the lease is for ninety-nine years or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>if for a shorter term, is perpetually renewable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Attorney General issued an opinion that the exemption should not have been granted, and the Supervisor of Assessments, on June 3, 1970, rescinded the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Thereafter, the Supervisor of Assessments sent appellants an \u201cEscaped Property Notice of Assessment\u201d for each of the levy years 1967, 1968 and 1969. The Supervisor enclosed a legal memorandum to the effect that the property was subject to assessment and taxation for those years as \u201cescaped property\u201d under \u00a7 34 of Article 81. Appellants were told that tax bills would be rendered in the near future. Appellants thereupon formally protested the Supervisor\u2019s notices proposing to assess the property for the back years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">After a hearing on appellants\u2019 protest, the assessments were finalized by the Supervisor of Assessments. Upon appellants\u2019 successive appeals, the Supervisor\u2019s decision was upheld by the Appeal Tax Court for Montgomery County and then by the Maryland Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Appellants do not here challenge the Supervisor\u2019s decision rescinding the tax exemption. All parties to the appeal agree that the Supervisor made a mistake in 1967 when he granted the exemption, although there is some disagreement as to whether appellants or their agents in any way submitted misleading information which induced the mistake. Consequently, no issue concerning the legality of the tax exemption is before us. Moreover, we shall assume <em>arguendo </em>that the Supervisor mistakenly granted the exemption entirely on his own, without any submission of misleading information or other fault on the part of the appellants or those in privity with them. The issue, then, is whether the Supervisor who erroneously granted an exemption is authorized by statute to later subject the property to taxation for the exempt years.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The Maryland \u201cEscaped Property\u201d statute, Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 34, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">\u201cIn case any property which by law is subject to assessment and taxation has escaped, such property shall be entered upon the assessment rolls at any time and shall be subject to taxation for current and previous years, not exceeding four years in all, in the same manner as other property is subject to taxation. The levy for each and every year by the county commissioners of the several counties and by any city shall be deemed and taken to have covered and embraced all property which was not assessed, but which ought to have been assessed, for the year for which any such levy was made.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The appellants argue that to come within the above statutory provision, the property must have escaped both \u201cassessment\u201d and \u201ctaxation.\u201d The property here involved, they insist, did not escape assessment but was- in fact \u201cassessed.\u201d It was \u201cassessed,\u201d appellants claim, because it was known to the Supervisor and listed in his records. Turning to the element of taxation, appellants acknowledge that the property was not taxed but claim that it did not \u201cescape\u201d taxation. The word \u201cescape,\u201d in their opinion, does not encompass the deliberate, although mistaken, act of the Supervisor in granting an exemption. In sum, appellants assert that to come within \u00a7 34, property must escape both assessment and taxation and that this property escaped neither assessment nor taxation. Appellants\u2019 theory seems to be that only property which was unknown to the tax assessor, either by oversight or because the taxpayer withheld information, is encompassed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Appellants\u2019 position, in our view, is not supported by the language of the statute or the decided cases. Moreover, their construction of the statute, if adopted, would create an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>illogical distinction with respect to properties which should have been taxed for prior years but were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In arguing that their property did not escape \u201cassessment\u201d but was in fact assessed in 1967, 1968 and 1969, appellants rely on the facts that the property was known to the Supervisor during that time, that he carried work sheets or cards on the property during the period, that he made a decision to exempt the property, and that this decision was marked on the work sheets or cards. Appellants insist that the property was therefore on the \u201cassessments rolls\u201d and that the \u201cexemption from taxation was a direct product of the assessment process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">It is true that the term \u201cassessment\u201d as used in tax statutes has been given a somewhat fluid and imprecise meaning. Nevertheless, as normally used, \u201cassessment\u201d is incident to the actual imposition of taxes. It would be a non sequitur to refer to an \u201cassessment\u201d giving rise to a tax exemption. As Chief Judge McSherry stated for the Court in <em>Consolidated Gas Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>101 Md. 541, 558, 61 A. 532, 538-39 (1905):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201c . . . \u2018An assessment, strictly speaking, is an official estimate of the sums which are to constitute the basis of an apportionment of a tax between the individual subjects of taxation within the district. As the word is more commonly employed, an assessment consists in the two processes of <em>listing </em>the persons, property, &amp;c., to be taxed, and of estimating the sums which are to be the guide in an apportionment of the tax between them.\u2019 <em>Cooley, Tax, </em>258; <em>New York v. Weaver, </em>100 U.S. 539; 3 <em>Cyc. </em>1111.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">We more recently set forth the same definition in <em>Casey Dev. Corp. v. Montgomery County, </em>212 Md. 138, 146, 129 A. 2d 63, 67 (1957), adding: \u201cThe assessment and the levy are separate and distinct elements of the taxing process.\u201d 212 Md. at 146. <em>See also, e.g., Whitehead v. Henson, </em>223 Ga. 329, 155 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1967) (\u201cthe assessment is the amount on which the taxpayer pays taxes.\u201d); <em>Webb v. Bidwell, </em>15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Minn. 479, 483 (1870) (an assessment took place \u201cwhen the amount or proportion of tax to which each parcel of real estate was subject, was fixed and determined.\u201d); <em>Iowa Nat. Bank v. Stewart, </em>214 Iowa 1229, 232 N. W. 445, 451 (1930) (\u201cThe assessment consists in the listing of the property to be taxed and the estimation of the sums which are to constitute the basis of the apportionment of the tax ....\u201d); <em>Northwestern Imp. Co. v. Henneford, </em>184 Wash. 502, 51 P. 2d 1083, 1085 (1935) (\u201c\u2018Assessment is the listing and valuation of property liable to taxation . . . .\u2019 \u201d); <em>Broad </em>&amp; <em>Sansom Realty Co. v. Fidelity Bldg. Corp., </em>292 Pa. 287, 291, 141 A. 34, 35 (1928) (\u201cAssessed, as used in our taxing statute and as here used, means a certain sum of money, fixed under a given rate on property valuation, due and payable as taxes.\u201d); <em>People v. Priest, </em>169 N. Y. 432, 435, 62 N. E. 567, 568 (1902); <em>Pipola v. Chicco, </em>169 F. Supp. 229, 231 (S.D.N.Y. 1959). While these definitions of the word \u201cassessment\u201d vary somewhat, the cases all recognize that assessment is part of the process resulting in the payment of or demand for tax money.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The very section of the Maryland Code dealing with property tax exemptions, and the section under which the subject property was granted an exemption, shows that it is a distortion to refer to an assessment giving rise to a tax exemption. Section 9 of Art. 81 begins: \u201cThe following real and tangible personal property shall be <em>exempt from, assessment </em>and from State, county and city ordinary taxation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, exemptions are from assessment and taxation. Property cannot, under Maryland law, receive an exemption from taxation but not from assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The ordinary meaning of \u201cassessment,\u201d therefore, would preclude a holding that appellants\u2019 property was \u201cassessed\u201d but exempted from taxation during the years 1967, 1968 and 1969. As \u201cassessment\u201d is an integral part of the taxation process, leading to the imposition of taxes, exempt property is simply not \u201cassessed.\u201d Absent some indication that the Legislature is using a term in an abnormal sense, a \u201c \u2018statute should be construed according to the ordinary and natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>import of the language used ....\u2019\u201d <em>Baltimore County v. White, </em>235 Md. 212, 218, 201 A. 2d 358, 360 (1964). And there is no indication that the Legislature was using the term \u201cassessment\u201d in the \u201cEscaped Property\u201d statute (Art. 81, \u00a7 34) in any unusual sense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The same principle, that words in a statute are construed in accordance with their ordinary and natural meaning, is also fatal to appellants\u2019 other argument focusing upon the word \u201cescape\u201d in \u00a7 34. In appellants\u2019 view, their property did not escape assessment and taxation because, they say, the word \u201cescape\u201d does not encompass the deliberate act of the Supervisor granting an exemption because of a mistake of law. Appellants give an overly narrow meaning to the word. Property which was not assessed and taxed, even if by an intentional although mistaken act of the tax assessor, has \u201cescaped\u201d assessment and taxation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Not only does the statutory language militate against appellants\u2019 position, but the cases fail to support their theory that only property which was unknown to the tax assessor or not on his records may be retroactively taxed under escaped property statutes. For example, in <em>Mid Towne v. State Tax Dept., </em>228 Md. 66, 178 A. 2d 422 (1962), the taxpayer\u2019s tangible personal property had been assessed for the year 1957 and the tax was paid for that year. However, it was not assessed in 1958 and 1959 because of the taxpayer\u2019s initial failure to file annual reports during those years and the tax officials\u2019 subsequent failure to make the estimated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>assessments provided for in situations where the taxpayer had failed to report. Nevertheless, the tax officials obviously knew of the property and had records concerning it, as they corresponded with the taxpayer about the property during 1958 and 1959. In 1960, the authorities assessed the property for 1958 and 1959 as escaped property within the meaning of \u00a7 34. This Court sustained the tax officials\u2019 action, holding that Maryland\u2019s \u201cEscaped Property\u201d statute was applicable under the circumstances. <em>See also Skinner Dry Dock Co. v. Baltimore </em>City, 96 Md. 32, 53 A. 416 (1902), involving a local omitted property statute which was held applicable even on the assumption that the tax authorities knew of the property. (96 Md. at 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The particular issue here, <em>i.e., </em>whether the Maryland \u201cEscaped Property\u201d statute embraces property which was erroneously granted a tax exemption for prior years, has not been decided by this Court. However, the question has arisen under the similar statutory provisions of a few other states, and the courts have held that property mistakenly given a tax exemption is escaped or omitted property subject to taxation for the period of exemption. <em>Tally v. </em>Brown, 146 Iowa 360, 125 N. W. 248 (1910); <em>Inhabitants of Athens v. Whittier, </em>122 Me. 86, 118 A. 897 (1922); <em>McCanna v. Board of Assessors, </em>48 R. I. 396, 137 A. 694 (1927); <em>Armory Realty Co. v. Olsen, </em>210 Wis. 281, 293-94, 246 N. W. 513, 518 (1933). As explained by the Supreme Court of Iowa in <em>Tally v. Brown, supra, </em>125 N. W. at 253:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201cIs taxable property any the less omitted from the assessment roll when the assessor . . . renders his opinion that it is not taxable, than when it is left off the assessment roll through oversight or ignorance of its existence? . . . The cause of omission is not suggested in this statute, so that, if for any reason taxable property has been \u2018left out\u2019 of the assessment roll by the assessor, it is subject to assessment. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\"><em>See also Sears v. Nahant, </em>215 Mass. 329, 334, 102 N.E. 494, 496 (1913), where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cBut we are of the opinion that section 85 as to omitted assessments does not require that the property be newly discovered in the sense of coming for the first time to the knowledge of the assessors, in order that it may be legally assessed. If the assessors, through want of knowledge of facts or ignorance of the law or as to their duty, or for any other honest reason have failed to include property in the annual assessment, it is omitted property within the meaning of that section, and in the exercise of good faith, they may include it in a supplemental assessment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The principal case relied on by appellants is <em>Baltimore C. &amp; A. Ry. Co. v. Wicomico County, </em>93 Md. 113, 48 A. 853 (1901), where this Court held that the county commissioners could not \u201clevy\u201d taxes on a railroad\u2019s property for'previous years during which the railroad was erroneously given the tax exemption of its predecessor. However, <em>Baltimore C. &amp; A. Ry. Co. v. Wicomico County </em>was decided twenty-eight years before the enactment of the present \u201cEscaped Property\u201d statute, Art. 81, \u00a7 34. At the time it was decided, there was no statutory provision authorizing the taxation for prior years of \u201cescaped\u201d property. Thus, the case cannot be relied upon in construing \u00a7 34 except to the extent it might be inferred that the Legislature, in enacting \u00a7 34, desired to overturn the result of the <em>Wicomico County </em>case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The appellants also contend that several cases from other states support their position, citing <em>Anniston City Land Co. v. State, </em>185 Ala. 482, 64 So. 110 (1913); <em>People v. Dunham, </em>311 Ill. 439, 143 N. E. 52 (1924); <em>German Savings Bank v. Trowbridge, </em>124 Iowa 514, 100 N. W. 333(1904); <em>Thomas\u2019etc. v. Comm., </em>308 Ky. 695, 215 S.W.2d 546 (1948); <em>Gully v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Mississippi Valley Co., </em>181 Miss. 669, 180 So. 745 (1938); <em>Adams v. Luce, </em>87 Miss. 220, 39 So. 418 (1905); <em>Marshall Wells Co. v. Foster County, </em>59 N. D. 599, 231 N. W. 542 (1930); <em>Palmer v. Beadle County, </em>70 S. D. 99, 15 N.W.2d 6 (1944). In all of these cases, the property involved was in fact assessed and some tax money was paid for the past years in question. Under these circumstances, the courts held that escaped property statutes wx&gt;re not applicable and that the tax authorities could not collect more taxes on the theory that the prior assessment was defective or void <em>(Adams v. Luce, supra)-, </em>or because the wrong governmental entity had originally made the assessment and collected the tax <em>(Gully v. Mississippi, supra; People v. Dunham, supra; Thomas\u2019 etc. v. Comm., supra); </em>or because a portion of the property had not been included in the assessment <em>(Anniston City Land Co. v. State, supra); </em>or because the assessor had previously undervalued the property <em>(German Savings Bank v. Trowbridge, supra; Marshall Wells Co. v. Foster County, supra; Palmer v. Beadle County, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The above-cited cases disclose the line which has been drawn by most courts throughout the country. Where an assessment has actually been made and taxes paid on property, such property has not \u201cescaped\u201d assessment and taxation. It simply is not escaped or omitted property under the language of typical \u201cescaped property\u201d statutes. The language of these statutes reveals that they were not intended to authorize a retroactive <em>increase </em>in the assessment and taxation for prior years because of an asserted mistake in valuation, or some other alleged mistake. On the other hand, where property has not been assessed and taxed at all for the years in question, the courts have regularly held that escaped property statutes apply, regardless of whether the property wTas known or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Lastly, no possible reason or policy has been suggested which might justify the distinction urged by appellants. There is no rational basis for distinguishing betwxen property mistakenly granted a tax exemption and property which the assessor overlooked. In either situation, the property owners should have contributed their share to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>support governmental services but did not, thereby increasing the burden on other property owners. A construction of a statute which produces an unreasonable or illogical result should be avoided wherever it is possible to do so consistent with the statutory language. <em>Coerper v. </em>Comptroller, 265 Md. 3, 6, 288 A. 2d 187, 188 (1972); <em>Pan Am. Sulphur Co. v. State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation, </em>251 Md. 620, 627, 248 A. 2d 354, 358 (1968); <em>Sanza v. Maryland Board of Censors, </em>245 Md. 319, 340, 226 A. 2d 317, 328 (1967). To adopt appellants\u2019 view of the statute would lead to an unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The statutory language, the cases, and logic, all lead to the conclusion that the Supervisor and the courts below correctly applied the \u201cEscaped Property\u2019\u2019 statute to appellants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>Appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\">.

Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 34 in regard to \u201cEscaped property,\u2019\u2019 (2) misunderstood several of the important facts, (3) misconstrued the legislative history of \u00a7 34, and (4) not properly evaluated several of the prior decisions of this Court and of our sister states.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">As a majority properly observes, the first method used by the courts to ascertain the legislative intent in a statute is to give the words used in the statute their plain, ordinary and usual meaning; and if those words disclose the legislative intent, there is no need for the courts to use rules of construction which would apply if the language is ambiguous. <em>Scoville Service, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>269 Md. 390, 306 A. 2d 534 (1973) and cases cited in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">As I read the words of \u00a7 34, they are clear, plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>unambiguous, and clearly indicate the intention of the General Assembly. First, taking the words \u201cany property which by law is subject to assessment <em>and </em>taxation\u201d (emphasis supplied), I find nothing ambiguous or difficult about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">It will be observed that the word \u201cand\u201d is used as a conjunction between the words \u201cassessment\u201d and \u201ctaxation,\u201d rather than the word \u201cor.\u201d This indicates to me that the words \u201cany property\u201d mean property that is subject to <em>both </em>\u201cassessment\u201d <em>and </em>\u201ctaxation\u201d and not property which may be subject only to one or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Then come the critical words \u201chas escaped.\u201d There is no mystery about the meaning of the word \u201cescape.\u201d In Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary (Unabridged, Second Edition), the word \u201cescape\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cescape, v.i. escaped (-kapt), pt., pp.; escaping, ppr. (ME. escapen; OFr. escaper, to escape; LL. ex capa, out of cape; L. ex. out of, and L.L. capa, cape, cloak)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">1. to get free; get away; break loose, as from a prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">2. to avoid an illness, accident, pain, etc.; as, two were killed, but he <em>escaped.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">3. to flow, drain, or leak away; as, water <em>escapes </em>rapidly from the drainpipe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">4. to slip away; disappear; as, the image <em>escaped </em>from her memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">\u201cescape, v.t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-16\">1. to get away from; flee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-17\">2. to avoid; manage to keep away from; as, he <em>escaped </em>punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-19\">3. to come from involuntarily or unintentionally; as, a scream <em>escaped </em>his lips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-21\">4. <em>to </em>slip away <em>from; be </em>missed, unperceived, or forgotten by; as, the exact date <em>escapes </em>me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-23\">\u201cSyn. \u2014 elude, evade, avoid, shun, decamp, flee, depart, abscond, break away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-24\">The General Assembly did not use the word \u201comitted\u201d from assessment and taxation as the Wisconsin statute does. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>See Armory Realty Co. v. Olsen, </em>210 Wis. 281, 246 N. W. 518 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The majority indicates that the cases use the words \u201comitted property\u201d and \u201cescaped property\u201d interchangeably. I do not so read the cases on which it relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u201cOmit\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary (Unabridged, Second Edition) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">\u201c1. To leave out or unmentioned; not to insert, include or name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">2. To forbear or fail to perform or make use of; to leave undone; to neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">It is apparent to me that property \u201comitted\u201d from assessment and taxation is that which has been \u201cleft out\u201d or \u201cunmentioned,\u201d or which by neglect of the assessor or his failure to perform his duties properly, has not been assessed or taxed. \u201cEscaped\u201d property, however, by its definition has a much more narrow meaning. It will be observed that the two words \u201comit\u201d and \u201cescape\u201d are not listed as synonyms for each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The words \u201chas escaped\u201d mean that the property has \u201cescaped\u201d the notice or attention of the assessing authorities. This may result from many causes; but property known to the assessing authorities, appearing on the books and records of the assessing authorities, and, indeed, actually assessed by those authorities, cannot, in my opinion, come within the ambit of the words \u201chas escaped.\u201d To attempt this is to distort \u2014 even to torture \u2014 the plain and ordinary meaning of the words. This we should not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The wTords \u201call property which was not assessed, but which ought to have been assessed,\u201d appearing in the last sentence of \u00a7 34, refer to escaped property and provide that such property shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have been \u201ccovered and embraced\u201d in <em>\u201cthe levy\u201d </em>for the prior years \u2014 not exceeding four \u2014 applicable to such escaped property.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The concept of \u201cescaped property\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 34 was broadened in regard to personal property by the Act of 1967, Ch. 404, \u00a7 1 \u2014 now \u00a7 34A of Art. 81 \u2014 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\u201c(a) <em>Deemed to be escaped property. </em>\u2014 Where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the taxpayer is required <em>to report personal property </em>in such detail <em>as to show the cost or market value thereof but the taxpayer fails to report accurately </em>the cost or other data required to establish market value, and the property is assessed at a lower valuation than it would have been had it been reported accurately, that portion of the property as to which the cost or market value is unreported shall be <em>deemed to be escaped property.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Assessment; penalty. </em>\u2014 The escaped property shall be assessed; and if it is determined that the taxpayer failed to make a full disclosure of the actual cost or market value or other data and the failure to report accurately was the cause of the assessment of said property at a lower valuation than it would have been had it been reported accurately, there shall be added thereto, by the assessing authority, a penalty in an amount equal to <em>207c </em>of the value of the escaped property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201c(c) <em>Notice of assessment and penalty. </em>\u2014 Notice of the assessment and of the penalty shall be made in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 29 of this article. Such notice shall indicate separately the assessment on the escaped property and the penalty thereon.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The significance of this amendment is that the General Assembly thought it necessary to apply by additional legislation the concept of \u201cescaped property\u201d to a situation in which the assessing authorities <em>had notice </em>of the personal property in question by the report, but where the <em>taxpayer failed to report accurately </em>the cost of the property. Due to this failure to report accurately, a lower assessment would result. The portion of property which was unreported would <em>\u201cbe deemed to be escaped property\u201d </em>under the statute. Even though the cost figures were inaccurately given, it is apparent that, but for this additional legislation in 1967, such property would not have been escaped property under \u00a7 34 because the assessing authorities would have had notice of the personal property appearing upon the report. This, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>my opinion, is a clear legislative recognition that the concept of \u201cescaped property\u201d in \u00a7 34 is the one which I believe to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Turning to the facts in the present case, the majority indicates that the subject property was not \u201cassessed\u201d by the collector of taxes for Montgomery County for the years 1967, 1968, and 1969. The evidence in the case, however, indicated quite the opposite conclusion to me, <em>i.e., </em>that the subject property was indeed assessed and was most likely on the \u201ctax rolls\u201d for the years mentioned. The appellee, Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County, did not introduce the tax rolls for the years in question into evidence, nor was there any testimony by anyone that he had made a careful examination of those rolls and that the subject property did not appear on the rolls. The documents that were introduced into evidence indicate to me that the subject property was \u25a0assessed and was most likely on the tax rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The master card of the assessor for the property 5400 Grosvenor Lane, Bethesda, Maryland, was introduced into evidence. After giving the liber and folio references, the original assessment for the property is: Land 165400, Imp. 62300, Total 227700, Zoning R-90. Under the heading \u201cRECOMMENDED ASSESSMENT\u201d the following appears under the subheadings \u201c1964,\u201d \u201c1968,\u201d and \u201c1971\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">Land</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Improvements</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">Date of Notice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK9Q\">Expiration Date</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">Protested</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Auv\">Date of Hearing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">Final Notice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">1964</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">132,210 (67)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">64,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX7\">196,710 (67)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">Oct. 25 \u201963</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">Nov. 14 \u201963</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">1968</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">233,800</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-15\">65,800</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-16\">299,600</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-18\">70-1799</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af4\">PROTEST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">Aug. 24 \u201970</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-19\">Aug. 26 \u201970</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-17\">1971</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU5\">317,250</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-F\">67,4UU</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">384.650</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">Sep. 25 \u201970</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG5\">Oct. 15 \u201970</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The master card has the word \u201cEXEMPT\u201d stamped on it in large letters, but it is stricken out in ink with a notation in ink reading \u201ceff. 1967 levy per Mr. Duvall\u2019s letter dated 6-22-67.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">There is no question that the subject property was on the tax rolls for the years prior to 1967 and that the owner of that property <em>paid </em>taxes upon it during those prior years. Inasmuch as the assessor\u2019s master card contains the assessment first mentioned throughout the period in question with only recommended assessments appearing on the card, it is presumed that the assessment continued throughout the period in question and was on the tax rolls during that period. <em>See Gibraltar Construction and Engineering, Inc. v. State National Bank, </em>265 Md. 530, 535, 290 A. 2d 789, 792 (1972) and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The majority seems to indicate that if there is no resulting taxation of a property, it cannot be legally assessed by the taxing authorities inasmuch as the \u201cassessment\u201d is \u201can integral part of the taxation process, leading to the imposition of taxes [so that] exempt property is simply not \u2018assessed.\u2019 \u201d This is a curious position to take in view of the practice to the contrary in Baltimore City \u2014 at least for the last 40 years \u2014 in uniformly assessing property exempt from taxation and placing it on the assessment books followed by the letter \u201cX\u201d indicating that it was property exempted from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">All property is potentially available for purposes of taxation depending, of course, on the legislative policy in regard to exemption from taxation. It is a sound public policy to assess property exempt from taxation in the event an exemption terminates so that a special assessment for such property is not required and, more importantly, the property assessed, but exempt from taxation, becomes part of the \u201cassessable basis\u201d for the jurisdiction involved, thereby substantially increasing the borrowing power of that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In any event, the subject property was <em>in fact </em>assessed by the assessing authorities for the years 1967, 1968, and 1969 and could not, in my opinion, be \u201cescaped\u201d property.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>How then can the subject property be thought to be \u201cescaped property\u201d under these circumstances when it admittedly was properly <em>assessed and taxed </em>during the taxable years prior to 1967 and when the records, themselves, of the Montgomery County assessors indicate, <em>prima facie, </em>that the subject property carried an assessment during the years 1967,1968 and 1969?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">It is interesting to observe that in the letter of June 3, 1970, Mr. Duvall, the Supervisor of Assessments for Montgomery County, wrote the Grosvenors, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\u201cUpon advice of Mr. William H. Riley, Chief Supervisor of Assessments and the opinion of Mr. Joseph R. Raymond, Assistant Attorney General, it is necessary for this office to place the assessment of your property on the assessment dockets in your name for tax collection, which in effect rescinds the exempt status of this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201cMr. Riley\u2019s letter dated May 20, 1970, attached, is herewith enclosed for your information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201cThere is also enclosed, notice of assessment indicating the assessment which is to be effective <em>for the 1970 levy.\u201d </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">It thus appears that the Supervisor of Assessments thought that the removal of the educational exemption from the subject property <em>only </em>subjected it to taxation <em>prospectively </em>for the taxable year 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">In sum, the facts indicate to me that the office of the assessors had full knowledge of the location, ownership and characteristics of the subject property and assessed that property, which was certainly on the tax rolls of the collector for years prior to 1967 and was, <em>prima facie, </em>on such rolls during the taxable years 1967, 1968, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>1969. Under these circumstances, it is extraordinary indeed, in my opinion, to think that the property was \u201cescaped property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 34 is instructive and, in my opinion, supports my understanding of the legislative intent in regard to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Section 34 first came into the Maryland law by the Act of 1929, Ch. 226, \u00a7 31 and the language of that section has remained the same since June 1,1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Prior to the effective date of the Act of 1929, Ch. 226, the Maryland law in regard to revenue and taxes had, <em>inter alia, </em>provided that every assessor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201c . . . shall annually inform himself by all lawful means of <em>all property </em>... in his county, district or city <em>liable to taxation </em>and which may have been <em>omitted in the assessment, </em>and all buildings and improvements, and all property created or acquired since said assessment, and shall value the same at the full cash value thereof and shall make return thereof to the county commissioners or appeal tax court, if in the city of Baltimore, for the purposes of this section. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\"><em>See </em>Laws of Maryland, 1841, Ch. 23, \u00a7 23; Ch. 116, Sec. 6; 1847, Ch. 266, \u00a7 16; 1874, Ch. 483, \u00a7 5 and Annotated Code of Maryland, 1924, Art. 81, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The language of this statute \u201comitted in the assessment\u201d is quite similar to that of the Wisconsin statute involved in <em>Armory Realty Co. v. Olsen, </em>210 Wis. 281, 246 N. W. 513 (1933), in which the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that property marked \u201cexempt\u201d in 1926, 1927 and 1928 and found not to have been exempt by the assessor in 1929 was \u201comitted\u201d property.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">But, as already noted, the Maryland law was <em>changed </em>by the Act of 1929, Ch. 226, \u00a7 31, by eliminating the words \u201comitted in the assessment\u201d to \u201cescaped\u201d which, to my mind, indicates a legislative intent to change the concept, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>particularly as the new provision subjected such escaped property retrospectively to the levy for the years, not exceeding four, in which the escaped property should have been, but was not, assessed. This thereby changed the existing law as enunciated by this Court in <em>The Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Ry. Co. v. Wicomico County, </em>93 Md. 113, 48 A. 853 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Section 34 was Section 31 of the proposed revision of Art. 81 by the Maryland Tax Revision Commission of 1927 of which Arthur W. Machen, Jr. was Chairman. The section did not appear in the Preliminary Report of that Commission, dated June 19, 1928, but did appear in its Final Report dated December 19, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">It seems clear that when the Commission in the Final Draft departed from the use of the words \u201comitted in the assessment\u201d in the existing law, the change wras deliberate and was intended to narrow the scope of the addition of property for assessment and taxation for <em>prior years, </em>not exceeding four years. This new concept \u2014 changing the prior law as announced by our predecessors in regard to the application of <em>prior levies </em>to \u201cescaped property\u201d \u2014 was deliberately made narrow, probably to escape difficulty in the passage of the proposed new law by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The majority states that \u201c[N]o possible reason or policy has been suggested which might justify the distinction urged by appellants. There is no rational basis for distinguishing between property mistakenly granted a tax exemption and property which the assessor overlooked.\u201d and concludes that the construction which I think is the proper one \u201cproduces an unreasonable or illogical result,\u201d which under a well-established principle of statutory construction, is to be avoided, if possible. I disagree with this position completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">It is apparent to me that \u201cescaped property\u201d would principally apply to personal property, rather than to real property, since real property has a fixed situs and is difficult to be \u201cescaped property\u201d \u2014 although it is, of course, possible that there could be such. In sum, the Revision Commission did not intend to have the retrospective provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>proposed Section 31 apply to <em>all </em>property \u201comitted\u201d from assessment and taxation, but only to \u201cescaped property.\u201d There is, in my judgment, a sound public policy behind this concept. If the property in question is known to the assessors and has been assessed by them in the past but has not been taxed in a particular tax year because of some error, default or oversight by the assessing authorities, it is hardly fair to the owner, who has assumed that the assessors acted properly and in accordance with the applicable law, to find himself subjected to taxation for prior years, up to four. The owner, who has been guilty of no fault in the matter and who has arranged his financial affairs in accordance with the then <em>status quo, </em>should not be subjected to four years of back taxes resulting from some oversight or error of the assessing authorities. I am aware that the State cannot be legally estopped by the error of its officials and employees, but the General Assembly may well take the essential unfairness of such retrospective imposition of taxes into account in adopting tax legislation for the State. The instant case is a classic example, in my opinion, of how unfairly and oppressively the construction approved by the majority operates. As I see it, it begs the question to first observe that everyone is to pay his fair share of taxes and, from that, to jump to the conclusion that the taxpayer who in prior years did not pay what the taxing authorities <em>later </em>determine he should have paid should have to pay his share although there was no fault or deception on his part. His \u201cfair share\u201d of taxes is that assessed and taxed to him in the taxable years in question unless \u201cescaped property\u201d under \u00a7 34, as properly construed, is involved. Indeed, the windfall is not to the taxpayer who was incorrectly taxed, but is to the taxing authorities who, in addition to the tax retrospectively levied, obtain the substantial interest imposed in addition to the tax itself even though all of this results from their error. In the present case, the amount of retrospective taxes is $28,661.49, not including interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The majority indicates that <em>Mid Towne Plymouth, Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>State Dept. of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>228 Md. 66, 178 A. 2d 422 (1962), fails to support the theory of the appellants that \u201conly property which was unknown to the tax assessor or not on his records may be retroactively taxed under the escaped property statutes.\u201d My reading of the opinion in that case indicates the contrary. In <em>Mid Towne, </em>the corporate appellant taxpayer, which conducted an automobile sales and service business, had filed a <em>tangible personal property report </em>with the State Tax Commission for the year 1957, but <em>did not file </em>the required annual report for the years 1958 and 1959. After the corporation was placed on the list of delinquent corporations for forfeiture of its \u2022corporate charter for failure to file the reports, it filed annual reports for 1958 and 1959 and was removed from the forfeiture list. During 1959, no assessment was made against the taxpayer\u2019s personal property for 1959. On April 12, 1960, the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (which succeeded the State Tax Commission) did not accept the information furnished in the corporation\u2019s reports, but made tentative assessments in excess of the amounts reported. The corporation filed amended reports and the Department entered final assessments for 1958 and 1959 against the tangible personal property as escaped property. In affirming the assessments for 1958 and 1959, the Court rejected the contention of the taxpayer that the assessment upon escaped property could not be made after the expiration of the tax year in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">As the opinion in <em>Mid Towne </em>observes, the tangible personal property in a commercial corporation changes from year to year and the knowledge obtained by the assessing authorities for a prior year is no indication of what the tangible personal property will be in a subsequent year. Unless the corporate taxpayer makes the required report of its tangible personal property for the taxable year in question, the assessing authorities have no knowledge of what property is involved and hence such unreported property is \u201cescaped property\u201d under Art. 81, \u00a7 34. I see nothing inconsistent between the decision in <em>Mid Towne </em>and the position urged by the appellants in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Skinner Dry Dock Co. v. Baltimore City, </em>96 Md. 32, 53 A. 416 (1902), involved the prior Maryland statute in regard to \u201comitted property.\u201d The distinction between that statute and the present \u201cescaped property\u201d statute has already been pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The cases from sister states cited by the majority to support its construction of the statute do not, in my opinion, lend such support. Many of the cases cited involve statutes similar to the Maryland statute prior to the effective date of the Act of 1929, Ch. 226, providing for <em>\u201cescaped </em>property,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>property liable to taxation which \u201cmay have been omitted in the assessment.\u201d These cited cases are: <em>Talley v. Brown, </em>146 Iowa 360, 125 N. W. 248 (1910); <em>Inhabitants of Athens v. Whittier, </em>122 Me. 86, 118 A. 897 (1922); <em>McCanna v. Board of Assessors, </em>48 R.

E. 494 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">As already stated, it is clear to me that there is a definite distinction between property <em>\u201comitted\u201d </em>from assessment and <em>\u201cescaped\u201d </em>property so that the cases mentioned are not in point with regard to the Maryland statute concerning \u201cescaped property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Nor am I of the opinion that the attempted distinction by the majority of the cases supporting what I consider to be the proper construction of the Maryland \u201cescaped property\u201d statute is a valid one. These cases are: <em>Anniston City Land Co. v. State, </em>185 Ala. 482, 64 So. 110 (1913); <em>People v. Dunham, </em>311 Ill. 439, 143 N. E. 52 (1924); <em>German Savings Bank v. Trowbridge, </em>124 Iowa 514, 100 N. W. 333 (1904); <em>Thomas\u2019 etc. v. Comm, </em>308 Ky. 695, 215 S.W.2d 546 (1948); <em>Gully v. Mississippi Valley Co., </em>181 Miss. 669, 180 So. 745 (1938); <em>Adams v. Luce, </em>87 Miss. 220, 39 So. 418 (1905); <em>Marshall Wells Co. v. Foster County, </em>59 N. D. 599, 231 N. W. 542 (1930); and <em>Palmer v. Beadle County, </em>70 S. D. 99, 15 N.W.2d 6 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The attempted distinction is that in these cases \u201cthe property involved was in fact assessed and some tax money was paid for the past years in question.\u201d The opinions in these cases, however, indicate that the holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>property was not \u201cescaped property\u201d or, in several cases, \u201comitted property,\u201d was based upon the fact that the property was known to the assessors as being the property of the taxpayer and hence could not be said to be \u201cescaped\u201d or \u201comitted\u201d property. As the Supreme Court of Mississippi aptly stated in <em>Adams v. </em>Luce, 87 Miss. 220, 224-25, 39 So. 418, 419 (1905), <em>supra </em>\u2014 a case in which the statute provided for assessment and taxation of \u201cescaped property\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201cThe object of the law, in respect to the back-assessment of property by tne revenue agent, was to prevent property which had not been actually assessed at all from escaping its proper portion of the public burden of taxation. Property may escape taxation in varied ways, as, for example, (a) by being willfully withheld from assessment by the owner; (b) by being inadvertently or accidentally omitted by the owner in returning his property to the assessor. In either of these two cases, and in others which may be conceived, there has been in fact \u2014 there has been actually \u2014 escape of such property from taxation. It has never been assessed at all as a matter of fact, and it was the purpose of the law, in cases like these, where the regularly constituted fiscal officers had failed to assess all property liable to taxation, to authorize the revenue agent to back-assess such property never heretofore in fact assessed at all, and which was, therefore, described as property which had in fact escaped taxation. But, where an assessment has in fact been made, where the assessment roll shows on its face all that it ought to show \u2014 the name of the owner, the description of the property, the valuation of the property, the tax, etc. \u2014 but that assessment is irregular or imperfect or defective, or even absolutely and utterly void, by reason simply of a failure to comply with some vital and fundamental requirement of the law, such property cannot, within the meaning of these words, \u2018escaped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>taxation,\u2019 be said to be property which has escaped taxation in fact. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">,.* * * ^he very term \u2018escape,\u2019 ex proprio vigore, implies that it had never been found or known or listed for taxation. That escapes detection which never has been seen in fact. That escapes assessment which never has in fact been assessed in any way. That which, as a matter of fact, has been returned by the owner, placed upon the assessment roll by the assessor, dealt with by the board of supervisors and by the tax collector, cannot be said in any proper sense of the words \u2018escaped taxation,\u2019 or, within the scope of the evil to be remedied by the revenue law, to have escaped taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In a later Mississippi case, <em>Gully v. Mississippi Valley Co., supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Mississippi extended the holding in the <em>Adams </em>case to a case involving lots shown on the assessment rolls of the County as the property of the taxpayer but upon which no value had been placed upon them by the county assessors\u2014they having assumed that the valuations were to be made by the Mississippi State Tax Commission. In fact, the State Tax Commission did make the valuations and the owner paid the resulting taxes. Still later, the County decided to evaluate the lots and attempted to assess the lots as \u201cescaped property.\u201d The Supreme Court held that the County could not assess the lots as escaped property because they had not been withheld from the assessment rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Indeed, in several of the cases cited, the Courts held that if the property appeared on the assessment rolls, it could not be considered as \u201comitted property\u201d because it was not \u201comitted.\u201d <em>See People v. Dunham; Marshall Wells Co. v. Foster County; Thomas\u2019 etc. v. Comm.; </em>and <em>Palmer v. Beadle County, </em>all <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In short, as I read them, the decisions of the highest Courts of our sister states <em>sustain </em>the construction of the Maryland statute in regard to \u201cescaped property\u201d I believe to be the correct construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">For all of these reasons, I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\">. The letter of May 20, 1970, notified Mr. Duvall that Regulation No. 1 was invalid as being in conflict with the provisions of the Act of 1961, Ch. 884 \u2014 codified as Art. 81, \u00a7 8 (61; that the opinion of the Assistant Attorney General to that effect was enclosed; and that the exemption allowed should be rescinded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
