and</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The Special Master having thereafter invited views of any registered voter of the State who desired to present information or data in support of, or in opposition to, the legislative districting set forth in the Governor\u2019s Plan, and in the tentative plan submitted by the Special Master, such information and data to be submitted in writing to the Special Master on or before January 4, 1974;
