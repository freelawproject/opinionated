Grimm, United States District Judge\n   After a fire damaged Plaintiff Ram Gehani's real property, which he had insured with Defendant American Zurich Insurance Company (\"Zurich\"), and Zurich denied his claim under the insurance policy, Gehani sued Zurich for breaching the policy. Zurich has moved for summary judgment and, because Gehani failed to substantially comply with the policy's requirements for filing a proof of loss, I will grant the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Zurich provided builder's risk coverage (\"Policy\") to Gehani for the property located at 1933 McHenry Street in Baltimore, Maryland (\"the Property\"), for the period of April 1, 2014 through April 1, 2015. Jt. Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, ECF No. 22-3. The Policy imposed the following duties on Gehani:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   You must see that the following are done in the event of loss or damage to Covered Property:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2.

Ex. 1, ECF No. 22-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy provided that \"[n]o one may bring a legal action against [Zurich] ... unless ...

Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 (citations omitted). Plaintiff contends that he \"received a copy of the initial report from the Baltimore City Fire Department sometime after November 5, 2014, and provided a copy of the same to the Defendant soon thereafter.\" Pl.'s Opp'n 3 (citing Gehani Dep. 28:1-14, Jt. Ex. 4, ECF No. 22-8). But, at his deposition, he testified that \"two to three days\" after the fire department called him to inform him about the fire, he \"went to the\n   fire department to collect the report.\" Gehani Dep. 26:15-17. He also testified that he received the Incident Report \"10 to 15 days ... after the fire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:23-29:1. Thus, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Gehani as the non-moving party, the fire happened on October 21, 2014; Gehani learned about it on October 27, 2014; and he obtained the Incident Report between October 29 and November 5, 2014. Additionally, while the deposition page he cites includes his testimony that he \"contacted the Zurich company\" and \"file[d] a claim with Zurich for this fire,\" he did not state when he provided the Incident Report to Zurich.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gehani Dep. 28:1-25. And, he stipulated that he \"notified Zurich of the loss on December 11, 2014.\" Jt.

Gehani did not respond to Zurich's December 29, 2014 letter.\" Jt. Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Gehani retained counsel and provided Zurich with a letter of representation, which it received on January 6, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Thereafter, Zurich \"requested Gehani's recorded statement and other documentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Although he stipulated that he never provided a recorded statement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12, Plaintiff contends that he \"was willing and prepared to submit to a Statement Under Oath, but the same was canceled by Defendant,\" Pl.'s Opp'n 1 (citing Emails, Pl.s' Ex. 3, ECF No. 23-5). The emails between the parties' attorneys show that a recorded statement was scheduled for July 17, 2017, but did not take place. Emails 2. Gehani testified that Zurich sent an adjuster to the Property, but he did not state when that happened or what the adjuster learned, noting that he expects that Zurich's response to his document production requests will include the adjuster's report. Pl.'s Opp'n 4 &amp; n.1 (citing Gehani Dep. 19:4-8, 27:17-25, 32:7-8, 49:6-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Zurich sent a letter on July 2, 2015 \"formally request[ing] from Gehani a 'proof of loss within 60 days of the date of th[e] letter.' \" Jt.

Also, at some point, Zurich sent an adjuster to the Property. Gehani Dep. 19:4-8, 27:17-25, 32:7-8, 49:6-21. Yet, Zurich's request for Gehani to submit a proof of loss by August 31, 2015 directed him to include with the proof of loss all documents to support his claim, and it specifically requested permit applications, permits, proposals, estimates, contracts, loan applications, loan agreements, and monthly statements for loans for any work performed at the Property since January 1, 2010, as well as photographs of the work and any lease agreements or documents regarding code violations at the Property since January 1, 2010; in addition to utility records for the Property since January 1, 2013 and police reports generated as a result of the fire. July 2, 2015 Ltr. It is undisputed that Gehani did not submit a proof of loss or any of this requested information or respond to the request at all\n   within the sixty-day period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Further, while he did submit some \"documentation, including partial bank statements and water bills,\" Jt. Stmt. \u00b6 15, and he attempted to obtain a report from the fire marshal, he did not do either until months later, in March of 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ltr. to Fire Marshal; Ltr. to Zurich, Jt. Ex. 10, ECF No. 22-14. He insists that he provided the documents \"after [he] was able to parse out which charges were related to this property,\" stating that he \"owns several properties in Maryland[,] ... often employs contract workers and day laborers from Cases de Maryland to perform work on his properties, and did so on this case,\" and that \"[t]he remainder of the work was done by handymen....\" Pl.'s Opp'n 4. But he has not shown that he made any effort to contact the fire marshal sooner or to obtain any other relevant documentation. And he does not justify his failure either to provide any information within the sixty-day period or to notify Zurich that he was trying to obtain the information and to promise within that same period to provide information as soon as he obtained it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, Gehani has not shown that he \"furnished the insurer with information reasonably requested by the insurer to the extent that it is reasonably possible for the insured to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Himelfarb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"865591\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/355/671/\">\n    736 A.2d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, he has not shown that he \"expressly or impliedly promise[d] to submit, when and as it is reasonably possible for [him] to do so, the balance of the information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"865591\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/355/671/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His meager, belated efforts are a far cry from substantial compliance with the Policy requirements that he provide the proof of loss and supporting documentation, and that he do so within sixty days of the insurer's request. Accordingly, the facts of this case are more in line with\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   , where no proof of loss was submitted, than\n   <em>\n    Himelfarb\n   </em>\n   , where a signed response to the proof of loss request was submitted, along with a promise to supplement. Because the undisputed facts establish that Gehani has not substantially complied with the Policy requirements for submitting a proof of loss and supporting documents, Zurich has no obligation under the Policy to pay Gehani.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"865591\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/355/671/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Zurich is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and I will grant Zurich's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"865591\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/355/671/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Fed.
