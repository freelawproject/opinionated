Sex Discrimination Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge\" or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\" because of that individual's \"sex.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). In her amended complaint, plaintiff alleges that Coastal violated Title VII's prohibition by terminating her on the basis of sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Cts. I, III. Coastal counters that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for its decision-namely, plaintiff's myriad violations of company policy, which resulted in Coastal's penalization and a joint DOC-COGAR request to remove plaintiff from the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Supp. Def.'s Mot. 16-18. At the present juncture, this Court must resolve one central question: Has plaintiff \"produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find\" that Coastal's \"asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason\" for plaintiff's termination and that she instead was \"intentionally discriminated against\" on the basis of sex?\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The answer is clearly no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The bottom line is that plaintiff has failed to identify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence that calls into question Coastal's asserted non-discriminatory reason for plainitff's termination. To start, plaintiff was not able to identify the final decisionmakers in her case-much less tie those decisionmakers to any discriminatory motive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Dep. 60:9-11. She has not disputed or questioned Coastal's evidence, which shows that a number of employees-both male and female-were terminated for violations similar to those plaintiff committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coker Decl. \u00b6 16 (recounting each terminated employee's name, sex, and violations). Nor has plaintiff alleged that any other male employee in her situation-that is, one who \"(a) failed an intrusion test; (b) had a prime contractor or government client request their removal from the contract; and (c) caused Coastal to be penalized for an open post\"-was treated more favorably than plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Perhaps most importantly, plaintiff's own statements belie the notion that sex discrimination was the reason for her termination. During her deposition, plaintiff testified that she thought she was terminated \"because of [her]\n   <em>\n    union activities\n   </em>\n   .\" Pl.'s Dep. 18:9-11 (emphasis added). When counsel asked if there were \"any other reasons,\" plaintiff responded, \"[u]nion steward retaliation, yeah. That's it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110:14-21. That testimony mirrors statements plaintiff made in a labor charge she filed with the NLRB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 1. In the final analysis, then, plaintiff has failed to support an inference that sex discrimination, rather than Coastal's \"asserted non-discriminatory reason,\" was the \"actual reason\" for her termination.\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Retaliation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to outlawing status-based discrimination, Title VII also precludes employers from retaliating against an employee \"because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by\" Title VII or \"because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).

Plaintiff concedes, however, that she never reported that confrontation to anyone.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:2-7. Even if she had, Wallace's allegedly improper use of Smith's office is not an \"unlawful employment practice\" for purposes of Title VII-nor could it \"reasonably and in good faith be regarded\" as such.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051474,3769301\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1377/\">\n    666 F.3d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
