Durham has filed suit against defendants Larry Martin, Tennessee Commissioner of Finance and Administration; Connie Ridley, Tennessee Director of Legislative Administration; and David H. Lillard, Jr., Tennessee State Treasurer, in their official capacities. The plaintiff asserts a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of his right to procedural\n   due process, and he seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. (Compl., Doc. No. 1.) Now before the court is the defendants' Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. No. 8.) The motion has been fully briefed by both parties and is ripe for review. For the reasons set forth herein, the motion will be granted, and this case will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Jeremy Durham was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in November 2012 and again in November 2014, where he served until his expulsion on September 13, 2016. This lawsuit stems from that event, although it does not purport to challenge it directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 2, 2016, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued a proclamation to convene the Tennessee General Assembly for a special session. As set forth in the proclamation, the purpose of the special session was to \"[c]onsider[ ] and act[ ] upon legislation necessary to ensure that Tennessee law prohibiting an individual under the age of 21 from operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol maintains compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20161\">\n    23 U.S.C. \u00a7 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \" (Proclamation, Doc. No. 1-2), in order to avoid losing up to $60 million in federal highway funds. The other purposes of the special session identified by the proclamation were to \"[c]onsider[ ] and act[ ] upon legislation to address any other instances of noncompliance ... with federal [law] relating to federal-aid highway funding,\" make appropriations necessary to provide first-year funding for any such legislation, and make appropriations to pay for the special legislative session. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The special legislative session was authorized by Article III, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That provision specifically empowers the governor, \"on extraordinary occasions, [to] convene the General Assembly by proclamation, in which he shall state specifically the purposes for which they are to convene.\" Tenn. Const. art. III, \u00a7 9. On such occasions, the General Assembly \"shall enter on no legislative business except that for which they were specifically called together.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 13, 2016, the second day of the special session, Representative Susan Lynn (R-Mt. Juliet) introduced a motion in the House of Representatives to expel Durham. The Tennessee House of Representatives eventually voted on the motion and approved it by a margin of seventy votes in favor of expulsion to two against. Durham was immediately expelled from the House of Representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The House's authority to expel Durham arose from a different provision of the Tennessee Constitution, which states in relevant part that \"[e]ach House may ..., with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.\" Tenn. Const. art. II, \u00a7 12. Durham nonetheless maintains that the House of Representatives had no authority under the Tennessee Constitution to expel him during the special session, because the General Assembly's authority under Article III, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution is limited to the consideration of those matters of \"legislative business\" specifically identified in the proclamation calling for the special session. His expulsion was not a matter identified in the Governor's proclamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after his expulsion from the legislature, Durham inquired about the status of his health insurance coverage. He was informed that, as a result of the vote to expel him on September 13, his insurance coverage as an active state employee would terminate on September 30, 2016, after which date he would be eligible for COBRA coverage. An email attached to the Complaint, from Angie Gargara, Benefits Administration, to Tammy Rather,\n   which the plaintiff claims was forwarded to him, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The question of whether former Representative Durham is entitled to lifetime coverage as a retiree was decided by Commissioner Martin after consultation with the Attorney General's office. It is the Department's decision that expulsion from the General Assembly does not constitute \"retirement\" that the law requires for lifetime coverage, so Representative Durham is not entitled to that benefit. The Attorney General interpreted \"retirement\" to exclude expulsion in Attorney General Opinion 80-147.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. No. 1-3, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff claims that his unlawful expulsion from the House of Representatives resulted in the loss of his right to lifetime health insurance coverage as well as the loss of a state pension to which he would have otherwise been entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Complaint alleges that the defendants \"are public officials of the State of Tennessee,\" each of whom \"either oversees, administers, or regulates state insurance and benefit plans in some capacity.\" (Compl. \u00b6 5.) Defendant Larry Martin, Commissioner of Finance and Administration for the State of Tennessee, is \"responsible for administering state benefit plans for elected members of state government.\" (Compl. \u00b6 12.) Defendant Connie Ridley, Director of Legislative Administration for the State of Tennessee, is \"responsible for all administrative matters and member benefits for the Tennessee General Assembly.\" (Comp. \u00b6 13.) Defendant David H. Lillard, Jr., Treasurer for the State of Tennessee, \"overseas the daily operation of the State retirement system.\" (Compl. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To be clear, the plaintiff does not actually challenge the constitutionality of the state statutes and regulations that govern his claims to health and retirement benefits or the correctness of the state officials' interpretation of state benefits law. Rather, he simply contends that his expulsion from the legislature violated the Tennessee Constitution and, as a result, violated his \"protected property interest in his state benefits, specifically his pension and insurance benefits.\" (Compl. \u00b6 3.) Durham claims that, \"[b]ased on the plain language of Article III, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution and prior failed attempts to call a special session for the specific purpose of expelling him, [he] had the reasonable understanding that he would retain his state benefits (lifetime health insurance and a state pension) at the end of his term.\" (Compl. \u00b6 28.) He also asserts that he was \"afforded no post-deprivation remedy to challenge his expulsion or deprivation of his state benefits.\" (Compl. \u00b6 29.) Consequently, he claims that he was been deprived of his constitutional right to due process, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Defendants' Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants' motion seeks dismissal of the Complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and, alternatively, under Rule 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. They argue in support of the motion that (1) the plaintiff lacks standing, both because he fails to identify an injury in fact caused by the defendants and because he fails to identify a violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States; (2) even if he has standing, he lacks a protected property interest in either his elected office or in receiving lifetime state benefits, for purposes of asserting a due process claim under \u00a7 1983 ; and (3) even if he had a protected property interest, he was afforded all the process that was due. In the alternative, the defendants argue that, if the court finds that dismissal is not warranted on any of the above grounds, the court should abstain or dismiss the\n   Complaint under the\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine or certify the state constitutional question raised by the Complaint-that is, whether Durham's expulsion violated the state Constitution-to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The plaintiff filed a Response opposing each of these arguments. (Doc. No. 12.) The defendants filed a Reply. (Doc. No. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As set forth below, the court finds that the plaintiff fails to establish standing, because he does not draw the requisite causal connection between his injuries and any action by the defendants named in this case, as a result of which the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and must dismiss the Complaint. The court declines to reach the defendants' alternative arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Standard: Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A court's subject matter jurisdiction is a \"threshold determination\" that may be challenged by motion under Rule 12(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    Am.

The injury-in-fact component requires the plaintiff to \"allege an injury to himself that is distinct and palpable, as opposed to merely abstract, and the alleged harm must be actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitmore v. Arkansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p155\">\n    495 U.S. 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p155\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p155\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (internal citations omitted). The causation element requires the plaintiff to establish a \"causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\"-that is, the plaintiff must show that the alleged injury is \"fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original; citation omitted).

The plaintiff retorts that he \"suffered an actual injury when he lost his benefits without due process.\" (Doc. No. 12, at 1.) He also argues that he lost his benefits through the defendants' actions, because the defendants are charged with \"oversee[ing], administer[ing], or regulat[ing] state insurance and benefits plans.\" (Doc. No. 12, at 3.) Although the plaintiff concedes that the \"basis\" for the defendants' actions was \"an illegal act by the Tennessee legislature,\" he argues that it was the defendants, rather than the state legislature, who actually \"enforced the denial of benefits based on [the] unauthorized and unconstitutional expulsion.\" (Doc. No. 12, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In their Reply, the defendants insist that the plaintiff's \"real complaint\" is that the Tennessee House of Representatives denied him due process (Doc. No. 16, at 2), as illustrated by his repeated assertions that the expulsion vote itself violated the Tennessee Constitution and \"deprived Mr. Durham of any meaningful notice or opportunity to be heard.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 12, at 11 (\"The violation of [the plaintiff's] procedural due process rights [by the Tennessee legislature] led to Defendants' deprivation of Mr. Durham's protected property interests in his benefits and pension.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Injury in Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court finds, first, that the plaintiff at least arguably suffered an actual injury that is neither conjectural nor hypothetical: he was expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives, allegedly in violation of the Tennessee Constitution, and, as a result, he suffered a loss of certain benefits attendant upon his status as a state legislator, including lifetime health insurance coverage and, if he met certain qualifications, a retirement pension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The next standing question implicated by his suit is whether the plaintiff has alleged a causal connection between the defendants' actions and the injuries he has identified. He has not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Retirement Benefit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Durham was initially elected to the House of Representatives on November 6, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://sos.tn.gov/products/elections/election-results#2012. He became a member of the General Assembly and a state employee on election day.\n   <em>\n    Comer v. Ashe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10139620\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/514/730/#p733\">\n    514 S.W.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733 (Tenn. 1974) (citing Tenn. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3 ). He was re-elected on November 4, 2014, https://sos.tn.gov/products/elections/election-results#2014, but he was expelled from the Legislature on September 13, 2016, approximately eight weeks before the fourth anniversary of his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Tennessee law provides state employees a retirement benefit under the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System (\"TCRS\"). To obtain the retirement benefit, an employee must comply with the prescribed procedure for applying for it, but he also must meet certain eligibility requirements. (Doc. No. 9, at 14-15.) As relevant here, the plaintiff does not allege that he ever made any attempt to apply for retirement benefits under the prescribed procedure or otherwise. Moreover, the defendants explain that the plaintiff, as a former member of the Tennessee General Assembly, would not have become eligible for the retirement benefit unless and until he achieved a minimum of four years of creditable service. (Doc. No. 9, at 15.) The plaintiff does not contest that assertion. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 12, at 1 (\"Plaintiff Jeremy Durham was entitled to receive his vested retirement ... benefits after four\n   years of service as a state representative.\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, although the plaintiff claims that his \"entitlement to ... retirement benefits had already vested\" (Doc. No. 12, at 10), he also concedes that he was expelled from the General Assembly prior to the expiration of his second two-year term and, thus, prior to reaching four years of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In other words, it is undisputed, for purposes of the defendants' motion, that (1) the plaintiff did not serve four years as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, and (2) he was required to serve at least four years in order to be entitled to a retirement benefit. Because he was not a state employee for the minimum four-year period, his interest in the state retirement system did not vest, and he did not become eligible to receive a state pension. No action by any defendant caused that result-it followed directly and inexorably from the plaintiff's expulsion from the House of Representatives. That is, the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   basis for the plaintiff's claim that he was deprived of his right to retirement benefits is that he was wrongfully expelled from the House of Representatives by the allegedly illegal,\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   vote by that body during the September 2016 special session, not by any illegal action by the named defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that the plaintiff fails to show a causal connection between his loss of any entitlement to a state retirement pension and any action or inaction by the named defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Lifetime Health Insurance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff alleges that he inquired about his health insurance coverage and was informed that defendant Martin had \"decided Plaintiff's coverage would end on September 30, 2016.\" (Compl. \u00b6 25 &amp; Ex. B.) Under state law, the plaintiff would have been entitled to elect to retain retiree health benefits for life upon \"retirement\" from the legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208-27-208\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-27-208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (\"Upon retirement from the general assembly, any ... representative ... may elect to retain retiree health benefits by participating in the plan authorized by the state insurance committee ....\"). Durham, however, did not \"retire\" from his position, and he does not argue otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The plaintiff does not allege that the Tennessee law providing lifetime health insurance to former legislators only upon \"retirement\" from the state legislature is itself unconstitutional. Nor does he actually contend that the application of these state laws to his situation-that of an expelled lawmaker-was unconstitutional. Instead, the plaintiff complains that his expulsion from the House of Representatives was itself unlawful-that it violated the state Constitution and, therefore, his federal right to due process. In other words, his position appears to be that he would not have had a basis for complaining about the loss of the health insurance benefit if he had been\n   <em>\n    lawfully\n   </em>\n   expelled, either during a regular legislative session or during a special session called for that purpose. Once again, the act that he is complaining about is his purportedly unlawful expulsion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Complaint itself clearly reflects the plaintiff's understanding that the wrongs visited upon him resulted from his wrongful expulsion from the state legislature:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   2. Plaintiff's expulsion took place during a special session constitutionally designated and limited by Article III, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution to address federal highway funds.

The defendants, who took no part in that event, simply acted upon the facts presented to them: the plaintiff had been expelled from the General Assembly and was thereby rendered ineligible for lifetime health insurance. The plaintiff does not contend that he actually retired from the state legislature, as required by the statute to render him eligible for the lifetime insurance benefit. Thus, the action the plaintiff actually contests is his expulsion from the state legislature, on the basis that it altered his legal status as a state employee and, thus, his eligibility, as a matter of state law, for the benefit to which he claims an entitlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Suing the named defendants in this case amounts to an attempt to make an end-run around a challenge to the expulsion itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection between his alleged injuries and any action by the defendants, he lacks standing, and, consequently, this action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
