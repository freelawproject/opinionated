The CAFC concluded that my additional limitations were unsupported by the patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on the prior claim constructions, particularly the construction of \"valve,\" \"pump,\" and \"a controller connected to said pump and said at least one valve,\" I granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment on literal infringement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290930\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/154/1099/\">\n    154 F.Supp.3d at 1104-1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given that the valve is a subdevice/component of the pump and it is undisputed that the activation mechanism activates the pump, the valve is also activated by the mechanism, albeit indirectly, and thus the BPS System and each one of Pumps A-D meets the required limitation of having an activation mechanism configured to control a pump and a valve to which it is directly or indirectly joined, united, or linked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   C.

Claims 19 and 20 depend from Claim 18. Claim 19 discloses a trauma training system as disclosed in Claim 18 but with two wound sites. Claim 20 discloses a trauma training system disclosed in Claim 18 with a container housing the reservoir, pump, and at least one valve.

Describing this device as being in the field of \"wound simulators\" is a general observation, and more importantly, it does not remove the SH-CF Device from being either in the same field of endeavor of trauma training devices or at least reasonably pertinent to the problem to be solved. The SH-CF Device allows for hands-on practice of treating a bleeding wound, appears to be non-fragile in the sense that it does not use software, does not appear to require pre-programming, and given its simplicity, is undoubtedly cost-effective.

'852 Patent at 2. However, the relevant federal regulation indicates that a patent applicant's citation of a reference during prosecution is not an admission that the reference is prior art.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.97\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (\"The filing of an information disclosure statement shall not be construed to be an admission that the information cited in the statement is, or is considered to be, material to patentability[.]\").

Plaintiff argues that the personal fluid dispensing device in the Zelenak Patent is not in the same field of endeavor as a trauma training or wound simulation system. According to Plaintiff, trauma training and the replenishment of personal bodily fluids are completely different fields of endeavor. I agree with Plaintiff that no reasonable juror could conclude that the Zelenak Patent and the '852 Patent are devices within the same field of endeavor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   But, analogous prior art includes prior art that is reasonably pertinent to the problem to be solved. The '852 Patent was trying to overcome problems of previous hemorrhage training methods which were not dynamic or realistic enough because they were either too limited in scope of training (such as CPR mannequins), too complex for mass training with attendant problems of being too costly and fragile for use in the field, or too restricted in the type of wound they could simulate (such as humans with cards).

Even though Lynn King, the '852 Patent's inventor, knew about the Zelenak Patent and disclosed it, Plaintiff argues that the Zelenak\n   Patent would not have logically commended itself to the inventor's attention in considering the problem he was addressing.

Thus, the fact that the Zelenak Patent is not designed as a trauma training device is not conclusive as to whether it is analogous prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   There are reasonable competing inferences that the Zelenak Patent is reasonably pertinent to the problems confronting King, who cited it in his patent application. Because the Zelenak Patent discloses a portable, lightweight system easily worn by a person as a backpack and which mechanically pumps fluid from a collapsible reservoir into a tube and then out of a nozzle, it could be reasonably concluded that it would have logically commended itself to King's attention in attempting to create a more dynamic and realistic trauma training device.

But, in contrast to the Zelenak Patent, I agree with Plaintiff that as a matter of law, no reasonable juror could determine that the Sirhan Patent is\n   reasonably pertinent to the problems King was solving to solve. The Sirhan Patent does have some features which overlap with the Zelenak Patent, including a storage container for liquid, a pump, an activation trigger, and a tube connecting the liquid to a dispensing hole. But, the storage container is not disclosed as being collapsible, the patent does not disclose a nozzle capable of dispensing fluid but only a pinhole designed to squirt fluid, and use of the device may require a belt to which the liquid container is attached as well as velcro straps attached to the tube so the user can strap the tube to his or her clothes to prevent the tube from becoming an obstacle during water competition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sirhan Patent 3:44-45 (container preferably made of high impact plastic); 3:64-65 (\"container\n   <strong>\n    24\n   </strong>\n   is made from hard, high impact plastic\"); 3:65-68 (liquid container unlikely to cause injury to user or water competition participant because it is attached to the user's belt); 4:22 (end cap has a pin hole opening); 4:35-39 (use of velcro straps); 5:11-12 (claim element claiming a glove opening \"for squirting liquid\"); 5:46-51 (claim element claiming tube with an end cap having a pin hole opening); 6:20-13 (claim element claiming container made from hard, high impact plastic).

The SABAS Device\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As described in a 1980 publication by the United States Army, the SABAS Device, which has the same components as the '852 Patent except for a collapsible reservoir, functions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Principal components of the device are the six plastic moulages of a wounded forearm which is bleeding from the artery. Each of these moulages is life-size and realistically colored. They may be placed on foam rubber in trays, which are provided, or strapped onto dummies or human \"subjects\" during the first-aid training. The six moulages may be operated separately or simultaneously.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Simulated blood, mixed from a powder provided with the device, is stored in the 5-gallon reservoir provided. Manifold valves control the blood flow to the desired moulage(s) so that it flows into the moulage and out of the wound, as it would on a wounded person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Control of the simulated blood is accomplished by means of a pump and power-supply unit, six blood supply lines, a bypass return line, and a main blood-supply line.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Eastman Oct. 2, 2017 Decl., Ex. 28 at 9, ECF 213-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The photos of the SABAS Device show that it is a considerably larger device than the \"Field Expedient Bleeding Simulation System\" (FEBSS) product Plaintiff makes and markets as the patented invention.\n   <em>\n    Compare id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 213-8 (photo of SABAS Device)\n   <em>\n    and id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 29 at 8, ECF 213-9 (photo of SABAS Device),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   King Aug. 14, 2015 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-9, ECF 99 (description of the invention with accompanying photo of Plaintiff's Hydrasim or FEBSS product),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7 to Lovett Sept. 4, 2015 Decl., ECF 129-7 at 6 (photo of FEBSS in advertisement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the size difference between the SABAS Device and the patented invention renders the SABAS Device irrelevant as prior art.

In the drawings, the simulacrum is made to resemble an abdomen such that one would practice wound closing directly on that component while it is housed in the structure with the simulated blood flowing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As for the supply tank, the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 discloses a \"closed unit with a removable air-tight opening\" which Defendant argues discloses a collapsible reservoir.

J. 42, ECF 227.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, Defendant cites to Exhibit 3 of Guentzler's August 1, 2017 Third Supplemental Expert Report re: Invalidity. Def.'s Am. Mot. for Sum. J., ECF 227. Exhibit 3 is a Claim Chart in which Guentzler asserts that the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 has a collapsible reservoir because the disclosed supply tank is a closed unit with removable air-tight opening. Guentzler Aug. 1, 2017 Supp'l Inv. Rep., Ex. 3, ECF 210-7 at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In opposing Plaintiff's motion, Defendant more clearly states that \"[b]ecause the reservoir described in the Niiranen Patent No. 1 has an 'air-tight opening,' the reservoir must necessarily flex or fold as the volume of the container of fluid is drawn out.\" Def.'s Opp. 24, ECF 234. For support, Defendant cites to Exhibit 6 to Guentzler's January 2015 Invalidity Report which is a Claim Chart that states that the '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2, not the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1, satisfies the \"collapsible reservoir\" element of Claim 18 of the '852 Patent because it \"[i]ncorporates by reference a description of an air tight supply tank.\" Guentzler Jan. 2015 Supp'l Inv. Rep., Ex. 6, ECF 210-3 at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 discloses that the \"supply tank\n   <strong>\n    12\n   </strong>\n   is a closed unit\n   with a removable air-tight opening\n   <strong>\n    45\n   </strong>\n   for replenishing the colored synthetic blood.\" '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1, 3:24-26. Earlier, the patent states that the \"tank\n   <strong>\n    12\n   </strong>\n   may be supplied with a continual steady air pressure, through inlet\n   <strong>\n    31\n   </strong>\n   by means of conduit\n   <strong>\n    32\n   </strong>\n   from a small air compressor\n   <strong>\n    33\n   </strong>\n   driven by electric motor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 3:3-6. The drawings show the supply tank as a rigid box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   While the claims themselves in the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 do not expressly recite a rigid storage tank or alternatively, a collapsible reservoir, each one of them discloses that the liquid in the tank is pressurized, thereby forcing the liquid out of the tank for use in the simulation. '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1, 4:14-75 (claiming a pressurized tank in each of five separate claims). With these disclosures, no reasonable juror could accept Defendant's argument that the disclosure of the tank being \"air tight\" necessitates the disclosure of a collapsible reservoir when each claim in the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 recites a pressurized system for storage of the liquid. That is, Defendant's argument that the recitation of \"air tight\" necessarily discloses a collapsible reservoir is untenable in the presence of a pressurized system. The '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 does not teach a collapsible reservoir in the context of the pressurized system disclosed by the claims of that patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   b. The '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Defendant makes the same assertion as to the '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2, contending that its \"closed unit with a removable air-tight opening\" discloses a collapsible reservoir. Def's Am. Mot. for Sum. J. 42, ECF 227. The '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2 is addressed to \"a training means for simulating early emergency casualty care\" and particularly to \"moulages which are fitted around the 'patient' to provide realistic simulation of wounds.\" '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2, 1:19-22, ECF 224-7;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   , 2:40, 2:45-46 (describing moulages \"adapted to be fitted on a volunteer\" which are \"connected by rubber tubing to a central fluid supply.\"). The claims themselves are primarily directed to the moulages, providing only for \"a supply of simulated blood\" without further elaboration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 6:21-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The patent description, however, makes clear that the supply tank disclosed in the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 is to be used in the '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2. The '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2 states that the \"fluid supply system contains a fluid storage tank\n   <strong>\n    12\n   </strong>\n   which is adapted to store venous and arterial blood flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 2:46-48. Figure 1 shows what appears to be a box as the tank. Later, the '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2 refers to the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1 when it states that the \"simulated blood supply unit has been more fully described in the co-pending application, Serial No. 588,584 and will not be further described here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 3:2-5. It also states that \"CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   supply and solenoid have been substituted for the air compressor in order to make the pressure producing means portable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 3:5-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As with the '579 Niiranen Patent No. 1, the '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2 discloses a pressurized tank system. Accordingly, Defendant's contention that the recitation of an air-tight supply tank necessarily discloses a collapsible reservoir is without support in the '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2. No reasonable juror could conclude otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   3. The Zelenak Patent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiff contends that in contrast to the '852 Patent, the Zelenak patented device lacks both a wound site and a valve connected to a controller. Plaintiff also argues that it is not a \"trauma training system.\" As to the valve, Plaintiff argues that Defendant provides no evidence that one exists in the device. There is no dispute\n   that it has a pump, but Stevick states that there is no evidence that the pump used in that device has an internal valve. Stevick Aug. 15, 2017 Supp'l Reb. Inv. Rep. 17-18, ECF 224-5. Guentzler, however, explains that consistent with Plaintiff's infringement contentions, if the pump of the Zelenak device includes internal valves, then the device has a valve in fluid communication with the pump. Guentzler Aug. 1, 2017 Supp'l Inv. Rep., Ex. 3, ECF 210-7 at 36. Plaintiff is correct that there is no affirmative evidence of the existence of a valve. However, the disclosure of a pump creates a reasonable inference that the pump possesses an internal valve. Thus, there is an issue of fact as to this component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   During claim construction I construed \"wound site,\" as used in Claim 18, to mean \"a simulated injury having an opening through which fluid can flow to simulate a hemorrhage.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290930\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/154/1099/\">\n    154 F.Supp.3d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties' experts offer contradictory opinions as to whether the nozzle in the Zelenak device satisfies the claim limitation of \"wound site.\" Guentzler Aug. 1, 2017 Supp'l Inv. Rep., Ex. 3, ECF 210-7 at 37-38 (stating that the valve or nozzle is \"used to direct a flow fluid, which when inserted into a mouth may simulate a bleeding mouth\"); Stevick Aug. 15, 2017 Supp'l Reb. Inv. Rep. 17, ECF 224-5 (the drinking nozzle of the Zelenak personal hydration system is not a wound site because the nozzle is not a simulated injury and does not simulate hemorrhaging).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   I agree with Plaintiff that no reasonable juror could conclude that the nozzle used in the Zelenak device is a \"wound site\" as defined. It simply lacks a simulated injury. Claim 18 of the '852 Patent discloses a separate wound site element which means that Claim 18 includes a component specifically designed to look like an injury. The Zelenak device nozzle is not such a component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the Zelenak device is not a \"trauma training system\" as required by the preamble to Claim 18. Claim 18 recites that it is a \"trauma training system for replicating at least one hemorrhage, said system comprising: [reciting elements].\" '852 Patent, 14:3-4. Plaintiff notes that the '852 Patent consistently describes the invention not as a mere collection of components such as a pump, valve, and controller, but as a trauma training system. It is the title of the '852 Patent. It is noted in the abstract to be a \"system for simulating one or more hemorrhages.\" '852 Patent at 1. The preamble to two of the three independent claims discloses that it is a \"trauma training system for replicating at least one hemorrhage[.]\" '852 Patent, 11:43-44 (Claim 1), 14:3-4 (Claim 18). All dependent claims also disclose a \"trauma training system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290930\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/154/1099/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 11:54, 58, 65, 12:1, 4, 16, 19, 31, 39, 41, 44, 54, 65, 13:1, 4, 14:15, 22. Plaintiff argues that nothing in the Zelenak Patent teaches use of its beverage-supplying personal hydration system as a trauma training system, and no reasonable factfinder could find otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Defendant argues that the preamble language is not limiting. Defendant acknowledges that a preamble can be limiting when it serves as an antecedent basis for limitations in the claim body.\n   <em>\n    Eaton Corp. v.

On the other hand, if the body of the claim sets out the complete invention, then the language of the preamble may be superfluous.\") (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Defendant argues that Claim 18's preamble provides no antecedent element for the asserted claims. Further, Defendant notes that there is no\n   evidence in the prosecution history where the patent examiner relied on the preamble to limit a claim element. Defendant argues that the preamble provides only a purpose or an intended use for the device, and thus, cannot be limiting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the \"trauma training system\" language in the preamble supplies a fundamental characteristic of the assembled elements and thereby breathes \"life, meaning, and vitality\" into the claims.\n   <em>\n    Deere &amp; Co. v.

On the other hand, a preamble is not limiting where a patentee defines a structurally complete invention in the claim body and uses the preamble only to state a purpose or intended use for the invention.

In\n   <em>\n    Deere &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , the patent at issue disclosed an \"easy clean dual wall deck\" for a rotary cutter pulled behind a tractor to cut or mow large swaths of ground.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869975\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1349/#p1357\">\n    703 F.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, that factor is not determinative. Similar to the torsional stiffness element in\n   <em>\n    Deere &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , the presence of the \"wound site\" element in Claim 18 is informed by the preamble limitation of \"trauma training system.\" The \"wound site\" limitation in Claim 18, even with the claim construction definition of \"a simulated injury having an opening through which fluid can flow to simulate a hemorrhage\" has little or no context without the presence of \"trauma training system.\" Thus, the preamble is essential to understanding the term in the claim body. Further, as in\n   <em>\n    Poly America\n   </em>\n   , \"trauma training system\" is the title of the '852 Patent and is recited in the preamble to every claim but one. The background of the invention establishes that the invention was conceived as a response to needs for a more dynamic and realistic trauma training system. Three of the four exemplary embodiments describe the invention as a trauma training system. '852 Patent, 2:9-36.

The specification thus shows the importance of the additional \"structure\" recited in the \"trauma training system\" preamble language.

But, even with that consensus, I reject Defendant's argument that no expert testimony is needed on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed definition focuses on the EMT experience both in terms of having an EMT certificate and having provided EMT training or the equivalent. It includes a basic high school education or equivalent which supports a conclusion that the scientific and engineering principles are not difficult. Defendant's proposed definition includes a person who has \"a basic understanding of electrical and mechanical systems.\" The reference to \"basic\" suggests that the skill level is not high, but, because the proposal singles out electrical and mechanical systems, it suggests a greater skill level than Plaintiff's proposal which more generally requires a high school or equivalent education without mentioning anything about electrical or mechanical processes. And, in contrast to Plaintiff's proposed definition emphasizing trauma treatment skills, Defendant's proposal requires only that the person have familiarity with the appearance and treatment of trauma conditions. Overall, Plaintiff's proposed POSA has more experience in trauma training than Defendant's proposed POSA and Defendant's proposed POSA has more specific requirements for mechanical and electrical systems knowledge than Plaintiff's proposed POSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Defendant suggests that no specific POSA finding is required because \"the prior art discloses all of the elements of the asserted claims and teaches how the components work together to create a training device.\" Def.'s Am. Reply 29, ECF 240. I disagree. While the prior art informs the finding, the prior art does not resolve the dispute between the parties regarding how much experience in EMT training or in mechanical and electrical knowledge the POSA must have. The prior art references indicate that a POSA is someone with some trauma training experience. The prior art references also indicate a need for a basic understanding of mechanical and electrical systems. But, the prior art references do not dictate the\n   <em>\n    precise level\n   </em>\n   of experience in trauma training or the\n   <em>\n    precise level\n   </em>\n   of knowledge of the scientific principles. Thus, the dispute between the parties about the proper POSA is material and is unresolved on summary judgment because a reasonable juror examining the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party could credit either party's proposed POSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   D.

As discussed above, \"trauma training system\" is limiting on Claim 18. This system, based on reading the '852 Patent in its entirety, is one that must be adaptable to several uses and practices, including mass casualty training. While there is no express reference to \"portability\" in Claims 18, 19, or 20, the '852 Patent's recitation of the limitations of the prior art and the patent's discussion of several different embodiments support a conclusion that \"portability\" is not an \"extraneous factor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The '852 Patent recites that it was intended to provide a more realistic and dynamic bleeding simulation and thus a more realistic and dynamic training experience.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , '852 Patent at 1 (abstract), 1:18-21, 2:3-5.

Portability is achieved when the invention as a whole is considered and practiced. As a result, portability is not \"an extraneous factor\" and commercial success related to that feature is relevant to nonobviousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of nexus by virtue of the FEBSS sales figures, which, while minimal absent market share context, are for sales of the claimed invention. There is also evidence of commercial desirability of the entire system. Defendant fails to rebut the prima facie presumption of nexus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   2. Long-Felt Need\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Evidence of a long-felt but unresolved need shows nonobviousness because it is reasonable to infer the need would not have persisted had the solution been obvious. Plaintiff argues that while prior art devices addressed the need for more realistic hemorrhage control training, no prior trauma training system allowed a hemorrhage in a live action training scenario as is possible with the patented device's particular arrangement of components including the controller, pump, valve, and wound site(s). Stevick opines that there was a long-felt need for a powered bleeding simulation system that was portable and concealable and which could be worn by a trainer patient to simulate traumatic hemorrhage on demand in a live action environment. Stevick June 2015 Inv. Rep. \u00b6 27, ECF 98-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Stevick's opinion creates an issue of fact as to the long-felt but unresolved need satisfied by the '852 Patent. Even without Stevick's testimony, however, the long-felt need for more realistic trauma training is found in the prior art.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2, 1:23-38, ECF 224-7 (stating that \"[t]he existing methods for teaching early emergency casualty care, or first aid, are unsatisfactory in the realism obtained by the simulation\" and reciting problems with existing methods as unsatisfactory in the realism obtained because (1) tags on subjects describing wound type provided only minimal realism; (2) painted wound on subject increased realism but provided inadequate simulation; and (3) moulages painted with wounds improved realism but complete realism unobtainable without a flow of blood through open wounds ). The prior art attempted to address that need.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 1:57-59 (\"[a]n object of the invention is to provide realistic simulation of injury whereby training in first aid is provided under conditions closely analogous to actual injury\"). Thus, the '304 Niiranen Patent No. 2, issued in 1960, along with the '579 Niiranen Patent No.1, issued in 1959, provided for a simulacrum containing an artificial body member with simulated layers of skin and blood vessels along with a simulated blood supply reservoir.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 1:39-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Defendant is correct that the prior art resolved the need for more realistic training systems.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , the Niiranen patents, the SABAS Device. However, the record also lacks a prior art device that increased the realism through use of a collection of\n   components as disclosed in Claim 18 of the '852 Patent which allows, as Plaintiff notes, for on-demand hemorrhage simulation in a live action environment using backpacks, mannequins, etc. Accordingly, Plaintiff produces evidence of long-felt but unmet need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   3. Failure of Others\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Failure of others to find a solution to the problem is objective evidence of nonobviousness.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Cyclobenzaprine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755968\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/1063/#p1068\">\n    676 F.3d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"evidence of a longfelt need for an extended-release formulation and the failure of others to formulate one strongly support a conclusion of nonobviousness\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reiner v. I. Leon Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2002983\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/285/501/#p504\">\n    285 F.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 504 (2d. Cir. 1960) (Hand, J.) (The failure of others to create an invention while having the means to do so and knowing of a need is evidence that the invention \"demanded more intuition than was possessed by the ordinary workers in the field.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Guentzler contends that Kevin Sweeney, Simulaids's former president, was one of ordinary skill in the art of trauma training devices and probably highly skilled in that art. Guentzler July 21, 2015 Dep. 224:19, ECF 97-6. Given that Simulaids is in the business of making simulation training aids for medical workers, it is reasonable to infer that Simulaids and Sweeney would have recognized the need for increasingly realistic training systems and would be motivated to improve upon their products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pro-Mold &amp; Tool Co. v. Great Lakes Plastics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"797\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/1568/#p1573\">\n    75 F.3d 1568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (court recognized \"self-evident proposition that mankind, in particular, inventors, strive to improve that which already exists\"). Yet, even though Simulaids already made the SABAS and SH-CF Devices, it did not manufacture a device equivalent to that disclosed in Claim 18 of the '852 Patent. This supports a finding of nonobviousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   4. Copying\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Copying of the invention is evidence of nonobviousness.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crocs, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221274\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1294/#p1310\">\n    598 F.3d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff notes that Defendant released its BPS in late 2011, after learning about King's invention in 2010. Kit Lavell Sept 24, 2014 Dep. 76:8-23, 80:17-18, ECF 129-11. This creates an inference of copying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   5. Summary re: Objective Factors of Nonobviousness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Plaintiff has evidence of industry praise. It has minimal evidence of commercial success. Plaintiff's evidence supports a finding of nexus. Defendant fails to rebut that finding. Plaintiff has evidence of a failure of others, namely Simulaids, to create the device. Plaintiff raises an inference of copying with the timing of Defendant learning of Plaintiff's device before releasing its own. A juror, however, could reasonably conclude that the timing does not establish copying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The record, when construed in Defendant's favor, suggests that prior art did address the long-felt need to provide more realistic trauma training. However, when construed in Plaintiff's favor, the record is capable of suggesting that the use and particular arrangement of the components satisfied an unmet need for a more realistic hemorrhage simulator used to train first responders that was sturdier, less expensive, and more flexible in its uses than previously existed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Overall, when viewed in Plaintiff's favor, the objective, secondary considerations of nonobviousness support Plaintiff. But, when viewed in Defendant's favor, some of these considerations do not show nonobviousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   E. Summary of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   Factors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   There are issues of fact as to whether the Zelenak Patent is analogous prior art, as to whether the Zelenak Patent discloses a valve,\n   as to the proper POSA, and as to some of the secondary considerations of nonobviousness. These are to be resolved by the factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   F. Motive to Combine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   While motive to combine is not one of the four\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors, it is a relevant inquiry.

A reasonable juror could conclude that to create more realistic trauma or hemorrhage control training simulations and to overcome the problems in the prior art (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , motive created by design need and/or\n   nature of the problem to be solved), a POSA would have looked at devices in the same field of endeavor including those with mechanical blood pumping systems, collapsible reservoirs, and moulages/wound sites. Thus, a reasonable juror could find, even without expert testimony, a motive to choose these two prior art devices and combine them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Plaintiff argues that a skilled artisan would not have relied on the SABAS Device as a prior art reference because it had a five-gallon supply tank, a car battery, and a desk-sized wooden crate housing the entire device. And, Plaintiff contends that given these features of the SABAS Device, a skilled artisan would not have expected success in achieving an adaptable, flexible, or portable training device simply by substituting the collapsible reservoir of the SH-CF Device for the rigid tank of the SABAS Device. Plaintiff also argues that a POSA at the time of the invention would not have been motivated to combine the SABAS and SH-CF Devices because the combination would compromise the functionality of the SABAS Device. That device has lengthy hoses and multiple moulages used to train up to six people simultaneously. According to Stevick, the combination would provide an inadequate supply of simulated blood to fill the hoses in the SABAS Device needed to function as a trauma training device for teaching hemorrhage control. Stevick Aug. 2017 Supp'l Reb. Inv. Rep. 7, ECF 224-5. According to Plaintiff, there is no evidence or logical explanation to show why a POSA would abandon the SABAS Device's functionality in order to combine it with the tiny reservoir of the SH-CF to arrive at an inoperable device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The CAFC has affirmed a determination of nonobviousness when the alleged combination would have destroyed a basic objective of how the prior art reference would have functioned.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trivascular, Inc. v.

The feasability, or lack thereof, of the proposed combination is not controlling. The issue is what a POSA would have learned at the time of the invention from each of the references and what the combination would have suggested. Here, reasonable minds could differ as to whether a POSA, under either party's proposed definition, would rely on the SABAS Device as a prior art reference in an effort to address the problem to be solved, or would have expected a likelihood of success. Reasonable minds could also differ as to whether a POSA would be motivated to combine the two devices even assuming that the combination may impede the functioning of the SABAS Device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   As to whether the combination yielded nothing more than a predictable result, Defendant argues that making a device more \"portable\" is not \"inventive.\" Defendant relies on a 1952 case which held that the \"elements must cooperate in such a manner as to produce a new, unobvious, and unexpected result.\"\n   <em>\n    Application of Lindberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"508191\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/194/732/#p736\">\n    194 F.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (C.C.P.A. 1952).

Instead, a combination of prior art elements is patentable even if portability is the distinguishing feature over the prior art but only if the new combination in the claimed invention creates a new and unexpected result. Thus, the question is whether the combination of prior art yields anything more than predictable results to one of ordinary skill in the art. Guentzler opines that the combination of claim elements in Claim 18 does not produce unexpected results. Guentzler Jan. 2015 Supp'l Inv. Rep. \u00b6 76, ECF 210-3 (stating that the elements, \"when combined, produce exactly the results a person of ordinary skill in the art would expect: a device that pumps simulated blood to a simulated wound to simulate trauma\").

Other Proposed Combinations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   All of Defendant's other proposed combinations rely on similar arguments which do not warrant extensive, separate discussion. Generally, Defendant asserts that any combination of the SABAS and/or either Niiranen Patent with the SH-CF and/or the Zelenak Patent would have been obvious for the same reasons discussed above. Plaintiff raises similar arguments, including that combining either Niiranen patented device with a collapsible reservoir would not have produced an operational system and that a POSA would not have been motivated to look to the Zelenak Patent as prior art because it is unrelated to trauma training and it lacks a wound site. Plaintiff also argues that combining the Zelenak Patent with the SH-CF Device does not create a trauma training device due to the use of a gravity switch in the Zelenak device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stevick Aug. 15, 2017 Supp'l Reb. Inv. Rep. 17-18, ECF 224-5. For the reasons discussed in the previous section, there are issues of fact regarding the motive to combine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   G. Summary re:\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   Factors &amp; Motivation to Combine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Obviousness is a conclusion of law based on the underlying\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors considered with the motive to combine. In considering Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, I construe all inferences of material fact in favor of Defendant. Thus, I assume (1) the Zelenak Patent is analogous prior art; (2) the Zelenak Patent has a valve; (3) a POSA is \"a person having familiarity with the appearance and treatment of trauma conditions, and a basic understanding of electrical and mechanical systems\"; (4) combinations of various prior art devices would be functional; (5) there is no evidence of copying and other evidence of secondary considerations is present but commercial success sales figures without market share are weak; and (6) given the resolution of these factual disputes in Defendant's favor, this POSA would have been motivated to combine the SABAS Device with the SH-CF or the Zelenak Patent by a desire to satisfy the design and market need for more realistic, cost effective trauma training devices which are durable and suitable for mass casualty live training simulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   A person having familiarity with the appearance and treatment of trauma conditions, and a basic understanding of electrical and mechanical systems (Defendant's proposed POSA), would have had knowledge of the analogous prior art devices,\n   including the Zelenak Patent, and would have been motivated to combine the prior art devices because of the design need and pressure from the military market. In order to improve upon the prior art and create a more dynamic and realistic trauma training system that was flexible, adaptable, cost-effective, and suited to live action mass casualty simulations, this POSA would have looked for devices that included a mechanized liquid supply, moulages or wound sites with multiple lines, a collapsible reservoir, and were relatively small in size-in other words, the prior art relied on by Defendant. The combination would not have changed the respective functions of the prior art components. The combination produced a trauma training device consistent with the limiting preamble to Claim 18. The result was predictable because using a collapsible reservoir with a system that already disclosed a mechanical blood pumping system (with pump, valve, and controller) and a wound site, would predictably produce a system that was capable of simulating a more realistic and dynamic hemorrhage simulation because it would have been more flexible, adaptable, and portable. Thus, construing the disputed inferences in Defendant's favor, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on obviousness must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Considering Defendant's motion, I construe the inferences in Plaintiff's favor. Thus, I assume: (1) the Zelenak Patent is not analogous prior art; (2) the combination of the SABAS and SH-CF Devices would not have been functional; (3) the combination of the either of the Niiranen patents with a collapsible reservoir from the SH-CF device would not have functioned given the compressed air/gas method disclosed in the Niiranen patents; (4) a POSA is a \"person possessing at least an emergency medical technician (EMT) certificate and high school degree (or similar educational background) with a year of hands on experience in EMT training or similar work history\"; (5) there is evidence of copying along with evidence of other secondary conditions of nonobviousness; and (6) given the resolution of these factual disputes in Plaintiff's favor, this POSA would have had little or no motive to combine the prior art devices because with less knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems, the relevance of the SABAS Device would have been diminished due to its size, and the functional obstacles to the combinations would have deterred consideration of them. This POSA, starting with prior art of the SABAS and SH-CF Devices and the Niiranen patents, would not have thought to combine them. This POSA would not have been motivated to choose these particular prior art references and would not have expected a likelihood of success by combining them. Additionally, given that the Zelenak Patent is the only prior art reference to teach a\n   <em>\n    portable\n   </em>\n   mechanical fluid supply system, its omission as analogous prior art would deprive this POSA of a key reference. Thus, even in the presence of market or design need, this POSA would not have been motivated to combine the prior art references in ways suggested by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   A person possessing at least an emergency medical technician (EMT) certificate and high school degree (or similar educational background) with a year of hands on experience in EMT training or similar work history\" (Plaintiff's proposed POSA), at the time of the invention would have had knowledge of the analogous prior art devices but would not have been motivated to combine the prior art devices given the differences between the claims and the prior art and given the functional impairments produced by the combinations. Considering the evidence in Plaintiff's favor, the prior art devices did not teach the particular combination of components that allowed for the flexible, portable, and adaptable system claimed in Claim 18. In\n   this light, it could be concluded that the patent claims at issue represent a device beyond this POSA's technical knowledge and would not have been obvious at the time of the invention. Thus, when all inferences are construed in Plaintiff's favor and with the recognition of Defendant's burden being one of clear and convincing evidence, Defendant's motion on the issue of obviousness is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   UNENFORCEABILITY-INEQUITABLE CONDUCT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Both parties move for summary judgment on Defendant's affirmative defense of inequitable conduct in which Defendant asserts Plaintiff failed to disclose three material prior art references to the PTO while prosecuting the '852 Patent.

Or. Apr. 1, 2016). In the context of the attorney fee motion, Plaintiff relied on Metzenthin's Declaration to argue that the failure to include the three references in the '852 Patent application was oversight. With that, I concluded that Metzenthin's statements raised an inference of \"negligence or even gross negligence, but not a specific intent to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208678445\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, because there were multiple inferences, Defendant could not establish deceptive intent in support of an attorney's fee award based on inequitable conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208678445\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Here, Plaintiff again relies on Metzenthin's Declaration in which he recalls being involved in the prosecution of the '665 Application which became the '852 Patent, and the earlier '891 Application. Metzenthin Decl. \u00b6 4, ECF 128. He states that before the allegations of inequitable conduct, he was unaware of references in the '891 Application that were not cited in the '665 Application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. He explains that the omission of references from the '891 Application which were cited in the '665 Application was inadvertent on his part and \"certainly not intentional.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Elizabeth Arwine, the Chief Patent Attorney for the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command, declares that she oversees patent applications owned by the Army, and oversaw those for the '891 Application and the '665 Application. Arwine Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF 225. She retained outside counsel Cahn &amp; Samuels to prepare and prosecute both applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. She makes the same assertions as Metzenthin: before these allegations, she was unaware of any failure to cross-cite the references between the two applications and any failure to disclose references in connection with the '665 Application was inadvertent and not intentional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6. Finally, Corey Mack, who was an associate at Cahn &amp; Samuels during the relevant time, was involved in the prosecution of the two applications and makes the same statements: before these allegations, he was unaware\n   of any failure to cross-cite the references between the two applications and any such failure to disclose references to the PTO in connection with the '665 Application was inadvertent and not intentional. Mack Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, 5, 6, ECF 226.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Defendant argues that there is no reasonable explanation to justify the withholding of the Niiranen patents and the Bardsley Application from the PTO during the prosecution of the '852 Patent other than to specifically deceive the PTO. Defendant observes that the same family of patents is involved, King is the inventor, and Cahn &amp; Samuels, LLP was King's representative. The attorneys knew of the prior art, knew the prior art was material, and yet failed to cite to these prior art references during the prosecution of the '852 Patent. Defendant characterizes this as \"blatant withholding\" resulting in a violation of the duty of candor. Def.'s Am. Mot. for Sum. J. 50, ECF 227.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Defendant contends that the only reasonable inference from the facts is that the omission of the key references was deliberate. Additionally, Defendant argues that deliberate collusion to withhold material references is demonstrated by the fact that three separate patent practitioners failed to cite to the references. Furthermore, Defendant argues that the Court cannot overlook the clear bias and motivation for patent prosecution counsels' submission of affidavits admitting negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   In support, Defendant cites to a 2014 CAFC case which affirmed a district court finding of inequitable conduct based on the withholding of a material prior art reference.\n   <em>\n    Am. Calcar, Inc. v. Am.

Cir. 2014). There, although the inventor had provided a limited disclosure of the prior art navigation system, the disclosure excluded material information and details about the system which, according to the defendant, were those that were claimed in the patents in suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264538\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1185/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264538\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1185/\">\n    at 1188, 1190-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   In its decision, the district court found that the inventor was \"constantly feeding\" information to his patent attorney but did not give the attorney information about the operational details of the prior art navigation system, did not tell the attorney about his personal experience with the system, did not give the attorney a copy of the navigation system manual which he possessed, and failed to provide the attorney with relevant photos of the navigation system display screens.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Cal. Apr. 17, 2012). The court found that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from these facts was that the inventor made a deliberate decision to withhold that information from his patent attorney and the PTO.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201328640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The district court then explained why an inference of negligence was not reasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201328640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It rejected the idea that the failure to disclose the navigation system details was a mistake or accident. That the inventor \"disclosed some information about the system and withheld other information demonstrates a deliberative process, not an accident or a mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201328640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the court found that the inventor's interactions with his counsel refuted an inference of negligence or gross negligence because the evidence showed that the inventor \"had ample time and opportunity\" to provide the information to his patent counsel and \"took advantage of both to send 'waves' of information, but he never sent the operational details of the [ ] navigation system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201328640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, it was not reasonable to infer either negligence or gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201328640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As indicated above, the CAFC affirmed the district court's conclusion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264538\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1185/\">\n    768 F.3d at 1190-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   I agree with Defendant that with an omission, it must rely on circumstantial evidence. And I agree that affidavits or declarations by patent counsel are fairly characterized as self-serving. Nonetheless, the facts in\n   <em>\n    American Calcar\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable. Here, there is no evidence that the inventor withheld any information from patent counsel. There is no information that patent counsel withheld any prior art in other applications or disclosures. Importantly, the evidence relied on by the district court in\n   <em>\n    American Calcar\n   </em>\n   to support its finding that the inventor did not act negligently or recklessly was that the inventor provided the prior art reference in support of the prosecution of the patent but\n   <em>\n    omitted\n   </em>\n   the key details which formed the basis of the claimed invention. Here, with a wholesale failure to cite to the prior art reference, deliberate conduct is not the only inference created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Deliberate intent to deceive is one reasonable inference. But, another reasonable inference is that patent counsel acted negligently or recklessly. When the evidence is considered in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that negligence or recklessness is an equally reasonable explanation for counsel's failure to cite to the prior art references and thus, because deceitful intent is not the single most reasonable inference, Defendant does not meet its burden to establish inequitable conduct. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Defendant, however, I deny Plaintiff's motion on this issue. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that the single most reasonable inference from the evidence is that patent counsel acted with a deliberate intent to deceive the PTO. Even though the evidence allows for an inference of a lesser\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   , reasonable minds could conclude that deceit is the single most reasonable inference. As a result, there is an issue of fact regarding intent to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   B. Materiality\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Defendant argues that the facts conclusively establish that the PTO would not have allowed the '852 Patent to issue had it known of the undisclosed Bardsley Application and the Niiranen patents. As noted above, all three references were noted by the PTO in its Final Office Action on the '891 Application. Several claims of the '891 Application were rejected as anticipated by Bardsley. And, the patent examiner stated that the Niiranen patents disclosed mannequin forms having a pump, reservoir, conduit, controller, and sleeve simulating skin located in a common housing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264538\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1185/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Patent prosecution counsel knew about the references as well. Guentzler opines that the Bardsley Application discloses all of the limitations of Claim 18 of the '852 Patent. Guentzler July 13, 2015 Supp'l Inv. Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 20-37, ECF 219-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Plaintiff argues that but-for materiality is not shown because (1) the government subsequently disclosed all three references to the PTO in connection with two other related patent applications and both times the PTO found no grounds to reject the related application based on those references; and (2) the three references are cumulative of prior art that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   disclosed in the '852 Patent Application and thus, the three references are not material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Impax Labs., Inc. v.

No. WO 96/42076).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   When examining the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, I cannot determine on summary judgment that the Bardsley reference or the two Niiranen patents, considered separately or collectively, are not material under the but-for materiality standard. First, the PTO's rejection of the '891 Application due to Bardsley, and its citation to the Niiranen patents, is relevant information but it may not be dispositive of the references' materiality to the '852 Patent.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dayco Prods., Inc. v. Total Containment, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9132924\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1358/#p1362\">\n    329 F.3d 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1362-69 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (prior art reference was omitted from application for patents-in-suit but was relied on by different examiner to invalidate family of applications related to application for patents-in-suit; court noted that the \"mere fact\" that the examiner of the family of applications relied on the prior art reference was \"informative, but not dispositive\" of materiality to the patents-in-suit). Second, a factfinder could determine that because the PTO did not expressly rely on these three prior art references in later rejecting related applications in which the references were disclosed, the '852 Patent would also not have been rejected because of them. And third, because the three omitted prior art references related to devices similar to those disclosed in the prosecution of the '852 Patent, a factfinder could reasonably determine that these three prior art references are cumulative and therefore not material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   On the other hand, when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Defendant, an inference of but-for materiality is reasonable. All three references were noted by the PTO in its Final Office Action on the '891 Application, several claims of the '891 Application were rejected as anticipated by Bardsley, and the '891 Application patent examiner noted that the Niiranen patents disclosed mannequin forms having a pump, reservoir, conduit, controller, and sleeve simulating skin located in a common housing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9132924\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1358/#p1362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given that the '891 Patent Application is similar to the '852 Patent, a factfinder could conclude that, just like the claims in the '891 Application, the '852 Patent would not have issued if the three prior art references had been disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Additionally, although the PTO did not expressly cite to the prior art references when invalidating the subsequent applications which disclosed the references, without evidence as to whether the PTO's practice is to set forth all possible bases for rejection (e.g. to multiple, alternative bases for rejection) or to just one of several, a factfinder could determine that here, the PTO cited to only one of possibly many bases for invalidating the subsequent patents and thus, its failure to cite to these prior art references is not, in fact, probative of their lack of materiality as to the '852 Patent. Based on these inferences, a reasonable factfinder could determine\n   that the omitted three prior art references meet the but-for materiality standard required to establish inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Moreover, while Plaintiff includes copies of the prior art references of Alderson, Aboud, and the PCT International Publication in support of its cumulative argument, it offers only conclusory argument and fails to assert particularities.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Mot. for Sum. J. 41, ECF 223 (\"the three references are all cumulative of prior art that was disclosed in the '852 Patent's application\"; citing to exhibits and listing components); Pl.'s Reply 36, ECF 238 (\"the three references at issue were cumulative to other prior art references cited in the prosecution history of the '852 Patent\"); Pl.'s Opp. 42, ECF 233 (\"all three references at issue all are cumulative of prior art that was disclosed in the '852 patent's application\"). Similarly, in support of its argument, Defendant cites to the '891 Application, the Bardsley Application, and the abstract of the Bardsley Application which total almost 400 pages, yet Defendant provides no particular page cite to assist the Court in evaluating the evidence.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Am. Mot., ECF 227 45-46 (citing to Eastman Oct. 2, 2017 Decl., Exs. 15, 17, 18). Overall, the Court finds the materiality arguments to be conclusory in nature and not particularly helpful to resolution on summary judgment. As the\n   <em>\n    Dayco\n   </em>\n   court observed, \"[w]hether Wilson [the reference omitted from the patents-in-suit application but found to invalidate claims in a related family of applications] meets the threshold level of materiality would require a detailed factual analysis of the relevance of the teachings of that reference both with respect to the claims of the patents-in-suit and with respect to the other prior art references that were before the examiner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9132924\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1358/#p1362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No such \"detailed factual analysis\" is included in the summary judgment briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Because, on the present record, reasonable factfinders could reach contrary conclusions regarding materiality and intent, I deny both parties' motions as to inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   REMAINING ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   I.

The only one of those raised in the summary judgment briefing is \u00a7 103 addressing obviousness.

Defendant did not move for summary judgment on any of these affirmative defenses and made no argument supporting these defenses in its brief opposing Plaintiff's motion. During oral argument on the summary judgment motions, I referred to all of the affirmative defenses, exclusive of obviousness and inequitable conduct, as no longer being \"alive.\" Tr. of Dec. 12, 2017 Oral Arg. 96, ECF 256. Defendant offered no contrary position to indicate that it was still relying\n   on any affirmative defense other than obviousness and inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   In view of Plaintiff's legal arguments and uncontested facts related to these affirmative defenses, and Defendant's implicit concession that it is not asserting any of these affirmative defenses, I grant Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to the following affirmative defenses: (1) First Affirmative Defense-acquiescence; (2) Second Affirmative Defense-waiver; (3) Third Affirmative Defense-consent; (4) Fourth Affirmative Defense-laches; (5) Fifth Affirmative Defense-estoppel; (6) Sixth Affirmative Defense-unclean hands; (7) Seventh Affirmative Defense-lack of right, title, or interest; (8) Eighth Affirmative Defense-noninfringement; (9) portions of the Ninth Affirmative Defense-invalidity based on \u00a7\u00a7 101, 102, or 112 ; (10) Tenth Affirmative Defense-innocent infringement; (11) Eleventh Affirmative Defense-\"no causation\"; (12) Twelfth Affirmative Defense-failure to state a claim; (13) Thirteenth Affirmative Defense-no irreparable harm; (14) Fourteenth Affirmative Defense-adequate legal remedy; (15) Fifteenth Affirmative Defense-patent exhaustion, patent misuse, first sale doctrine; (16) portion of the Sixteenth Affirmative Defense-fraud; (17) Seventeenth Affirmative Defense-damages limited by \u00a7\u00a7 286, 287; (18) Eighteenth Affirmative Defense-failure to mitigate; and (19) Nineteenth Affirmative Defense-marking/notice under \u00a7 287.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   II.

Given that during the period, Plaintiff's FEBSS basic unit sold for $1,664 and its deluxe unit sold for $3,738, Plaintiff would have sold $114,816 in basic units and $41,118 in deluxe units had it made the sales Morones claims were made by Defendant.
