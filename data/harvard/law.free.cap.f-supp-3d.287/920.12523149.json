Dkt. 1 (\"Compl.\"). Plaintiff alleges that defendants placed a call to his cellular phone without his \"prior express consent\" to sell or solicit their services using an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" and an \"artificial or prerecorded voice\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(l)(A)(iii). Plaintiff asserts claims for negligent and willful or knowing violations of the TCPA and seeks statutory damages on behalf of himself a nationwide class of similarly situated consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 26, 2017, defendants filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), raising a facial First Amendment challenge to the TCPA. Dkt. 18 (\"MJP\"). On January 9, 2018, the United States of America (the \"government\") intervened for the limited purpose of defending the TCPA's constitutionality. Dkt. 38 (\"Gov't Mot.\"). On January 12, 2018, plaintiff filed an opposition. Dkt. 39 (\"MJP Opp'n\"). On January 22, 2018, defendants filed a consolidated reply. Dkt. 42 (\"MJP Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 13, 2017, defendants filed a motion to stay the proceedings in this case pending the later of (1) decision of the\n   Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\"D.C.

On October 23, 2017, plaintiff filed an opposition, dkt. 29 (\"Stay Opp'n\"); and defendants filed a reply on October 30, 2017, dkt. 32 (\"Stay Reply\"). On February 5, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the motions.

Accordingly, defendants' facial First Amendment challenge fails, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the hearing on February 5, 2018, defendants moved to certify this order for interlocutory review pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). A district court may certify under section 1292(b) if the following three requirements are met: \"(1) there is a controlling question of law, (2) there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion, and (3) an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cement Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1412729\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/673/1020/#p1026\">\n    673 F.2d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1026 (9th Cir. 1982). In both\n   <em>\n    Brickman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   , the courts granted the defendant's motions to certify the question of whether the TCPA, as a content-based regulation of speech, survives strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brickman v.

The Court agrees that (1) the constitutionality of the TCPA is a controlling question of law; (2) there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion because it is plausible that other courts could have reached the opposite result given that the question presented is a novel issue and strict scrutiny imposes a high bar; and (3) immediate appeal would advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brickman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201508719\">\n    2017 WL 1508719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendants' motion for interlocutory review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Stay Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants move to stay this action pending a final decision by the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   . Stay Mot. at 1. Numerous district courts have considered whether to stay TCPA actions pending the outcome of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , and the majority have also determined that a stay is warranted. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Fontes v. Time Warner Cable Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV14-2060-CAS( ),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209272790\">\n    2015 WL 9272790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. Dec. 17, 2015), this Court stayed a TCPA action concerning pre-recorded phone calls allegedly made from an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The Court found a \"legitimate possibility that the [D.C. Circuit] Court of Appeals may overturn\" the FCC's final order, and because the issues in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , including the definition of an ATDS, \"could potentially be dispositive of the outcome in\" that case, \"the Court [found] that it is prudent to await further guidance from the\n   D.C. Circuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The Court determined that a stay could save \"substantial efforts by the parties\" and avoid \"the risk of wasting the resources of the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Similarly, here, after balancing the interests of judicial economy against potential prejudice to the parties, the Court concludes that a stay is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Simplifying Issues and Promoting Judicial Economy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court agrees with defendants that a stay will simplify the issues in this case and conserve judicial resources. The D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   will significantly impact this case by clarifying the controlling legal standard regarding what constitutes an ATDS. While an opinion of the D.C. Circuit is normally not binding authority on this Court, it has exclusive jurisdiction over the FCC's final order under the Hobbs Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202342\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and therefore the decision will be dispositive on numerous issues including the scope of liability based on the use of an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gage v. Cox Commc's, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-02708-KJD-GWF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201536220\">\n    2017 WL 1536220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Nev. Apr. 27, 2017). Plaintiff contends that\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because the TCPA is worded disjunctively and therefore an individual may be held liable for either \"using any automatic telephone dialing system\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   an artificial or prerecorded voice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). Plaintiff argues that because the complaint alleges defendants also used an \"artificial or prerecorded voice,\" plaintiff is not required to prove that defendants used an ATDS, and accordingly\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   is \"wholly irrelevant.\" Stay Opp'n at 7. However, the D.C. Circuit's decision will significantly impact one ground for defendants' potential liability in this putative class action and will at least define the scope of discovery regarding ATDS. Accordingly, the Court finds that these savings in judicial resources militate in favor of granting a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Potential Prejudice to the Non-Moving Party\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court further finds that the potential prejudice to plaintiff is not substantial, particularly because, in all likelihood, the stay will be brief. This Court granted a similar stay in\n   <em>\n    Fontes\n   </em>\n   nearly two years ago when the D.C. Circuit had just set a briefing schedule in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   . Briefing concluded in February 2016 and the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments in October 2016. It is thus reasonable to expect that the decision will be issued soon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends that further appeals of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   could delay his case \"for years.\" Stay Opp'n at 9. However, defendants are only requesting a stay until a decision is issued by the D.C. Circuit panel in the current appeal; defendants are not seeking a stay through en banc review or a potential appeal to the Supreme Court. Stay Reply at 9. Accordingly, the Court expects that the duration of the stay will be short. Plaintiff further argues that he will be prejudiced due to \"diminished memory and lack of available witnesses,\" including because of \"company turnover\" at defendants' offices. Stay Opp'n at 8, 15. Plaintiff posits that defendants \"may have hired a lead generator\" to place calls to class members, and because these companies \"typically go out of business and disappear quickly,\" there is a risk of losing evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding the lack of evidentiary support for these\n   assertions, the Court finds that these concerns are largely mitigated by the anticipated short duration of the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Hardship or Inequity to the Proponent of the Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although, as plaintiff emphasizes, being required to defend a suit is not, by itself, sufficient to merit a stay,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9180404,9032700\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/398/1098/\">\n    398 F.3d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"the burden of proceeding with this litigation potentially unnecessarily is nonetheless a factor in favor of granting a stay ... in conjunction with the savings to judicial resources ... that the Court may consider, even if it is not dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Geico Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-01940-SU,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20815238\">\n    2017 WL 815238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D. Or. Mar. 1, 2017) (citing\n   <em>\n    Small v. GE Capital, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. EDCV 15-2479 JGB (DTBx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204502460\">\n    2016 WL 4502460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (C.D. Cal. June 9, 2016) (\"[F]urther litigation absent a ruling may be unnecessary and will require both parties and the court to spend substantial resources.\"). The Court finds that these substantial savings in judicial resources outweigh any potential prejudice to plaintiff in waiting for a decision from the D.C. Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In conclusion, the Court finds that the aforementioned factors weigh in favor of granting a stay. The D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   may limit the scope of defendants' liability, and at the very least, will determine the scope of discovery and conserve both the parties' and this Court's resources by clarifying the law. Although the possibility of prejudice to plaintiff weighs against a stay, the Court finds that the countervailing factors tip the balance, particularly because the duration of the stay is expected to be short. Accordingly, defendants' request for a stay is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the hearing on February 5, 2018, plaintiff indicated that defendants have disclosed the identity of a third party that placed calls at issue in this case. Plaintiff requests a limited exception to the stay to allow plaintiff to issue a subpoena to the third party. However, because plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing that there is a risk of losing evidence, the Court declines to grant plaintiff an exception to the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   defendants' Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings. However, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendants' motion to certify the Court's order for interlocutory review pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Court also\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendants' motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, this action is hereby\n   <strong>\n    STAYED\n   </strong>\n   pending a ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-1211. If the Ninth Circuit grants defendants permission to appeal this Court's order, proceedings in this Court shall be\n   <strong>\n    STAYED\n   </strong>\n   pending a decision on that appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Because the Court concludes that the TCPA is content-based on its face in light of the government-debt exception and\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    , the Court need not reach defendants' alternative arguments and counter-arguments raised by plaintiff and the government. Defendants also contend that: (1) section 227(b)(l)(A)(iii) imposes a speaker-based preference for all government messages over private messages; (2) the statute regulates substantially more than commercial speech; and (3) the statute authorizes the FCC to promulgate further content-based exceptions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    MJP at 5-13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    According to the latest statistics, the median time between oral argument and a final disposition for civil appeals in the D.C.
