Specifically, Commerce explained that respondents' reported data was distorted because they included non-subject merchandise in the denominator that had different yields and fillets that have greater weight gain due to soaking in preservatives. Final Decision Memo at 17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.

Final Decision Memo at 16-17. However, the processing FOPs in the tollers' data are reported on a subject merchandise basis, while the farming FOPs, as reported by HVG, are reported on a whole live fish harvested basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. To remedy the unparalleled denominators, Commerce converted HVG's denominator, which was based on whole live fish harvested, by what Commerce called, the \"shank equivalent conversion factor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce explained the conversion factor as \"simply the whole live fish to subject merchandise (shank fillets) FOP that is used for the processing factors [.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In using the conversion factor, Commerce arrived at what it called the \"shank equivalent of the total harvested fish.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (citation omitted). Commerce then added the farming FOPs from all farming\n   activities at HVG, Agifish, and Europe JSC, and used the total as the numerator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (citations omitted). Commerce, however, fails to explain why adjusting the denominator to represent the \"shank-equivalent\" does not require adjusting the numerator to reflect the \"shank-equivalent\" farming FOP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant argues that although HVG now argues that Commerce's changes to the denominator would require a modification to the numerator, HVG did not actually raise the argument at the agency level, and therefore, HVG's argument has not been exhausted.

In their brief before the agency, Plaintiffs specifically recognize that the farming FOPs in the numerator are overstated, when compared to Commerce's adjusted denominator, because the numerator contains data for all farming factors consumed in raising the total number of harvested fish, across all of HVG's companies, during the POR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant's only response to Plaintiffs' argument is that Plaintiffs fail to support their position that Commerce's analysis leads to distortions or that adjusting the numerator would resolve such distortions.

Commerce acknowledged that TAFISHCO was cooperative. Final Decision Memo at 23. However, at verification, Commerce \"learned that during the POR, when cash deposit rates for frozen fish fillet producers from Vietnam went up,\" TAFISHCO retained its low cash deposit rate, and was therefore in a \"good position\" to export frozen fish fillets.

Commerce then relied on this trend to support its conclusion that TAFISHCO should have induced Tollers A and B to cooperate as its own cooperation with Commerce benefited the tollers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Considering this information, together with Commerce's finding that the uncooperative tollers' involvement in the total production was significant, Commerce decided that partial AFA should be applied to TAFISHCO.

Plaintiffs' arguments are not persuasive because they misunderstand the crux of Commerce's reasoning for using floating feed fish price quotes only. Commerce used a more specific data set because HVG, during the administrative review, did not populate the record with evidence showing a use of fish feed, other than floating fish feed.
