Doc. 28 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9, 10. When opening the Account, Miller received and agreed to Ginny's Choose 'N Charge\u00ae Credit Terms (\"Credit Terms\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Also, at the time of opening the Account, Miller provided Ginny's with her cellular telephone number. Doc. 28 \u00b6 13. The cellular telephone connected with that number was used by Miller for ten years, was the only telephone regularly used by Miller, the account for the telephone number was in Miller's name and she paid for it, and Miller maintained exclusive possession of the phone.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    \u00b6 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Miller Depo. 18:24-25, 19:7-11, 20:2-6; Doc. 24-1 \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miller did not make any required payments on the Account and Ginny's began making regular calls to Miller's cell phone on July 31, 2013 using an automatic dialing machine. Doc. 28 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12-13. The calls were not recorded and Miller did not maintain personal records of the calls because she expected them to stop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Chamberlain Depo. 9:21-23; Doc. 24-1 \u00b6 5. At all times relevant to this case, Ginny's had a policy that it would not cease collection calls if the consumer gave only an oral cease-and-desist request. Doc. 28 \u00b6 6; Chamberlain Depo. 6:22-7:5. Instead, it was Ginny's policy to cease such calls only in the event that a written request was made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ginny's maintained a Collection Correspondence Log, which documented the content of calls to customers through an action code that corresponded with various interactions between an agent and customer, and by a narrative that summarized the agent's conversation with the customer. Doc. 30-1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 15. One of the action codes was \"313,\" which Ginny's stated was used when the answering party did not identify him or herself, and would not be used if the answering party confirmed that he or she was the client. Doc. 30-1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Chamberlain Depo. 21:8-18; 22:11-16. Miller disputes that this is the only instance in which the 313 action code would be used, based on Ginny's policy manual. The policy manual explained that the code should be used as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     313 TT THIRD PARTY-NO MSG\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The agent will use this action code at any time they speak to someone at the phone number dialed, but were unable to leave a message.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This code should also be used in the following situations:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   *This code may also be used when the agent speaks to the customer but does not obtain any promise to pay from the customer and the reason why does not fit any of the No Pay codes listed below. The agent should make clear notes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Doc. 37-4 p. 1. The no pay codes included ones for inability to pay due to personal illness or illness of a family member, inability to pay due to unemployment of the customer or his or her spouse, and a general \"other\" category which was to be used \"when the customer states they can't pay on the account for any reason other than those\" two preceding reasons. Doc. 37-4 p. 1. Another action code was \"317,\" which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    317 WON'T PAY / NO DISPUTE\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The agent will enter this code when the customer states their refusal to pay without any dispute or legitimate reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Doc. 37-4. The 317 action code was also to be used if a customer told the agent to\n   cease and desist communications or to stop calling. Doc. 28 \u00b6 17; 30-1 \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition to the Collection Correspondence Log, Ginny's maintained a database, the Dialer Records, which recorded the number of attempted calls to a customer, regardless of whether the call actually connected with the number or resulted in it ringing. Doc. 30-1 \u00b6 18-19. The Dialer Records also showed the duration of a call, which did not appear on the Collection Correspondence Log. Doc. 38-3. Miller stipulated that the number of calls, dates, and indications of contact contained in Ginny's records were correct, but she did not stipulate that any recorded content of the conversations contained in Ginny's records were correct. Doc. 28 \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ginny's call logs showed that the first telephone call answered by Miller was on November 21, 2013, and lasted for 125 seconds. Doc. 37-3 p. 18; 38-3 p. 2. Ginny's input the 313 \"TT 3RD PARTY/NO MES\" action code for the call. Doc. 37-3 p. 18. In the comments section for the call, the Ginny's agent wrote \"TP USED PROFANITY LANGUAGE.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Following this call, Ginny's attempted to place 145 calls to Miller, with the final call being placed on April 13, 2015. Doc. 28 \u00b6 22; Doc. 38-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Several additional calls were answered and given the 313 action code of \"TT 3RD PARTY/NO MES.\" Starting from the next oldest call, Miller's phone was answered on January 15, 2014, the phone call lasted for 13 seconds, and the Ginny's agent wrote in the \"scratch pad\" \"TP HUNG UP.\" Doc. 37-3 p. 17; Doc. 38-3 p. 2. The next answered telephone call occurred on May 16, 2014 and lasted for 32 seconds. Doc. 37-3 p. 16; Doc. 38-3 p. 2. Miller's phone was answered again on June 19, 2014 and the call lasted for 20 seconds. Doc. 37-3 p. 14; Doc. 38-3 p. 3. Another call was answered on August 7, 2014, which lasted for 37 seconds. Doc. 37-3 p. 13; Doc. 38-3 p. 3. A call was answered on September 8, 2014, which lasted for 16 seconds. Doc. 37-3 p. 11; Doc. 38-3 p. 3. An additional call was answered on September 18, 2014, which lasted for 34 seconds. Doc. 37-3 p. 11; Doc. 38-3 p. 3. Additionally, between October 17, 2014 and the date of the last call, April 13, 2015, Miller received 79 calls from Ginny's, three of which were answered but lasted only one second, indicating that the answering party disconnected the call upon answering. Doc. 28 \u00b6 25; Dios Depo. 17:5-6; Doc. 38-3 p. 4. The action code of 317 did not appear in Ginny's records, and there was no other indication in its records that Miller requested that it cease its calls to her, or stated that she would not make payments on the Account. Chamberlain Depo. 26:7-9; Doc. 30-1 \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on the repeated telephone calls, Miller filed this action for violation of the TCPA and FCCPA.
