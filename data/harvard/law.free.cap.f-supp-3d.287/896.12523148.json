AR 001953. They also point to the statements by CMS in the June 30, 2009, rescission of the 2008 Outpatient Definition Rule, acknowledging the burden on health care districts were CMS to define \"outpatient\" to eliminate costs of hospital-based RHCs and FCHCs for DSH purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 001258, et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendants argue, however, that CMS was not required to subject the \"interpretation\" in the preamble to the final 2014 DSH Payments Uninsured Definition Rule to notice-and-comment rulemaking, because it was simply an \"interpretive\" rule of the type used by an agency to advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules it administers. Defendants claim that CMS' interpretation simply \"implements\" what they refer to as \"the plain language of the Medicaid statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendants contend that because the Medicaid statute distinguishes between \"inpatient hospital services,\" \"outpatient hospital services,\" and \"FQHC services,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(1), (2)(A), (C), those three categories are necessarily mutually exclusive, and that \"outpatient hospital services\" thus cannot also be included within the category of \"FQHC services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   They argue that because the DSH statute provides that \"the costs incurred during the year of furnishing hospital services\" may be included in the HSL calculation, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) ; and because the statute further requires a state to certify in the DSH audit process that the calculation of the HSL includes \"[o]nly the uncompensated care costs of providing inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services\" to Medicaid-eligible individuals and uninsured individuals, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(j)(2)(C) ; the result is that the \"hospital services\" included in the HSL can only be inpatient and outpatient hospital services, not FQHC services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendants assert that CMS has long interpreted the DSH statute as prohibiting hospitals from including in the calculation of the HSL the uncompensated costs incurred by hospital-based FQHCs that are defined and reimbursed under the FCHC benefit category under the State Plan. They claim that CMS simply reiterated this \"policy\" in December 2014, in its response to a comment submitted with regard to the 2012 DSH Proposed Rule. They concede that neither the statute nor the regulation spell out the details of how the restriction to \"inpatient\" and \"outpatient\" \"hospital services\" is to be applied in practice to every type of service covered by Medicaid, but they argue that CMS' \"interpretation\" in the preamble to the final 2014 DSH Payments Uninsured Definition Rule simply explains how this statutory language applies to a particular category of services-FQHC services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As for the State Plan, defendants note that the \"FQHC\" benefit is listed separately from the benefit for \"[o]utpatient hospital services\" and that the Plan provides that each FQHC can choose whether it wants to be reimbursed under PPS methodology or under an APM provided for in the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 002272-95; Cal. State Plan Att. 3.1-A. Thus, they assert, because the two benefits are listed separately, services provided by a hospital-based FQHC cannot properly be included as costs of \"outpatient hospital services\" in the calculation of that hospital's hospital-specific DSH limit. Similarly, defendants assert, base payments for outpatient hospital services are made according to a fee schedule that does not apply to hospital-based FQHCs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518696,3816793\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/1106/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518696,3816793\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/1106/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Att. 4.19-B, at 1-3.2 &amp; Supp. 17 (AR 002264-68); and that FQHCs, including specifically provider-based FQHCs, are paid under a different methodology (PPS or APM),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518696,3816793\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/1106/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 6-6V (AR 002272-95).

Further, they contend, the California State Medicaid plan clearly defines and reimburses FQHC services separately from inpatient or outpatient hospital services. Therefore, they argue, CMS has properly determined that such costs may not be included in the HSL, and the interpretation at issue here was not required to be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Whether an agency rule is interpretive or legislative is a question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    Chief Probation Officers of Cal. v.

In this case, the distinction between the two is significant, because if the challenged \"New Rule\" is an interpretive rule, it is valid despite the absence of notice-and-comment procedures, whereas if it is a legislative rule, it is invalid because of CMS' failure to comply with the rule-making procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemp Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113824\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/1082/#p1086\">\n    333 F.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Here, plaintiffs claim it is a legislative rule, and defendants take the position that it is an interpretive rule.

Section 440.20(a) provides, in its entirety, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   (a) Outpatient hospital services means preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (1) Are furnished to outpatients;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (2) Are furnished by or under the direction of a physician or dentist; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (3) Are furnished by an institution that\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (i) Is licensed or formally approved as a hospital by an officially designated authority for State standard-setting; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (ii) Meets the requirements for participation in Medicare as a hospital; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (4) May be limited by a Medicaid agency in the following manner: A Medicaid agency may exclude from the definition of \"outpatient hospital services\" those types of items and services that are not generally furnished by most hospitals in the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20440.20\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Nevertheless, notwithstanding this long-standing and consistent definition, in January 2016, CMS advised plaintiffs that hospital-based FQHCs' costs must be excluded from the DSH Limit calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 002130-31. In doing so, CMS did not\n   cite to a single regulation or statute implementing this new DSH Limit. The \"New Rule\" is inconsistent with \u00a7 440.20(a), as the services provided by the hospital-based FQHCs at issue here meet the definition of \"outpatient hospital services\" set forth in the regulation. Defendants do not dispute that, as required by CMS' definition, the services provided by plaintiffs' FQHCs are provided to outpatients; by or under the direction of a physician or dentist; and by a licensed or formally approved hospital that meets the requirements for participation in Medicare as a hospital. Nor do defendants dispute that these services constitute \"preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services\" under \u00a7 440.20(a). Moreover, the New Rule does not appear to even address the same subject matter as the regulation it purports to \"interpret.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The court disagrees with defendants' contention that because the \"New Rule\" advises the public of the agency's construction of its statutes and rules it administers, it is merely an \"interpretation\" of the DSH Statute and its own regulations, and is therefore exempt from the notice-and-comment provisions of the APA. There is no statutory or regulatory language that can be interpreted to mean that a hospital forfeits DSH payments for outpatient hospital services by obtaining FQHC certification for the hospital outpatient department that provides those services. Thus, the \"New Rule\" does not \"clarify\" the meaning of any statute or regulation, but is instead purely legislative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Defendants contend that because FQHC services and outpatient hospital services are listed separately in the Medicaid Act, the two service categories are mutually exclusive-which it claims is shown by the fact that outpatient hospital services and services offered by FQHCs are listed as distinct service categories under its regulations and the State Plan. However, CMS is simply assuming as true the very premise that it is attempting to prove-that being listed as distinct service categories means that outpatient hospital services and services of FQHCs are mutually exclusive. However, defendants point to no language in the Medicaid Act or its regulations that supports this underlying premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Nor does California's State Plan exclude outpatient hospital services provided by hospital-based FQHCs from the definition of outpatient hospital services found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20440.20\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As with the Medicaid Act and CMS' regulations, California's State Plan merely lists FQHC services and outpatient hospital services separately, and describes their payment methodologies. It is true that defendants have cited examples where California's State Plan expressly excludes FQHC services from being counted as outpatient hospital services in specific instances, but these examples do not support defendants' argument. Indeed, there would be no need for the State Plan to identify specific instances where services provided by FQHCs are not counted as outpatient hospital services if such services were categorically excluded from the definition of outpatient services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Defendants' claim that the \"New Rule\" is interpretive is also belied by the fact that CMS previously attempted to exclude services provided by hospital-based FQHCs from the definition of outpatient hospital services via the formal notice-and-comment process, when it adopted the 2008 Outpatient Hospital Services Rule. However, in rescinding the Rule, CMS withdrew the requirement that hospital outpatient services be services that were not also included in other service categories. CMS properly initiated notice-and-comment rulemaking in 2008, but having put the proposed rule through the public comment process, and having rescinded it, CMS cannot now argue that its \"New Rule\" somehow remained in force after its\n   rescission as part of some informal interpretive rule-making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Nor do the portions of the preamble to the final 2008 DSH Audit Rule that CMS now contends support its \"New Rule\" set forth the restrictions that CMS ascribes to them. CMS focuses on two statements in the preamble, which are underlined below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   [T]he hospital-specific limit is based on the costs incurred for furnishing \"hospital services\" and does not include costs incurred for services that are outside either the State or Federal definition of inpatient or outpatient hospital services. While States have some flexibility to define the scope of \"hospital services,\"\n   <em>\n    States must use consistent definitions of \"hospital services.\" Hospitals may engage in any number of activities, or may furnish practitioner or other services to patients, that are not within the scope of \"hospital services.\n   </em>\n   \" A State cannot include in calculating the hospital-specific DSH limit cost of services that are not defined under its Medicaid State plan as a Medicaid inpatient or outpatient hospital service....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    States should use a consistent treatment of physician and other provider-based clinics.\n   </em>\n   All costs that are associated with services that are defined and reimbursed under the approved Medicaid State plan as inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services to Medicaid eligible individuals and to individuals with no source of third party coverage for such services may be included in calculating the hospital-specific DSH limit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C907\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. 77,907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77,926 (AR 000624, 000643) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Neither of these statements provides support for CMS' \"New Rule.\" Requiring that states \"use consistent definitions of 'hospital services' \" or \"consistent treatment of physician and other provider-based clinics\" does not preclude states from consistently defining outpatient hospital services to encompass services that are reimbursed under different payment schemes like the hospital-based FQHC payment scheme, as California has done.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 000624. Nor does any other portion of the preamble to the December 19, 2008 DSH final rule or the FAQs support the \"New Rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Moreover, the two statements cited by CMS are not \"representative\" of the preamble to the final 2008 DSH Audit Rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tex. Children's Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248155\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/76/224/#p241\">\n    76 F.Supp.3d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which, by its own terms, \"only relate[s] to reporting and auditing,\" AR 000622; and \"does not alter any of the substantive standards regarding the calculation of hospital costs,\" AR 000623;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 000624 (\"the [2008 DSH final] rule does not substantively change the standards for DSH payments, or for the review of hospital-specific limits on such payments.\"); AR000638 (\"does not change the underlying statutory requirements for DSH payments\"); AR 000623 (\"does not alter any of the substantive standards regarding the calculation of hospital costs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Further, even if the cited portions of the preamble to the final 2008 Audit Rule did support CMS' \"New Rule,\" they still would not justify that \"New Rule\" because a preamble cannot amend an existing regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tex. Children's Hosp.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248155\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/76/224/#p241\">\n    76 F.Supp.3d at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When CMS issued the final 2008 Audit Rule, its regulation narrowing the definition of outpatient hospital services (the 2008 Outpatient Definition Rule) had just been published. However, that narrowed definition was rescinded before it was implemented, and any limitations articulated in the preamble to the final 2008 Audit Rule-which could only be based on the rescinded definition-would not survive CMS' own repeal of that definition. Accordingly, CMS' \"New Rule\" cannot be based on the final 2008 Audit Rule or the preamble to that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, to the extent that defendants intend to suggest that CMS properly engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking with regard to the \"New Rule,\" by issuing the 2012 DSH Proposed Rule, and in issuing the 2014 DSH Payments Uninsured Definition Rule, the court finds that CMS' notice-and-comment procedure was inadequate for the further reason that it did not afford interested parties the opportunity to comment on whether the proposed exclusion of FQHC \"outpatient\" costs from the DHS calculation conformed to the requirements of the Medicaid Act and to the provisions of the CMS-approved California State Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Where notice-and-comment rulemaking is required, the dispositive question in assessing the adequacy of notice is whether an agency's final rule is a \"logical outgrowth\" of the rule proposed (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the request for comment).\n   <em>\n    Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v.

In general, a final rule is a \"logical outgrowth\" of a proposed rule \"only if interested parties should have anticipated that the change was possible, and thus reasonably should have filed their comments on the subject during the notice-and-comment period.\"\n   <em>\n    Veterans Justice Grp., LLC v.

Cir. 2016). In determining whether interested parties could reasonably have anticipated the final rule from the draft, \"one of the salient questions is 'whether a new round of notice and comment would provide the first opportunity for interested parties to offer comments that could persuade the agency to modify its rule.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nat.

The 2012 DSH Proposed Rule was directed at defining through regulation \"individuals who have no health insurance (or other source of third-party coverage) for the services furnished during the year.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%202500\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. 2500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (AR 001272). The preamble to the Proposed Rule indicated that it was \"designed to mitigate some of the unintended consequences of the uninsured definition put forth in the [final 2008 DSH Audit Rule] and to provide additional clarity on which costs can be considered uninsured costs for purposes of determining the hospital-specific limit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%202501\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. 2501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (AR 001273).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Nowhere in the Proposed Rule did CMS indicate any intention to exclude FQHC and RHC \"outpatient\" costs from the DHS calculation. It was only in the final 2014 DSH Payments Uninsured Definition Rule-which described the focus of the Proposed Rule as defining certain terms related to \"uninsured\" individuals-and then only in one brief section of the preamble, that CMS stated that \"if a hospital elects to have a department meet the conditions to participate in Medicaid as a provider of FQHC services, and claims payment for its services as an FQHC, the services of that department are not considered outpatient hospital services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071%2C684\">\n    79 Fed.

However, rather than again engaging in notice-and-comment rulemaking, CMS simply inserted this new provision excluding FQHC costs from the DHS calculation into the preamble of the final 2014 DSH Payments Uninsured Definition Rule. CMS' assertion that this provision was consistent with prior \"regulatory and sub-regulatory guidance,\" which included the 2008 DSH Audit Rule, is unpersuasive, as the 2008 DSH Audit Rule did not include a provision excluding outpatient services by FQHCs from the category of \"outpatient hospital services\" for purposes of the DHS calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The point of notice-and-comment rulemaking is that public comment will be considered by an agency and the agency may alter its action in light of those comments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

However, where the final rule makes no mention of an important component of the final rule that is promulgated, the final rule is not a \"logical outgrowth\" of the proposal on which the public had the opportunity to comment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Better Forestry v.

Because CMS' \"New Rule,\" which excludes services provided by a hospital-based FQHC from the definition of \"outpatient hospital services\" for purposes of the DHS calculation, is a legislative rule which was not promulgated in accordance with the requirements of notice-and-comment rulemaking, defendants violated \u00a7 706(2)(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tex.

Accordingly, because CMS failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking, the challenged provision must be set aside.
