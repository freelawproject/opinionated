As a result of this Court's prior decision dismissing plaintiffs' federal claims for municipal liability, plaintiffs' remaining claims are for false arrest, false imprisonment, deprivation of substantive due process, excessive force, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery.

Defendants, for their part, claim that they did slide the order under the door, only to have it pushed back out.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Figueroa Decl. at 2. But because the Court must view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs in resolving defendants' motion, the Court must assume that defendants refused to furnish the June 29 order for inspection. This, in turn, raises two possible arguments for plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, plaintiffs might argue that the officers' failure to permit visual inspection of the warrant prior to execution was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,\n   in which case plaintiffs could not have been arrested for obstructing a\n   <em>\n    lawful\n   </em>\n   search, as required by \u00a7 195.05.

The Second Circuit has held that a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(f)(1)(C), which requires an executing officer to provide a copy of a warrant\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   seizing property, is not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   an unconstitutional act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court is unpersuaded. While a reasonable jury may well conclude that Bliss's use of force was reasonable under the circumstances, Daghrib's testimony might also lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the force used was greater than reasonably necessary.
