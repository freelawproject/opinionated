The May 21, 2015 Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 21, 2015, M.R. was a 14-year-old sophomore at Oak Park High School. Defs' SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9; Pls' SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. At the time, Rabinovitz had full legal and physical custody of M.R. Officer Buenaventura, then a 21-year veteran of the LAPD, worked in the juvenile unit at the Department's Topanga station. Pls' SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. Buenaventura's primary job was to investigate suspected child abuse and, specifically, Suspected Child Abuse Reports (\"SCAR\") prepared by the Department of Children and Family Services (\"DCFS\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6; Ex. 1 to Shapero Decl.

(\"Subject SCAR\"). Defs' SUF at \u00b6 4; Ex. 9 to Cox Decl. (Subject SCAR) [Doc. # 66-12]. The Subject SCAR, filed by a counselor at M.R.'s school on April 27, 2015, indicated that someone found a letter, which M.R. wrote, indicating that she had an \"inappropriate relationship\" with her mother's boyfriend. Defs' SUF at \u00b6 5; Pls' SUF at \u00b6 18; Subject SCAR at 5. Because M.R. lived with Rabinovitz and her mother lived out of state and had not been involved in M.R.'s life \"for years,\" the Subject SCAR stated that M.R. was \"not in immediate danger.\" Subject SCAR at 5. The Subject SCAR also indicated that it was unknown when the purported inappropriate relationship occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rabinovitz did not know about the letter M.R. wrote or the purported contact between M.R. and her mother's boyfriend, and law enforcement never suspected Rabinovitz was involved in the alleged abuse.

Buenaventura Depo. at 71:16-25. On May 21, 2015, Buenaventura decided to interview M.R. while she was at school. Defs' SUF at \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to interviewing\n   M.R., Buenaventura did not contact DCFS to learn whether it had evaluated or investigated the SCAR's allegations. Pls' SUF at \u00b6 23. Nor did Buenaventura contact Rabinovitz (despite the SCAR's inclusion of Rabinovitz's contact information) about the SCAR or tell Rabinovitz that he wanted to interview M.R.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25; Pls' ASUF at \u00b6 9. Buenaventura knew nonetheless that the alleged abuse did not involve Rabinovitz.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9 to Cox Decl. (Buenaventura's Detective's Case Progress Log) at 1 [Doc. # 61-14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   M.R. was pulled out of class and taken to Mr. Buchanan's (school principal) office, where Mr. Buchanan informed her that \"a police officer [was] there to see her.\" Pls' SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 31. M.R. was \"terrified\" because she did not know what was going on and immediately asked the principal if she could call her father because she wanted \"to find safety in [her] dad.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. M.R. called and sent text messages to her father and attorney but at first was unable to reach them. Defs' SUF at \u00b6 12. While trying to contact them, Mr. Buchanan told M.R. to go into another room to speak with Buenaventura. Pls' SUF at \u00b6 36. M.R. told the principal she did not want to speak to police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It appears that by the time M.R. entered the second room for the interview, she had reached her father. Defs' SUF at \u00b6 15; Ex. 3 to Shapero Decl. (\"M.R. Depo.\") at 25:1-23 [Doc. # 59-4\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]. Once M.R. reached her father, who was with his attorney at the time, M.R. put them on speakerphone.

During the interview, M.R. told Buenaventura that she did not wish to speak to him without her attorney present. Defs' SUF at \u00b6 38. When Buenaventura asked for her name and grade level, M.R. refused to answer and told him \"repeatedly,\" \"I don't know. Ask my lawyers.\" Pls' SUF at \u00b6 16. Mr. Buchanan was present during M.R.'s interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.

I got a response, and I was told [by Buenaventura] that my permission wasn't needed\"). Then, while Rabinovitz was still on speakerphone, Buenaventura threatened to arrest M.R. and take her to the station for questioning if she did not answer his questions. Pls' SUF at \u00b6 17. M.R. began to cry and, throughout the entire encounter, was \"hysterical, crying, and asking her father what to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45; Defs' SUF at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At some point, Buenaventura left the conference room and terminated the interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Buenaventura Depo. at 103:9-23; Iulianelli Decl. at \u00b6 12 [Doc. # 61-2] (stating that Buenaventura stopped questioning after approximately an hour's worth of discussion among LAPD employees and representatives, Rabinovitz's attorney, and Los Angeles City's and County's attorneys). The entire incident, from the time Buenaventura arrived at the school and left the premises, took 68 minutes. Ex. 11 to Cox Decl. [Doc. # 61-16]; Buenaventura\n   Depo. at 102:21-103:8. Rabinovitz estimated that the phone call (where he and his counsel were on speakerphone) lasted four to nine minutes. Defs' SUF at \u00b6 32. M.R. testified that she had \"no clue\" how long she spent in the conference room with Buenaventura, that it \"could have been\" between 20 and 30 minutes, but it \"felt like\" an hour.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21; M.R.

Defs' SUF at \u00b6 49. The Division determined that the allegations were \"unfounded, meaning the [complained-of] act did not occur as alleged in that [personnel] complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. As a result, Buenaventura was not disciplined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. Buenaventura has never been disciplined \"in any way in connection with a school interview.\" Pls' ASUF at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Official Practices Regarding Interviews of Suspected Child Abuse Victims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On May 1, 2013, the Office of the Chief of Police issued a notice of changes in LAPD procedures for on-campus investigations of child victims or witnesses. Pls' SUF at \u00b6 50; Ex. 13 to Cox Decl. (\"May 2013 Notice\") [Doc. # 61-18]. The procedures announced in the Notice were in effect at the time of M.R.'s interview. Pls' SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. The May 2013 Notice indicates that officers should \"notify the child's parent(s) and/or guardian(s) when appropriate.\" May 2013 Notice at 1. The accompanying \"LAUSD\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Legal Brief\" on requests for interviews on campus, which officers should present to school administrators if those administrators refuse to facilitate the requested interview, states that law enforcement \"can interview anyone regarding suspected child abuse,\" and that where there is suspected in-home abuse, the school \"should not\" contact the child's parent about the interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The Brief contains no additional information about contacting the interviewee's parents or information about constitutional rights of parents and children that an interview may implicate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pls' SUF at \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The then-governing LAPD Manual contains a chapter entitled School Investigations. Pls' SUF at \u00b6 53. Section 2500 of that chapter governs police investigations at school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 14 to Cox Decl. [Doc. # 61-19]. Section 2500 indicates that when an investigation involves the questioning of a minor student on school premises, during school hours, the officer \"shall\" contact the school principal and explain the reason for questioning the student; request permission to interview the student at school; attempt to secure a secluded place to interview the minor; and, when the interview involves a suspected victim of child abuse, afford the minor the option of being interviewed\n   in private and inform the minor of such a right before questioning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section 2500 is unclear to whom the officer should direct a request for permission to interview the student at school.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The LAPD's other written materials and training \"essentially\" mirror California Penal Code section 11174.3. Defs' SUF at \u00b6 35. Consistent with that statute, officers investigating SCARs should check in with school administrators to inform them of the need to conduct an interview, and the on-campus interview should occur in a private setting with the support of a child advocate when appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011174.3\">\n    Cal.

Defs' SUF at \u00b6 36. While not formally written into any official policy, it is undisputed that \"LAPD instructs officers\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to notify parents before conducting a school interview regarding suspected abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40 (emphasis added). Apparently, this instruction applies, as here, even when the parent is not the suspected abuser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   There do not appear to be any written policies governing officer conduct during the interview of a minor suspected child abuse victim. Frank Ramirez of the LAPD testified nonetheless that while it is not official policy, procedure, practice, or custom, it is also not against official policy, procedure, practice, or custom for an officer to inform the minor interviewee that he will take the child to the police station if the child does not permit the officer to conduct the interview at school. Ramirez Depo. at 142:18-143:7. Similarly, an officer's threat to arrest the minor interviewee in such a circumstance would not be in conformance with Department policy, procedure, practice, or custom, but it also is not against such official policy, procedure, practice, or custom.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011174.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011174.3\">\n    at 149:4-16, 150:21-152:10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given this, a reasonable jury could infer that Buenaventura threatened and continued to detain M.R. because of Plaintiffs' speech conduct, in an effort to chill it.

The Circuit Court rejected plaintiff's evidence of retaliatory motive-a newspaper article that ran the night before plaintiff was cited, which stated that the political group of which plaintiff was a part had been forced to leave an area of the street on the first day of the event-because she did not present any evidence that the officers actually read or knew of the article.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 895, 901.

Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit explained that in a case such as\n   <em>\n    Dietrich\n   </em>\n   , where there is \"very strong evidence of probable cause and very weak evidence of a retaliatory motive,\" the fact that defendant officers had probable cause, while not required to defeat retaliatory motive, \"undoubtedly\" has high probative value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit came to a similar conclusion, relying in part on\n   <em>\n    Dietrich\n   </em>\n   .

Although Plaintiffs also rely on the temporal proximity of the Plaintiffs' and Defendants' actions, Defendants' so-called probable cause evidence is not particularly strong. The Subject SCAR indicated that M.R. may be a victim of child abuse, but the SCAR also stated that she was not in immediate danger, that her mother's boyfriend (the perpetrator) likely lived out of state, that her mother had not been involved with M.R. for several years, and that M.R. lived with her father. Subject SCAR at 4-5. Additionally, it is undisputed that Rabinovitz was not suspected of any wrongdoing and had no knowledge of the possible abuse or the letter, which cuts against Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs objected to the questioning of M.R. in an effort to preclude the discovery of misconduct, as opposed to an exercise of their constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls' SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; Defs' MSJ at 26.

Construing the facts in Plaintiffs' favor, as the Court must on Defendants' motion for summary judgment, there is at least a triable issue of material fact as to whether Buenaventura took retaliatory action intended to chill Plaintiffs' First Amendment activity.

Under Plaintiffs' version of events, they objected to and remained silent in the face of Buenaventura's questioning, and Buenaventura threatened to arrest M.R. and continued the questioning in response to that protected activity-a factual position supported by evidence. Thus, the proper question for purposes of qualified immunity is whether it would have been clear to all but the plainly incompetent officials in Buenaventura's position that it would be a violation of individuals' constitutional rights to threaten to arrest and detain them because they engaged in protected speech conduct.

Whether a Seizure Occurred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   A Fourth Amendment seizure occurs when, \"taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To determine whether M.R.'s liberty was so restrained, the Court considers the following five factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (1) the number of officers; (2) whether weapons were displayed; (3) whether the encounter occurred in a public or non-public setting; (4) whether the officer's officious or authoritative manner would imply that compliance would be compelled; and (5) whether the officers advised the detainee of his right to terminate the encounter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155436\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1060/#p1068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Based on the second through fifth factors mentioned above and all the other relevant circumstances, the Court concludes that Buenaventura seized M.R. While Buenaventura was the sole officer present, he was dressed in full official uniform, with his weapon and badge displayed. M.R. was directed-not asked-to enter a private room inside the principal's office, despite her earlier statement that she did not wish to speak with police.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Depo. at 19:24-20:6 (\"[QUESTION:] So when you were .. asked to leave the conference room and go somewhere else, ....

I do not want to talk to officers ever without attorneys present or my dad. And I didn't want to that day, and I made that very clear.

And it is uncontroverted that Buenaventura threatened to arrest M.R. and take her to the police station to continue questioning when she asserted that she would not respond to further questions,\n   and Buenaventura expressly rejected the notion that he needed Rabinovitz's permission or any exigent circumstances to detain and interview M.R. during the encounter.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956926\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/410/1221/#p1227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding that, regardless of whether the challenged interview was initially consensual, the encounter \"transformed into a seizure through [school and law enforcement officials'] alleged threats and demands\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants counter that by refusing to answer Buenaventura's questions and directing him to speak with her attorney instead, M.R. did not submit to his authority so as to preclude the finding of a seizure.

A reasonable person-let alone a reasonable 14-year-old high school sophomore, even a precocious one-confronted with the circumstances of this interview would not feel free to leave and go about her business.

Using the reasonable suspicion standard as a starting point, the Court concluded that the facts of the case precluded such a finding, in large part because \"the stop was not made pursuant to the [law enforcement] agent's founded suspicion that the\n   <em>\n    detainee\n   </em>\n   was involved or about to be involved in criminal activity....

Otherwise, serious injustices may result.

Buenaventura was tasked with investigating the Subject SCAR on May 4, 2015-over two weeks before he decided to interview M.R. at school. Because the Subject SCAR indicated that M.R. was not in immediate danger, that her father was not a suspect, and that the alleged perpetrator likely lived out of state, Buenaventura's decision to appear at M.R.'s school without a warrant or prior notice to and consent from Rabinovitz indicates that he acted with deliberate indifference to Rabinovitz's parental rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917837\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/1126/#p1138\">\n    202 F.3d at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he police cannot seize children suspected of being abused or neglected unless reasonable avenues of investigation are first pursued, particularly where it is not clear that a crime has been-or will be-committed.\").

The Court has not been asked to evaluate the constitutionality of California Penal Code section 11174.3(a), and this Order does not undertake that task. More importantly, the Court's conclusion that the LAPD written and informal policies caused Plaintiffs' constitutional injuries and are constitutionally deficient has no bearing on the constitutionality of section 11174.3(a). Section 11174.3(a) is silent as to the constitutional safeguards discussed in this Order, while LAPD policy is not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dees v. County of San Diego\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:14-cv-0189-BEN-DHB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208673910\">\n    2016 WL 8673910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court addresses the lawfulness of the City's policy, practice, or custom\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   in the context presented here-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where the parent or guardian of the suspected child abuse victim is not the suspected perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   First, the Court observes that the written policies in effect at the time of Buenaventura's interview-Section 2500 and the May 2013 Notice-are vague with respect to parental notification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 2013 Notice at 1 (\"[O]fficers conducting an on-campus interview of a child should ... notify the child's parent(s) and/or guardian(s) when appropriate.\"); Section 2500 (instructing officers to \"[r]equest permission to question the student at school\" without any guidance regarding from whom such permission should be sought). The current written policy is silent as to parental consent, but the evidence in the record shows that Section 2500 has not been construed by the City to require pre-interview consent from a parent or guardian of the suspected victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 15 to Cox Decl. (\"Advice regarding notifying a parent and/or guardian before interviewing a child in an investigation for a crime\n   <em>\n    other than child abuse\n   </em>\n   should be obtained from\n   the Area Juvenile Coordinator, Major Assault Crimes Coordinator or other respective detective coordinator\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Yet, LAPD policy with respect to the in-school interviews of suspected child abuse victims is not confined to these written policies. The uncontroverted facts show that it is the LAPD's custom and practice for officers to uniformly interview suspected child abuse victims at school without prior judicial authorization or parental consent, regardless of exigency. Additionally, as a matter of course, officers do not tell the minor interviewees that they may leave the interview at any time or that they are not required to consent to the interview. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that these official policies are insufficient to protect against the underlying Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   While there was no clearly established law at the time of the underlying rights violations that Buenaventura's conduct was unconstitutional, the City may still be liable under section 1983. Defendants' suggestion to the contrary flies in the face of section 1983 precedent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mendiola-Martinez v. Arpaio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355054\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/1239/#p1249\">\n    836 F.3d 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249-50 (9th Cir. 2016). Particularly in a case such as this, where the officer acted unlawfully pursuant to official policy, municipal liability is most sensible because there is a \"direct causal link\" between official policy, practice, or custom and the constitutional deprivation complained of.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355054\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/1239/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355054\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/1239/#p1249\">\n    at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Further, because it is uncontroverted that Buenaventura-to say nothing of the other juvenile division officers at the LAPD-has conducted between 900 and 1,000 interviews of minors on school grounds, and he called parents beforehand on only two to three occasions even when the parents were not suspected perpetrators, the Court draws the reasonable inference that Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim based on their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations are not isolated incidents. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have established that official municipal policy caused their underlying rights violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trevino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652336\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/911/#p918\">\n    99 F.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Liability for improper custom may not be predicated on isolated or sporadic incidents; it must be founded upon practices of sufficient duration, frequency and consistency that the conduct has become a traditional method of carrying out policy.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Court does not come to the same conclusion with respect to the claim that Buenaventura's conduct is reflective of LAPD policies that allegedly encourage intimidation, fear, threats, coercion, retaliation, misrepresentation, or duress. As explained in the Factual Background, LAPD procedures say nothing about the use of such tactics. In fact, Ramirez indicated that such conduct is not in line with Department policy; is not a best practice; and that if an officer in the field called him because a minor interviewee would not cooperate, he would tell the officer not to threaten the child with arrest. The City thus \"cannot be held liable under [ section] 1983\" for Buenaventura's coercion or retaliation that allegedly caused the underlying First Amendment violation because Plaintiffs have not \"proved the existence of an unconstitutional municipal policy.\"\n   <em>\n    City of St. Louis v.
