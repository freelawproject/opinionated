The Court is inclined to dismiss Mrs. Berardi as a party defendant and allow this case to otherwise proceed in the District of New Jersey. The Court will allow supplemental briefing from the parties regarding how this case should proceed before issuing its final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts come from Plaintiffs' April 29, 2016 Second Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 25, 2005,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C948%2C527\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,948,527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '527 patent\") entitled \"Pressure-Actuated Linearly Retractable and Extendible Hose\" was issued to Gary Dean Ragner and Robert Daniel deRochemont, Jr. On June 23, 2009,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C549%2C448\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,549,448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '448 patent\") entitled \"Linearly Retractable Pressure Hose\" was issued to Ragner. Ragner Technology is the owner and assignee of all rights to the '527 and '448 patents, subject only to exclusive licenses granted to Tristar Products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2011, Ragner Technology was introduced to Greg Janson, who appeared to be interested in investing in Ragner Technology or bringing Ragner Technology to the attention of potential investors. Janson was hired as a broker to recruit investors for Ragner Technology's patented products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Janson informed Defendants that Ragner Technology was seeking to meet with investors. Janson scheduled a meeting between Ragner Technology and Defendants for August 23, 2011. On August 23, 2011, Ragner, deRochemont, and Margaret Combs, CEO of Ragner Technology, arrived in Jupiter, Florida for the scheduled meeting. At that time, they learned they\n   were at the home of the Berardi Defendants. Also at the meeting was Edward Kelly, CEO of Defendant National Express. Janson and Vince Simonelli, a business broker, were also present at the meeting. The Berardi Defendants were introduced as Kelly's producers for his television commercials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the start of the meeting, Ragner Technology made clear it was seeking investors and not licensing opportunities. Prior to disclosing any confidential information, Combs informed the Berardi Defendants and Kelly that non-disclosure agreements had not been prepared because they had been unaware of whom they were meeting with. Nonetheless, Combs insisted on a non-disclosure agreement before commencing the meeting. The Berardi Defendants and Kelly verbally agreed to terms of confidentiality and non-disclosure for the meeting. They also agreed to execute written non-disclosure agreements to be sent by Combs following the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the oral agreement, Ragner Technology \"disclosed information relating to Ragner Technology, the scope of its patents, product specifications, and target market of the Microhose product.\" They further disclosed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   specific engineering diagrams, ideas, materials of manufacture, including but not limited to, prior iterations of prototype hoses and prototype hoses constructed of more than one layer, more than one material, at least one fabric layer, various materials of manufacture including but not limited to, vinyl, nylon, rubber, polyester, and/or polypropylene, at least one layer with cord reinforcement including a hose wherein the biasing was performed by elastic material such as polymers made of thermoplastic polyurethane to provide retracting force, manufacture know-how, concepts, etc. related to its prototypes of the Microhose product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ragner Technology also demonstrated one of the patented prototypes of the Microhose product. Mr. Berardi was able to use one of the patented prototypes and saw it expand and retract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the meeting, National Express articulated its interest in licensing the patented technology and an intent for the product to be manufactured in Taiwan. Ragner Technology reiterated its request was solely for investors, but also conveyed its hesitancy to use a foreign manufacturer. After reassuring Ragner Technology of the capabilities of its foreign manufacturing contact, Kelly requested permission to contact the foreign manufacturer to address its ability to manufacture the product using the patented technology, subject to the terms of the non-disclosure agreement. Ragner Technology agreed to that limited disclosure. Kelly indicated he would contact the manufacturer as discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The morning following the meeting, August 24, 2011, Combs prepared the non-disclosure agreements, all dated August 23, 2011. The non-disclosure agreements were never executed by Defendants. Ragner Technology was similarly never contacted regarding Kelly's communications with the manufacturer in Taiwan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A little over two months later, on November 4, 2011, Mr. Berardi filed a patent application entitled \"Expandable and contractible hose,\" which Plaintiffs allege \"claim[ed] novel features of the prototypes of the Microhose product demonstrated by Ragner Technology at the August 23, 2011\n   meeting.\" Mr. Berardi obtained\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C291%2C941\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,291,941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '941 patent\"), entitled \"Expandable and contractible hose,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C291%2C942\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,291,942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '942 patent\") entitled \"Expandable hose assembly,\" and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C479%2C776\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,479,776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '776 patent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Blue Gentian, LLC is the owner of all the rights in the '941, '942, and '776 patents. Mr. Berardi is a managing member of Blue Gentian. Blue Gentian, in turn, granted National Express the exclusive right under the '941, '942, and '776 patents to market and sell the expandable hose product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on May 30, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This was followed by a First Amended Complaint on June 25, 2015. This matter was then transferred, sua sponte, from the Southern District of Florida to the District of New Jersey by the Honorable William P. Dimitrouleas, U.S.D.J. on October 28, 2015. This case was originally assigned to the Honorable Kevin McNulty, U.S.D.J. before being reassigned to the undersigned on December 2, 2016 because of the pendency of related matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs' April 29, 2016 Second Amended Complaint brings three counts against Defendants: conspiracy to monopolize (in the alternative, attempt to monopolize) (Count I); common law fraud (Count II); and breach of contract (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court begins by considering the Berardi Defendants' argument that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.

It is clear that the Berardi Defendants contested personal jurisdiction before the Southern District of Florida. Indeed, in the order transferring this case to the District of New Jersey, the Southern District of Florida acknowledged that \"Defendants Michael Berardi and Cheryl Berardi ... assert that the District of New Jersey does not have personal jurisdiction over both individuals\" and that they \"may attempt to challenge personal jurisdiction in the District of New Jersey.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case was transferred to the District of New Jersey on October 28, 2015. On March 21, 2016, Plaintiffs requested the Clerk enter default against Defendants for failing to respond to the amended complaint. In a responsive letter, Defendants indicated their understanding that their fully briefed motion to dismiss before the Southern District of Florida was ripe for adjudication before the District of New Jersey. A docket entry, however, appears to have terminated the motion to dismiss pending before the Southern District of Florida. Nonetheless, the letter further confirmed Defendants still disputed personal jurisdiction and had planned to discuss the issue at the initial conference before the Court, which had been rescheduled. Thus, on March 22, 2016 Magistrate Judge Michael A.

Defendants did not file any earlier motions or substantive filings in the District of New Jersey that this Court finds would result in a waiver of their personal jurisdiction argument.

The Second Amended Complaint also alleges Mr. Berardi met with Keith Mirchandani, the executive officer and president of Tristar, in his New Jersey home, to discuss resolving various patent matters. This meeting was done in his capacity as Managing Member of Blue Gentian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As to both Berardi Defendants, the Second Amended Complaint states the Berardi Defendants direct Berardi Productions to produce anticompetitive commercials \"which air in the State of New Jersey.\" It further states the Berardi Defendants \"write, produce, direct, and edit\" the anticompetitive advertisements that air in New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court finds the Second Amended Complaint sufficiently supports personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi based on his contacts through Blue Gentian. The 13-481 action was filed in the District of New Jersey on October 23, 2012 by Blue Gentian and National Express. The 13-7099 action was filed in the District of New Jersey on November 21, 2013 by Blue Gentian and National Express. The Court finds the filing of these actions constitute the minimum contacts necessary for this Court to assert personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi. The Second Amended Complaint pleads that Mr. Berardi took specific action and directed the filing of these lawsuits in his capacity as managing member. The Court finds that in using New Jersey courts to allegedly conspire or attempt to monopolize a market with fraudulently obtained patents, Mr. Berardi purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the State of New Jersey. Mr. Berardi was invoking the benefits and protections of the District of New Jersey, located in the forum state. If such use was fraudulent or constituted an attempt to monopolize, Mr. Berardi could reasonably expect to be haled into court in the state in which he filed the lawsuits. Combined with the meeting in New Jersey with Mirchandani, the Court finds Mr. Berardi has such minimum contacts to confer personal jurisdiction on this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court also finds exercising personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi comports with fair play and substantial justice. This Court, and the federal judiciary generally, has a significant interest in adjudicating this case in the District of New Jersey, where several related matters are also being litigated. Hearing this case in this district allows for optimal use of judicial resources and will allow for consistent rulings in these cases. The Court does not find the burden on Mr. Berardi, a\n   resident of Florida, to be overly burdensome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   However, the Court finds the Second Amended Complaint deficient in terms of supporting personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Berardi. Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the Berardi Productions' advertisements are not specific enough for this Court to determine whether they are contacts with the forum state that could support personal jurisdiction. Stating that the advertisements \"air in the State of New Jersey\" does not tell this Court whether these were national advertisements, airing in all states including New Jersey, or whether these advertisements were specifically targeted toward New Jersey residents and broadcast in New Jersey. \"[N]ational advertisements not directed at a particular forum, and advertisements which are not direct solicitations, but rather merely 'spread knowledge of defendant's facilities among the general public,' have not been sufficient to establish jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Seltzer v.

The Court finds the Southern District of Florida's implicit conclusion that this Court has personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Berardi clearly erroneous. The Court further finds asserting personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Berardi simply to comply with the law of the case would result in manifest injustice. It is fundamentally unfair to require a defendant to litigate a matter in a district in which the defendant lacks sufficient contacts. Further, the Court finds that upon \"conclud[ing] that the prior decision was 'clearly erroneous,' \" this Court is \"oblig[ated] to decline jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p815\">\n    486 U.S. at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p815\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finding this Court has personal jurisdiction over Mr. Berardi, the Court also addresses venue.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) provides that venue is proper in:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   According to the Second Amended Complaint, the Berardi Defendants reside in Florida.

The Court focuses on the first Count, as it is what allows this case to proceed in federal court. The Court thus considers the nature of the dispute to be a conspiracy to monopolize or an attempt to monopolize. The law suits brought in the State of New Jersey make up a large part of Plaintiffs' monopolization claim. While there were other significant events occurring in the State of Florida as well, the Court finds there are enough contacts in New Jersey that prevent this Court from concluding that it was clear error to determine venue was proper in the District of New Jersey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At this juncture,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds its options for the disposition of this case to be: (1) transfer of the case to an appropriate district;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) severance of the case, allowing this Court to retain jurisdiction over National Express and Mr. Berardi and dismiss Mrs. Berardi; or (3) severance of the case,\n   allowing this Court to retain jurisdiction over National Express and Mr. Berardi and transfer the claims against Mrs. Berardi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court is hesitant to transfer this case, given the related cases currently being litigated in the District of New Jersey. The Court finds judicial resources are best conserved, and consistent decisions will be made, if this case is able to proceed in the District of New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As to severing this case and transferring the claims against Mrs. Berardi, the Court is concerned this would result in duplicitous litigation, a waste of judicial resources, and possibly inconsistent decisions, as the claims against Mrs. Berardi are the same as those against the other two defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court is inclined therefore to exercise its jurisdiction over National Express and Mr. Berardi and dismiss Mrs. Berardi as a party defendant without prejudice.
