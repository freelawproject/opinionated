The Court finds that six of the causes of action against Ponomarenko, and the entire Third Party Complaint against Summit Estate, are insufficiently pled.

Of course, the entire basis of Shapiro's breach of contract claim is that Ponomarenko did not pay in full, and still owes thousands of dollars under the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer &amp; Counterclaim at 24 (alleging that Ponomarenko \"failed to meet his financial obligations\" resulting in at least $23,000 in damages to Shapiro).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court views these allegations in the light most favorable to Shapiro, and cannot credit Ponomarenko's insistence that he \"fully performed his end of the bargain\" by making payments to Krogh and Shapiro. MTD at 9. Ponomarenko's declaration and attorney argument on this point are misplaced on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and the Court STRIKES Ponomarenko's declaration attached to the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 59-1.

With respect to his second and third causes of action for breach of confidentiality and breach of the non-compete provision in the written agreement, Shapiro merely identifies these provisions but does not adequately allege facts regarding Ponomarenko's conduct to make these claims for relief plausible.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A claim is facially plausible when it \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged\").

Therefore, Shapiro has not plausibly alleged that Ponomarenko violated the non-compete provision which by its terms only applied for \"a period of two years.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Agreement at 10.

The Court cannot determine from Shapiro's allegations how the conspiracy formed or operated, and whether Ponomarenko had knowledge of or intent to aid in wrongful activity, or even what the alleged wrongful activity entailed. Cursory allegations that Ponomarenko contacted PVM students and agents to solicit business and prospective clients for \"Elevated Pickup\" is insufficient to state a claim for civil conspiracy.

Google, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328426\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/159/1101/#p1107\">\n    159 F.Supp.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (emphasis added). The forum selection clause in the First Agreement is unambiguous and legally indistinguishable. Here, the District of Nevada has two courthouses, one of which is located in Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada. Ponomarenko's argument that the forum selection clause is ambiguous is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, Ponomarenko is a sophisticated individual who actually made copious notes and changes to the First Agreement before he signed it, as well as initialed every page of the contract including the page containing the forum selection clause.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   First Agreement. Unlike consumers or customers clicking \"accept\" when presented with a company's standard Terms of Service, this case involves an agreement between sophisticated parties who exercised their ability to negotiate certain provisions of the contract, as evidenced by Ponomarenko's handwritten interlineations. This provides even more support for upholding the validity of the forum selection clause in the First Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court also rejects Ponomarenko's primary argument that the forum selection clause is \"not binding\" because it is part of a disputed contract. In their opposition, Ponomarenko contends that because he alleges that the entire contract was fraudulent, invalid, or otherwise uncertain, he cannot be deemed to have consented to a forum selection clause within such contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Transfer at 3. The Court takes issue with Ponomarenko's characterization of the facts of this case. The First Agreement is not \"in dispute\" in this action. To the contrary, the FAC does not challenge the validity of the First Agreement, the forum selection clause, or the Second Agreement for that matter. In fact, Ponomarenko actually seeks to recover damages for Shapiro's breach of the First Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 44-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Ponomarenko cannot have it both ways by alleging that he has been harmed by Defendants' \"failure to perform\" the First Agreement, FAC \u00b6 50, and also challenging the Agreement as fraudulent, invalid, or otherwise uncertain for purposes of invalidating the forum selection clause. All six causes of action in the FAC actually rely on the existence of a valid agreement between the parties. Even Ponomarenko's misrepresentation claims allege that \"Defendants represented to Plaintiff that Defendants would perform coaching services to Plaintiff as set forth in the First and Second Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 60. Indeed, Ponomarenko describes this case as being \"about a breach of contract and fraud in which Plaintiff Paul Ponomarenko was promised life and motivational coaching services but was never provided such services by the Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 1. Ponomarenko does not seek to void the contract as unenforceable, and his arguments aimed at the validity of the forum selection clause fail on these grounds as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Whether\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Marine\n    </em>\n    Governs the \u00a7 1404(a) Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Ponomarenko and Summit Estate argue that even if the forum selection clause is valid, the \u00a7 1404(a) analysis would not support transfer to Nevada.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Transfer at 5. Ponomarenko points to the FAC, which he argues includes several claims that are \"wholly unrelated\" to the First Agreement containing the forum selection clause, including breach of the oral Second Agreement that is entirely separate from the First Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 26-30, 51-74. Thus, their argument is that the forum selection clause only covers Ponomarenko's claims relating to the First Agreement. Opp'n to Transfer at 6. However, even if the terms of the alleged Second Agreement are sufficiently pled, the Court finds that the First Agreement is the primary contract between the parties and contains a valid forum selection clause. Moreover, the First Agreement contains a provision stating that all changes must be in writing, and an integration clause providing that the written agreement contains \"the entire agreement between the parties\" and \"[n]o subsequent agreement, representation or promise made by either party, or by or to any employee, officer, agent or representative of either party shall be of any effect unless it is in writing and executed by the parties to be bound.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transfer Mot. at 3; First Agreement at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Second Agreement is purported to be just that-an agreement proposed by an agent of PVM (Krogh), to provide additional coaching sessions in California. FAC \u00b6 26. Ponomarenko specifically alleges that he \"was informed and led to believe that this second agreement was authorized by Defendant PVM, and no communications were made by Defendant Shapiro at that time to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even the payments made to Krogh in February 2014 were made pursuant to both the First\n   Agreement and Second Agreement, demonstrating that the oral agreement appears to be an extension of the written agreement for personal coaching services governing the relationship between the parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The Court anticipates a factual dispute as to the existence of the Second Agreement, and whether the forum selection clause and non-disclosure provisions of the First Agreement extend to that contract. However, Ponomarenko has failed to demonstrate that the forum selection clause does not extend to certain claims in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court agrees with Shapiro that\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   applies to this case, and mandates adjustments to the traditional \u00a7 1404(a) analysis. At the hearing, Ponomarenko and Summit Estate insisted that\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   cannot decide this case because the forum selection clause does not apply to all of their claims. They also argued that\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   provides that the forum selection clause should only be considered as one factor in the \u00a7 1404(a) analysis. However, Ponomarenko and Summit Estate cite no authority for their proposed analysis, other than an outdated legal standard from a pre-\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   case that has since been clarified by the Supreme Court.

The Court finds that Ponomarenko and Summit Estate have misread\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   , and disagrees with their analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Court also finds that the forum selection clause covers the claims in the FAC. Although the Court indicated at the hearing that it was leaning toward keeping the case in California, the Court cannot ignore the clear and broad forum selection clause in the written agreement between the parties, and the guidance from the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   . It is clear from a plain reading of the forum selection clause that it applies to Ponomarenko's claims against Shapiro and PVM. Ponomarenko's claims, even those involving the alleged oral agreement, fall within the ambit of the written agreement for personal coaching services which provides that \"[a]ll actions or proceedings\n   <em>\n    arising in connection with\n   </em>\n   this Agreement shall be tried and litigated exclusively in Clark County, Nevada State and Federal Courts.\" First Agreement at 12 (emphasis added). This clause is mandatory, and its breadth supports this Court's finding that this entire action arises \"in connection with\" the First Agreement. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   dictates that the Court should transfer this action to the District of Nevada pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a) absent exceptional circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a valid forum selection clause should be given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   , Ponomarenko's choice of venue in California \"merits no weight,\" and the burden shifts to Ponomarenko to show why the action should not be transferred to the preselected forum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the Court must ignore Ponomarenko and Summit Estate's arguments regarding private interest factors, such as their assertion that \"the majority of events, witnesses, and parties are located in California.\" Opp'n to Transfer at 7. This is because when a valid forum selection clause covers a parties' dispute, the Court \"must deem the private-interest factors to weigh entirely in favor\n   of the preselected forum.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is because the forum selection clause waives the parties' \"right to challenge the preselected forum as inconvenient\" and the \"district court may consider arguments about public-interest factors only.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ponomarenko agreed to litigate disputes \"arising in connection\" with the First Agreement in Las Vegas, Nevada, and his traditional \u00a7 1404(a) arguments that the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interests of justice weigh in favor of venue in California are simply irrelevant under\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   . In other words, where there is a valid forum selection clause in a contract between the parties, \"the interest of justice\" is best served by giving effect to the parties' bargain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In the face of a valid and enforceable forum selection clause, Ponomarenko and Summit Estate can only avoid transfer pursuant to the forum selection clause by demonstrating that the public interest under \u00a7 1404(a) makes transfer inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    at 579, 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the hearing and in their briefing, Ponomarenko and Summit Estate put forth no persuasive public interest arguments, other than those rejected above such as that Shapiro should not be able to enforce any term of a disputed contract. Again, the First Agreement is not disputed, as Ponomarenko seeks to enforce it in his FAC. The Court finds that Ponomarenko and Summit Estate have failed to raise any exceptional circumstances or public interest factors that preclude enforcement of the forum selection clause.\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   581 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    T &amp; M Solar &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v.
