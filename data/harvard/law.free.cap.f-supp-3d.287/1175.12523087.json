BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Motion to Dismiss Indictment as It Relates to Shauna Gutierrez, filed May 18, 2016 (Doc. 1155)(\"MTD\"). The Court held a hearing on November 8-9, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court should dismiss the Second Superseding Indictment, filed March 9, 2017 (Doc. 947)(\"Indictment\") as it relates to Defendant Shauna Gutierrez for evidentiary insufficiency; and (ii) whether the allegations in the Indictment, when assumed to be true, amount to a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"VICAR\"). The Court concludes that, in a criminal case, it cannot consider the merits of a pretrial motion to dismiss for evidentiary insufficiency unless Plaintiff United States of America consents and the facts are essentially undisputed. The Court also concludes that the allegations in the Indictment, if true, indicate that Gutierrez violated VICAR. Accordingly, the Court denies the MTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court takes its background facts from the Indictment. The facts are largely unchanged from those that the Court provided in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed October 28, 2016 (Doc. 753).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Deleon\n   </em>\n   , No. CR 15-4268,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207242579\">\n    2016 WL 7242579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.M. 2016) (Browning, J.).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed March 8, 2017 (Doc. 943);\n   <em>\n    United States of America v. Angel Deleon\n   </em>\n   , No. CR 15-4268,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203124632\">\n    2016 WL 3124632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.M. 2016) (Browning, J.). The Court does not set forth these facts as findings or the truth. The Court recognizes that the factual background is largely the United States' version of events and that the Defendants are all presumed innocent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case deals with crimes that the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico (\"SNM\") allegedly committed through its members. Indictment at 2. SNM, through its members, operated in the District of New Mexico at all relevant times, and its members engaged in acts of violence and other criminal activities, \"including murder, kidnapping, attempted murder, conspiracy to manufacture/distribute narcotics, and firearms trafficking.\" Indictment at 2. SNM constitutes an enterprise \"as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 1959(b)(2), that is, a group of individuals associated in fact that engaged in, and the activities of which affected, interstate and foreign commerce.\" Indictment at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   SNM is a violent prison gang formed in the early 1980s at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (\"PNM\") after a violent prison riot at PNM during which inmates seriously\n   assaulted and raped twelve correctional officers after taking them hostage. Indictment at 3. During the riot, thirty-three inmates were killed and over 200 were injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3. After the PNM riot, SNM expanded throughout the state's prison system and has had as many as 500 members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3. SNM has approximately 250 members, with \"a 'panel' or 'mesa' (Spanish for table) of leaders who issued orders to subordinate gang members.\" Indictment at 3. SNM controls drug distribution and other illegal activities within the New Mexico penal system, but it also conveys orders outside the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3. Members who rejoin their communities after completing their sentences are expected to further the gang's goals, the main one being the control of and profit from narcotics trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. Members who fail \"to show continued loyalty to the gang [are] disciplined in various ways, [ ] includ[ing] murder and assaults.\" Indictment at 4. SNM also intimidates and influences smaller New Mexico Hispanic gangs to expand its illegal activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. If another gang does not abide by SNM's demands, SNM manages to assault or kill one of the other gang's members to show its power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. SNM's rivalry with other gangs also manifests itself in beatings and stabbings within the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. SNM further engages in violence \"to assert its gang identity, to claim or protect its territory, to challenge or respond to challenges, to retaliate against a rival gang or member, [and] to gain notoriety and show it superiority over others.\" Indictment at 4-5. To show its strength and influence, SNM expects its members to confront and attack any suspected law enforcement informants, cooperating witnesses, homosexuals, or sex offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 5. To achieve its purpose of preserving its power, SNM uses intimidation, violence, threats of violence, assaults, and murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 7. SNM as an enterprise generates income by having its members and associates traffic controlled substances and extort narcotic traffickers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 7. SNM's recent activities in a conspiracy to murder high-ranking New Mexico Corrections Department Officials inspired the present investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garcia\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-4275 JB, Memorandum Opinion and Order at 2, filed November 16, 2016 (Doc. 133)(citing United States' Response to Defendant's Motion to Designate Complex (Doc. 56) at 1, filed May 3, 2016 (Doc. 70) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The United States filed the Indictment on March 9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1. The Indictment charges Gutierrez with two distinct VICAR violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 17-18. Count 14 alleges that Gutierrez and others \"unlawfully, knowingly and intentionally conspire[d] to murder J.G. ... in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).\" Indictment at 17. Count 15 alleges that Gutierrez and others \"unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally attempt[ed] to murder J.G., and committed assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury ... in violation of 18 U.S.C.[\u00a7 1959 ].\" Indictment at 17-18. In addition to those VICAR violations, Count 16 alleges that Gutierrez and others, \"used and attempted to use physical force against J.G. by assaulting J.G. with a dangerous weapon with the intent to influence, delay, or prevent J.G. from testifying ... in an official proceeding ... in violation of 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 1512 ].\" Indictment at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court now recites the procedural background regarding the MTD. That background includes both the MTD itself and the United States' response. It also includes the hearing that the Court held on November 8-9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The MTD\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Gutierrez filed the MTD on May 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 7. Gutierrez argues that the Court should dismiss the Indictment's charges against her, because the \"conduct charged in the Indictment does not constitute a violation of\" VICAR or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MTD at 1. According to Gutierrez, \"[t]he discovery disclosed to date states that Shauna Gutierrez permitted Brandy Rodriguez to drive Shauna's truck to Charlene Parker-Johnson's house not knowing the plan of Brandy Rodriguez, Paul Rivera and Santos Gonzales once they arrived at Parker's house. The trio proceeded to assault J.G.\" Indictment at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Gutierrez asserts that she is not an SNM member, because \"[f]emales are not members or associates of SNM,\" and because she \"has never been to prison, a prerequisite to becoming a member of SNM.\" MTD at 4. Gutierrez contends that \"[t]he Government concedes that Ms. Gutierrez is not a member of SNM, but is an associate or prospect of SNM by virtue of her romantic relationship with Joe Lawrence Gallegos.\" MTD at 4. Gutierrez argues that her romantic relationship with an alleged SNM member does not make her an SNM prospect or associate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 5. Gutierrez also argues that she did not knowingly and intentionally associate with SNM, because she \"associated with Joe Lawrence Gallegos as a personal romantic choice, and not for purposes of the enterprise,\" or \"so as to promote illegal activities.\" MTD at 5. Gutierrez then contends that, contrary to the Indictment, \"[t]here is not a shred of evidence that Ms. Gutierrez received money, a large amount of drugs or anything of pecuniary value from the SNM at anytime. She did not receive a penny.\" MTD at 5-6. According to Gutierrez, it follows that \"[t]he indictment against Ms. Gutierrez must be dismissed.\" MTD at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The United States responds to the MTD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States' Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Indictment [1155] at 1, filed June 1, 2017 (Doc. 1173)(\"MTD Response\"). The United States argues that \"Gutierrez's argument is premature and therefore procedurally improper,\" because it \"[e]ssentially ... challenges the sufficiency of the United States' evidence to prove the elements of the crimes.\" MTD Response at 1. Specifically, \"Gutierrez's involvement with the enterprise is an essential element of the offenses charged in the Indictment, and as such should be decided by the jury.\" MTD Response at 1. According to the United States, \"it is well established that during pretrial proceedings, a defendant may not properly challenge an indictment on the ground that it is not supported by the evidence.\" MTD at 2. The United States acknowledges that the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held that a trial court can consider the sufficiency of the evidence on a pretrial motion to dismiss when the operative facts are undisputed and the United States fails to object.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513883\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/1084/#p1088\">\n    20 F.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1088 (10th Cir. 1994) ). The United States asserts that, \"[i]n this case, there are disputed facts,\" so \"this case does not represent the rare exception laid out in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   .\" MTD Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court held a hearing on November 8-9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing (held November 8, 2017), filed November 20, 2017 (Doc. 1456); Transcript of Hearing (held November 9, 2017), filed November 20, 2017 (Doc. 1457)(\"Nov. 9 Tr.\"). The Court heard the MTD on November 9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 169:3-10 (Court). Gutierrez began by arguing that \"the\n   Court has to make some decisions at some point concerning whether SNM is an enterprise within the meaning of the racketeering statutes[,] ... whether Ms. Gutierrez was a member of SNM, and whether she did participate in the predicate violent crime, and whether she received anything of pecuniary value.\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 170:7-15 (Arellanes). Gutierrez then repeated her arguments in the MTD that she is not an SNM member or associate, and that she did not receive anything of pecuniary value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 170:16-171:6 (Arellanes). According to Gutierrez, it follows from \"the burden on the Government to show the elements of the offense for which they have charged\" that \"Ms. Gutierrez should be completely dismissed out of this case.\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 171:7-10 (Arellanes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court then asked Gutierrez to address\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hall\n   </em>\n   and its holding that, absent prosecution consent, \"since there is no summary judgment procedure [on] the criminal side, basically if they want to present their facts to a jury, you've got to wait until the directed verdict stage. You can't get a preliminary ruling over whether ... that evidence is sufficient.\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 173:16-174:2 (Court). Gutierrez replied that, under\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hall\n   </em>\n   , \"if there [are] undisputed facts,\" then the situation is \"[s]imilar to summary judgment.\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 174:23-175:3 (Arellanes). The Court then pressed Gutierrez, positing that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hall\n   </em>\n   requires both undisputed facts and prosecution consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 175:5-16 (Court). Gutierrez then admitted that \"[t]hat may be true, Judge.\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 175:17 (Arellanes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The United States then took to the podium and indicated that the Court's understanding of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hall\n   </em>\n   is correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 175:23-176:6 (Castellano). The United States asserted that the MTD \"is the equivalent to a plea of not guilty at arraignment\" and disputing all the elements of the offense. Nov. 9 Tr. at 176:7-11 (Castellano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court gave the last word to Gutierrez,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. 180:5-6 (Court), and then it articulated its inclination regarding the MTD:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   I think my power here is very restricted. And I'm not at all confident that I have the power to-with the Government objecting to it-to grant a motion to dismiss of this nature. So I'm inclined to deny the motion. I'll take a look at it, but I'm inclined to think that there is at least disputed issues of inferences from the evidence that's here. And I'm not prepared to say that the Government is incapable of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. So I think I'll be denying this motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 182:20-183:5 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW REGARDING MOTIONS TO DISMISS IN CRIMINAL CASES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure contain no analog for summary judgment under rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
