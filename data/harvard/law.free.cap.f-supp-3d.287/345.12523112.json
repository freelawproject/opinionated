Although plaintiff's motion seeks various forms of relief, at oral argument the parties stipulated that the only issue remaining in dispute is the failure by defendants Jodi Ball, M.D., Sisters of Charity Hospital and Catholic Health System to comply with plaintiff's March 10, 2017 demand for production of \"[a]ll Peer Review and Quality Assurance reports, statements, memoranda, communications, materials, attendance logs concerning care and treatment of patient JILL A. WOODWORTH on July 27, 2012\". [72-3], p. 7 of 9, Request 4. Although that demand required production by April 11, 2017, defendants did not respond until September 13, 2017, objecting that the requested documents \"would be privileged pursuant to New York Education Law \u00a7 6527 and Public Health Law \u00a7\u00a7 2805-j through 2805-m as any responsive document would have been created in the course of the hospital's quality assurance and/or peer review programs\". [72-6], p. 3 of 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In moving to compel production of these documents, plaintiff argues that defendants' untimely objection to the demand is ineffective, and that in any event the privilege does not apply.

[73-2], p. 4 of 11, \u00b6 4. For that reason, and without condoning defendants' failure to timely object to plaintiff's March 10, 2017 demand, I conclude that the harsh sanction of waiver is not warranted in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
