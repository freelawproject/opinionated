Both parties have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Commissioner's motion is denied, Perozzi's motion is granted, and the case is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 25, 2013, Perozzi applied for disability insurance benefits (\"SSDI\") and supplemental security income (\"SSI\"), alleging that he was disabled as of June 13, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Administrative Record, filed May 24, 2017 (Docket # 12) (\"R.\"), at 95, 152-61. The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied these\n   claims on November 26, 2013. R. 96. Two months later, on January 23, 2014, Perozzi requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). R. 104. That hearing occurred on June 16, 2015. R. 37-67. On August 28, 2015, the ALJ issued a decision that found Perozzi not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act (the \"Act\"). R. 14-36. Perozzi appealed that decision to the Appeals Council, which denied his request for review on January 19, 2017. R. 1-7. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Perozzi was represented by his attorney, Gideon Miller, at the hearing before the ALJ. R. 37-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Perozzi testified that the last time he worked was as a \"maintenance helper\" for the Rockland County Sewer Department in 2009. R. 44-46. He has not worked since. R. 46. He testified that he suffers from constant back pain, as well as side effects of fatigue and an inability to concentrate from the pain medication he takes. R. 47-48. It is \"hard for [him] to sit for long periods of time,\" usually for no more than 15 minutes without discomfort; he can walk \"[m]aybe down the block\" but uses a cane \"on occasion\" that is not prescribed by a doctor; he can stand for no more than 10 to 15 minutes; he can lift \"10 pounds at the most\"; he has difficulty bending down; and he lies down \"quite a few times for minimum a half-hour\" during the day after taking his medications. R. 48-50, 53. He suffered a heart attack in 2013, but his heart condition now is \"pretty good\" although his blood pressure is \"slightly high\" and his \"pulse runs high.\" R. 47-48. He also has gout, but \"it's controlled.\" R. 48. A life-long learning disability impairs his reading comprehension. R. 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With regard to daily activities, Perozzi showers every other day, but relies on the \"aid of grab bars ... the bench, [or] some sort of leverage\"; he does not perform household chores like cooking, except he sometimes does the laundry; he occasionally does \"a little light grocery shopping, just whatever [he] can carry\"; and he socializes \"maybe like once a month\" with a friend at whose house he drinks a bit and listens to music. R. 51-53. He otherwise passes the time \"mostly lying down on the bed\" and watching television or reading short articles. R. 52-53. He drives, but does so \"very little\" per week and only locally. R. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Perozzi has not undergone surgery on his back, but has received two epidural shots, which did not help, and physical therapy \"for a few months\" that also \"wasn't helping.\" R. 51. Perozzi testified that he does not see anyone for his \"mental problems.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After hearing from Perozzi, the ALJ called Barbara Ellen Burk, a vocational expert (\"VE\"), for her opinion as to the claimant's previous work capacity based on his testimony. R. 54. Perozzi had testified that his past work was as a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   maintenance helper ... [and it] involved a lot of heavy ... lifting, maintaining the sewer ... lines and going to pump stations and ... helping the pump station operator with the maintenance and the upkeep of the pump house, which was a lot of lifting of heavy weight, and climbing up and down the stairs, and a lot of tools and equipment for whatever job had to be done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   R. 45. Based on this testimony, VE Burk categorized Perozzi's past work as either \"municipal maintenance worker\" or \"highway maintenance worker\" and described it as demanding a \"heavy\" level of exertion. R. 57. Perozzi had also testified to his work as a \"surveyor helper\" prior to starting his job with Rockland County in 2001. R. 46. VE Burk described that job as demanding a \"medium\" level of exertion,\n   based off how Perozzi had described it. R. 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ALJ then described a person of Perozzi's age, education, and work experience who could perform sedentary work, but who could only occasionally climb stairs and ramps; could never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; could occasionally balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, and crawl; must avoid unprotected heights and hazardous machinery; must be provided a \"sit/stand option\" once every two hours; and should avoid wetness, humidity, and extreme heat and cold. R. 58. The VE testified that such a person could not perform his or her past work, but could perform the jobs of small products assembler, telephone solicitor, printed circuit board assembly touch-up screener, and cashier II, all of which exist in significant numbers in the national economy. R. 59-62. All these jobs permit an employee to \"sit and stand as they need to\" so long as the person remains at their work station. R. 59. The VE did note that \"[small products assembler] is in the [Dictionary of Occupational Titles] at light,\" but she testified that in her experience there are many such jobs at the sedentary level. R. 60. But if the hypothetical person was limited to sitting for less than six hours in an eight-hour work day, standing and walking for only two hours of an eight-hour work day, occasionally lifting or carrying weights that are less than ten pounds, and that person would be off task 15 percent of the work day and absent three or more times per month, then the VE testified that there would be no jobs such a person could perform in the national economy. R. 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both Perozzi and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 3-10; Comm'r Mem. at 1-14. The summaries are substantially consistent with each other. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed May 26, 2017 (Docket # 13), at \u00b6 5, and neither party has done so. Accordingly, the Court adopts the plaintiff's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ALJ denied Perozzi's application for benefits on August 28, 2015. R. 14. The ALJ found that Perozzi met the insured status requirements of the Act through December 31, 2015, and that he had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since June 13, 2009, the alleged onset date. R. 19. The ALJ found that Perozzi had the following severe impairments: \"degenerative disc disease, disc herniations and scoliosis of the lumbar spine, left L2-3 radiculopathy ; coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, status post cardiac stentings, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also recognized that Perozzi had obesity at various times of his treatment. R. 20. He found, however, that Perozzi's gout and related renal insufficiency were managed with medication.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also found that Perozzi's stated learning disability did not more than minimally limit his ability to perform basic mental work activities, noting that he demonstrated no cognitive deficits at the hearing or at the Social Security Field Office; that he had achieved an IQ score of 82, placing him in the low average range of intelligence; that he read at an approximately 12th grade reading level; that independent examiners reported only mild functional limitations; and that in any case, he had worked successfully with the learning disability for many years. R. 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The ALJ then determined that none of Perozzi's severe impairments met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart P, appendix 1. R. 22. The ALJ specifically considered Listing 1.04, Disorders of the Back,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 1.04 (\"Listing 1.04\"), and Listing 4.04, Ischemic Heart Disease,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.04 (\"Listing 4.04\"). R. 22. The ALJ found that Perozzi's degenerative disc disease did not meet Listing 1.04, because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   the record does not demonstrate compromise of a nerve root (including the cauda equina ) or the spinal cord with additional findings of: A) evidence of nerve root compression characterized by neuro-anatomic distribution of pain, limitation of motion of the spine, motor loss (atrophy with associated muscle weakness) accompanied by sensory or reflex loss and, if there is involvement of the lower back, positive straight-leg raising; or B) spinal arachnoiditis ; or C) lumbar spinal stenosis resulting in pseudoclaudication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Likewise, the ALJ found that Perozzi failed to meet Listing 4.04, because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [he did] not have a sign- or symptom-limited exercise tolerance test demonstrating at least one of the manifestations described in the Listing at a workload equivalent to five METs or less. He has not had three separate ischemic episodes, each requiring revascularization or not amenable to revascularization within a twelve-month period. The claimant further does not have coronary artery disease demonstrated by appropriate medically acceptable imaging, and, in the absence of an exercise tolerance or drug-induced stress test, a medical consultant has concluded that performance of exercise tolerance testing would present significant risk to the individual with angiographic evidence showing significant narrowing as contemplated in the Listing and very serious limitations in the ability to independently initiate, sustain or complete activities of daily living.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the ALJ recognized that Listing 4.00(H)(1) directs an ALJ to evaluate hypertension with reference to specific body systems affected under that listing, the ALJ found \"no evidence in the medical file of a specific body system so affected as to meet a listing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ noted that \"no treating or examining physician has mentioned findings equivalent in severity to the criteria of any Listed impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Turning next to Perozzi's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), the ALJ determined that Perozzi could perform the full range of sedentary work, except insofar as it required him to climb stairs and ramps, or balance, stoop, crouch, knee, and crawl more than occasionally. R. 23. The ALJ also added that Perozzi would have to be provided an option to sit and stand, once every two hours, and must avoid wetness, humidity, and temperature extremes of heat and cold.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In compiling Perozzi's RFC, the ALJ weighed the opinions of various treating and consulting sources, giving the opinions \"great weight,\" \"some weight,\" or \"little weight.\" R. 24-29. As for the opinions of physicians on Perozzi's back problems, the ALJ gave \"great weight\" to only one opinion-that of Dr. Julia Kaci, a consultative examiner for Perozzi's SSI and SSDI claims. R. 26. She had opined that Perozzi had \"moderate limitations with walking, standing, sitting, pushing, pulling, bending, climbing and lifting or carrying,\" but \"no limitations with his hands.\" R. 26. After summarizing her findings and opinion, the ALJ noted that her findings \"support a residual functional capacity for sedentary work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ gave \"some weight\" to the opinions of three treating sources and two examining sources. The three treating sources, Drs. Todd Askensas (a chiropractor), Thomas Bottiglieri, and Jack Stern, had opined in 2009 and 2010 that Perozzi \"was not a surgical candidate\" and that he could promptly return to work after a conservative course of treatment including \"physical therapy, osteopathic manipulative therapy, a home exercise program and anti-inflammatory medication and an epidural injection.\" R. 24-25. Noting that the opinions were rendered in accordance with the standards of the New York State Workers' Compensation Act, the ALJ gave these opinions \"some weight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, the ALJ gave some weight to the opinion of Dr. Robert Hendler, an independent medical examiner, who had opined that Perozzi \"was able to work\" so long as he lifted no more than twenty pounds and did not bend repeatedly or stand \"for periods of greater than two hours, without taking a break.\" R. 25. Again, the ALJ noted that the opinion was due less weight because it was rendered in the context of Perozzi's workers' compensation case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ also gave some weight to the opinion of Dr. Charles Sallahian, a chiropractor and independent medical examiner, that Perozzi could work \"in a sedentary position with restrictions of heavy lifting and repetitive bending.\" R. 26. Here, the ALJ appears to have given Dr. Sallahian's opinion less weight due only to his status as a chiropractor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Earning only \"little weight\" were the opinions of Dr. Gerald Gaughan, a treating source, who saw Perozzi from 2011 through the date of the hearing before the ALJ. R. 27. The ALJ gave \"little weight\" to Dr. Gaughan's opinions that Perozzi was \"totally disabled and unable to work in any capacity,\" that Perozzi could \"occasionally lift and carry less than ten pounds; and less than five pounds frequently; stand and/or walk for up to two hours in an eight hour workday; and sit for less than six hours in an eight hour workday,\" that Perozzi \"would require a fifteen minute unscheduled break every thirty minutes,\" that Perozzi \"needed to avoid wetness, humidity, temperatures extremes and heights,\" and that Perozzi \"would be absent from work more than three times a month.\" R. 27-28. In explaining the weight given, the ALJ observed that a \"claimant's treating physician in the context of a workers' compensation claim often serves as an advocate for the claimant and describes excessive limitations to enhance the claimant's financial recovery.\" R. 28. He also noted that the definition of disability in the workers' compensation context differs from that of the Act, and that \"the opinions of Drs. Kaci, Handler, Bottiglieri and Salliahan [are] more persuasive and more consistent with the overall medical records and claimant's activities of daily living.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As for Perozzi's heart problems, the ALJ observed that Drs. John Fitzpatrick and Michael Innerfield generally reported that Perozzi \"was doing well,\" in that his heart had regular rate and rhythm, he had normal range of motion and muscle strength in all four extremities, he was losing weight, and he \"exercised three to four times a week.\" R. 28-29. He did not explicitly assign any weight to their opinions, but gave \"great weight\" to the corroborating report of Dr. A. Auerbach who opined that Perozzi \"was capable of lifting twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, stand/walk for six hours in an eight hour workday and sit for six hours in an eight hour workday.\" R. 29. The ALJ noted, however, that Dr. Auerbach's opinion was \"limited just to the cardiovascular aspect of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ALJ also weighed Perozzi's subjective complaints of pain and discomfort, finding them not wholly credible. R. 24. The ALJ noted that despite Perozzi's complaints\n   of severe back pain, Perozzi had reported to Drs. Melissa Antiaris and Kaci that he prepares simple meals, performs light cleaning, does the laundry, drives, showers and dresses himself, exercises three to four times a week, and has \"sought work 'on and off' since his accident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His driving, in particular, showed to the ALJ \"an ability to deal with the stress inherent [in driving],\" an ability to use hand and foot controls, and a presumed \"ability to turn one's head to back up and change lanes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Adding to the ALJ's perception that Perozzi's subjective complaints of debilitating symptoms were not wholly credible, the ALJ observed that Perozzi's medical records showed that he has received only routine treatments for his alleged disabilities and that he \"continually advises his physician that he feels well and the physician continually notes he looks well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Last, the ALJ observed no evidence of Perozzi's debilitating symptoms at the hearing, further reducing the credibility of Perozzi's subjective complaints.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After determining Perozzi's RFC, the ALJ turned to the question of whether Perozzi could return to his past work. R. 30-32. Relying in large part on the testimony of VE Burk that a person of Perozzi's age, education, experience and RFC could no longer perform the jobs of municipal maintenance worker and surveyor helper, the ALJ concluded that Perozzi could no longer perform his past relevant work. R. 30-31. The ALJ then moved on to consider whether Perozzi could successfully transition to other work in the national economy. R. 30-32. Again relying on the VE's testimony and also materials in the record, the ALJ concluded that Perozzi could successfully transition to other work. R. 31-32. Accordingly, the ALJ found Perozzi \"not disabled\" under the Act and denied his application for benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    GOVERNING STANDARDS OF LAW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Scope of Judicial Review Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A court reviewing a final decision by the Commissioner \"is limited to determining whether the [Commissioner's] conclusions were supported by substantial evidence in the record and were based on a correct legal standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Selian v.

Perozzi may have met the requirement based on the 2009 MRI and subsequent MRIs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   If the threshold requirement is met, a claimant still must show that he satisfies all the paragraph A criteria. Thus, Perozzi must show \"neuro-anatomic distribution of pain.\" Here, there was evidence of radicular pain consistent with compression of the right L2 nerve root and mild impingement of the L3 nerve root.

Left-sided radiculopathy is not perfectly consistent with compression of the right L2 nerve root, but the result might show \"neuro-anatomic distribution of pain\" consistent with compression of an L2-L3 nerve. The Commissioner directs us to no evidence from the record that contradicts these results and the ALJ expressly found that Perozzi has \"left L2-3 radiculopathy.\" R. 19.

Additionally, Dr. Sallahian observed limited range of motion of the lumbar spine with consistent complaints of lower back pain, though he concurrently noted that Perozzi's coordination, station, and gait \"were within normal limits\" and that a \"motor and sensory examination of the lower extremities did not reveal any deficits.\" R. 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The same doctors also observed positive straight-leg raising: Dr. Gaughan found positive straight-leg raising at a January 2014 assessment, R. 504; October 2014 assessment, R. 516; February 2015 assessment, R. 513; and June 2015 assessment, R. 619. Dr. Kaci found positive straight-leg raising \"at 30 degrees bilaterally\" at her November 2013 assessment, R. 335, and Dr. Sallahian noted that \"[s]upine straight leg raise was accomplished to 45 [degrees] on the right with a complaint of right lower back and buttock pain and to 60 [degrees] on the left without complaint,\" R. 231.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Together, this medical evidence potentially meets the Listing 1.04A requirements.

Reply at 5. The bias, it is alleged, arose out of Dr. Hendler's role as examiner in Perozzi's workers' compensation case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ, however, explicitly accounted for that role in his opinion. R. 25. It is also incorrect to say that Dr. Hendler was the only examiner to find a negative straight leg raise test. Pl. Reply at 5. Both Drs. Bottiglieri and Semble also noted negative straight leg raise tests, R. 236, 264, as the Commissioner notes, Comm'r Reply at 3. Additionally, Dr. Fitzpatrick observed normal muscle strength, stability and range of motion repeatedly, and Perozzi also reported this. R. 346, 350, 358, 390, 402, 406.

Pl. Mem. at 18. Dr. Kaci, whose opinions the ALJ gave \"great weight,\" R. 26, was the only doctor besides Dr. Gaughan to opine specifically on Perozzi's limitations with regard to sitting, finding that Perozzi had \"moderate limitation to ... sitting,\" R. 336. Dr. Gaughan, whose opinions the ALJ gave little weight, R. 28, had repeatedly opined that Perozzi could sit for no longer than 30 minutes at a time or for more than an hour in an eight-hour workday,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 500, 504, 515. However, the meaning of Dr. Kaci's opinion is unclear. It is not obvious that a \"moderate\" limitation on sitting translates into a set number of hours. For this reason, the Second Circuit has held that when compiling an RFC from the record, an ALJ may not rely on opinions that employ the terms \"moderate\" and \"mild\" absent additional information.\n   <em>\n    Curry v.

Kaci and Sallahian, and consistent with certain findings of Dr. Bottiglieri. Pl. Mem. at 15. In fact, there were many points of disagreement. For instance, Dr. Gaughan was the only doctor to find muscle atrophy in Perozzi's left leg,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 504, 515, 619, and consistently find weakness in Perozzi's lower extremities, R. 504, 506-512, 515, 619; the only doctor to prescribe limitations for the use of Perozzi's hands, R. 501; the only doctor to limit Perozzi to less than an hour of standing over an 8-hour work period, R. 500; and the only doctor to conclude, since the time of the accident through the date of the hearing, that Perozzi was \"totally disabled and unable to work in any capacity,\" R. 492, 495, 504, 513, 516, 620. Dr. Gaughan's findings and opinions thus stand in contrast with the opinions of other treating sources. For instance, Dr. Kaci did not observe muscle atrophy and noted full grip strength bilaterally with intact hand and finger dexterity. R. 335-36. Dr. Kaci also observed limited lumbar flexion at 30 degrees, R. 335, in contrast to Dr. Gaughan's consistent observation that lumbar flexion could not exceed 15 degrees, R. 492, 504, 513, 516. Dr. Kaci observed no sensory deficits, whereas Dr. Gaughan repeatedly identified \"decreased sensibility to vibration\" in Perozzi's left thigh, R. 492, 495, 513, 516, 619. Finally, Dr. Kaci concluded that Perozzi had \"moderate limitation to walking, standing, sitting, pushing, pulling, bending, ability to lift or carry, and stairs or other climbing,\" R. 336, in contrast to Dr. Gaughan's assertion that Perozzi was \"totally disabled,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 492.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Dr. Gaughan's findings and opinions were also inconsistent with those of Dr. Sallahian. While Dr. Sallahian did find reduced range of motion and tenderness in Perozzi's lumbar spine,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 231, in line with Dr. Gaughan's notes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 504, there were numerous points of disagreement. Dr. Gaughan stated that Perozzi tested positive on the straight leg test on his left leg at 45 degrees,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203938242\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203938242\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in addition to muscle weakness and atrophy in the left leg,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203938242\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203938242\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   but Dr. Sallahian found no such results on the left leg, R. 231. Dr. Sallahian also noted that Perozzi exhibited no motor or sensory deficits in the lower extremities and that his spine exhibited no muscle spasm or trigger points upon probing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203938242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His ultimate assessment was that Perozzi had a \"moderate, partial disability,\" and accordingly, could perform sedentary work with restrictions on heavy lifting and repetitive bending. R. 232. As with Dr. Kaci's opinion above, this opinion sharply contrasts Dr. Gaughan's consistent finding that Perozzi was totally disabled.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Dr. Bottiglieri's findings are even more at odds with Dr. Gaughan's. While both did find paraspinal spasm,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 236, 513, and Dr. Bottiglieri observed moderate limitation in Perozzi's flexion range of motion, R. 236, similar to Dr. Gaughan's findings, R. 513, Dr. Bottiglieri observed no neurological\n   deficits in Perozzi's lower extremities and noted that he had intact sensation, full strength, normal flexion of the hip and knees, and negative straight leg raise testing, R. 240. Soon thereafter, Dr. Bottiglieri referred Perozzi to a neurosurgeon for evaluation, given that \"he has not responded at all to conservative managements.\" R. 236. Upon that referral, Perozzi saw Dr. Jack Stern in March 2010 for a surgical evaluation. R. 224-25. Dr. Stern recommended against surgery and encouraged further conservative care by Dr. Bottiglieri. R. 224. At a subsequent examination with Dr. Bottiglieri, he noted that \"[r]ange of motion remains minimally restricted in flexion and extension with subjective reproduction of pain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203938242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, he certified that Perozzi \"is able to return to work as of [June 22, 2010].\" R. 243.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Thus, the ALJ could properly find that Dr. Gaughan's findings were inconsistent with those of Dr. Bottiglieri, as well as Drs. Sallahian and Kaci. R. 28. It was within the ALJ's discretion to resolve such conflicts between medical opinions in the manner he did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balsamo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219710\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/75/#p81\">\n    142 F.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (An ALJ may \"choose between properly submitted medical opinions.\").

Pl. Reply at 6. He contends that an ALJ may not use his activities of daily living as evidence that a medical opinion is inconsistent with the record, unless \"[h]is activities rise to a level that would allow for the performance of substantial gainful activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Perozzi cites no case law for this rule and we find none in support of it. An ALJ has discretion to resolve conflicts in the record, including with reference to a claimant's reported activities of daily living, regardless of the severity of the claimant's limitations in activities of daily living.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Domm v.

Pl. Mem. at 16. We agree that an ALJ may not reject a treating source's opinions solely for this reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mercado v.

In addition to that factor, the ALJ also noted that \"the definition of disability in a workers' compensation case is not the same as [under the Act],\" the decision is reserved to the Commissioner, and \"the opinions of Drs.
