At the time of the original lease, the Property was a mix of office and warehouse space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Alterations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At all times during defendant's tenancy, the Lease prohibited defendant from making structural changes and from making non-structural changes without plaintiff's written consent. It also required defendant\n   to \"maintain the leased premises in good condition, reasonable wear and tear, damage by fire and other casualty only excepted ... The LESSEE shall not permit the leased premises to be overloaded, damaged, stripped, or defaced, nor suffer any waste.\" Lease at 4, \u00b6 11A, as amended by paragraph 3 of Addendum A,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is undisputed that defendant nonetheless made significant alterations to the Property during the course of its tenancy and has produced no evidence of consent for those alterations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 54-1, at \u00b6\u00b6 45-48, 50. Building permits filed with the Town of Rockland and identifying Smiths as the client include plans for new structural walls and ceilings, the addition of lab and sprinkler equipment, the removal of existing rooms, and the installation of rooftop HVAC equipment. Asked to anticipate the cost of putting the Property \"back into a state ready to hand over to the land lord,\" defendant's site coordinator Dennis Sullivan observed, \"There has been much work done to the facility over the years in regards to walls being put up and taken down, electrical additions, and the entire second floor being redone.\" Docket # 50, at 6-7 (email response, dated February 18, 2015, to defendant's \"Director of Operations Transformation\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (notes of defendant's in-house counsel Shoua Xiong, dated January 22, 2015, describing \"significant alterations\" to Rockland facility);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket # 40-3, at 22. The parties agree that these alterations occurred during the effective period of the Lease but disagree as to whether written consent was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As the expiration of the Lease approached, Gallo made multiple attempts to address the alterations with Smiths.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 50, at 8-9 (July 22, 2015 email from Gallo to defendant stating, \"there is also the question of returning the building to it's [sic] original state. we [sic] need to discuss this as well.\"); Docket # 51, at 14 (August 11, 2015 email from Gallo to Xiong stating, \"I do need to speak to Dennis [Sullivan] in regards to returning the condition of the property to its original status and repairs of the windows, which need attention asap.\"). Defendant initially appeared amenable,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket # 50, at 8 (July 23, 2015 email from Xiong to Gallo responding, \"With respect to returning the building to its original state, we'd greatly appreciate it if you could do a walk-through of the building with Ricco [Feudo, Facilities Supervisor] sometime next week and identify any modifications you'd like us to make so that we can get the work underway as soon as possible.\"), but ultimately disavowed responsibility under the Lease. Docket # 51, at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Parking Lot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to the unauthorized alterations, plaintiff complains of the condition in which defendant left the Property's parking lot. The parties agree that the parking lot had not been replaced since its 1985 installation and sustained extensive damage during the historic snowfall of 2013-2014. Defendant had asked in 2013 that the lot be resurfaced, and plaintiff included in the final Lease addendum a provision that it would finance the resurfacing if defendant renewed the Lease. The Lease required defendant to perform maintenance and repairs but ascribed responsibility for capital expenditures other than those expressly included in the Lease to plaintiff. Although the parties now disagree as to whether the lot resurfacing resulted from defendant's failure of maintenance or was appropriately plaintiff's capital expenditure, neither ultimately bore the cost, as described below.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The complaint also claims damages as to glass replacement for clouded windows, but the parties agreed at the motion hearing on November 9, 2017, to settle that claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Sale of the Property to Third-Party Buyer\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    When it became apparent that defendant would not renew the Lease, plaintiff engaged the brokerage services of James\n    Rader, as owner of Rader Properties, to secure a new tenant. Although Rader identified prospective tenants, none were interested in leasing the Property in its present condition, and plaintiff concluded that the cost of restoration was prohibitive. Plaintiff ultimately negotiated a sale with a Rader-owned entity called 160 Weymouth LLC (\"Buyer\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The Addendum to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 4, 2016, includes the following language:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    55.\n    <em>\n     Acknowledgment of Purchase Price Adjustment.\n    </em>\n    Buyer and Seller agree that the purchase price of the premises has been adjusted to reflect an estimated repair or replacement cost of the parking lot in the amount of $200,000.00 and demolition of existing leasehold improvements in the amount of $200,000.00. $3,700,000.00 is the agreed upon sale price.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The Offer to Purchase similarly quantifies the Purchase Price as below:\n   </p>\n   <pre id=\"p-24\">Purchase Price: $4,100,000 Gross Purchase Price ($200,000) Deduct parking lot replacement ($200,000) Deduct deferred maintenance &amp; demo expenses __________ $3,700,000 Net Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer all cash at closing. In no event shall Buyer be obligated to pay more than the Net Purchase Price.</pre>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    After closing on the Property in October 2016, Buyer spent about $140,000 to resurface the parking lot. Buyer also spent about $25,000 on demolition work, and anticipates that additional demolition will be necessary to render rentable the one-third of the Property that remains vacant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    While the sale of the Property was still pending, plaintiff brought this action in state court, alleging essentially that defendant's breaches of the Lease resulted in damages and/or diminished the value of the Property. Defendant removed the case to federal court on September 29, 2016, and now moves for summary judgment on all counts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <strong>\n     II. Legal Standard\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ.

Breach of Contract (Count I)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The parties agreed at the motion hearing on November 9, 2017, that because the property has sold, diminution in value is the appropriate measure of damages, but they part ways as to evidence thereof. In support of its argument that it would have achieved a higher purchase price for the property had defendant not breached, plaintiff points to three main pieces of evidence: (1) the estimated cost of repairs, citing to bids for the interior restoration and parking lot resurfacing,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Docket # 41, at 18; Docket # 53; (2) buyer's opinion\n    that the condition of the parking lot and interior build-outs hampered efforts to market the Property and reduced the final purchase price,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Docket # 41, at 19; Docket # 40-8, at 28:1-7, 61:3-62:11; and (3) Gallo's testimony that he reduced the price of the Property by $400,000, his estimate of the cost of repairs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20; Docket # 52, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Defendant maintains that plaintiff's claims must fail because plaintiff sold the Property for $3.7 million without incurring any restoration costs, and has thus sustained no damages. Docket # 39, at 11. Pointing to its expert appraisal of the property at $3.4 million at the time it vacated in July 2015, defendant contends that plaintiff has created no genuine issue of fact that it suffered harm as a result of any breach.\n    <em>\n     See id.;\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    SOF \u00b6 34.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    I consider in turn each of plaintiff's pieces of evidence beginning with the bids submitted estimating the cost of repairs. Plaintiff cites both to the bid of Tarbox Construction and to that of the property management company hired by defendant for the period after it vacated but before the expiration of the Lease. As to the former, Tarbox estimated that the interior restoration would cost $369,150, exclusive of parking lot resurfacing estimated at an additional $202,190. Defendant's property management company estimated $116,828.99 for the interior restoration, and an additional $175,000 for the parking lot.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff has introduced no evidence, however, illustrating the relationship between the cost of repairs and the Property's value. As other courts have noted, \"[t]his relationship (if any) is shaky indeed. Restoring property to its pre-injury condition may eliminate the depreciation in its fair market value which results from the injury. It by no means follows, however, that the cost of repairing the property will coincide with the amount of depreciation caused by the injury.\"\n    <em>\n     Williams-Bowman Rubber Co. v. Indus.

The same analysis applies here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Plaintiff maintains, however, that the buyer's testimony that he or prospective tenants would have paid more for better maintained property is probative of diminution in value. Asked whether defendant's interior build-out and conversion to lab and office space adversely impacted the marketability of the Property, the buyer-who had also served as plaintiff's broker-responded, \"Most tenants don't have a vision of what it could look like ... So I would say for most tenants though, the envisioning what it could look like, it was a challenge with all of the rooms and office build-out in the warehouse. Most of the tenants that came looking at the building were looking for warehouse, not office space.\" Docket # 40-8, at 60-62. He believed that the condition of the parking lot also had an adverse impact, and ultimately spent $140,000 to have it resurfaced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    But plaintiff confronts the same causation problem with the buyer's testimony as with evidence on cost of repairs above. The buyer's testimony does not amount to evidence that the purchase price was diminished, and the plaintiff thus harmed, by defendant's purported breach. Rather, buyer states that the $3.7 million purchase price reflected no reduction negotiated due either to interior alterations or to the parking lot.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 9-12 (\"Q. When you acquired the property for 3.7 million dollars you weren't getting a discount because of, for example, parking lot replacement or demolition of existing leasehold improvements; is that correct? ... A. Correct, correct.\"). In contrast, buyer did specifically request a purchase price credit for failing HVAC units whose repair he anticipated would cost about $7,500.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 36.\n    <em>\n     Cf\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     349 W.

Gallo concedes having included the price adjustment paragraph for the purposes of this lawsuit. And although he contends that the original asking price for the Property was $4.2 million, plaintiff offers neither a listing corroborating that fact nor a market analysis supporting that value. Buyer's subsequent ability to obtain a $4.6 million mortgage on the Property, has no bearing on its fair market value at the time of sale, and even less on what the fair market value would have been absent any purported breaches. Gallo's statement that the Property was sold \"on a distress basis and at a price which I do not believe reflected the true value of the property,\" Docket # 52, at \u00b6 18, is insufficient to create a dispute of fact as to diminution in value.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Correia v.

The record is undeveloped as to what about the Property's \"as-is\" condition deterred prospective tenants, and as to what actual damage plaintiff thereby incurred. Plaintiff points to no otherwise comparable properties commanding a higher sale price\n    for want of such alterations and has submitted no expert report to refute defendant's appraisal. Because plaintiff has thus adduced no evidence of damages which a reasonable jury could attribute to defendant, defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Count I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     C.
