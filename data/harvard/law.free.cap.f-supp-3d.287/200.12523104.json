(Compl. (Dkt. 1).) Plaintiffs are professional models who state that they earn their livelihood selling their images to companies, magazines, and individuals for advertising purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-16, 19.) Defendants Summit Entertainment Corp. (\"Summit\") and Phillip Tricolla allegedly own and operate Gentlemen's Quarters, a strip club in Baldwin, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) Although the initial complaint filed by Plaintiffs contained eight alleged causes of action (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-136), Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 1, 2017, limiting their claims to just two causes of action: false endorsement under \u00a7 43 of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and deceptive trade practices under New York's Deceptive Trade Practices Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law (\"NYGBL\") \u00a7 349. (Am. Compl. (Dkt. 10) \u00b6\u00b6 87-103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Not. of Mot. to Dismiss the Compl. (Dkt. 13) ), and Plaintiffs opposed the motion (Pl. Opp'n to Mot (\"Pls. Br.\") (Dkt. 13-2) ). By Order dated April 27, 2017, the court referred Defendants' motion to dismiss (the \"Motion\") to Magistrate Judge Steven L. Tiscione for a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\") pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1). (Apr. 27, 2017, Order.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 18, 2018, Judge Tiscione issued an R &amp; R recommending that the\n   court grant the Motion in part and deny it in part. (R &amp; R (Dkt. 15) at 1.) The R &amp; R recommended that the court dismiss Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages under the Lanham Act as punitive damages are unavailable under that law, and that the court dismiss the Section 349 claims brought by plaintiffs Guerra, Koren, and Toth as time-barred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Otherwise, the R &amp; R recommended that the court deny the Motion: The R &amp; R concluded that all plaintiffs had stated a claim of false endorsement under the Lanham Act (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-13) and that the plaintiffs whose claims were not time-barred had stated a claim of deceptive practices under NYGBL Section 349 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-29). Crucially, the R &amp; R found that the complaint's allegation of consumer confusion was sufficient to state a claim under Section 349, endorsing the \"minority\" view on this question. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The R &amp; R also recommended the denial of the motion to dismiss the punitive damages request under Section 349 and the denial of the motion to dismiss the Lanham Act claim against defendant Tricolla in his individual capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants subsequently filed an objection to the R &amp; R. (Defs. Obj. to R &amp; R (\"Defs. Obj.\") (Dkt. 16).) Defendants do not object to the R &amp; R's recommendation that the court dismiss the state-law claims of plaintiffs Guerra, Koren, and Toth, nor do they object to the recommendation that the court dismiss Plaintiffs' punitive damages claims under the Lanham Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) They also do not object to the R &amp; R's recommendation that the court deny their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims against Summit under the Lanham Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) They do, however, object to the R &amp; R's recommendation that the court deny their motion to dismiss the timely Section 349 claims, as well as the R &amp; R's recommendation that the court deny their motion to dismiss the Lanham Act claim based on personal liability against Tricolla. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Plaintiffs did not file an objection to the R &amp; R, but they did respond to Defendants' objections. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Resp. &amp; Opp'n to Defs. Obj. (\"Pls. Resp. &amp; Opp'n\") (Dkt. 19).) For the reasons discussed below, Defendants' objections are SUSTAINED IN PART and OVERRULED IN PART and Judge Tiscione's R &amp; R is ADOPTED IN PART and REJECTED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court assumes familiarity with the facts of the case, and adopts the summary of the relevant factual allegations included in the R &amp; R. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 2-3.) In brief, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants appropriated Plaintiffs' likenesses by altering photographs of Plaintiffs and using them in social media advertisements for Defendants' strip club. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-86.) Plaintiffs claim that they did not consent to and were not paid for the use of their images. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-63.) Plaintiffs further claim that Defendants left some of these advertisements on their social media pages for months after Defendants were put on notice of the misappropriations by the filing of this lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring Defendants to cease using Plaintiffs' images to promote the club, as well as compensatory damages, punitive damages, and costs and attorneys' fees.

(R &amp; R at 5-13.) Defendants admit that they do not agree with this part of the R &amp; R, but they declined to challenge it at this stage in the proceedings. (Defs. Obj. at 1-2.) The court reviews this portion of the R &amp; R for clear error. The court believes it was not clear error for the R &amp; R to allow Plaintiffs' claims under the Lanham Act to proceed, and the court accordingly DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss these claims. The court separately addresses the question of Defendant Tricolla's individual liability under the Lanham Act below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The R &amp; R also recommended that the court strike Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages under the Lanham Act on the grounds that such a remedy is not available under this law. (R &amp; R at 31-33.) Plaintiffs did not file an objection to this recommendation. The court reviews this portion of the R &amp; R for clear error. The court believes this recommendation was not clear error, and the court accordingly STRIKES Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages under the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants object to the R &amp; R's recommendation that the court allow Plaintiffs' non-time-barred claims under Section 349 to proceed. (Defs. Obj. at 3 (citing R &amp; R at 21-28).) Following\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the court REJECTS this portion of the R &amp; R and DISMISSES Plaintiffs' claims under Section 349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As Judge Tiscione states, a plaintiff bringing a claim under Section 349 needs to allege: \"(1) the act or practice was consumer-oriented; (2) the act or practice was misleading in a material respect; and (3) the plaintiff was injured as a result.\" (R &amp; R at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spagnola v. Chubb Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675970\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/64/#p74\">\n    574 F.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (2d Cir. 2009) ).) A non-consumer plaintiff bringing a claim under Section 349 must allege that the defendant's actions \"harmed consumers or the public interest in [a] material respect.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stadt v. Fox News Network LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082934\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/719/312/#p323\">\n    719 F.Supp.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 323 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (Scheindlin, J.). Defendants argue that, pursuant to this rule, Plaintiffs' Section 349 claim must be dismissed because courts do not recognize \"consumer confusion\" as a cognizable injury under Section 349. (Defs. Obj. at 3.) The R &amp; R rejects this so-called \"majority rule,\" instead stating that a non-consumer plaintiff bringing a trademark-infringement claim under Section 349 need not allege a specific and substantial injury to the public interest, thus espousing a more lenient requirement that would allow Plaintiffs' claims to proceed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 13, 21-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While the court appreciates Judge Tiscione's exhaustive and illuminating look at the text, history, and theory of Section 349 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-21), the R &amp; R goes too far in writing off the so-called \"majority rule.\" The R &amp; R departs from the majority of courts by stating that \"consumer confusion ... is a sufficiently consumer-directed harm under [ Section 349 ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) This conclusion is in error for two reasons: First, the R &amp; R should not have ignored state-law precedent on Section 349 and wrongly attempted to divine how the New York Court of Appeals would rule on this matter. Second, even setting aside controlling state-law precedent on this question, the R &amp; R gave too little weight to the large majority of federal courts that have interpreted Section 349 as requiring plaintiffs to allege more than consumer confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Harm Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Majority Rule in State Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The primary reason the court must reject the part of Judge Tiscione's R &amp; R\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   dealing with liability under Section 349 is that the R &amp; R writes off controlling state-law precedent and inserts its own view of the law instead.

The court is thus unconvinced that either\n   <em>\n    Casper Sleep\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Burberry\n   </em>\n   upended settled New York law in favor of the minority view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Edmondson v.

(Pls. Resp. &amp; Opp'n at 2-7.) Plaintiffs appear to be reading Judge Caproni's statement from the bench that the plaintiffs' success in that case \"depends on whether plaintiffs can prove that the misrepresentations were actually materially misleading and that plaintiffs were actually injured\" as obviating the requirement of showing harm to the public interest beyond consumer confusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (quoting Transcript of Oral Argument at 34,\n   <em>\n    Edmondson\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-2242 (VEC) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2017) ).) The court is unconvinced that Judge Caproni's statement was intended to categorically restrict the harm requirement to cases alleging actual trademark infringement. But even if it was, the court simply disagrees with that reading of the law, as stated throughout this opinion: In cases brought under Section 349, plaintiffs must allege harm to the public interest beyond consumer confusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   One district court opinion does not suffice to overrule a long-standing and persuasive body of law establishing that, in order for Plaintiffs to succeed on their claim, they must allege harm to the public beyond mere confusion. Since they do not, the court must dismiss their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   All told, neither the R &amp; R nor Plaintiffs' briefing contains persuasive evidence that that the Court of Appeals would choose to upset the majority rule were it to rule on the matter. Instead, the court today predicts that the Court of Appeals would continue to follow the common understanding of Section 349 and find that consumer confusion is not a harm to the public interest sufficient to support a claim under this law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiffs allege that the publication of their images \"was misleading in a material respect because it created the impression that Plaintiffs were strippers working at the Clubs, or endorsed the Clubs.\" (Am.

Givens, Practice Commentary, NYGBL \u00a7 349 (McKinney 1988) ) ). It bears noting, as Defendants point out, that the New York Court of Appeals' continued approval of the Commentary means that \"the [C]ommentary should be viewed as a persuasive authority when considering how the Court of Appeals would interpret Section 349.\" (Defs. Obj. at 9 (collecting cases).) Citing the line in the Commentary that it would be \"contrary to the history of the statutes\" to allow pendent federal jurisdiction over Section 349 claims where Lanham Act claims are already present, the R &amp; R says that the Commentary is wrong to suggest that trademark disputes should not be allowed to arise under Section 349. (R &amp; R at 22 (quoting Givens, Practice Commentary).) But that is not what the commentary suggests, and besides, many courts have allowed trademark disputes brought under Section 349 to proceed.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    Eric E. Bensen, New York Intellectual Property Law \u00a7 3[2], at 415 &amp; n.31 (2018 ed. 2017) (collecting cases). In any case, the R &amp; R's issues with the Commentary are not enough to upset the common understanding of Section 349.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The broad sweep of this conclusion is due in part to the fact that courts do not distinguish among causes of action stating claims under Section 349.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
