Dkt. # 18. Plaintiff Ancora Technologies, Inc. (\"Ancora\") opposes the Motion. Dkt. # 30. Having considered the submissions of the parties, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that oral argument is unnecessary. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Dkt. # 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A. It was issued on June 25, 2002 and a reexamination certificate was issued on June 1, 2010. The '941 Patent purports to improve on prior art by providing a different method of identifying and restricting an unauthorized software program's operation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C411%2C941\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C411%2C941\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The license verification \"key\" is stored in a computer's \"Basic Input/Output System\" (\"BIOS\"). The patent specification states that the level of programming expertise needed to alter the contents of a computer's BIOS without accidentally damaging it is very high, making it harder for a hacker to tamper with the \"key\" when it is stored in the BIOS as opposed to other storage areas. This method also makes use of the existing computer hardware, which eliminates the expense and inconvenience of using additional hardware.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C411%2C941\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Independent Claim 1 of the '941 Patent claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1.

Cir. 2014). Thus, Ancora's argument that the claims at issue are directed toward an improvement in computer functionality because the interaction between a verification structure within the BIOS and the program is a novel method to check licensing is better considered in step two of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ancora's argument that the placement of the verification structure in the BIOS constitutes\n   an improvement in how computers function is also unpersuasive. The claims of the '941 Patent are not focused on how usage of the BIOS to store the verification structure leads to an improvement in computer security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Erie Indem. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277922\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/1315/#p1327\">\n    850 F.3d 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Instead, the claim calls for the set-up of the verification structure data in the erasable, non-volatile memory of the BIOS, a memory that is typically used to store data. The ease or difficulty of altering this data does not change its function, or represent an improvement in its function. Further, Ancora's reliance on a comparison to the claims in\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   does not support its argument. In\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   , the patents were specifically directed to a self-referential table for a computer database rather than simply focusing on the individual functions performed by that self-referential table, i.e. storing, organizing, and retrieving memory in a logical table.\n   <em>\n    Enfish, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1335\">\n    822 F.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the claim at issue refers to \"using an agent to set up a verification structure in the erasable, non-volatile memory of the BIOS,\" it provides no other details regarding how the agent sets up the structure, the structure itself (other than it must accommodate data that includes at least one license record), or other details as to how this structure within the BIOS creates an improvement in computer function. Reading the claims as a whole it is apparent that their focus is on the abstract concept of selecting a program, verifying whether the program is licensed, and acting on the program according to the verification. The requirement that the verification \"key\" be placed as data within the BIOS memory is at best a limitation of the invention, and does not make the concept of the claims any less abstract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ancora's argument that the patent at issue was not rejected by a patent examiner as directed to an abstract idea and was certified after re-examination in 2010, is similarly unpersuasive. All patents must be approved by an examiner at the USPTO in order to become a patent. The fact that these patents were not rejected by an examiner is not enough to support its argument that the patents are directed to a patent-eligible concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ancora argues that, like the claims in\n   <em>\n    Bascom\n   </em>\n   , in this case, \"an inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\"\n   <em>\n    Bascom Glob.Internet Servs., Inc. v.

Cir. 2016). The '941 Patent claim 1 recites using an agent to software licensing verification structure in the BIOS, and then actually verifying a program using that verification structure. Ancora asserts that these two elements of the claim are a non-conventional arrangement of known, conventional\n   pieces. However, it is unclear how the interaction between these two elements constitutes an inventive concept. Nothing in Claim 1 or the other limitations in the '941 Patent sufficiently recite how the use of an agent to place the structure in the BIOS, or placing and using such a structure in the BIOS leads to an improvement in computer functionality. Specifying that the BIOS be used to house the verification structure is not sufficiently transformative so as to make this innovation more than a requirement that a generic computer to perform generic computer functions. Storing data in the memory of a computer component that generally stores data is not transformative. The Court disagrees that these limitations transform the abstract idea into something patent-eligible in application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ancora also argues that the method claimed is patent-eligible because it passes the \"machine-or-transformation\" test. \"A claimed process can be patent-eligible under \u00a7 101 if: '(1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p715\">\n    772 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   716 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Bilski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3857791\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/943/#p954\">\n    545 F.3d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 954 (Fed.

Here, the claimed process fails the second prong of the machine-or-transformation test. Placing a verification structure within the BIOS does not transform it into a \"different state or thing\". As mentioned above, storage of data in a pre-existing memory location that typically stores data does not create a different entity, just as \"[a]dding a computer to otherwise conventional steps does not make an invention patent-eligible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, as the '941 Patent claims are directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
