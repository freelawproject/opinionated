Plaintiff Joshua Verde is a lawyer representing a commercial airline pilot, Kevin Johnson, who developed a conflict with Defendant Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concerning his medical fitness to fly. Arguing that the FAA withheld documents when answering his FOIA request, Verde sued the FAA in August 2016. (Doc. No. 1.) In April 2017, Verde moved for summary judgment, requesting an order compelling full disclosure as well as attorney's fees. (Doc. No. 12.) The FAA then filed its own motion for summary judgment, asserting that it had fully complied and thereby mooted the case. (Doc. No. 17.) Based on careful consideration of the parties' arguments and applicable law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Verde's Motion for Summary Judgment,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the FAA's Motion for Summary Judgment, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Verde's request for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Verde filed his FOIA request on May 5, 2016. (Doc. No. 13-1.) The FAA farmed out portions of his request to various offices, all but one of which responded promptly and completely. (Doc. No. 28 at 1-2.) The one exception was the Southern Region office of the Aerospace Medicine Division (ASO-300). (Doc. No. 17 at 1-2.) Dr. Susan Northrup, a Regional Flight Surgeon for the FAA, handled the request on behalf of ASO-300. On June 16, 2016, the office produced ten responsive pages and told Verde that 27 pages were withheld. (Doc. No. 13-2 at 1-2.) Verde then filed an administrative appeal on July 13. (Doc. No. 13-5.) On August 12, the FAA acknowledged his appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [This] email acknowledges receipt of you[r] July 13, 2016 FOIA appeal.... I apologize for the delay in sending this email, but as Ms. McLean communicated to you several times, we are shorthanded and working through a backlog. As you are aware, we must work appeals in the order they were received and there are a number being worked that were received before this one. Rest assured that your client's appeal will be worked in the order it was received as expeditiously as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Verde then filed this lawsuit on August 31. (Doc. No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Verde and the FAA carried on negotiations during the litigation. Each side had problems with the other. In the FAA's view, Verde's document request was overly broad, entailing the review and production of thousands of emails. (Doc. No. 28 at 5.) Moreover, privacy issues prevented the production of certain documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In Verde's view, it was improper for Dr. Northrup to conduct the document search on behalf of her office, because he was seeking documents that directly implicated her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also faulted the FAA for not sending his request to a different doctor, Michael Berry, whose records Verde also sought. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   These negotiations nevertheless did move the document production forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 3, 2017, the FAA produced another 42 pages of documents, as well as a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 13-6.) Verde was still unsatisfied, however, for several reasons: his concern about Dr. Northrup's involvement; the failure to obtain records from Dr. Berry; and his possession of FAA emails responsive to his original request that FAA should have but had not yet produced. (Doc. No. 27 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Consequently, Verde filed a motion for summary judgment on April 4, 2017. (Doc. No. 12 &amp; 13.) On April 11, the FAA internal appeals system remanded Verde's appeal to ASO-300 and provided instructions for a further search. (Doc. No. 16-3 at 14.) On April 27, the Southern Region office made another substantial document production: 154 pages of documents, all but ten of which were new, and a second\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19.) The FAA then filed its own motion for summary judgment, arguing that production was complete and the case should be dismissed. (Doc. No. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This sequence of events looks distinctly different from each party's vantage point. In Verde's view, the FAA did not want to produce these documents. Had he not pursued his FOIA request vigorously, only ten pages of responsive documents would have been produced, and the remainder would remain secret. In particular, he sees his motion for summary judgment as the catalytic event. Coming eight months after his lawsuit and nearly a year after his original request, it pried loose a trove of documents that the FAA would not have otherwise released. (Doc. No. 27 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Verde attributes the FAA's reticence to the nature of the documents he sought. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) He believed the records would show \"inappropriate communications between private business entities and an FAA regional flight surgeon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Verde also believed that an FAA employee-evidently Dr. Northrup-\"was 'doing the bidding' of a private corporation,\" which resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As he sees it, his FOIA request \"was necessary to determine the extent of the breach of privacy and whether the FAA employee(s) were engaged in a practice of publicly disclosing protected medical information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Throughout this litigation, however, these allegations have remained unsubstantiated. Verde has not presented any evidence of wrongful behavior, and it does not appear that the records he obtained through his FOIA request evince it either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the FAA's view, its internal processes worked as designed. \"FAA never changed its position or altered its conduct because of Plaintiff's lawsuit.\" (Doc. No. 28 at 9.) Verde's summary judgment motion was not the key event; the FAA's remand of Verde's appeal and subsequent search were the key events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FAA also argues that Verde is himself to blame for delays. One cause was the privacy problem, which required Verde's client to sign a release so that documents with personal health information could be released to Verde. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Verde could have avoided this by obtaining a release at the outset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Another crucial cause of delay was the poor wording of Verde's original document request. (Doc. No. 28 at 5.) Item # 1 of Verde's request asked for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   All emails sent to or from the email account of Dr. Susan Northrup (susan.northrup-md@faa.gov) that meet\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the following criteria:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   - Date range: October 1, 2015 to Present;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   - Sent to or from the wnco.com domain;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   - Reference \"Kevin Johnson\" in the subject or body of the message;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   - Reference [an identifying number] in the subject or body of the message; and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   - Contain the word \"concerns\" in the subject of the message.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Doc. No. 13-1 at 1.) Perhaps inadvertently, the scope of this request was exceptionally broad. Verde asked for all emails meeting \"any\" criteria, one of which was simply a lengthy date range. This led the FAA to tell Verde during their negotiations in February that approximately 13,000 documents were responsive to his request. (Doc. No. 13 at 3.) As the FAA sees it, Verde is responsible for the resulting confusion and delay. For months, Verde maintained that the FAA was withholding thousands of pages of responsive documents, but in fact, he had simply drafted a document request much more inclusive than necessary. (Doc. No. 28 at 5, 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court must decide whether the FAA has met its burden, first, of showing that it has made a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents and, second, of proving that withheld information is exempt from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The declaration of Shiela Gibson, Medical Program Analyst at the FAA, is the agency's main evidence showing that it made a sufficient search. (Doc. No. 16 at 10.) Gibson worked at ASO-300 and processed Verde's FOIA request after FAA management remanded it to ASO-300 in April 2017. (Doc. No. 16-1 at 1-4.) This is the search that yielded the 154-page production later that month. Gibson explained her search methodology as follows. For Item # 1, Dr. Northrup's emails, she says:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The initial search of Dr. Northrup's emails, as requested by sub-item # 1(a) of the FOIA request that required production of all emails from \"October 1, 2015 to present,\" would have required the production and review of thousands of emails, which would be unduly burdensome. Therefore the email search was limited to the parameters specified in sub-items b, c and d of item # 1 which provided sufficient precision to narrow the request and allow this Office to locate the responsive documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Verde construes Gibson's declaration as an admission by the FAA that \"it narrowed the scope of its search to deal with the burden of conducting the search.\" (Doc. No. 18 at 5.) In his view, because the FAA had acknowledged thousands of emails were responsive to the FOIA request, FAA's production of only 154 pages is unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Such self-limiting by an agency should not free the agency of its obligations under FOIA and certainly should not entitle it to relief via summary judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The adequacy of FAA's search is measured by a standard of reasonableness, with the Court looking at the relevant circumstances and for reasonable specificity in the agency's declarations. Two aspects of the case's circumstances are worth noting. The first is the unwitting overbreadth of Verde's original FOIA request. He asked for all of Dr. Northrup's emails over a lengthy period. It seems that his request swept in thousands of responsive documents due to this unintentionally wide-ranging construction. The second relevant circumstance is that, in Verde's original request, he indicated an unwillingness to pay high costs of production: \"I am willing to pay a reasonable fee for FOIA processing, but request that you notify me immediately if the anticipated fees exceed $500.\" (Doc. No. 13-1 at 1.) Taken together, these circumstances justify the narrowing that Gibson and ASO-300 did upon remand of the case in April 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The FAA has supplied the reasonably detailed declaration that the law requires, and it bears no indicia of bad faith or inadequacy. Moreover, Verde has not identified any real deficiencies in the search process that Gibson conducted in April 2017. Therefore, the FAA has met its burden of establishing that its search was reasonably calculated to produce all relevant documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As for the FAA's withholding, the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index accompanying FAA's production in April 2017 constitutes the agency's case that its redactions are valid. (Doc. No. 16-2.) The index lists emails one by one, providing dates, senders, recipients, descriptions of redacted information, and FOIA exemptions justifying redaction. A typical entry in the index indicates that, located at page 35 of the production, a one-page email from \"Northrup, Susan MD (FAA)\" to \"Marshall, Taneesha (FAA)\" was sent on April 14, 2016 at 9:30 AM. It bore the subject, \"Re: Kevin Johnson-3/30/16 Ltr from Atty Goldstein,\" and contained redacted info described as \"Follow up with FAA Atty on subject letter; Legal advise regarding letter.\" Exemption 5, including the deliberative-process privilege, attorney work-product privilege, and attorney-client privilege, justified the redaction. The index contains such entries for eighteen redactions. FAA cites Exemption 5's various privileges for six of the eighteen and Exemption 6, \"Privacy Information-Non-work phone number,\" for the other twelve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To rule in the FAA's favor, the Court must determine that the agency's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index \"sufficiently identif[ies] the documents at issue, including the relevant information contained in each document, and explain[s] why the asserted exemptions justify withholding.\"\n   <em>\n    Batton I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222690\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/169/#p175\">\n    598 F.3d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Batton\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit ruled against the Internal Revenue Service after it withheld documents containing third-party taxpayer information. IRS offered only a \"general description\" of the withheld documents, saying nothing \"about the individual documents and why more general information-for example, the dates, authors, or brief description of the subject matter of the notes and information-cannot be disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222690\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/169/#p175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222690\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/169/#p175\">\n    at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, FAA seems mostly to have redacted documents, not completely withheld them, and its index\n   has all the features that the Fifth Circuit faulted the government for not providing in\n   <em>\n    Batton\n   </em>\n   . The FAA here clears the threshold the IRS did not reach there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Verde's sole argument on the issue of redactions is the same one described above-his entitlement to the supposed thousands of documents that FAA identified but did not produce. As noted above, Verde argues that the FAA \"self-limited\" its search and has failed to explain its refusal to produce these documents. (Doc. No. 18 at 7.) Again, these documents appear responsive to Verde's initial FOIA request only in the sense that his request reached them inadvertently, not in the sense that they actually relate to his client. Beyond these assertions, Verde provides no reasons to believe that the exemptions in the April production's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index are inapplicable or overbroad. Likewise, Verde makes no objection to the redactions in FAA's February 2017 production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the FAA has produced a sufficiently specific\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index that Verde has not persuasively criticized, the FAA has adequately demonstrated that the information withheld here is indeed exempt from disclosure. Based on that showing, and on the FAA's showing that it conducted a reasonable search, the FAA is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. ATTORNEY's FEES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Though the FAA is entitled to summary judgment, it still may be that Verde should receive attorney's fees. Under FOIA, the district court \"may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under [FOIA] in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(E)(i). A complainant can be eligible for attorney's fees even if the district court rules in favor of the government. Eligibility turns on whether the complainant \"substantially prevailed,\" which may happen either through \"a judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree\" in the complainant's favor, or through \"a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency, if the complainant's claim is not insubstantial.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(E)(ii).

Cir. 1984) (\"\n   <em>\n    Weisberg II\n   </em>\n   \"). \"Although an agency cannot prevent an award of attorneys' fees simply by releasing the requested information without requiring the complainant to obtain a court order, the mere filing of the complaint and the subsequent release of the documents is insufficient to establish causation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"593091,3804036\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1476/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The statute says that the district court \"may\" assess attorney's fees, rather than directing that it \"shall\" assess fees. Accordingly, the district court must determine not only whether a complainant is eligible for fees, but also whether he is entitled to them. Entitlement turns on the balancing of four factors: \"(1) the benefit to the public deriving from the case; (2) the commercial benefit to the complainant; (3) the nature of the complainant's interest in the records sought; and (4) whether the government's withholding of the records had a reasonable basis in law.\"\n   <em>\n    Batton II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049619\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/522/#p525\">\n    718 F.3d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No. 28 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A resort to case law shows that the FAA has the better argument.

As to that part, the FAA explained to Verde the issues that would prevent timely and complete production, in contrast to the silence of the agency in\n   <em>\n    Batton\n   </em>\n   . The FAA then worked with him to resolve privacy issues implicated by his request and to narrow his request to an appropriate scope. The contrast is clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   While the question is close, the evidence in the record and the comparisons to prior cases lead the Court to conclude that Verde did not substantially prevail for the purposes of FOIA's fee-shifting provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Entitlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even if Verde were considered a substantially prevailing party, the four-factor balancing test for determining entitlement to fees is not in his favor. As noted, those factors are: (1) the benefit to the public deriving from the case; (2) the commercial benefit to the complainant; (3) the nature of the complainant's interest in the records sought; and (4) whether the government's withholding of the records had a reasonable basis in law. Taken together, the four factors indicate that a fee award is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has said that the first factor supports an award \"where the complainant's victory is likely to add to the fund of information that citizens may use in making vital political choices.\"\n   <em>\n    Blue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918048\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/529/#p534\">\n    570 F.2d at 533-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[It] does not particularly favor attorneys' fees where the award would merely subsidize a matter of private concern.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918048\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/529/#p534\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Verde's case is the latter type.

This distinction is important because, in a suit \"to advance private commercial interests,\" \"there is usually no need to award attorneys' fees to insure that the action will be brought. The private self-interest motive of, and often pecuniary benefit to, the complainant will be sufficient to insure the vindication of the rights given in the\n   FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Fenster v.

Cir. 1979) (quoting the Senate Report for FOIA). Both Verde and his client had adequate motive for the FOIA request independent of a fee award. Verde is representing a client in his professional capacity as an attorney. His client, in turn, seems to have been engaged in a dispute affecting his livelihood as a pilot. Each has the sort of \"private self-interest motive\" that courts see as sufficient incentive for FOIA requests absent the award of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has said of the fourth factor that \"attorneys' fees would be favored if an agency's nondisclosure was designed to avoid embarrassment or thwart the requester.\"\n   <em>\n    Blue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918048\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/529/#p534\">\n    570 F.2d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But if \"the government had a reasonable basis in law for concluding that the information in issue was exempt and [it was not] recalcitrant in its opposition to a valid claim or otherwise engaged in obdurate behavior,\" a fee award for the prevailing party is less appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Fenster\n   </em>\n   , 617 F.2d at 744 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cuneo v.

Privacy issues slowed its production of documents, as did the inadvertent overbreadth of Verde's request. Verde has a legitimate point that at least some of the documents produced in April 2017 could have been produced earlier, but that consideration tilts the scales in his favor only modestly. Setting that against the other three factors, the balance favors the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Verde, perhaps sensing his fate under the four factors, invites the Court to pursue a different analysis.

Even if the Court could, there are principled reasons to disagree with Judge Kavanaugh, who proposes either adopting the expansive interpretation of the Civil Rights Act's fee-shifting provision from\n   <em>\n    Newman v.

It has its origin in circuit decisions four decades old.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918048\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/529/#p534\">\n    570 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   532-34 ;\n   <em>\n    Cuneo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3526162,970837\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/553/1360/\">\n    553 F.2d at 1365-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those decisions drew sensible conclusions from the law's legislative history, which courts may consider with an appropriate skepticism but need not totally disregard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The four-factor test also tracks the preference for scholarly, journalistic, and other noncommercial FOIA requests over commercial requests reflected in the statute's fee structure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(ii) ; Laurence Tai,\n   <em>\n    Fast Fixes for FOIA\n   </em>\n   , 52 HARVARD J. ON LEGIS . 455, 470 (2015) (noting that \"the statute places the least priority on record requests 'for commercial use' by charging them the highest fees\"). Judge Kavanaugh thus erred in his characterization of FOIA as \"an equal-opportunity disclosure statute\" that \"treats all requests and requesters the same,\" which was central to his call for alternative approaches.\n   <em>\n    Morley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055061,3664734\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/689/\">\n    719 F.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Judge Kavanaugh's proposals also appear imprudent in light of the fact that commercial actors comprise a large majority of FOIA requesters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Margaret B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Kwoka,\n   <em>\n    FOIA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 65 DUKE L.

Commercial requesters would therefore be the main beneficiaries of eliminating the first three or all of the four factors, as Judge Kavanaugh proposes. This would run contrary to the preference expressed elsewhere in the statute, as noted, while adding to the already onerous burdens that FOIA places on agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 473-76 (summarizing FOIA's high administrative and financial costs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The predominance of commercial actors among FOIA plaintiffs also distinguishes FOIA from the Civil Rights Act, which was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   , Judge Kavanaugh's favored analogue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n    390 U.S. at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n    88 S.Ct. 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Supreme Court said in that racial discrimination case, the Civil Rights Act faced \"difficult\" enforcement prospects, and private suits would serve \"to advance the public interest,\" thereby \"vindicating a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n    at 401-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n    88 S.Ct. 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is hard to say the same for FOIA. The law is used out of private commercial interest, like the private lawyer who uses FOIA to gain an advantage in negotiations over high-dollar government contracts (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuneo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3526162,970837\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/553/1360/\">\n    553 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1365-66 ), at least as often as it is used in the public interest, like the advocate who uses FOIA to uncover government misconduct on an issue of major public concern (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20398328\">\n    2012 WL 398328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (E.D. La. Feb. 7, 2012) ). When set against the statute's legislative history, expressed preferences, purposes, and uses, the compensation of commercial FOIA requesters is not a cause so pressing as to require discarding four decades of precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Adhering to that precedent, the Court concludes that Verde is not entitled to attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff Joshua Verde filed this action under the Freedom of Information Act and eventually obtained a substantial production of responsive documents. He appears to have represented his client ably and energetically. But because Verde has not shown any shortcoming in that production or any deficiency in the search process that yielded it, Defendant Federal Aviation Administration is entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly, the FAA's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 17) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Verde's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 12) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . On the issue of attorney's fees, Verde has established neither that he is eligible nor that he is entitled to them. Accordingly, the request for attorney's fees in his Motion for Summary Judgment, elaborated in his Memorandum in Support of Attorney's Fees and Costs (Doc. No. 27), is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    A\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    index is \"a common FOIA procedural device that lists the documents responsive to the request and explains why portions have been withheld.\"\n    <em>\n     Cooper Cameron Corp. v.
