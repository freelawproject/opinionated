(Dkt. 1). Specifically, Plaintiff claims that he was subjected to an unlawful arrest and criminal prosecution after engaging in protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Plaintiff asserts six claims pursuant to \u00a7 1983 against the Individual Defendants, and four common law claims against all Defendants. Plaintiff's common law claims against the City are premised upon the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 27).

Plaintiff was displeased with his treatment by police officials during these interactions, and claimed that Captain Leo had \"unlawfully confiscated\" some of his personal belongings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As a result, Plaintiff created a website and a Facebook page where he expressed various opinions regarding the City of Lackawanna, law enforcement officials, and various authority figures, including Captain Leo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The website was named \"Lackawanna, New York police corruption.\" (Dkt. 27-9 at 19 (Plaintiff's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Mun.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2050\">\n    N.Y.

Plaintiff also posted, \"you [referring to Captain Leo] and your disgusting pigpen at parasite hall are going to pay for your crime.\" (Dkt. 27-2 at \u00b6 16; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6 16). Plaintiff indicated that he was going to \"enjoy punishing [Captain Leo] and [y]our gang in every conceivable way.\" (Dkt. 27-2 at \u00b6 17; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27-10 at 19). Plaintiff also posted photographs of Captain Leo and called him vulgar and derogatory names, such as a \"psychopathic pig fucker.\" (Dkt. 27-10 at 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27-2 at \u00b6 15; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6 15). Plaintiff invited others to submit comments about Captain Leo online as well. (Dkt. 27-10 at 20). Plaintiff also testified that had Captain Leo read the posted statements, he \"might\" find them annoying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27-2 at \u00b6 18; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Captain Leo testified that he does not \"go on the websites,\" maintain a Facebook account, or frequent the Internet, and that it was an unidentified individual who initially brought these postings to his attention. (Dkt. 27-17 at 9-10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27-2 at \u00b6 22; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6 22). Captain Leo then approached Detective Lakso with a screenshot of one of Plaintiff's posts, and requested that Detective Lakso review the website and Facebook postings. (Dkt. 27-2\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). Detective Lakso reviewed the website and Facebook postings in Captain Leo's presence, and had Captain Leo review certain excerpts from the web pages. (Dkt. 27-17 at 9-11, 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Captain Leo testified that he believed the posted statements were annoying, harassing, and threatening. (Dkt. 27-17 at 22). Detective Lakso testified that, on previous occasions, he had filed criminal charges for aggravation in the second degree based upon communications transmitted over the Internet. (Dkt. 27-18 at 8-12). On January 2, 2014, Captain Leo lodged a criminal complaint with the City of Lackawanna Police Department, asserting allegations of aggravated harassment in the second degree. (Dkt. 27-2 at \u00b6 38; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6 38). Detective Lakso drafted the complaint and reviewed it with Captain Leo before he signed it. (Dkt. 27-18 at 14-15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27-14 (criminal complaint with attached screenshots) ). Detective Lakso completed a police report on the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27-14 (Detective Lakso's police report) ). Detective Lakso also submitted the criminal complaint for review by a state court judge. (Dkt. 27-18 at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 3, 2014, Lackawanna City Court Judge Frederic Marrano issued a warrant for Plaintiff's arrest pursuant to the provisions of the second degree aggravated harassment statute. (Dkt. 27-16). Subsequently, law enforcement officials in the Village of Angola, New York, arrested Plaintiff on April 30, 2014. (Dkt. 27-10 at 24-25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff appeared before Lackawanna City Court Judge Norman LeBlanc on May 1, 2014, where he entered a plea of not guilty. (Dkt. 27-2 at \u00b6 43; Dkt. 30-1 at \u00b6 43). On May 13, 2014, the New York Court of Appeals struck down the aggravated harassment in the second degree provision at issue as unconstitutionally vague under the New York State and Federal Constitutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

(Dkt. 1). Under the framework of \u00a7 1983, Plaintiff asserts claims for malicious prosecution (first cause of action), false arrest (second cause of action), failure to intercede to prevent an unconstitutional act (third cause of action), violation of his right to free speech (fourth cause of action), assault (fifth cause of action), and battery (sixth cause of action). (Dkt. 1 at 6-11). These claims are only asserted against the Individual Defendants. Under state common law principles, Plaintiff alleges companion claims for malicious prosecution (seventh cause of action), false arrest (eighth cause of action), assault (ninth cause of action), and battery (tenth cause of action). The common law claims are asserted against all Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants answered the complaint,\n   and raised a number of affirmative defenses, including the doctrine of qualified immunity. (Dkt. 3). After discovery was completed, Defendants filed the instant motion requesting that summary judgment be granted in their favor. (Dkt. 27). Plaintiff opposes the motion. (Dkt. 30).

Indeed, Defendants posit this as one reason to dismiss the claims asserted against the City. (Dkt. 27-23 at 7-10).
