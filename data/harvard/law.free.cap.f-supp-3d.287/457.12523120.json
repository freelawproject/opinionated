(together, \"KIND\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   seek dismissal of Plaintiffs' Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\"). Plaintiffs allege that KIND deceptively marketed its products as \"natural\" and \"non-GMO\" even though they contain synthetic and genetically modified ingredients. This Court previously stayed the \"natural\" claim. KIND now seeks to dismiss or stay the \"non-GMO\" claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Separately, Plaintiffs move to lift the stay of the \"natural\" claim. They assert that the Federal Drug Administration's (\"FDA\") rulemaking process to define the term \"natural\" has stalled since May 2016 when the agency closed its notice and comment period. Plaintiffs are eager to forge ahead on their \"natural\" claim in tandem with their \"non-GMO\" claim, and contend that indefinitely staying the \"natural\" claim will result in undue delay and prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, KIND's motion to dismiss or stay the \"non-GMO\" claim is granted in part and denied in part, and Plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay on the \"natural\" claim is denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Relevant Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss the Original Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 15, 2016, this Court granted in part KIND's motion to dismiss the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re KIND LLC \"Healthy and All Natural\" Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272417\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/689/\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2016). As an initial matter, this Court disposed of the original complaint's \"healthy\" claim after Plaintiffs stipulated to dismissing it. (ECF No. 74.) Invoking the primary jurisdiction doctrine, this Court stayed the \"all natural\" claim, finding that the FDA's rulemaking process should run its course before allowing that claim to proceed here. Finally, this Court dismissed without prejudice Plaintiff's \"non-GMO\" claim on the basis that it was insufficiently pled. Despite largely granting KIND's motion, this Court provided Plaintiffs with a further opportunity to re-plead their \"non-GMO\" claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    FDA Rulemaking Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2015, the FDA \"announc[ed] the establishment of a docket to receive information and comments on the use of the term 'natural' in the labeling of human food products, including foods that are genetically engineered or contain ingredients produced through the use of genetic engineering.\"\n   <em>\n    Use of the Term \"Natural\" in the Labeling of Human Food Products; Request for Information and Comments\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2069%2C905\">\n    80 Fed.

The notice and comment period ended in May 2016. Since then, the FDA has gone quiet, leaving various stakeholders with little clarity on the agency's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 15, 2016, the parties jointly provided a status report concerning the FDA's rulemaking process. (ECF No. 65.) Despite injecting their letter with competing interpretations of what the FDA might do, the parties acknowledged that the agency had not formally issued any guidance since closing its comment period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Executive Order Regarding Regulatory Rulemaking\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 24, 2017, the parties supplemented their joint status report (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 98.), informing this Court of President Trump's January 30, 2017 executive order titled, \" Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs\" (the \"Executive Order\").

While the Executive Order does not specifically reference the FDA's rulemaking process,\n   Plaintiffs in particular stressed that an Executive Order rooted in scaling back regulation could stymie the FDA's process of defining \"natural.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Executive Order essentially imposes new requirements on agency rulemaking. First, it directs agencies to identify \"at least two existing regulations to be repealed\" for every new regulation they seek to implement. (Executive Order \u00a7 2.) This requirement essentially offsets the cost of a new regulation by eliminating two old ones. Second, the Executive Order establishes an annual budgeting process to control the cumulative costs imposed by each agency's regulations. For 2017, it required the total cost of new regulations to be zero, unless an exception applied. (Executive Order \u00a7 2(b).) In 2018, the Executive Order directs each agency to have a budget that accounts for the reduction of costs imposed by their own regulations. (Executive Order \u00a7 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Allegations of the Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs re-allege the stayed \"natural\" claim and seek to cure the deficiencies previously identified in this Court's Opinion and Order underlying their \"non-GMO\" claim. The Amended Complaint devotes a section to addressing KIND's non-GMO marketing, alleging, among other things, that \"[t]esting completed on June 1, 2016 detected the presence of GMOs in at least some of [KIND's] Products ...\" and that at least one product tested \"positive [for] GMO soy from the ingredient soy protein isolate.\" (Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, ECF No. 84 (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In total, Plaintiffs assert nine different claims on behalf of a putative nationwide class and/or various state sub-classes: (1) breach of express warranty; (2) unjust enrichment or common law restitution; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4) violation of New York General Business Law (\"NY GBL\") \u00a7 349 ; (5) violation of NY GBL \u00a7 350 ; (6) violation of California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"; (7) violation of California's False Advertising Law (\"FAL\"); (8) violation of California's Unfair Competition Act (\"UCL\"); and (9) violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUPTA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The allegations in the Amended Complaint are presumed true, with all reasonable inferences drawn in Plaintiffs' favor, for purposes of KIND's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Rescuecom Corp. v.

According to Plaintiffs, a genetically modified crop is a crop whose genetic material has been altered by humans using genetic engineering techniques. (Compl. \u00b6 2.) Moreover,\n   \"genetically modified organisms\" are \"organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally,\" and encompass genetically modified crops. (Compl. \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that based on testing completed in June 2016, they discovered the presence of GMOs in some KIND products. (Compl. \u00b6 33.) They also allege that many other products contain ingredients that were produced using genetically modified crops, such as canola, corn, and soy. Some of these ingredients were so heavily processed that the GMO DNA from their original sources was no longer detectable in the finished products. (Compl. \u00b6 34.) The Amended Complaint specifically lists soy lecithin, glucose syrup, vegetable glycerine, canola oil, and ascorbic acid among the \"heavily-processed ingredients originating from GMO crops\" found in KIND's products. (Compl. \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   KIND argues that the \"non-GMO\" claim is expressly preempted by the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, a federal law that took effect on July 29, 2016 (the \"National GMO Standard Law\"). This statute directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") to establish \"a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard with respect to any bioengineered food\" by July 2018. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(a). Among other things, the USDA must \"determine the amounts of a bioengineered substance that may be present in food, as appropriate, in order for the food to be a bioengineered food.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The National GMO Standard Law precludes states from establishing state-specific food labeling standards that deviate from the GMO labeling standards codified by the USDA. The statute's preemption clause provides that no state may \"directly or indirectly establish ... any requirement relating to the labeling of whether a food ... contains an ingredient that was developed or produced using genetic engineering.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639i(b). Despite this express preemption provision, the National GMO Standard Law also provides that \"[n]othing in this subchapter ... shall be construed to preempt any remedy created by State or Federal statutory common law right.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639j.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The preemption doctrine has its roots in the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which provides that the \"Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. This clause \"invalidates state laws that interfere with, or are contrary to\" federal law.\n   <em>\n    Hillsborough Cty. v. Automated Med.

The issue here, then, is whether Plaintiffs seek to \"directly or indirectly establish ... any requirement relating to the labeling of\" food containing GMOs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   KIND contends that the National GMO Standard Law preempts Plaintiffs' claims because they rely on \"state law requirements that are related to the labeling of whether a food contains an ingredient that was developed or produced using genetic engineering.\" (KIND's Memo. of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 101 (\"Mot.\"), at 6 (alterations omitted).)

Those statutes only provide remedies for representations that are untrue and misleading. Indeed, the only agency-level guidance on GMO labeling corroborates that view: \"Food manufacturers may voluntarily label their foods with information about whether the foods were not produced using bioengineering, as long as such information is truthful and not misleading.\" U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration: GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY: VOLUNTARY LABELING INDICATING WHETHER FOODS HAVE OR HAVE NOT BEEN DERIVED FROM GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PLANTS (July 1, 2016), https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm059098.htm. \"The fact that Plaintiffs' claims are consistent with the current [agency] guidance supports the Court's conclusion that allowing Plaintiffs to pursue their state-law claims would not frustrate Congressional intent in enacting the express preemption provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Kao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205257041\">\n    2017 WL 5257041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.

The non-GMO claim in\n   <em>\n    Sorrell\n   </em>\n   arose from Vermont's Act 120, which directly regulates and imposes labeling requirements on foods containing GMO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%209%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203041\">\n    Vt.

Agency discretion aside, this Court found that two other\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   factors-the risk of inconsistent rulings and prior application to the FDA-weighed in favor of a stay, but only slightly so, in view of countervailing considerations that any FDA definition of \"natural\" would not \"conclusively resolve [the] issue[s]\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    In re KIND\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272417\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/689/\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Entering a stay seemed like the more prudent and appealing course of action at the time because the \"FDA ha[d] already completed its notice and comment period\" and appeared \"determined to address the 'all natural' labeling issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re KIND\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272417\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/689/\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Optimistic that the FDA would achieve the two principal objectives of primary jurisdiction-uniformity and expertise-this Court entered the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   But that was then, and this is now. Since the stay was entered, very little has happened, at least on the agency front. Undeterred, plaintiffs across the country have continued to file consumer-related claims concerning the misleading and deceptive use of the \"natural\" label.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stanton v. Sarenton Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17cv2881 (N.D. Cal. 2017);\n   <em>\n    Rhinesmith v. Tradewinds Beverage Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17cv0408 (C.D. Cal. 2017);\n   <em>\n    Madrigal v.

Other plaintiffs, whose cases were stayed under circumstances similar to Plaintiffs, have moved to lift the stays in their cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The parties contend there are two intervening developments that should inform this Court's decision to lift or continue the stay. First, President Trump's Executive Order directs all agencies to evaluate their existing regulations and make recommendations regarding their appeal, replacement, or modification. While the Executive Order extends to all agencies-not just the FDA or USDA-Plaintiffs fear that the FDA's work on \"natural\" food labeling will slow to a crawl, delaying any conclusive decision on the term for years. Second, despite the FDA's relative silence on its progress, Congress has signaled its expectation for the FDA to make headway in promulgating a uniform standard on \"natural.\" In a July 2017 report accompanying the 2018 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill (\"2018 FDA Bill\"), the House Committee on Appropriations remarked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The Committee commends the FDA for taking the first step towards defining the term \"natural\" and regulating its use on food labeling by requesting public comment on a number of relevant questions in a November 2015 Federal Register notice. The Committee directs\n   FDA to provide a report\n   <em>\n    within 60 days of enactment of this Act\n   </em>\n   on the actions and timeframe for defining \"natural\" so that there is a uniform national standard for the labeling claims and consumers and food producers have certainty about the meaning of the term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 115-232, at 72 (2017) (emphasis added). KIND therefore contends that a stay of this action should remain in place because the FDA's promulgation of a \"natural\" definition appears imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Courts have issued mixed rulings on whether to impose or lift a stay in \"natural\" labeling litigation, in view of the glacial pace of agency action. Some have cited the \"congressional interest reflected in th[e] [House Report]\" that \"makes it likely that the FDA will address, in a relatively short amount of time, the use of the term 'natural' on food labels.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosillo v.

Aug. 29, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The House Report does not fully address the question of when the FDA must establish a \"natural\" standard. Because enactment of the 2018 FDA Bill triggers the 60-day period in which the FDA must provide an action plan and time frame on defining \"natural,\" the House Report's mandate depends on Congress's ability to pass the appropriations bill. Although the House Report was issued in July 2017, Congress has not enacted the bill into law. Without that critical step, the FDA-related mandate in the House Report becomes toothless. At present, the 2018 FDA Bill has been approved at the subcommittee and committee level in both the House of Representatives and Senate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States Congress,\n   <em>\n    Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2018, Regular Appropriations\n   </em>\n   , https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/Appropriations+for+Fiscal+Year+2018 (last visited Feb. 22, 2018). However, the bill remains under review for initial and final passage by both chambers, and must subsequently be approved by the President.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Even if the 2018 FDA Bill is enacted, the House Report's directive for the FDA to act with deliberate speed is somewhat constrained by a number of other factors. First, the FDA is only required to report \"the actions and timeframe for defining 'natural' \" within 60 days. Therefore, the FDA may, after 60 days, simply provide a time frame setting forth a period of many more months, or years, to fully define \"natural.\" If that happens, this case will\n   remain in judicial purgatory for an indefinite period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Further, although the broad sentiment behind the Executive Order is rooted in cutting regulatory costs, this Court cannot discern a specific impact to the FDA's rulemaking work on defining \"natural.\" Rather, as of October 2017-more than nine months after the Executive Order was issued-it was unclear whether the FDA had suspended its work on formulating food-labeling rules or whether the agency would plow ahead on implementing rules that were under consideration long before the Executive Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The pace of the FDA's process is still unclear. There is no indication whether the FDA is earnestly working toward a uniform \"natural\" standard, or whether it has shelved that effort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heather Haddon,\n   <em>\n    FDA Commissioner Wants Closer Look at Health Claims on Packaging\n   </em>\n   , Wall St. J., Oct. 10, 2017, https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-commissioner-wants-closer-look-at-health-claims-on-packaging-1507673335 (reporting that while FDA Commissioner said the agency is \"looking at how to define 'healthy' and 'natural' more uniformly,\" he has postponed other food labeling rules); Julie Creswell,\n   <em>\n    Is it \"Natural\"?

Times, Feb. 16, 2018, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/business/natural-food-products.html (quoting the FDA Commissioner, \" 'Consumers have called upon the FDA to help define the term 'natural' and we take the responsibility to provide this clarity seriously. We will have more to say on the issue soon.' \"). Neither the House Report nor the Executive Order provide much clarity, instead inviting each party to take what little there is to hypothesize about what the FDA may be doing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In re Gen. Mills, Inc. Kix Cereal Litig., No. 12-249, slip op. at 1 (D.N.J. Apr. 21, 2017) (The Executive Order is \"very far from an indication that the FDA intends to abandon its regulatory efforts as to the kind of 'natural' labeling claims involved in this action, or that the need for regulatory expertise has abated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In view of these observations, this Court believes it prudent to continue staying the \"natural\" claim, but will limit its duration through the date on which the USDA is expected to define and promulgate the \"non-GMO\" standard. As the parties both acknowledge, the \"non-GMO\" and \"natural\" claims should not be litigated in piecemeal fashion since it would make little sense as a matter of judicial economy for one set of claims to advance to resolution while the other lags behind. (Mot. at 14; Plaintiffs' Memo. of Law in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 105, at 23; KIND's Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 106, at 9.) Though the pace of regulatory work is always subject to change, Congress has fixed, by statute, a concrete deadline by which the USDA must complete its work on the \"non-GMO\" claim. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(a). There is no telling when the FDA will complete its work on the term \"natural,\" much less provide any public guidance on its progress. However, in the interest of litigating the \"natural\" and \"non-GMO\" claims concurrently, this Court believes the August 15, 2018 deadline is a sensible benchmark from which it can re-assess whether a stay over both claims is proper. Therefore, like the \"non-GMO\" claim, the \"all natural\" claim shall be stayed until August 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   observed that \"considerations of judicial economy should not be considered because the Supreme Court has consistently held that there are only two purposes to consider in determining whether to apply the primary jurisdiction doctrine-uniformity and expertise,\" it also held that the primary jurisdiction doctrine \"relies on the timely and good-faith efforts of regulatory agencies in addressing\n   issues within their domain.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046229\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/71/#p82\">\n    443 F.3d at 91-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Absent any word from the FDA about its current progress, this Court cannot sit idly by on an illusory assurance that something is likely to happen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosillo v. Annie's Homegrown Inc.\n   </em>\n   No. 17-2474, slip op. at 1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 26, 2018) (\"The Court will not indefinitely stay this case on the hope that Congress or the FDA will eventually, at some unknown point time, have something to say on this issue.\"). Therefore, if the FDA fails to issue any guidance on the \"natural\" claim, Plaintiffs may renew their motion to lift the stay. By then, nearly two years will have elapsed since the stay was first entered, and this Court presumes, without more, that the basis for lifting stay will be substantially stronger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosillo\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 1 (\"The Court will be disinclined to continue the stay beyond July 2018 unless the FDA has made some indication that the regulatory process is close to completion.\");\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Prosecution of the \"non-GMO\" claim is stayed until August 15, 2018. Additionally, Plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay of their \"all natural\" claim is denied without prejudice to renew after August 15, 2018.
