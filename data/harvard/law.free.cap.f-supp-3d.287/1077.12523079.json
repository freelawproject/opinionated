Anthony J. Battaglia, United States District Judge\n   There are several motions currently pending before the Court. Most notable is Petitioner Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam's emergency motion for stay of his removal, (Doc. No. 52), and its related motions-Petitioner's ex parte application for a temporary stay pending his emergency motion for stay of removal, (Doc. No. 53), and the joint motion to shorten time for Petitioner's emergency motion for stay of removal, (Doc. No. 54). Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1.d.1, the Court finds these matters suitable for determination on the papers and without oral argument. As will be explained in great detail below, the Court finds that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the instant habeas petition and thus\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   the Petition. (Doc. No. 1.) Consequently, Petitioner's motion for stay of removal is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and the remainder of the pending motions on the docket are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   . (Doc. Nos. 25, 52, 53, 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner is a forty-six year old Sri Lankan Tamil man. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 35.) Tamil is an ethnic minority group in Sri Lanka. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Beginning in the 1980s, a civil war between government forces and the Tamil separatist group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (\"LTTE\"), began. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2002, a cease fire was declared, however the cease fire collapsed in 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2004, during the political elections, Petitioner worked on behalf of M.K Shivajilingam, a candidate for parliament with the Tamil National Alliance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) In 2007, Petitioner was then ordered to report to a Sri Lankan Army camp where he was detained and beaten, but was eventually released. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Subsequently in 2009, the Sri Lankan government defeated the LTTE ending the civil war. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter in 2013, Petitioner again assisted Mr. Shivajilingam in his run as a candidate for provincial election. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Petitioner's responsibilities were similar to those he held in 2004 and they included arranging public meetings in support of Mr. Shivajilingam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2014, Petitioner was approached by men on his farm who identified themselves as government intelligence officers and called Petitioner by his name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Petitioner was then pushed into a van where he was bound, beaten, and interrogated about his political activities and connection to Mr. Shivajilingam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 42.) Petitioner then endured additional torture before he woke up in a hospital where he spent several days recovering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43.) Currently, Petitioner still suffers from numbness in his left arm and has scars from his beatings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After these events, Petitioner went into hiding in Sri Lanka and India, and then in 2016 he fled the country. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Petitioner\n   then made his way through Latin America, where he was finally able to reach the U.S.-Mexico border. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 17, 2017, Petitioner entered the United States where he was apprehended by a Border Patrol Agent patrolling the area of \"Goats Canyon\" four miles west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45; Doc. No. 25-1 at 15.) According to Petitioner, he was then afforded only a \"cursory administrative asylum hearing\" and then was issued an expedited removal order pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) after the government determined that he did not have a credible fear of persecution. (Doc. No. 1 at 3, 13.) Petitioner argues that absent court intervention, he will be deported to Sri Lanka, where he will no doubt face further beatings, torture, and death because of his political associations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Petitioner is currently detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner filed his petition on January 19, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 1.) On March 5, 2018, Respondents filed their motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 25.) Briefing has not yet been completed on this motion. Thereafter, on March 7, 2018, in short succession, and after Court operating hours, Petitioner filed his emergency motion for stay of removal, his ex parte application, and both parties filed their joint motion to shorten time. (Doc. Nos. 52, 53, 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) allows a motion to dismiss where a court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Cognizant that Respondents' motion to dismiss is based solely on arguing that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear his claims, Petitioner's emergency motion for a stay of removal devotes an entire section to asserting that this Court has jurisdiction to hear his Petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B) and the Suspension Clause. (Doc. No. 52-1 at 24.) Regrettably, despite all of the arguments produced and the urgency and nature of the Petition and motions, the Court finds that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Petitioner's habeas claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Congress expressly deprived courts of jurisdiction to hear a direct appeal from an expedited removal order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (limiting review of expedited removal orders to habeas review under \u00a7 1252(e) ). Section 1252(e) states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Judicial review of any determination made under section 1225(b)(1) of this title is available in habeas corpus proceedings, but shall be limited to determinations of-(A) whether the petitioner is an alien, (B) whether the petitioner was ordered removed under such section, and (C) whether the petitioner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit holds that this statute \"strictly circumscribes the scope of review of expedited removal orders to the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 1252(e).\"\n   <em>\n    Garcia de Rincon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3116906\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/1133/#p1138\">\n    539 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1138 (9th Cir. 2008). Thus, \"[b]y the clear operation of these statutes, federal courts are jurisdictionally barred from hearing direct challenges to expedited removal orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Torre-Flores v. Napolitano\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-2698-IEG (WVG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203060923\">\n    2012 WL 3060923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Cal. July 25, 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite the Act's narrow, limited, and explicit terms, Petitioner seeks to have this Court review his habeas petition under the second factor-whether Petitioner was ordered removed. (Doc. No. 52-1 at 28.) Petitioner contends that \u00a7 1252(e)(2)(B)\"permits review of the type of threshold question presented here: whether Petitioner was 'ordered removed[.]' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) Furthermore, Petitioner states that \"there must be review of whether the negative credible fear determination was properly made-a prerequisite for issuing the expedited removal order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Unfortunately, the preceding assertions are not only wholly unsupported by applicable case law, but they also amount to nothing more than Petitioner's own self-serving assumptions. First, the Court notes that in determining whether an alien has been removed under \u00a7 1252(e)(2)(B), \"the court's inquiry shall be limited to whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to the petitioner.\" 8 U.S.C. 1252(e)(5). The Court declines to broaden and expand the clear writing of this section of the Act to include the characterization Petitioner impresses on the Court. Moreover, the Court rejects Petitioner's contention that \u00a7 1252(e)(2)(B) is\n   ambiguous. (Doc. No. 52-1 at 30.) There could be nothing further from the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Next, and most importantly for purposes of the instant Petition, the clear case law from this circuit forecloses this Court's ability to evaluate the negative credible fear determination that resulted in Petitioner's expedited removal order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galindo-Romero v.

(Doc. No. 52-1 at 30.) Explicitly, Petitioner argues that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   addresses a claim \"conceptually similar\" to his own.

Ultimately, the CBP determined that Smith was seeking to enter the United States to work and thus classified him as an \"intending immigrant\" under \u00a7 212 (a)(7)(A)(i)(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897498\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1016/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897498\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1016/\">\n    at 1018-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner gained entry into the United States and is still currently being held in the United States. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 45.) Most importantly, the underlying reasons for the petition in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and the instant case are completely dissimilar. In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner argued that he was a \"Canadian to whom the documentary requirements for admission did not apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897498\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1016/\">\n    741 F.3d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, he alleged that the CBP exceeded its authority as it could not lawfully remove him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897498\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1016/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In direct contrast, the instant petition involves Petitioner's claims that his negative credible fear determination was based off of numerous legal errors. (Doc. No. 1 at 14.) Accordingly, the blatant factual dissimilarities between the instant case and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   render Petitioner's argument that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the expedited removal statute permits the type of \"narrow legal claim\" that he raises in his Petition meritless. (Doc. No. 52-1 at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, the Court follows the clear precedent set forth by the Ninth Circuit and its sister circuits and concludes that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear Petitioner's claims challenging his removal order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodaz v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=656%20Fed.%20Appx.%20860\">\n    656 Fed.Appx. 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 861 (9th Cir. 2016) (\"To the extent Ramirez Rodaz challenges the underlying 2010 expedited removal order, we lack jurisdiction to consider this collateral attack.\") (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barajas-Alvarado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828683\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1077/#p1082\">\n    655 F.3d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1082 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that the INA \"precludes meaningful judicial review of the validity of the proceedings that result in an expedited removal order.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Further, the Court disagrees with Petitioner's characterization and application of the Suspension Clause in his case. Petitioner argues that the Suspension Clause would be violated if immigration statutes precluded this Court from reviewing his claims. (Doc. No. 52-1 at 24.) Additionally, from what the Court can discern, Petitioner attempts to assert that by dismissing his Petition for lack of jurisdiction, the Court is in essence denying him \"judicial review over [all of his] legal claims[, which] violates the Suspension Clause[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Petitioner then refers to a litany of cases to support the broad contention that the Suspension Clause applies to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Regrettably, Petitioner's arguments miss the mark. The Court does not dispute that the Suspension Clause applies to Petitioner. Instead, the Court finds that the strict restraints on this Court's jurisdictional reach to review expedited removal orders does not violate the Suspension Clause. As discussed in\n   <em>\n    Pena v.

(Doc. No. 52-1 at 25.) Petitioner claims that per\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   , noncitizens always have judicial review to challenge their deportation orders, that the scope of the review must include both constitutional and legal challenges to deportation orders, and that the absence of such review would violate the Suspension Clause.

The Court is cognizant that this case is not dispositive, however, as the factual background and habeas claims are identical to the present matter, its analysis and ultimate conclusion are incredibly persuasive to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   , twenty-nine Central American women were seized after their illegal entry into the United States.\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338054\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/163/157/#p169\">\n    163 F.Supp.3d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court does not downplay the important role courts across the nation have in safeguarding the reliability and fairness of the immigration process. However, no matter how credible Petitioner's claims of fear may be and the purported harsh consequences that may come to him if he is removed to his native country, the limited scope of this Court's judicial review over expedited removal orders restricts it from hearing Petitioner's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the Petition is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. As a result, as there is no likelihood of success on the merits to support Petitioner's emergency motion for stay of removal, this motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   (Doc.

Thus, Respondents' motion to dismiss, Petitioner's ex parte application for a stay of removal pending his emergency motion, and the joint motion to shorten time for Petitioner's emergency motion for stay of removal are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc.
