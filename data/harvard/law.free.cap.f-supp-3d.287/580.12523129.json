This change created the need for re-evaluation of CertusView's patents-in-suit, breathing new life into the presumption of validity attaching to such patents and providing objective evidence that CertusView's positions were not unreasonable. The '646 patent, which is a continuation of the asserted '341 patent -in-suit, issued on November 10, 2015, over a year after\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   CertusView submitted this Court's \u00a7 101 patent ineligibility opinion to the examiner.

ECF No. 577, at 6. S &amp; N argues that the claims in the patents-in-suit were therefore objectively without merit both before and after\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   and that such lack of merit was even more obvious after\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .

In support of this response, CertusView states that\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   was initially viewed as a case where the Supreme Court implicitly saved software patents, citing numerous articles for such proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 555-10, 555-11, 555-12.

Rather than immediately filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings when\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   was decided, S &amp; N waited four months to file its \u00a7 101 motion, only moving for judgment under \u00a7 101 after subsequent cases illustrated that\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   had turned the tide on the eligibility of many software patents.

In fact, the Patent Office expressly determined this to be the case when it allowed the claims over the recording of 'conventional' locate operations, of which the Patent Office was well aware\"). Relying on evidence from the inequitable conduct trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 545, CertusView ultimately contended that the limitations recite specific solutions that overcame problems with conventional locate documentation 1) by using a high-resolution manifest to document to scale, improving accuracy and reducing error, and 2) by reciting the high-resolution manifest, searchable electronic record, and geographical coordinate limitations not previously disclosed, thereby solving industry problems with paper-based locate manifests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br.

In much of its ineligibility analysis of this point in its \u00a7 101 Opinion, this Court focused on the fact that a claim directed to an abstract idea is not transformed into patent-eligible subject matter by merely requiring generic computer implementation.

ECF No. 574 at 5.

As district courts have observed, \"the reluctance to find exceptionality, based in part on the presumption of validity, is not unreasonable when the examiner considered whether the patent was eligible under current \u00a7 101 law.\"\n   <em>\n    My Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206512221\">\n    2017 WL 6512221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20209273\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

S &amp; N points out that CertusView \"could not support an argument that its asserted claims were analogous to those at issue in\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   because its own expert had already made\n   clear that 'I don't think that the direction of the patents is towards an invention of a computer technology.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. CertusView responds that\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Enfish\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   \"was significant because it was the first appellate court decision that clarified\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   Step One.\" ECF No. 576, at 16.

CertusView further asserts that its motion for reconsideration was not only based upon\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Enfish\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , it was also based upon \"new evidence from the trial on S &amp; N's inequitable conduct claims.\" ECF No. 576, at 17. S &amp; N responds that CertusView's argument regarding\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Enfish\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   \"was baseless because this argument sought an application of\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   that this Court (and numerous others) acknowledged 'cannot be stretched to support Certusview's suggestion.' \" ECF No. 577, at 8. S &amp; N further responds that because this Court had previously stated in its \u00a7 101 opinion that there were no factual disputes that could affect its \u00a7 101 analysis, it was \"objectively unreasonable for CertusView to expect the Court to later find that extrinsic evidence was necessary or somehow could change the result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This Court issued its \u00a7 101 opinion on January 21, 2015. The '646 continuation patent issued on November 10, 2015. On March 8, 2016, the Court began a five day bench trial on S &amp; N's declaratory judgment counterclaim against CertusView for inequitable conduct. After the Court took the matter under advisement pending submission of post-trial briefs, the Federal Circuit issued the\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   decision on May 12, 2016. CertusView filed a motion for partial reconsideration of the Court's \u00a7 101 opinion on June 15, 2016, and the Court denied such motion for reconsideration on August 10, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the denial of the motion for reconsideration, this Court carefully explained why its prior finding that Claim 1 of the '359 patent, which is \"directed towards the abstract idea of creating a computer-readable file to store information, as applied in the particular technological environment of conducting a locate operation,\" was \"unchanged by the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Enfish\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   decisions.\" ECF No. 545, at 18-21. This Court also explained that CertusView failed to demonstrate that new evidence heard during the bench trial of S &amp; N's inequitable conduct counterclaim was relevant to reconsideration, or that such trial produced evidence that was substantially different from the evidence that was available at the time the Court resolved S &amp; N's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. Therefore, the Court concluded that reconsideration of the Court's judgment of patent ineligibility regarding Claim 1 of the '359 patent was unwarranted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   While it might be argued that,\n   <strong>\n    absent\n   </strong>\n   the issuance of the '646 continuation patent, CertusView conducted the litigation in an unreasonable manner by filing the motion for reconsideration, the issuance of the '646 continuation patent sufficiently breathed new life into the presumption of validity attached to the '359 patent that it cannot be said CertusView's filing of the motion for reconsideration was unreasonable. Moreover, the evolving nature of \u00a7 101 jurisprudence in this area, as discussed above, militates against a finding of unreasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Filing of Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   S &amp; N argues that CertusView's arguments on appeal are further evidence of the weakness of CertusView's position with respect to \u00a7 101. ECF No. 574, at 11. In support of such argument, S &amp; N contends that, \"in an attempt to salvage its ineligible claims on appeal, CertusView made new claim construction arguments before the\n   Federal Circuit based on this Court's trial order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CertusView responds that S &amp; N \"fails to acknowledge that the constructions CertusView argued on appeal were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   its own, crafted anew, but were based on the Court's application of the asserted claims in the post-trial judgment.\" ECF No. 576, at 19. S &amp; N replies that CertusView, in arguing that the constructions it argued on appeal were based on the Court's application of the asserted claims in the post-trial judgment, does not dispute that such claim construction arguments on appeal were inconsistent with its claim construction positions below. ECF No. 577, at 9. Moreover, S &amp; N posits, \"neither of the authorities that CertusView points to-\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Cordis\n   </em>\n   -allow a party to advance inconsistent claim construction positions on appeal as long as they are not the party's own,\" and even if they did, \"the district court did not re-construe any claims in its trial order as CertusView contends.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even if there were merit to S &amp; N's argument that CertusView made new claim construction arguments before the Federal Circuit, as CertusView points out, its argument comes late in the case and would carry more weight (and possibly have been addressed earlier) had it been made before the Federal Circuit. ECF No. 576, at 19. Such late argument militates against this Court finding that CertusView's argument was one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of CertusView's litigating position or that the case was litigated in an unreasonable manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SFA Sys., LLC v.

Therefore, the Court finds S &amp; N's argument, that CertusView took inconsistent claim construction positions before this Court and the Federal Circuit, does not merit further consideration as its lateness suggests that CertusView's litigation position did not stand out from others with respect to its substantive strength or that such argument was asserted in an unreasonable manner.\n   <em>\n    SFA Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277266\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1344/#p1348\">\n    793 F.3d at 1348-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming district court's refusal to conduct a mini-trial on frivolity for attorneys' fees purposes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Unreasonable Litigation Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   S &amp; N argues that CertusView's unreasonable litigation and discovery misconduct merit an exceptional case finding.

Privilege and Discovery Misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   S &amp; N argues that CertusView's improper claim of privilege over relevant documents (including corporate documents and assessments of relevant prior art) that were clearly discoverable, and making material misrepresentations to the Court in the process of asserting such privilege claim, is particularly egregious and stands out from other matters that are properly litigated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. CertusView essentially responds that the facts relied upon by S &amp; N amount to, at most, an aggressive litigation strategy that was not egregious. ECF No. 576, at 21. CertusView first asserts that none of the extenuating circumstances that courts have found in other cases, such as manufacturing evidence, perjury, witness tampering, obfuscations or bad faith, exists here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. CertusView next responds that allegations of concealed documents do not support a finding of exceptionality: 1) where this Court previously found that CertusView's initial assertion of privilege was supported by a reasonable basis in law and fact, and 2) where S &amp; N fails to identify a particular document allegedly concealed, or instead\n   inferentially relies on assertions of concealment outlined in a prior motion that do not amount to exceptional behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-25. Summarily relying on five pages of explanation in a previously-filed motion for attorneys' fees in this case, S &amp; N replies that CertusView's knowingly unfounded privilege assertions, multiple misrepresentations to the Court under oath, and concealment of numerous important documents and witnesses, set this case apart from others. ECF No. 577, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This Court does not intend to relitigate in detail here the merits of each of the grounds asserted by S &amp; N. Suffice it to say that, for the reasons cited by CertusView in its responsive brief, ECF No. 576, at 20-22, the Court finds such grounds to be examples of an aggressive litigation strategy by a patent holder against a competitor, and in some respects conduct worthy of condemnation and sanctions, but the Court finds in the exercise of its discretion that on these facts this is not the type of egregious behavior justifying an award of attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204391776\">\n    2017 WL 4391776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20155525\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

Number of Claims Asserted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   S &amp; N argues that CertusView \"asserted an inordinate amount of claims initially, and importantly, refused to reasonably limit the number of asserted claims despite representing to the Court that it would do so.\" ECF No. 574, at 14. CertusView responds that \"there is nothing exceptional about a plaintiff initially asserting fewer than half of the claims in its asserted patents,\" and \"there is nothing exceptional about a patentee reducing clams [sic] during the suit or in asking for commensurate reductions in the number of asserted prior art references as CertusView did here.\" ECF No. 576, at 22. CertusView asserts that its \"position-that it was willing to narrow its claims of infringement after obtaining the requisite discovery from S &amp; N, so long as S &amp; N proportionally narrowed its counterclaims of invalidity-reflected a standard practice in patent litigation, not an unreasonable litigation tactic.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20155525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   CertusView says that \"[t]ellingly, the Court ultimately\n   <em>\n    agreed\n   </em>\n   with CertusView's position that parallel reductions in the number of asserted claims and the number of prior art references was appropriate and ordered a parallel-reduction process,\" ECF No. 576, at 23 (citing ECF No. 159, at 11, 14). Later, CertusView argues, \"the Court\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   S &amp; N's request for sanctions based on this process\" after observing that the parties had been negotiating an agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20155525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, CertusView responds \"that S &amp; N offers no evidence to substantiate its argument that CertusView asserted a large number of patent claims in bad faith,\" and further responds that the unrelated blog post by one of CertusView's former attorneys seemingly encouraging such behavior provides \"no basis for attributing Mr. Rodrigues' blog post to CertusView.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. S &amp; N replies that \"CertusView's strategy of waiting over eight months to assert a large number of 'largely redundant' claims from multiple patents to 'drastically increase the costs of litigation' and subsequent refusal to timely limit the number of claims was in bad faith and sets this case apart from others.\" ECF No. 577, at 10. Moreover, S &amp; N replies, \"contrary\n   to CertusView's assertions, S &amp; N was willing to limit its invalidity arguments\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   CertusView identified its reduced number of claims, which is an approach that is both logical and common in patent cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This issue was discussed at length by the Court in its Opinion and Order filed on October 1, 2014. ECF No. 159. As reflected there, the Court had previously expected CertusView to take the lead in reducing the initial number of claims asserted after receiving necessary discovery, and for S &amp; N to correspondingly reduce the number of asserted prior art references.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 86, at 4, 6. Of course, as indicated in the cases cited by the Court in its original order, upon a showing of good cause, CertusView could seek authorization from the Court to increase the number of claims after such initial reduction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Although CertusView believed it needed additional discovery before making its initial reduction in the number of claims it asserted, it was nonetheless in the process of negotiating a resolution to the impasse at the time that S &amp; N filed its motion to limit the number of claims CertusView could assert. For that reason, the Court denied S &amp; N's request for sanctions. However, contrary to CertusView's view of the matter, the Court also concluded that CertusView had received sufficient discovery to allow it to make an initial reduction in the number of claims asserted. While it appears that CertusView failed to appreciate the Court's prior admonition to make an initial reduction in the number of claims it asserted, ECF No. 86, at 5-6, it was in the process of trying to negotiate a corresponding limitation on the number of prior art references S &amp; N asserted. The problem was that, in the absence of such an agreement, the Court's prior order essentially envisioned CertusView, as the party in the best position to narrow the dispute, ECF No. 159, at 8, proceeding to make its initial reduction in the number of claims asserted after receiving relevant discovery, even if it could not reach agreement with S &amp; N on corresponding reductions in prior art references. CertusView failed to make its initial reduction, in spite of the fact that the Court concluded CertusView had received sufficient discovery to be able to do so. However, for the same reason that the Court denied S &amp; N's sanctions request at the time, the Court also finds that CertusView's actions, though reflecting poor litigation judgment and an aggressive litigation strategy, were not egregious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Totality of Circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   S &amp; N asserts that \"[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances, this case was not only litigated in a wholly unreasonable manner from the beginning, but it also stands out from the others with respect to CertusView's exceptionally weak litigation position.\" ECF No. 574, at 16. CertusView responds that \"none of S &amp; N's individual arguments warrant a fee award, and, when considered in the context of the entire litigation-a hard-fought competitor litigation where both sides won and lost discovery battles and claims and counterclaims-there is no showing that the sum of the parts is sufficient to support the 'rare' finding that this case 'stands out' from others.\" ECF No. 576, at 26. CertusView goes on to argue that \"the sort of discovery conduct S &amp; N complains of occurred on both sides,\" and therefore \"[c]onsidering the litigation strategy by both parties was similar, the totality of the circumstances does not support a finding that it should be deemed an 'exceptional case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, CertusView argues that after \"winning its judgment on the pleadings that the asserted claims were patent ineligible, S &amp; N filed inequitable conduct counterclaims in hopes of garnering a fee award,\" ... \"[y]et, at trial, S &amp; N failed to prove a single element of any of its five inequitable conduct allegations,\" and therefore such \"pursuit of its\n   inequitable conduct claims, and its resort to exaggeration of the record to hide the weakness of its arguments, shows-as an equitable matter-that S &amp; N is not entitled to its requested fee award.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27. S &amp; N replies that, with respect to the argument that both parties had the same aggressive litigation strategy, \"the circumstances surrounding S &amp; Ns sanctions were significantly different from the circumstances surrounding CertusView's.\" ECF No. 577, at 13. S &amp; N further replies that it \"is aware of no authority that precludes an attorneys' fees award because a party lost on its inequitable conduct claims,\" and \"[a]lthough attorneys' fees\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   be awarded on the basis of an inequitable conduct finding, this is certainly not the only basis for a fee award under\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   , which specifically provides for an exceptional case finding based on the manner of litigation and/or substantive strength of a party's litigating position.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The parties' sanctioned conduct involved here was different is scope and degree, in the Court's view; with the misconduct of CertusView exceeding that of S &amp; N. However, it does reflect that both sides aggressively litigated the case. Each parties' behavior has already been the subject of a sanctions award. That is not to say that it cannot be considered here, but such fact does affect this Court's view about the manner in which it should exercise it discretion, and diminishes the overall need for deterrence. With respect to the argument that S &amp; N's loss on the inequitable conduct counterclaims should somehow equitably preclude it from pursuing and prevailing on its exceptional case motion, the Court agrees that such outcome does not preclude S &amp; N from pursuing such a motion, and finds that it is proper to consider all of the conduct associated with such trial in exercising its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, with the totality of the circumstances in mind, the Court looks back to the nonexclusive list of factors that the Supreme Court said trial courts could consider in deciding whether a case is exceptional, and makes the following observations.\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1756 n.6. First, with respect to frivolousness, the Court has made detailed findings above as to why it concludes that specific actions of CertusView were not frivolous. The Court now concludes that the totality of all of these circumstances do not support a finding of frivolousness on the part of CertusView. Second, with respect to motivation, the Court has made findings above as to why it concludes that specific actions of CertusView were not driven by an improper motive. While it is true that CertusView has aggressively argued for patent eligibility in an evolving area of the law, the Court was not presented with any persuasive evidence that such arguments were improperly motivated. Moreover, there is a \"presumption that an assertion of infringement of a duly granted patent is made in good faith,\"\n   <em>\n    Medtronic Navigation, Inc. v. BrainLAB Medizinische Computersysteme GmbH\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228690\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/603/943/#p954\">\n    603 F.3d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 954 (Fed. Cir. 2010), and \"motivation to implement the statutory patent right by bringing suit based on a reasonable belief in infringement is not an improper motive,\" as a \"patentee's assertion of reasonable claims of infringement is the mechanism whereby patent systems provide an innovation incentive.\"\n   <em>\n    Hopkins Mfg. Corp. v. Cequent Performance Prods.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 14-CV-2208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20107997\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *21 (D. Kan. July 5, 2017). Therefore, the Court now concludes that the totality of the circumstances do not support a finding of improper motive on the part of CertusView. Third, with respect to objective unreasonableness, both in the factual and legal components of the case, the Court has made findings above as to why it concludes\n   that specific actions of CertusView were not objectively unreasonable. The Court now finds, based upon a totality of the circumstances, that S &amp; N has failed to show objective unreasonableness by CertusView in the factual and legal components of the case. Alternatively, to the extent that objective unreasonableness exists, the Court finds such conduct is not so exceptional as to justify an award of fees. For all of these reasons, the Court concludes, based upon the totality of the circumstances, that S &amp; N has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that this is \"the rare case in which a party's unreasonable conduct\" is \"so 'exceptional' as to justify an award of fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1757.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
