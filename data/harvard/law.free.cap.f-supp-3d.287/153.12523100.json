INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs, Lynne Liston-Smith and John Smith (collectively \"the plaintiffs\"), bring this action against their homeowner's insurance provider, CSAA Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (\"CSAA\"), for CSAA's failure to pay for damage to their basement walls. The Complaint (Doc. No. 1-1) alleges breach of contract (Count One), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count Two), and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (\"CUIPA\") and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"CUTPA\"). On October 25, 2016, the court dismissed Count Two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling re Mot. to Dismiss (Doc. No. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   CSAA has moved for summary judgment (Doc No. 30) as to the two remaining counts. For the reasons that follow, CSAA's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs have lived at their home in Tolland, Connecticut since 1996. Local Rule 56(a)1 Statement (\"L.R. 56(a)1 Stat.\") (Doc. No. 32) at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 12. Plaintiffs' home is insured by CSAA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Around late summer or fall of 2014, John Smith (\"Smith\") noticed cracks in his basement wall and alerted his wife, Lynne Liston-Smith (\"Liston-Smith\"). John Smith Depo. (Oct. 14, 2016), Ex. C to L.R. 56(a)1 Stat. (Doc. No. 32-3) at 7. In August of 2015, the plaintiffs hired an engineer, William Neal, to inspect the cracks in the foundation of their home. Lynne Liston-Smith Depo. (Oct. 14, 2016), Ex. D to L.R. 56(a)1 Stat. (Doc. No. 32-4) at 10. Neal determined that a defect in the concrete, which he later determined to be a chemical reaction, was causing cracks in the walls that would continue to grow until the structure became unstable. William Neal Depo. (Dec. 1, 2016), Ex. E (Doc. No. 32-5) at 12-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neal recommended that the concrete foundation be replaced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 2, 2015, the plaintiffs made a claim to CSAA for damages the chemical reaction had caused to their foundation. L.R. 56(a)1 Stat. at \u00b6 13. In a letter dated October 12, 2015, CSAA denied\n   plaintiffs coverage under their home insurance policy (\"the Policy\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Coverage A-Dwelling\" in the Policy applies to plaintiffs' home.

First, the loss the plaintiffs identify is not considered a \"collapse\" under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Mem.\") (Doc. No. 31) at 12-15. Second, the Policy only covers accidental losses, whereas the deterioration of the plaintiffs' walls has been inherent in the concrete since the foundation of the house was laid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17. Third, coverage for the plaintiffs' claim is barred by several exclusions in the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-24. Fourth, CSAA argues that the plaintiffs' suit is barred by the Policy's two-year suit limitation provision and that the alleged loss from the chemical reaction in the plaintiffs' foundation and basement walls began well before the CSAA Policy period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-28. Because the court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiffs' claim is not covered under the collapse provision and is barred by express exclusions in the Policy, the court does not reach the issue of timeliness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   1. Collapse\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CSAA argues that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that the plaintiffs' home has not collapsed, as defined in the Policy, and is therefore not covered under the Additional Coverage for collapse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 15. Plaintiffs argue that the definition of collapse is ambiguous and that coverage under the collapse provision extends to \"substantial impairment of the structural integrity of a building.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. of Law in Opp'n to the Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls.' Opp'n\") (Doc. No. 37) at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The court concludes that the Additional Coverage for collapse does not cover the plaintiffs' home because there has been no collapse, as the provision unambiguously requires. Plaintiffs' own expert stated that the walls had not abruptly fallen down or caved in.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   William Neal Depo. (Dec. 1, 2016), Ex. E to L.R. 56(a)1 Stat. (Doc No. 32-5) at 14. Rather, he determined that the walls were deteriorating as a result of a progressive condition, remained upright, and the home was still inhabitable for its intended purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Other Connecticut courts that have looked at insurance policies requiring an abrupt collapse have rejected arguments that the provision was ambiguous or could be interpreted as covering a state short of\n   an abrupt collapse, such as a \"substantial structural impairment\".\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.
