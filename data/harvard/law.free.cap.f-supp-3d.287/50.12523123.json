INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request for records relating to a Defendant Department of Energy (\"DOE\") investigation into lobbying activities of Sandia Corporation (\"Sandia\"), a contractor hired by DOE to operate Sandia National Laboratory, a government-owned nuclear facility. In 2009, certain officials of Sandia and its parent company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, devised a plan to lobby Congress and other federal officials to renew Sandia's\n   contract with DOE without competitive bidding. An investigation by DOE's Office of Inspector General later revealed that the plan was developed and carried out with taxpayer funds, in violation of federal law. Sandia eventually reached a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Center for Public Integrity brought this FOIA action against DOE, seeking to compel the disclosure of records concerning the agency's investigation of Sandia. In response to Plaintiff's FOIA request, DOE produced some records in full, some in part, and withheld others in their entirety under certain statutory exemptions. Plaintiff challenges Defendant's reliance on these exemptions. This court resolved some of Plaintiff's challenges when it ruled upon the parties' initial cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Pub. Integrity v. U.S. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2017). In its previous Opinion, the court held that Defendant properly withheld information under FOIA Exemptions 3, 7(E), and 7(F), as well as certain information under Exemptions 4, 6, and 7(C).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also found, however, that Defendant did not provide sufficient justification with respect to certain other information withheld under FOIA Exemptions 4, 6, and 7(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, the court held that Defendant did not adequately justify its efforts to segregate and release all non-exempt records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n    at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court gave the agency an opportunity to supplement its declarations to address these deficiencies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268200\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/65/\">\n    at 71, 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Now before the court are the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. Upon consideration of the parties' submissions and the present record, the court finds Defendant may rely on Exemption 4 to withhold the e-mail communications between Sandia and its legal counsel, except those portions that the agency has officially disclosed through public releases. The court also concludes that Defendant has now provided sufficient justification for its redaction of names and other identifying information pursuant to Exemption 7(C), except as to those names that the agency has officially acknowledged through FOIA disclosures. The court therefore grants the parties' motions in part and denies them in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Upon receiving Plaintiff's FOIA request in 2014, OIG identified and reviewed a total of 114 documents responsive to Plaintiff's request. Def.'s Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 2. Of those documents, OIG ultimately released 71 documents either in part or in full and withheld two in their entirety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This set of documents included the aforementioned OIG Report and Memorandum to the Secretary, as well as other work product created by OIG as a part of its investigation into Sandia's lobbying activities. Tr. at 33-35. As to the other 41 documents found in its investigative file, OIG forwarded them to NNSA for review. Def.'s Stmt. of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33-35. This set of documents included those records that NNSA received from Sandia pursuant to its request for records. Tr. at 33;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Initial Cross-Mot., Ex. C, ECF No. 30-5 (seven-day letter). NNSA, along with Sandia staff, reviewed and ultimately produced 39 documents with redactions.\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Pub.

J. at 1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   OIG and NNSA took different approaches with respect to weighing the privacy interests of individuals whose names appear in the responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27-47. OIG conducted an independent review of the documents that it eventually disclosed and concluded that all Sandia officials, regardless of rank or participation in the lobbying scheme, \"ha[d] the same privacy interest that any other private citizen would have\" under Exemption 7(C).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:16-18. As a result, for example, OIG redacted the names of all Sandia employees appearing in the OIG Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s First Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 14-15; Def.'s Mot., Suppl. Decl. of Adrienne Martin, ECF No. 41-1 [hereinafter Suppl. Martin Decl.], \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At oral argument, it became clear that, unlike OIG, NNSA did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   withhold the names of all Sandia employees. Instead, it disclosed the names of certain \"key management official[s]\" at Sandia, because, according to NNSA, those officials contractually waived their privacy interests as a part of the DOE contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 30-32, 36-37, 44. NNSA did review the documents in question under Exemption 6, but in NNSA's estimation Exemption 6 did not allow withholding the names of high-level Sandia officials.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:25-28:5 (\"[W]hen the NNSA did [its] analysis on Exemption 6 ... [it] looked at ... who were high-level managerial folks, and those names were actually released, the people making the decisions, the people in that capacity.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Second Mot. for Partial Summ.

With respect to timing, NNSA made its determination to disclose names\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   OIG had released its redacted records. Tr. at 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   These disparate approaches, standing alone, are unremarkable. But herein lies the problem: Some of the documents that NNSA disclosed in full\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   names redacted were originally part of OIG's investigative file,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33-35;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:8-19, yet OIG cited those very documents its Report\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   names redacted. That one component of DOE disclosed the names of certain high-level Sandia officials in some documents, while another component did not, raises several questions, the answers to which are critical to framing the merits of this issue. First, as to those names NNSA disclosed, does the official acknowledgment doctrine operate to bar Defendant from invoking Exemption 7(C) to block the release of those same names as found in OIG's records? Second, if the official acknowledgment doctrine does not bar all invocations of Exemption 7(C) for a person whose name NNSA has released, what effect does NNSA's public disclosure have on the person's privacy interest in the Exemption 7(C) balancing? Finally, if a person whose name NNSA has disclosed retains some privacy interest in OIG's records, does that person's interest vary depending on the document that NNSA has disclosed? Concrete examples will help flesh out the answers to these questions, but the court first turns to the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Official Acknowledgment Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In order for information to be considered \"officially acknowledged,\" it must \"match\" the information previously disclosed,\" be \"as specific as\" such information, and it must have been \"made public through an official and documented disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5676379,10537511\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/911/755/\">\n    911 F.2d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But does NNSA's release of names foreclose OIG from redacting those same names from its disclosed material? Put more broadly, does official disclosure of a name by one agency component preclude another agency component from withholding the same name?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Circuit precedent addresses and answers the question.

Does that acknowledgment extend to all OIG records containing the disclosed person's name, or does it apply only to OIG material that mirrors or is derived from the NNSA-produced document? An example is useful here. Take the May 20, 2010, e-mail chain discussed above. NNSA disclosed that record to Plaintiff with the name \"Becky Krauss\" appearing in the \"To\" or \"From\" lines in the component emails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Filing of Exs. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ.

OIG's Report discusses the May 20, 2010, e-mail chain, but when OIG produced the Report to Plaintiff it redacted the names of all senders and recipients of the emails, including presumably Becky Krauss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OIG Report at 27. But application of the official acknowledgment doctrine precludes OIG from redacting Krauss's name in connection with its discussion of the May 20, 2010, e-mail chain. The same is not true, however, for all other OIG records containing Krauss's name, including other references to Krauss that might be in the Report. For there to be an official acknowledgment, the information disclosed must precisely \"match\" the information requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5676379,10537511\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/911/755/\">\n    911 F.2d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, Defendant must produce to Plaintiffs any such OIG records without redacting such names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Balancing of Interests Under Exemption 7(C)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Having established the circumstances in which the agency can no longer withhold names, the court turns to the Exemption 7(C) analysis. Under this analysis, the court must balance the privacy interests of the individuals named in the documents against the public interest in disclosure. As previously discussed, the parties' dispute over the application of Exemption 7(C) centers on whether Defendant may redact the names of three general categories of individuals: (1) high-level Sandia, SNL, and Lockheed Martin officials; (2) DOE employees who are at pay grades GS-15 or below; and (3) individuals who were interviewed during the OIG Inquiry. Furthermore, as indicated above, the dispute over the first category of names now contains an added wrinkle, given NNSA's and OIG's different approaches with respect to the names of high-level Sandia officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    High-Level SNL, Sandia, and Lockheed Martin Employees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   With respect to the first category of names redacted by Defendant, the Supplemental Declaration of OIG Information Specialist Adrienne Martin clarifies that these individuals are \"relatively high-level employees of SNL, Sandia Corporation, or Lockheed Martin Corporation, several of whom had concurrent positions in more than one of those entities.\" Suppl. Martin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7. The employees falling within this category include not only those who advocated for Sandia \"to charge the cost of lobbying activities to the contract with DOE for the operation of SNL,\" but also those who opposed that decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. According to Defendant, the \"common element\" uniting the advocates and opponents of the decision is that \"none of the[m] ... w[ere] determined [by OIG] to be [individually] culpable ... for any misconduct\" or \"indicted for or convicted of any criminal activity.\" Def.'s Mot. at 10 (citing Suppl. Martin Decl. \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Before turning to the balancing of interests with respect to this category of individuals, the court raises but ultimately sets aside a threshold issue: For purposes of Exemption 7(C), should Sandia employees be treated as private citizens because they work for a private company, or are they more akin to government employees because they carry out a unique government function, i.e., operating a government-owned nuclear lab? That distinction is important because it dictates the weight of the privacy interest at stake and the\n   proper test to apply. To protect the substantial privacy interests recognized under Exemption 7(C), the D.C. Circuit has adopted a \"categorical rule permitting an agency to withhold information identifying private citizens mentioned in law enforcement records, unless disclosure is 'necessary in order to confirm or refute compelling evidence that the agency is engaged in illegal activity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Schrecker v.

That holds true irrespective of the person's role in the lobbying scheme. And it also obtains for those high-level Sandia officials whose names NNSA released as part of its production and who now arguably might be associated with proof of wrongdoing. No employee has been publicly identified by a law enforcement agency as having engaged in violating the law, let alone stood accused or convicted of an offense. As the Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    CREW II\n   </em>\n   :\"The privacy interests of individuals who have not been convicted in connection with this investigation-and even more so those who have not been publicly linked with the investigation whatsoever-differ greatly from those of individuals who were convicted or pled guilty for their roles.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277046\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/675/#p681\">\n    854 F.3d at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, Sandia only can act through its agents or employees, and therefore\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   must be responsible (though not necessarily in the legal sense) for the federal law violations. But the court is not aware of any case that diminishes a person's privacy interests simply because her employer, on account of the doctrine of respondeat superior liability, is held accountable for a law violation. Accordingly, all persons in this category possess a substantial privacy interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To overcome this privacy interest in favor of disclosure, Plaintiff must make two showings related to the public interest.

By contrast, Plaintiff here does not explain how releasing the names of Sandia employees will get Plaintiff any closer to learning whether OIG pulled its punches or, for that matter, anything else about the investigation. Defendant already has released the final OIG Report and relevant investigative records. That release offers Plaintiff a bounty of information about OIG's investigation, including the categories of witnesses it interviewed, the documents it reviewed, how it weighed the evidence, and the conclusions it drew. In view of that release, the public interest in evaluating the OIG inquiry is \"greatly reduced.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264432\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/346/#p350\">\n    876 F.3d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the \"weighty public interest in evaluating government investigations of public officials\" was \"greatly reduced\" where there was \"voluminous information already in the public domain about the ... investigation\" and \"[t]he political branches of the federal government ha[d] assessed the evidence and documented their proceedings and findings in publicly available reports\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Arguably, the release of names might enable Plaintiff to determine if any specific individual escaped public scrutiny for an improper purpose.

U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878827,3816293\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/1489/\">\n    997 F.2d 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1493 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In this case, although Sandia's misdeeds became public, they hardly qualify as a \"well-publicized scandal\" that captured the public's attention. Second, Lockheed Martin and Sandia are no longer running SNL, having lost the contract as of 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 49, 56. Thus, those involved in the lobbying scheme are likely no longer in a position to misuse taxpayer money, and Plaintiff has got given the court reason to think otherwise. The public interest in \"hold[ing] the governors accountable to the governed\" is therefore diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In the end, whatever public interest there is in learning the identities of the persons involved in Sandia's lobbying efforts, that interest is not outweighed by those persons' substantial privacy interests. Accordingly, Defendant properly invoked Exemption 7(C) to withhold the names of Sandia, SNL, and Lockheed Martin employees from disclosure, subject to the court's official acknowledgment holding above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    DOE Employees Who Serve at the GS-15 Level and Below\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant also redacted the names of \"all DOE employees in pay grades GS-15 and below\" from the responsive records. Suppl. Martin Decl. \u00b6 9. According to Defendant, most of these employees are either OIG investigators or employees at DOE headquarters or field offices who shared background information with investigators.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878827,3816293\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/1489/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"None of the Federal employees\" in this category \"was alleged to have been involved in any misconduct or wrongdoing of any kind.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878827,3816293\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/1489/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The court \"need not linger over the balance\" as to these employees.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Retired Fed.

The only public interest Plaintiff claims is that \"the names of the other [non-investigative] employees are important in understanding the significance of the information they provided.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 8. It is not at all clear what Plaintiff means by this, but in any event it is not an interest that reveals \"what [the] government is up to.\"\n   <em>\n    Reporters Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p755\">\n    489 U.S. at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p755\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Martin Decl. \u00b6 11. These individuals fall into two camps. The first consists of DOE officials at various levels, none of whom are alleged to have been involved in any misconduct or wrongdoing of any kind.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The second consists of high-level \"SNL, Sandia Corporation, and Lockheed Martin Corporation\" employees, both advocates and opponents of the Sandia decision, who were interviewed by OIG \"regarding the decision to charge lobbying expenses to the SNL contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given the substantial overlap between this third category of individuals and the first and second categories, the non-disclosure of the names of these individuals was proper for the reasons already discussed. Moreover, to the extent there are any individuals who fall within this third category but do not fall within the first or second categories, Plaintiff\n   does not address why disclosure of these names is warranted under the balancing test.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. &amp; Opp'n at 9. Accordingly, Defendant properly withheld these names, too, under Exemption 7(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Segregability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, the court addresses Defendant's segregability determination. A district court must evaluate segregability even where, as here, the requester has not challenged it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sussman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565051,6047422\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1106/\">\n    494 F.3d at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"[t]he focus of FOIA is information, not documents ... an agency cannot justify withholding an entire document simply by showing that it contains some exempt material.\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.
