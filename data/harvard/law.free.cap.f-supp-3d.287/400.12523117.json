RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Can't Live Without It, LLC (\"S'well\") has brought six claims against defendant ETS Express, Inc. (\"ETS\"). ETS manufactures the Force and Swig Bottles, which have the exact same shape as plaintiff's S'well and S'ip Bottles, respectively. ETS has moved for summary judgment dismissing all six of S'well's\n   claims: (1) trade dress infringement in violation of the Lanham Act; (2) false designation of origin and unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act; (3) trade dress infringement under New York common law; (4) unfair competition under New York common law; (5) deceptive acts and practices in violation of New York General Business law \u00a7 349, and (6) false advertising in violation of New York General Business Law \u00a7 350. ETS has also moved for summary judgment on its counterclaim seeking cancellation of the trade dress registrations for the S'well and S'ip Bottles. S'well, in turn, has moved for summary judgment as to liability on its second and fourth claims, but only with regard to ETS's alleged use of S'well's trademarked name, not S'well's trade dress rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's second claim (false designation of origin and unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act), fifth claim (deceptive acts and practices in violation of New York General Business law \u00a7 349 ), and sixth claim (false advertising in violation of New York General Business Law \u00a7 350 ). The Court otherwise denies defendant's motions, and also denies plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts, undisputed except where noted, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   S'well was founded in 2010 by Sarah Kauss, who remains its CEO.

S'well registered the S'well Bottle's trade dress (its three-dimensional shape and cap, in combination) with the PTO Supplemental Register in July 2013 and the PTO Principal Register in January 2017.

ETS 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 13-18. S'well sells its bottles (a) directly to consumers on its website, (b) to retailers who then sell the bottles in their stores, and (c) through S'well's custom program, in which an imprint of a company's name or logo is added to the bottle and the company then resells or gives away the bottles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.

The Force Bottle is one of ETS's most popular products and is shaped identically to the S'well Bottle. ETS 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34. ETS first placed a factory order for a Force Bottle in May 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. ETS characterizes itself as operating in the \"promotion products market\" rather than the retail market, meaning it fulfills orders placed by intermediaries for custom-printed products and the intermediaries then sell those products to businesses that give them away as promotions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. These intermediaries sell a wide variety of products and do not specialize in drinkware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. ETS does sell Force Bottles directly to some retailers-including, at least, college bookstores and a coffee shop chain with locations throughout California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.

In evaluating this issue, courts look to such factors,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , as advertising expenditures, consumer studies, sales success, unsolicited media coverage, attempts to plagiarize the mark, and length and exclusivity of the mark's use.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.

ETS provides declarations from various employees who state that they purchased S'well-like bottles from various stores and websites, providing pictures, descriptions, and receipts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant ETS Express, Inc.'s Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute (\"ETS 56.1 Stmt.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, 42, ECF No. 47. ETS identifies 130 different sources of water bottles that have the same shape as the S'well Bottle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant posits that, as a matter of law, if \"the total number of such different sources exceeds 20, the alleged mark is generic because it cannot indicate that it emanates from a single source.\" ETS Express, Inc.'s Memorandum of Law in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment (\"ETS Mem.\") at 5, ECF No. 57. But no such numeric rule exists. If, for example, one source has such a large market share and strong brand awareness that the public strongly associates its mark with that brand, consumers will likely assume that products bearing that mark are associated with that brand, regardless of the number of \"knockoff\" manufacturers. The number of manufacturers is therefore a relevant, but not determinative factor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While ETS, in its motion seeking summary judgment dismissing S'well's first and third claims largely relies on a non-existent statistical rule, S'well, by contrast, submits substantial evidence suggesting that the public in fact does associate this particular shape with S'well, including undisputed, significant levels of advertising expenditures, sales success, and unsolicited media coverage.

ETS cites material S'well itself submitted to the PTO in support of its registrations to argue that both bottles contain \"mouths\" that are big enough for ice cubes but small enough for \"drip-free sipping\" and are located in the center of the bottle, so users never need to rotate the bottle to begin drinking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. ETS also asserts that the circular shape is the \"strongest and the easiest to make,\" and that the bottles' smooth tapering at a relatively shallow angle from the base to the mouth permits the bottles to be emptied completely with relatively minor tilts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. The alternative design-straight sides with a sharp angle just before the mouth-creates a \"catch basin,\" so that the liquid in the bottle, rather than smoothly flowing out, is trapped in the depression where the angle changes until the bottle is tilted further, at which point it comes rushing out all at once, leading to spills and other dangers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ETS, however, cites no evidence in the section of its brief making these assertions, and that by itself is enough to defeat these assertions for purposes of a summary judgment motion. Several propositions on which they rely, moreover, are far from self-evident. ETS states that manufacturing a circular shape is the easiest and cheapest option, but a rectangular shape might likely be easier to stack and ship.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs. v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512497\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/6/#p20\">\n    971 F.2d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (7th Cir. 1992) (nail polish manufacturer arguing that square container was functional for these reasons). The founder of S'well also said in her declaration that she made several aesthetic choices when she designed the bottles that she knew would be more expensive. Declaration of Sarah Kauss dated December 4, 2017 \u00b6 5, ECF No. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Furthermore, ETS offers no evidence suggesting that no other designs could have these same functional benefits. S'well has not trademarked all water bottles with gently sloping sides. Indeed, ETS's argument that both the S'ip and S'Well Bottles have ideal shapes, despite the two being shaped differently, suggests that these benefits may be available in other shapes as well. And ETS says nothing about the distinctive bottle cap, which is part of S'well's trade dress. Nor is it clear that S'well and S'ip Bottles have achieved the perfect mouth size. (How many ice cubes will not fit a smaller bottle mouth? How much more spilling does a bigger bottle mouth risk?)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To be sure, container shapes are often functional, and \"society is better served if functional containers ... remain available for use among competitors. To the extent this causes a modicum of confusion of the public, it will be tolerated.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Water Gremlin Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1348054\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/635/841/#p844\">\n    635 F.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 844 (C.C.P.A. 1980). But ETS has not offered sufficient evidence to show that the function the instant combination of design elements serves is otherwise unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although the genuine dispute that therefore exists as to whether S'well's trade dress rights are distinctive and nonfunctional is insufficient in itself to end the inquiry regarding defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's first and third causes of action (see the next section), it is sufficient to deny defendant's motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim seeking cancelation of plaintiff's marks. That motion is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Likelihood of Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even if its mark is valid, a plaintiff cannot succeed on claims of infringement under the Lanham Act or parallel New York State law unless the defendant's use of the mark tends to cause confusion. The Court therefore considers whether customers or potential customers who see the allegedly infringing product (the Force Bottle) are likely to either confuse it with the protected product (the S'well Bottle) or believe that S'well is somehow associated with Force Bottle. In deciding whether a product is likely to confuse consumers about its origins, courts in this circuit examine the eight factors famously enumerated by Judge Friendly in\n   <em>\n    Polaroid Corp. v.

And defendant concedes that the two products are very similar. ETS Mem. at 6. These first two critical factors therefore weigh against granting defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ETS's principal argument is that S'well's claim fails on the third and eighth\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factors. According to ETS, Force Bottles and S'well Bottles are sold in separate markets to sophisticated consumers who would not confuse them. ETS submits a declaration from an expert who opines that distributors that purchase Force Bottles from ETS and the businesses that order those bottles from the distributors are unlikely to be confused about the bottles they purchase.

Ex. 41. A reasonable juror could therefore disagree with the expert's conclusions. Furthermore, ETS and S'well undisputedly do participate, to some extent, in the same markets. Specifically, 10-15% of S'well's business is in the promotional market. ETS 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 21.

Nor does it matter, as ETS argues, that the two bottles are of the same physical quality, particularly where, as here, there is evidence that they are not of the same expressive quality.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Declaration of Sarah M.

The purchase of one product under the mistaken belief that it is another product is a prototypical harm against which the Lanham Act protects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   S'well has also pointed to several examples of actual downstream confusion. At least one retailer mislabeled Force Bottles as \"Swell Bottles\" on its shelves, Safier Decl. Exs. 28-29, and several consumers have contacted S'well customer service in the mistaken belief that they had S'well Bottles, when in fact they had Force Bottles or, perhaps, similar bottles from other brands, Penchina Decl. Exs. 51-53.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   S'well also submitted a report from an expert who conducted an internet survey that shows that 59% of S'well's target demographic-female potential purchasers of stainless steel water bottles-associate the shape at issue with S'well. Safier Decl. Ex. 22, Expert Report of Robert L. Klein at 14. This expert also calculated an overall net confusion rate of 26.6% between the S'well and Force Bottles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30. ETS does not address this expert's findings. And even if it had, the Court, on summary judgment, must draw every reasonable inference in the non-moving party's favor. For purposes of defendant's motion, the fifth\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factor therefore favors S'well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The sixth\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factor is \"whether the defendant adopted its mark with the intention of capitalizing on plaintiff's reputation and goodwill and any confusion between his and the senior user's product.\"\n   <em>\n    Lang v. Ret. Living Publ'g Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11937635\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/949/576/#p583\">\n    949 F.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (2d Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). ETS asserts that it did not know about S'well or the S'well Bottle when it decided to make the Force Bottle. ETS 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 58. According to ETS's CEO, ETS decided to make the Force Bottle \"in response to requests from its distributors who requested that ETS supply them with a cola type bottle that was being supplied by competitors of ETS,\" and ETS only learned about S'well after it began doing research about such a bottle. Declaration of Michael W. Carwin in Support of ETS Express, Inc.'s Opposition to Plaintiff's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment dated December 4, 2017 (\"Carwin Opp. Decl.\"), EOF No. 66, Ex. 21, Declaration of Sharon Eyal \u00b6 2. Given, however, the many years of the S'well Bottle's prominent existence before ETS decided to make the Force Bottle, the credibility of the CEO's assertion is still a genuine and disputed issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, even if ETS initially decided to make a \"cola type bottle\" before it knew about S'well, the evidence tends to show that, before the Force Bottle was actually made, ETS learned of the S'well Bottle. Specifically, ETS employee Adam Kovar sent a list of the available volumes of S'well Bottles to ETS CEO Sharon Eyal and ETS CFO Taly Eyal in an email dated May 2, 2014, just before ETS finalized its first order of Force Bottles. Penchina Decl. Ex. 28. The evidence also tends to show that ETS made changes to the Force Bottle for the express purpose of making it\n   more similar to the S'well Bottle. In a 2015 email exchange with employees of a factory that makes both the Force and S'well Bottles, Kovar told a factory employee, \"[P]lease look at the S'well bottle/lid you make. Ours should be equally as defined as theirs.\" Penchina Decl. Ex. 30. Sharon Eyal then added, \"We really need to match the lid on the left,\" referring to the picture of the S'well Bottle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11937635\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/949/576/#p583\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Kovar later distributed a chart to ETS staff highlighting changes and noting that \"the newer version is identical to S'well's (lid and base).\" Penchina Decl. Ex. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ETS also has a \"Retail Brands Guide\" that compares its products to retail products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Penchina Decl. Ex. 26 (the guide). Although ETS contends this was made for internal use, at least some ETS representatives distributed it to customers.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Stone Dep. 120:13-25 (regional sales representative testifying that he \"blasted\" the guide out to \"probably ... [a] [h]undred, hundred plus\" clients). This catalog compares the Force to the S'well Bottle, with the description and picture of the S'well Bottle taking up almost the entire page and comparably tiny pictures of the Force Bottle at the bottom. Penchina Decl. Ex. 26 at 9. In a deposition, one ETS salesperson said it was \"fair\" to say that ETS tried to \"get the distributor to offer [customers] a Force as the equivalent to the ... S'well\" in which the customer was interested because the retail brands \"invest in marketing and create interest.\" Stone Dep. 161:24-162:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   There is thus sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find that ETS intentionally made its Force Bottle look exactly like the S'well Bottle because ETS meant to take advantage of the strength of S'well's mark. The sixth\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factor therefore militates against granting defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The seventh factor is the quality of the goods. A marked difference in quality \"tends to reduce the likelihood of confusion in the first instance, because buyers will be less likely to assume that the senior user whose product is high-quality will have produced the lesser-quality products of the junior user.\"\n   <em>\n    Savin Corp. v. Savin Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140553\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/439/#p461\">\n    391 F.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (2d Cir. 2004). But, for reasons relating to the positions they take on other claims, the parties take positions on this seventh factor seemingly at odds with their interests. Specifically, ETS argues that the products are similar (which would make confusion more likely) while S'well argues that the Force Bottle is inferior (which would make confusion less likely). While this issue is addressed below in relation to S'well's deceptive practices and false advertising claims under New York law, for immediate purposes the most that can be said is that there is no evidence that Force Bottles are inferior products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For all the foregoing reasons, consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factors demonstrates that there is, at a minimum, a genuine dispute regarding whether it is likely that purchasers and potential purchasers will confuse Force Bottles for S'well Bottles. Defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's claims for trade dress infringement in violation of the Lanham Act and New York common law is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Deceptive Acts and Practices (Fifth Cause of Action) and False Advertising (Sixth Cause of Action) Under New York Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   ETS has also moved for summary judgment on S'well's claims under Sections 349 and 350 of the New York General Business Law. Section 349 prohibits \"[d]eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Bus.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    N.Y.

S'well points to deposition testimony that there have been complaints \"from time to time\" about customer misuse leading to leaks and the \"imprint\" on Force Bottles coming off. Safier Decl. Ex. 9, Deposition of Jennifer V. Campolini 13:22-15:12. Another employee testified that sometimes the products leak because a batch is badly made or because of customer error, but he could point to no specific instance. Penchina Decl. Ex. 3, Deposition of Robert James Derrig, Jr. (\"Derrig Dep.\") 17:1-24. Putting aside hearsay problems, S'well has arguably shown in these instances that Force Bottles are not always perfect. But S'well adduces no evidence that S'well Bottles do not leak when misused or that their customized labels do not occasionally chip off. No reasonable juror could find that Force Bottles are an inferior product based only on this vague testimony and with no evidence of the comparative quality of S'well products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   S'well also points to the plastic Impact Bottle that ETS manufactures, which shares the same shape and cap as the S'well Bottle, but, unlike the S'well Bottle, is not made of stainless steel. S'well 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 35. However, none of S'well's claims in its complaint involved the Impact Bottle, so the extent to which it is confusing is irrelevant. Moreover, no reasonable consumer purchasing plastic Impact Bottles will think she is purchasing a stainless steel S'well Bottle, nor will she infer that S'well's steel bottles are somehow worse simply because a plastic version exists. Such a consumer may think the Impact Bottle is somehow linked to S'well, but that consumer confusion is insufficiently consumer-oriented to state a claim under New York's deceptive practices and false advertising statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claims for violation of New York's deceptive acts and false advertising statutes is therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

By contrast, S'well has moved for summary judgment in its favor only as to liability and only on two of its claims against ETS: false designation and unfair competition under the Lanham Act (its second cause of action) and common law unfair competition (its fourth cause of action).

Nevertheless, despite the confusion (in every sense) generated by the competing discussion in\n   <em>\n    1-800 Contacts\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rescuecom Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit has not overruled\n   <em>\n    1-800 Contacts\n   </em>\n   and S'well has failed meet its requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   S'well argues that the use of a mark to promote other goods at the point of sale is sufficient to meet the \"use in commerce\" requirement, whether it is physically printed on something or not. But the \"use\" of a mark \"in the sale\" of a product falls under the definition of \"use in commerce\" for the\n   sale of services, not goods. S'well, as it must, relies principally on Ninth Circuit precedent, where courts are not bound by\n   <em>\n    1-800 Contacts\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coca-Cola Co. v.

Ex. 26. But ETS's use of the mark in this guide is more akin to use \"in the sale or advertising\" of the product than it is to a sales display. Furthermore, no reasonable juror would find that this guide could confuse a distributor into thinking that the Force Bottle was a version of the S'well Bottle, as it clearly states that the two are simply similar, and the Guide contains dozens of other retail brands along with their ETS analogue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Thus, even if ETS employees actually provided Force Bottles to distributors seeking S'well Bottles without informing them, and even if ETS representatives really did suggest in emails to distributors that Force Bottles were a type of S'well Bottle, ETS nonetheless did not violate Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act because of an absence of applicable \"use in commerce.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because, regretfully,\n   <em>\n    1-800 Contacts\n   </em>\n   remains binding on this Court, and because defendant's alleged use of plaintiff's mark was not \"in commerce\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's second claim, for false designation and unfair competition under the Lanham Act, must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   However, there is no reason to believe that New York courts would impose the same \"use in commerce\" limitation on common law unfair competition claims, including plaintiff's fourth cause of action. The limitation imposed by\n   <em>\n    1-800 Contacts\n   </em>\n   arises from that court's misreading of the text of the Lanham Act, and there is no such statute at issue in New York. Instead, there is only the broad common law. As the Second Circuit has pointed out,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   New York courts have noted the \"incalculable variety\" of illegal practices falling within the unfair competition rubric, calling it a \"broad and flexible doctrine\" that depends \"more upon the facts set forth than in most causes of action.\" It has been, broadly described as encompassing \"any, form of commercial immorality,\" or simply as \"endeavoring to reap where one has not sown\"; it is taking \"the skill, expenditures and labors of a competitor,\" and \"misappropriating for the commercial advantage of one person a benefit or 'property' right belonging to another.\" The tort is adaptable and capacious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Roy Exp.

ETS suggests that the S'well mark has become generic, but puts forward no evidence, such as a consumer study, indicating that the public uses the words \"S'well\" or \"Swell\" to describe the specific shape of a bottle and does not connect the words to a specific source. ETS has not shown, therefore, that there is no genuine dispute as to the validity of S'well's mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   New York courts in trademark cases also examine the eight\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factors to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    George V Restauration S.A. v.

Confusion is even more likely if, as plaintiff alleges, ETS has misled distributors into believing that they did receive S'well Bottles, by either delivering Force Bottles when they ordered S'well Bottles or telling them that Force Bottles are a type of S'well Bottle. The question, then, is whether there is a genuine dispute as to whether or not ETS employees have actually used S'well's trademarked name in the manner alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

S'well points to multiple emails in which various distributors ask for \"S'well\" or \"Swell\" bottles and ETS employees, at least in the threads produced, do not clarify that they only sell Force Bottles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Penchina Decl. Exs. 40-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   ETS maintains that these requests were in fact for Force Bottles, and that, as Sharon Eyal, ETS's CEO, testified, \"a lot of people call it just 'the S'well shape.' \" Carwin Opp. Decl., Ex. 11, Deposition of Sharon Eyal 51:3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Sharon Eyal testified that they \"try\" to train their sales staff to correct customers who ask for S'well Bottles, but repeat customers consistently respond that they know they are getting the Force Bottle and are just referring to the shape, sometimes growing frustrated by being corrected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   132:19-133:15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After this litigation began, S'well employees were told that they must correct distributors asking for S'well Bottles. Penchina Decl. Ex. 47. That email describes itself as being a \"gentle reminder,\" but there is some deposition testimony indicating that salespeople had not previously received this instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Penchina Decl. Ex. 17, Deposition of Jeffrey Hinds 175:20-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   One ETS salesperson testified that, if a distributor references S'well in an email and she responds discussing Force Bottles, she must have \"had a conversation in person or on the phone that's not related in the e-mail, for example, that would have either clarified or I would have had knowledge that they're clear on what our bottle is.\" Carwin Opp. Decl., Ex. 10, Deposition of Cristina Ysselstein 18:13-19. Another employee similarly testified that repeat customers \"get upset sometimes if you keep asking them to confirm what item they're looking for,\" saying things like, \" 'Dang it, Jen. You know what I'm looking for. Stop asking me. You know it's the Force.' \" Carwin Opp. Decl., Ex. 7, Deposition of Jennifer Campolini 54:3-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court finds that a reasonable juror could find for either party on this evidence, making summary judgment inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   S'well has adduced evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude ETS has passed off Force Bottles as S'well Bottles. In one email, a distributor requested that the salesperson requested S'well Bottles, and asked that ETS \"try to get these exact brands and items!\" Penchina Decl. Ex. 41. Another email involved an obviously new customer-she introduced herself in the initial email-who asked for a quote and sample of S'well Bottles. Penchina Decl. Ex. 44. The ETS employee never clarified that they sell Force Bottles, and after several exchanges and the passage of two weeks, the distributor again referred to S'well bottles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This does not square with ETS's story that they corrected new customers who inquired about S'well Bottles. In fact, ETS provides no emails in which an ETS employee clarified that Force Bottles were not affiliated with S'well. ETS is therefore not entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   However, a reasonable juror could also find that these distributors generally used \"S'well\" to reference the shape of the desired bottles, not the brand. S'well argues elsewhere that participants in the market strongly associate the shape of S'well bottles with the S'well brand, supporting an inference that distributors would use \"S'well\" to refer to the shape, but know they will receive Force Bottles. Many of the emails to which plaintiff points appear to be from repeat customers or plainly do not contain all the communications associated with the order. If a juror believes the testimony of S'well salespeople that their general practice was to correct new customers who asked for S'well Bottles, they may reasonably infer that the distributors who requested S'well branded bottles were corrected in separate emails or phone calls. Moreover, if the jury finds ETS employees'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   testimony credible, then they will conclude that the employees believed in good faith that distributors knew they were going to receive Force Bottles even when they used the word \"S'well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Credibility determinations are squarely the province of the jury.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because bad faith is a required element under New York law, and there exists a genuine factual dispute as to whether it was present or absent here, neither party is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Claiming That Force Bottles Are S'well Branded Bottles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   S'well also cites several emails in which it claims that ETS told customers that its Force Bottle is a version of the S'well Bottle specific to the promotional products market. Defendant argues that its employees were not communicating that Force Bottles are S'well-branded, only that the two are very similar, and that Force Bottles are sold mostly in the promotional space while S'well Bottles are sold mostly by retailers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The first email chain is between a distributor and an ETS sales manager in which the distributor asks, referencing the Force Bottle, \"What is the retail brand that looks like this?\" and the manager responds, \"The S'well bottle is the retail version of this bottle.\" Penchina Decl. Ex. 34. The distributor's question suggests that he knows the Force Bottle is not affiliated with \"the retail brand,\" and that the Force Bottle just \"looks like\" the retail brand. A reasonable juror could therefore find that the employee meant to convey only that the Force Bottle is similar to the S'well Bottle, which is sold in retail stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second is an email chain between Rob Derrig, the ETS accounts manager, and Dave Gephart, a potential distributor, with the subject line \"Yeti and S'well.\" Penchina Decl. Ex. 35. The email chain appears to have originated with Derrig, suggesting he wrote the subject line. In the first email, Derrig tells Gephart that he understands Gephart was \"looking for some information on our Polar and h2go force.\" Gephart responds by saying, \"Another large computer company is VERY interested in S'Wells.\" Derrig then provides links to ETS products and says, \"Below are links to our h2go force (S'well).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his deposition, Derrig said that he was \"not meaning to identify it as a S'well product but as a S'well alternative.\" Derrig Dep. 100:20-101:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Third, plaintiff cites an email from Derrig to a distributor in which he references the price for their \"force/S'well\" bottle. Penchina Decl. Ex. 58. Although there is no testimony about this email, ETS argues that Derrig again intended to communicate that the Force Bottle is a similar alternative to the S'well Bottle, not that the two are otherwise related. ETS 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   A genuine dispute remains as to whether these two ETS employees were actually claiming that Force Bottles were S'well-branded bottles or were simply similar in shape. Again, plaintiff's claim turns on the credibility of the ETS witnesses regarding what they meant to communicate in these emails. Both parties' summary judgment motions as to plaintiff's New York unfair competition claims are therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the reasons stated above, defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted dismissing plaintiff's second, fifth, and sixth causes of action (false designation of origin and unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act, deceptive acts and practices in violation of New York General Business law \u00a7 349, and false advertising in violation of\n   New York General Business Law \u00a7 350 ), but is otherwise denied, and plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied in its entirety.
