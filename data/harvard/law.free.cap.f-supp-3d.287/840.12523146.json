GM moves to dismiss on several grounds which can broadly be grouped under challenges to personal jurisdiction for the out-of-state plaintiffs; failure to plead an unreasonable safety hazard or\n   pre-sale knowledge that gives rise to a duty to disclose in support of the consumer protection and fraud claims; failure to adequately plead reliance on the omission; failure to allege the defect manifested during the implied warranty period; and various statute of limitations or pre-suit notice issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As explained below, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Gen IV Vortec 5300 engine suffers from an \"inherent\" \"Oil Consumption Defect.\" SAC \u00b6 7. The engine was installed in each of the Class Vehicles: the 2010-2014 Chevrolet Avalanche; 2010-2012 Chevrolet Colorado; 2010-2013 Chevrolet Express; 2010-2013 Chevrolet Silverado; 2010-2014 Chevrolet Suburban; 2010-2014 Chevrolet Tahoe; 2010-2013 GMC Canyon; 2010-2013 GMC Savana; 2010-2013 GMC Sierra; 2010-2014 GMC Yukon; and the 2010-2014 GMC Yukon XL.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs identify five defects that \"contribute\" to the overall \"Oil Consumption Defect.\"\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the \"primary cause\" are \"piston rings ... [that] do not maintain sufficient tension to keep oil in the crankcase.\" SAC \u00b6 8.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system \"contributes\" to the defect by \"spraying oil directly at the piston skirts,\" which \"overloads and fouls the defective piston rings, triggering oil migration past the rings.\" SAC \u00b6 9.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the PCV system \"vacuums oil from the valvetrain into the intake system, where it is ultimately burned in the combustion chambers\" contributing to excessive oil combustion. SAC \u00b6 10.\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the defective \"Oil Life Monitoring System\" does not monitor oil level, but rather, engine conditions like revolutions and temperature to predict oil quality. SAC \u00b6 11. Because it does not take oil\n   <em>\n    level\n   </em>\n   into account, the system \"directs drivers to travel thousands of miles with inadequate engine lubricity levels, wearing out and damaging moving internal engine components.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   , the oil pressure gauge \"\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   provide any indication as to when the oil pressure ... falls to levels low enough to damage internally lubricated parts or cause engine failure\" and the oil canister symbol does not illuminate \"until well past the time when the Class Vehicles are critically oil starved.\" SAC \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also discuss the impact of the alleged defect on their own vehicles and on other consumers.

Plaintiffs argue this challenge has been waived because Defendant made general appearances and did not object to personal jurisdiction in a timely fashion. Defendant filed its first motion to dismiss on April 10, 2017, Docket No. 47, but the hearing was held on July 5, 2017, Docket No. 60, after the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   on June 19, 2017. Defendant counters that there was no waiver, and, even if there were, it would not apply to the new plaintiffs who were added only to the Second Amended Complaint and for whom this motion is the first opportunity to challenge personal jurisdiction. The Court requested, and the parties have filed, supplemental briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 87 and 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As explained below, Defendant failed to raise its challenge to personal jurisdiction at the first available opportunity with respect to 27 non-California plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this is Defendant's first opportunity to challenge personal jurisdiction with respect to five named plaintiffs who were added to the case in the Second Amended Complaint: the Doepels (Illinois), Vita (New York), Martell (Oregon), and Harris (Washington).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Waiver of Challenge to Personal Jurisdiction as to Original Plaintiffs Already in Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rule 12 permits a party to request dismissal on the basis that a court lacks personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 12(b)(2). However, that defense is \"waive[d]\" if a party \"fail[s] to ... (i) make it by motion under this rule; or (ii) include it in a responsive pleading or in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1).

Though the issue had been percolating (the appeal of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   to the U.S. Supreme Court was already pending), Defendant failed to challenge personal jurisdiction over those Plaintiffs. Then,\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   was decided approximately two weeks\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the hearing on Defendant's first motion to dismiss. Defendant could have filed a notice of supplemental authority or could have requested leave from the Court to submit supplemental briefing, but it failed to do so. Moreover, Defendant did not object to personal jurisdiction at the hearing on its motion. Accordingly, the argument was waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant has not shown that the exception for an argument previously \"unavailable\" applies here. Contrary to Defendant's contention,\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   did not reverse any Ninth Circuit precedent foreclosing Defendant's challenge. Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly stated that its decision did not inaugurate a change in law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Our settled principles ... control this case.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    at 1783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Our straightforward application in this case of settled principles of personal jurisdiction will not result in the parade of horribles that respondents conjure up.\"). Further, the Supreme Court limited its holding and expressly stated that the very question raised by Defendant's challenge here was not addressed in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    at 1783-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]ince our decision concerns the due process limits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    by a State\n   </em>\n   , we leave open the question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, Defendant has not identified a single Ninth Circuit case overturned by\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvarez v.

Cal. Dec. 6, 2017) (holding that personal jurisdiction defense was previously available because\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   did not overturn controlling precedent). Nor has Defendant identified controlling precedent in the Ninth Circuit directly precluding its jurisdictional argument. Rather, Defendant's sole argument is that the Supreme Court reversed the California Supreme Court and Defendant should not have been expected to take a position contrary to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   court. This argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, the California Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   did not control Defendant's available defenses. Though a federal court looks to the long-arm statute of the state in which it resides to determine whether it may exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, California law permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction to the maximum extent permitted under the U.S. constitution's due process clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20410.10\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 410.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the outer boundaries of California personal jurisdiction (and therefore this Court's) concerned a federal question over which the Ninth Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court had ultimate authority, not a question of state law over which the California Supreme Court's decisions controlled. The California Supreme Court's decision did not constitute controlling Ninth Circuit authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, the California Supreme Court's opinion was sharply divided in a four-three vote with a published dissent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Sup. Ct.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446755\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-5th/1/783/\">\n    1 Cal.5th 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20636\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20874\">\n    377 P.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on January 19, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609776,12609777,12609778,12609779,12609780,12609781\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/827/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609769,12609770,12609780,12609781\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/196/610/\">\n    196 L.Ed.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Thus, it is not credible to suggest that by the time Defendant filed its first motion to dismiss four months later on April 10, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 47, it felt so constrained by the California Supreme Court's divided opinion that it could not have been expected to raise or at the very least preserve a personal jurisdiction challenge in this case. And even to the extent Defendant felt constrained by the California Supreme Court, that does not explain why Defendant did not take advantage of a two-week window between\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   and the hearing on its first motion to dismiss to notify the Court it intended to challenge personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Defendant has argued that the waiver of personal jurisdiction is discretionary. The Court is not persuaded. Rule 12's language is mandatory, not discretionary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

BMS itself was an out-of-state defendant, incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York. It sold Plavix in California and engaged in other business activities there, but it \"did not develop Plavix in California, did not create a marketing strategy for Plavix in California, and did not manufacture, label, package, or work on the regulatory approval of the product in California.\" 137 S.Ct. at 1778. The California Supreme Court had nevertheless reasoned that the exercise of specific jurisdiction over the out-of-state plaintiffs' claims was reasonable under its \"sliding scale approach to specific jurisdiction\" under which \"the more wide ranging the defendant's forum contacts, the more readily is shown a connection between the forum contacts and the claim\" because the claims by all plaintiffs were \"based on the same allegedly defective product and the assertedly misleading marketing and promotion of that product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1779 (quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed. That Court emphasized that the interests to be considered in determining whether personal jurisdiction exists include \"the interests of the forum State and of the plaintiff in proceeding with the cause in the plaintiff's forum of choice,\" but that the \"primary concern is the burden on the\n   defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1780 (quotations and citations omitted). This analysis \"obviously requires a court to consider the practical problems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also encompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As the Supreme Court explained, the principle of personal jurisdiction is in part \"a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States,\" as \"[t]he sovereignty of each State ... implie[s] a limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister states.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1780 (citations and quotations omitted). These federalism concerns underpinned\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because of these significant interstate federalism concerns, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that mere factual or legal\n   <em>\n    similarity\n   </em>\n   between the California plaintiffs' claims and the non-resident plaintiffs' claims somehow sufficed to create personal jurisdiction. \"The mere fact that\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California-and allegedly sustained the same injuries as did the nonresidents-does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1781. Rather, \"[w]hat is needed ... is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs could not demonstrate such a connection with respect to the out-of-state plaintiffs because defendant had not done anything related to\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   claims in California. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that California state courts lacked specific personal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants for claims brought by out-of-state plaintiffs, where there were no sufficient contacts between defendants' conduct in connection with those claims and the forum state, California. 137 S.Ct. at 1782-83. This conclusion was driven by the limitations of state sovereignty. Indeed, before analyzing the lack of a connection between California and the nonresident plaintiffs' claims, the Supreme Court emphasized that \"at times, [the] federalism interest may be decisive\" in the personal jurisdiction analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1780 (quotation omitted).

Rather, it focused on whether the new\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   arose out of the same nucleus of operative facts, not whether the claims belonged to the same plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Action Embroidery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248249\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/1174/\">\n    368 F.3d at 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]hen a defendant must appear in a forum to defend against one claim, it is often reasonable to compel that defendant to answer other\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   in the same suit arising out of a common nucleus of operative facts\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248249\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/1174/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"a court may assert pendent personal jurisdiction over a defendant with respect to a\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   for which there is no independent basis of personal jurisdiction so long as it arises out of a common nucleus of operative facts with a\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   in the same suit over which the court does have personal jurisdiction\" (emphasis added) ).

Applying pendent personal jurisdiction to such a plaintiff's claims therefore constitutes a factual extension of\n   <em>\n    Action Embroidery\n   </em>\n   ; the calculus may differ, particularly in light of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   ' holding that a common nucleus of operative facts was not in and of itself sufficient to justify the exercise of a state court's sovereign power over an out-of-state defendant.

They are not strangers to this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, as discussed in more detail in the following section, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the non-resident Plaintiffs' claims in this case will impose only a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   burden on GM. Because the Court has found a waiver of personal jurisdiction with respect to the non-California plaintiffs previously named in this suit, the Court's application of the pendent personal jurisdiction doctrine permits inclusion\n   of only 5 additional Plaintiffs asserting claims under the laws of 2 additional states to this litigation. Those new claims overlap substantially with the claims (including federal claims) already before this Court, arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Third, if the Court were to decline to exercise jurisdiction, GM would face piecemeal litigation and would have to defend itself in several different courts on nearly identical issues.

GM stated that it could not credibly suggest that it lacked resources to litigate in this district, but noted that a federal court sitting in Florida, for example, might be more familiar with Florida law than a federal court sitting in California. Though that may be the case, it is not clear how that translates into a burden, let alone an unreasonable one. In any case, the argument is unpersuasive because federal courts are frequently called upon to interpret the laws of the several States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rabinowitz v.

Cal. Oct. 10, 2014) (explaining that \"federal courts have an equal ability to address claims arising out of state law\" and \"[d]istrict courts regularly apply the law of states other than the forum state\" (citations and quotations omitted) ). Furthermore, GM's argument is undercut by its own proposal that the Court transfer the claims of the out-of-state and California plaintiffs to a single court, the Eastern District of Michigan, which would similarly be called upon to apply non-Michigan state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 90 at 10-12. Defendant therefore has not identified a legitimate burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Further, the Court is hard-pressed to find any unreasonable burden on the facts of this case. As discussed above, because the Court already has jurisdiction over the 5 California plaintiffs' claims and those of 27 nonresident plaintiffs, the sole question here is whether it would be unreasonably burdensome on Defendant for this Court to also exercise personal jurisdiction over the claims of 5 new plaintiffs, which introduce claims under only 2 additional states'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   laws (New York and Oregon). That burden is de minimis, particularly because the alternative would be for those plaintiffs to file new, separate cases under their states' laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, GM has not explained how it would be less burdensome to answer to those plaintiffs' claims in New York, Washington, Oregon, and Illinois rather than San Francisco, as those plaintiffs would likely be able to exercise personal jurisdiction over GM in their home states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In addition, the overarching circumstances meriting the exercise of pendent personal jurisdiction-\"judicial economy, avoidance of piecemeal litigation, and overall convenience of the parties,\"\n   <em>\n    Action Embroidery\n   </em>\n   , at 1181 -counsel in favor of jurisdiction. Judicial economy is better served by having the claims of all plaintiffs heard in this Court where they involve similar legal issues and all arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts relating principally to whether GM's engine was defective, whether the defect was material or posed an unreasonable safety risk, and when GM became aware of the defect. The alternative to hearing those claims in a single forum is to populate the dockets of up to fifty federal courts with nearly identical legal and factual issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, there is an interest in avoiding piecemeal litigation, particularly since Plaintiffs request injunctive relief and certification of a nationwide class. Having the same question proceed in different courts creates the possibility of overlapping nationwide classes, inconsistent outcomes,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), and an obvious waste of judicial resources. Finally, the overall convenience of the parties-including Defendant's-is much better served by having the claims heard in a single forum rather than fifty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, under the particular facts of\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case, all three prongs of the test for specific personal jurisdiction have been satisfied here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Axiom Foods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266693\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1064/#p1068\">\n    874 F.3d at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is undisputed that GM has availed itself of the privileges of conducting business in California, satisfying the first prong. In the absence of any particular federalism concerns, there is a sufficient nexus between the additional non-California claims and GM's contacts with California to satisfy the second prong. The exercise of personal jurisdiction over the 5 new out-of-state plaintiffs' claims would not offend fair play or substantial justice, satisfying the third prong. Moreover, all factors that inform the due process analysis are present here: judicial economy, the avoidance of piecemeal litigation, the overall convenience of the parties, and the minimal additional burden on Defendant all counsel strongly in favor of exercising pendent personal jurisdiction over the 5 new plaintiffs' claims under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Fraud and Consumer Protection Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs bring fraud and consumer protection claims under the laws of several states alleging Defendant unlawfully failed to disclose the excessive oil consumption defect to consumers.

GM disputes both of these points. The Court first analyzes whether Plaintiffs adequately plead that GM had pre-sale knowledge of the defect and that the defect was material. As to whether Defendant had exclusive knowledge of the defect (assuming pre-sale knowledge is established) and whether Plaintiff knew of the material facts, those facts are not disputed. As to whether Defendant actively concealed a material fact, that is discussed below in connection with fraudulent concealment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 888-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Pre-Sale Knowledge of Defect\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To be liable for a failure to disclose, a defendant must have pre-sale knowledge of the defect. The Court previously concluded Plaintiffs had failed to plead such pre-sale knowledge for four reasons. First, the mere fact that GM subsequently re-designed its engine was not probative where the whole engine was re-designed, rather than just the allegedly defective low-tension oil rings. Docket No. 62 at 11. Second, the Court found 81 consumer complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") and consumer forums did not demonstrate knowledge because they did not explicitly state that the cause of the oil consumption was the Low-Tension Oil Ring Defect, and a majority of the complaints were posted in 2014 or later, after the marketing and sale of the 2010-2013 Class Vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Third, Plaintiffs failed to allege that 81 complaints posted over the course of 7 years was an unusually high number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Fourth, the single Technical Safety Bulletin (\"TSB\") identified by Plaintiffs did not show knowledge of a low-tension oil ring defect (the sole defect previously alleged by Plaintiffs) where it explicitly identified other causes for the excessive oil\n   consumption (the AFM and PCV systems).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   However, in the SAC, Plaintiffs have broadened their allegations concerning the nature of the defect. They no longer allege that the low-tension oil ring defect was the sole problem that caused excessive oil consumption. Rather, they allege an \"Oil Consumption Defect\" to which there were several contributing factors, including defective piston rings, a defective AFM system, a defective PVC system, and defective oil warning lights/pressure gauges. In addition to this broader definition, Plaintiffs have bolstered the complaint with additional consumer complaints and other allegations Plaintiffs contend support an inference of pre-sale knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The revised allegations alter the analysis. Most compellingly, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant issued two TSBs specifically related to two of the components they allege contributed to the overconsumption defect: the AFM and PCV systems. With respect to the AFM system, GM issued a TSB in August 2010 that \"acknowledged that the AFM system's oil pressure relief valve contributed to oil consumption and carbon buildup on the piston rings.\" SAC \u00b6 227. With respect to the PCV system, GM issued a TSB in March 2011 that \"acknowledged [the] system contributed to oil consumption.\" SAC \u00b6 231. Because Plaintiffs' class period covers sales from 2010-2013, these two TSBs-issued relatively early in the Class Period in mid-2010 and early-2011-permit the plausible inference that Defendant had knowledge prior to the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re MyFord Touch\n   </em>\n   , 46 F.Supp.3d at 958 (\"[I]t is still reasonable to infer that, if Ford had issued four TSBs and two updates in 2012 alone, Ford should have known of problems with MFT by around 2011,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , before it could recommend what repairs or updates needed to be done.

Thus, unlike before, the Court now has a baseline upon which to conclude that Plaintiffs have plausibly pled an unusual number of complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   It is true, as Defendant points out, that a number of the complaints relate to non-Class Vehicles (models of the same vehicles preceding the Class Period or other vehicles altogether). However, all the vehicles are equipped with the same allegedly defective engine and thus bolster the plausibility of inferring Defendant's general knowledge of the over-consumption problem associated with that engine.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , 37 F.Supp.3d at 1093-94 (TSB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   issued with respect to only one vehicle model permits plausible inference with respect to knowledge of same defective component in other vehicle model). Additionally, since the focus is on\n   <em>\n    pre\n   </em>\n   -sale knowledge with respect to Class Vehicles, the emphasis is rightly on complaints that arose prior to sale of the Class Vehicles. Thus, it is reasonable that complaints associated with earlier model years (several dating as far back as 2008),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 249, support a plausible inference of knowledge with respect to later model years equipped with the same allegedly defective component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   That the complaints do not specifically identify the low-tension oil rings is no longer an issue because Plaintiffs now allege that there were various failing parts associated with the Gen IV Vortec 5300 engine that contributed to overconsumption. Where the complaints all relate to the same phenomenon (excessive oil consumption), the number is unusually high, and all complaints pertain to a group of vehicles with a common component (the engine), one plausible inference is that GM was generally aware of the over-consumption problem with the engine even if it had not yet isolated a specific cause for or solution to the problem. An inference of knowledge is further supported by several consumer complaints which state that the dealers to whom vehicles were presented for repair asserted that it was a \"known\" problem or common issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   To be sure, other inferences might plausibly be drawn from the complaints. For example, since more complaints appear to be associated with earlier models of the vehicles, another plausible inference could be that the defect was substantially repaired or resolved with respect to later vehicles. However, \"[t]hat [GM] is able to identify competing inferences from the same set of facts does not mean that Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   , 37 F.Supp.3d at 1093.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At this pleading stage, Plaintiffs have included sufficient allegations to support a plausible inference that Defendant was aware of the oil consumption defect with respect to the Class Vehicles prior to their sale. Moreover, Defendant has not identified any basis to believe that Plaintiffs could have been aware of the severity of the defect before purchasing the vehicles, so Plaintiffs' allegations support a plausible inference that the details about the cause, extent, and resolvability\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of the defect were within Defendant's exclusive knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Materiality of Defect\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs fail to adequately plead that the information was material because they have not shown it pertained to an unreasonable safety risk. The Court previously dismissed Plaintiffs' allegation of a material defect on two grounds. First, the Court held that as a matter of law Plaintiffs must plead an unreasonable safety hazard under California law in order to demonstrate the defect was material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 62 at 9. Second, the Court held that Plaintiffs had failed to plead an unreasonable safety hazard\n   because \"no facts in this case suggest that the risk of excess oil consumption causes a safety risk,\" and \"Plaintiffs admit that there [was] a functioning oil level gauge that will give advance warning of low levels.\" Docket No. 62 at 10-11. Moreover, \"not a single plaintiff allege[d] that his or her vehicle experienced any damage due to excessive oil consumption;\" no complaints of \"sudden loss of power\" were made; and Plaintiffs did not establish a \"risk of sudden failure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In re-visiting the issue on this motion to dismiss the SAC, the Court notes that both parties in both rounds of briefing overlooked a crucial distinction California law makes with respect to defects arising in-warranty and those arising post-warranty. In its prior holding, the Court treated both situations in an identical fashion, relying on language in\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Several plaintiffs allege they experienced excessive oil consumption during the warranty period. See, e.g., SAC \u00b6 58 (Plaintiff Shorter); SAC \u00b6\u00b6 154-155 (Plaintiff Martell); SAC \u00b6 202 (Plaintiff Bednarek). Consumer complaints also indicate that excessive oil consumption was experienced within the warranty period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6\u00b6 255, 258, 265, 271, 272. GM provides Class Vehicles with a three-year, 36,000 miles \"bumper to bumper\" warranty and a five-year, 100,000 mile powertrain warranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 223-31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF Docket No. 48-22 to 48-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the defect may arise during the limited warranty period. To state a claim for failure to disclose the defect in these circumstances, Plaintiffs need only allege that the defect \"would have caused [them] to not purchase the car if [it] had been disclosed\" to show that it was material.\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206477821\">\n    2013 WL 6477821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (quotation and citation omitted). Plaintiffs have done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6\u00b6 20, 394-395, 411, 443-444, 460. Thus, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded materiality for the in-warranty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Post-Warranty Period Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   With respect to defects that manifested only after the warranty period, Plaintiffs must allege that the defect poses an unreasonable safety hazard.

However, if the nexus is not \"sufficiently close,\" then a plaintiff must allege examples of the safety risk coming to fruition to plausibly plead an unreasonable safety hazard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206477821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that \"a party's allegations of an unreasonable safety hazard must describe more than merely conjectural and hypothetical injuries\") (citation and quotation omitted). A \"sufficiently close nexus\" exists when the causal chain between the alleged defect and the ultimate safety hazard is adequately explained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The nexus is not sufficiently\n   close, however, where the connection is not explained or appears illogical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs adequately allege a sufficiently close nexus and have also provided examples of injury that make their allegations of an unreasonable safety hazard plausible. Plaintiffs allege the Oil Consumption Defect can lead to engine damage and engine failure, exposing drivers to the risk of suddenly inoperable vehicles. SAC \u00b6 245. They allege in detail that the various defects cause excessive oil consumption. For example, the piston rings \"fail to achieve their intended purpose of keeping oil in the crankcase and out of the combustion chamber,\" resulting in \"excessive oil consumption.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 218;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 214-222. Additionally, the AFM system \"overwhelm[s] the independently defective piston rings\" by \"spray[ing] oil directly into the piston skirts (undersides) in quantities that the rings cannot control\" and therefore \"allow[ing] excessive quantities of oil in the combustion chambers where it is burned.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 223-225. The PCV system \"also contributes to oil consumption and engine damage by vacuuming oil from the valvetrain,\" which it is not supposed to do, further contributing to excessive oil consumption. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 228-231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The excessive consumption of oil, in turn, results in insufficient oil and lubricity. SAC \u00b6 244. Low oil levels potentially cause the engine to seize or shut down unexpectedly (causing accidents or stranding occupants), to overheat and catch fire, or to produce engine misfires that cause sluggish throttle response, placing occupants in harm's way by undermining their ability to navigate traffic. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 244-46. Fouled spark plugs may also cause engine misfires, ignition failure, and sluggish throttle response, undermining drivers' ability to accelerate out of harm's way or even to drive at all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 246.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Standing alone, these allegations would likely be insufficient to support a finding of unreasonable safety risk not for lack of a causal chain, but because, as the Court previously explained, arguably \"there is no more of a safety concern [here] than where,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a car gets less gas mileage than advertised,\" as \"the more rapid consumption of gas might lead to a driver running out of fuel on a freeway or other dangerous location, [but] the driver has a fuel gauge to warn him or her of low fuel.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 62 at 10, n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Unlike in their prior complaint, however, Plaintiffs now specifically allege in the SAC that the vehicle's warning systems are inadequate and therefore fail to warn drivers before oil levels are dangerously low. For example, Plaintiffs allege that \"the oil pressure gauge in the Class Vehicles fails to provide any indication as to when a vehicle is dangerously low on oil\" and \"do not indicate a dangerously low oil level until the vehicles have no oil pressure,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   which is \"well beyond the point at which a lack of oil, and oil pressure, will damage or destroy an engine.\" SAC \u00b6 235. Further, Plaintiffs allege that \"the oil canister symbol will not illuminate, and the Class Vehicles will not provide\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   low oil pressure warning, until well past the time when the Class Vehicles are critically low on oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 236 (emphasis added). In particular, Plaintiffs claim they performed testing demonstrating that the low oil pressure indicator does not illuminate until the oil pressure drops below six PSI, below GM's minimum oil specification of 24 PSI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, \"[a]n engine generating six PSI of oil pressure will suffer immediate internal destruction if put under operating loads.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, \"the Class Vehicles communicate\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   visible or audible warnings of destructive oil pressure levels until the engines internally seize or disintegrate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Several Plaintiffs also allege that they suffered various forms of engine damage without a warning from the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In light of these more detailed allegations including the lack of adequate warning, Plaintiffs have pled a sufficiently close nexus between the alleged defects (overconsumption of engine oil and a failure to provide adequate warning) and the safety risk (engine disintegration or failure or engine fire) to plead an unreasonable safety hazard. Though Defendant argues that the existence of its warning systems should preclude liability here, the cases Defendant cites are all decided at the summary judgment or trial stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have included sufficient allegations to create a plausible assertion as to the inadequacy of the warning system and hence the existence of safety risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The plausibility of the causal chain between the defect and the safety hazard is bolstered by allegations that consumers, including Plaintiffs, have reported virtually every problem on the way to the ultimate safety hazard. For example, Plaintiff Perkins alleges that as a result of the Oil Consumption Defect and resulting loss of lubricity, the lifters in his vehicle's engine collapsed. SAC \u00b6 47. Plaintiffs Mr. and Mrs. Doepel allege that their vehicle's engine exhibited loud knocking and emitted white smoke from the tail pipe as a result of the over-consumption of oil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. Plaintiffs Bradford, Kitchen, and Warpinski experienced failures with their lifters and cam shafts, and Warpinski experienced engine knocking, shaking, and running through.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 124, 149. Plaintiffs' allegations are supplemented by a multitude of consumer complaints alleging a variety of similar problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 276 (car \"started smoking really bad whenever I would start it\"); \u00b6 278 (\"[A]fter\n   turning feels like the throttle goes flat\"); \u00b6 258 (\"Traction control problems, engine reduced power, this problem cripples the vehicle\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   A number of consumer complaints also allege that their vehicles' operability became impaired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendant argues that the consumer complaints carry little weight because they did not involve Class Vehicles. However, the complaints involve the same alleged problem (overconsumption of oil), the same types of intermediate problems (spark plugs, smoke, etc.), and the same allegedly defective engine (Gen IV Vortec 5300). Although it is plausible the problems experienced by the non-Class Vehicles were caused by something other than the alleged engine defect, it is at least equally plausible that the engine common to all the vehicles was the common cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Starr v. Baca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1216\">\n    652 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216 (9th Cir. 2011) (\"If there are two alternative explanations, one advanced by defendant and the other advanced by plaintiff, both of which are plausible, plaintiff's complaint survives a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Plaintiff's complaint may be dismissed only when defendant's plausible explanation is so convincing that plaintiff's explanation is\n   <em>\n    implausible\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, the Court must consider whether this safety risk was \"unreasonable\" such that the omission may be considered material even for post-warranty claims, and thus may give rise to a duty to disclose. In considering this question, the Court is mindful that, in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit rejected a claim that a boat motor experiencing premature corrosion posed an \"unreasonable safety hazard\" because of the plaintiffs' \"own characterization of the defect\" as one which \"merely accelerates the\n   <em>\n    normal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    expected\n   </em>\n   process of corrosion.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277760\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1015/#p1025\">\n    851 F.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The Ninth Circuit reasoned that \"[w]ere we to conclude that [plaintiffs'] allegations of premature but otherwise normal wear and tear plausibly establish an unreasonable safety hazard, we would effectively open the door to claims that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Yamaha's outboard motors eventually pose an unreasonable safety hazard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277760\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1015/#p1025\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). Thus, \"the nature of the alleged defect as being primarily one of accelerated timing rather than the manifestation of a wholly abnormal condition weighs against its characterization as 'unreasonable.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277760\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1015/#p1025\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Arguably, the consumption of oil is normal and expected, and the excessive consumption of oil is another way of stating that such consumption is simply an accelerated but otherwise normal process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   might appear to stand for the proposition that a claim based on what is essentially premature or accelerated wear-and-tear that is otherwise normal or expected is categorically precluded. Such a broad interpretation, however, would conflict with prior Ninth Circuit precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Daniel v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , for example, the plaintiffs alleged that a rear suspension defect caused \"premature tire wear,\" yet the Ninth Circuit held that \"[a] reasonable fact finder could infer that a vehicle that experiences premature and more frequent tire wear would pose an unreasonable safety risk ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359011\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1217/#p1226\">\n    806 F.3d 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1226 (9th Cir. 2015). Because\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   does not cite or discuss\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   , the Court cannot infer that\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   announced a broad rule new rule and silently overturned prior precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Regardless of how one might reconcile\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   , the alleged facts in this case present a situation where safety risks, even if due to a gradual (and not sudden) process, may not be discovered in time to prevent harm. Plaintiffs have alleged enough detail to suggest that a reasonable jury on these allegations could conclude the safety risk was unreasonable in light of the inadequate warning system. In light of these allegations, the issue of unreasonableness is a question of fact more appropriately resolved at summary judgment or trial rather than on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re MyFord Touch Consumer Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889913\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/936/#p960\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 960 (N.D.

This component of the reliance analysis is different for omission and concealment than affirmative misrepresentation. In an affirmative misrepresentation case, a plaintiff obviously must plead that they in fact viewed or were exposed to the misleading misrepresentation; otherwise, they could not have relied on it. In contrast, the very premise of an omission case is that the plaintiff was never exposed to certain information that should have been disclosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the reliance analysis proceeds from a very different starting point. Here, the parties dispute the meaning of this distinction in an omission case. GM argues Plaintiffs must allege what advertisements they viewed to plead reliance; this argument appears to confuse the reliance analysis for affirmative misrepresentation with that for omission. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that they are not required to plead what advertisements they viewed with specificity under Rule 9(b) in an omissions case; while Plaintiffs' argument is correct, the main issue, which Plaintiffs do not quite articulate, is that an omissions case does not necessarily require a plaintiff to have viewed an advertisement at all. Rather, a plaintiff's ultimate burden at trial is to present sufficient evidence to \"establish a plausible method of disclosure and to establish that they\n   <em>\n    would have been aware\n   </em>\n   of information disclosed using that method.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1227 (emphasis added). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs met that burden at summary judgment by introducing evidence \"that they interacted with and received information from sales representatives at authorized Ford dealerships prior to purchasing their Focuses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1226. That was sufficient even though \"Ford presented evidence that conclusively establishes that Plaintiffs did not view any advertising materials produced by Ford prior to purchase.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To the extent what advertisements Plaintiffs saw may have some relevance as to what channels of disclosure were available to the Defendant\n   disabuse consumers of the omission,\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   makes clear that the actual viewing of advertisements is not required in an omission case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   , Ford had argued that the plaintiffs could not simply show that they could have received the information through dealerships, but had to demonstrate that the dealerships were contractually obligated to pass on disclosures from Ford or would have done so voluntarily. The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Rather, it was sufficient \"that Ford communicates indirectly through its authorized dealerships,\" that the plaintiffs \"received information about the 'characteristics,' 'benefits,' and 'quality,' of the Ford Focus from Ford's dealerships,\" that the warranty required plaintiffs \"to return to Ford dealerships to perform warranty repairs,\" and that Ford \"circulated its special service messages and technical service bulletins when issues arose with the Focus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1227. Based on that evidence, the Ninth Circuit held \"a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Ford knew that its customers depended at least in part on its authorized dealerships for information about its vehicles and that Ford's authorized dealerships would have disclosed the alleged rear suspension defect to consumers if Ford had required it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The proper focus in an omission case such as this is, therefore, what channels of information customers depend upon and whether the defendant could have taken action to disseminate information through those channels (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , by requiring dealerships to disclose it as in\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ).

What matters in an omission case under\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   is whether the plaintiff had an\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   to receive and therefore rely on the omitted information, not whether they actually received some other, irrelevant information. Although the actual receipt of some information from a defendant might tend to demonstrate that the plaintiff had an opportunity to receive additional information, it is not necessarily the only way to establish such an opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Here, the Plaintiffs who purchased their vehicles (both new and used\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) directly from authorized GM dealerships have adequately pleaded that they had an opportunity to receive the information at the dealerships had it been disclosed to\n   them. Although they have not specifically alleged that they interacted with and received information from sales representatives at the dealerships, it is plausible to infer that they did so (at least at the pleading stage) because it would be highly improbable for a person to walk into a dealership and purchase a vehicle without interacting with a sales representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Further, it is fair to treat Plaintiffs' opportunity to receive information from GM's authorized dealerships as an opportunity to receive the information directly from GM because an agency relationship has plausibly been pled. Though Plaintiffs have not explicitly alleged an agency relationship, the complaint includes allegations from which an agency relationship may plausibly be inferred. For example, the complaint alleges that GM \"instructed\" dealerships how to respond to excessive oil complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18. Moreover, the express warranties submitted by Defendant state that \"GM requests that the vehicle be returned to the selling dealer for all warranty repairs,\" and that \"[i]f you are unable to return to the selling dealer, contact a GM dealer in the United States or Canada for warranty service.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Oxford Decl., Ex. 22 at 1 (Docket No. 48-22) (2010 Chevrolet Limited Warranty).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, for pleading purposes, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged an agency relationship between the dealerships and GM.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re MyFord Touch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889913\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/936/#p960\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d at 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the scope of the agency is a factual one for the jury to resolve, especially as information about Ford's precise relationship with its dealers ... is largely within Ford's possession, custody or control\" and holding that allegations that Ford sent instructions to dealers about how to repair vehicle defect was sufficient at pleading stage). Because Plaintiffs have adequately pled an agency relationship between GM and its authorized dealerships, Plaintiffs' interactions with the dealerships are sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   to constitute the opportunity through which they would have received the omitted information from GM had GM undertaken reasonable steps to disseminate it through its dealerships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   However, a small number of Plaintiffs alleged that they purchased vehicles from an entity other than a GM dealership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The inference that effective disclosure would have been made by Defendant cannot be drawn as to those Plaintiffs because it is not clear what relationship, if any, those dealerships had with GM and whether or not they generally passed information from GM on to consumers, as in\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   .

As discussed above in the context of the implied warranty claim, Plaintiff Olivier's claim should not be dismissed on the basis of the four-year statute of limitations because the complaint does not indicate that he is outside of it. Thus, it may only be dismissed if he discovered the defect more than one year before filing the complaint. There is no indication in the complaint that he discovered the defect more than one year before filing suit, and because statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, Plaintiff Olivier was not required to plead around it. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   GM's request to dismiss Plaintiff Olivier's redhibitory defects claim under Louisiana law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Unjust Enrichment Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Defendant principally argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment because restitution is a remedy, not a cause of action; thus, because Plaintiffs have failed to state any viable causes of action, they no longer have a basis to seek an unjust enrichment remedy. However, in light of the Court's holding denying GM's request to dismiss the consumer protection and fraud claims, it does not follow that the remedy is no longer available to them and should be dismissed. Moreover, as Plaintiffs point out, the Ninth Circuit has held that \"[w]hen a plaintiff alleges unjust enrichment, a court may 'construe the cause of action as a quasi-contract claim seeking restitution.' \"\n   <em>\n    Astiana v. Hain Celestial Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149790\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/753/#p762\">\n    783 F.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762 (9th Cir. 2015). Thus, that restitution may be a remedy is not a basis for dismissing the unjust enrichment claims, and Defendant has not argued that a quasi-contract claim seeking restitution is insufficiently pled or precluded as a matter of law. The Court declines to dismiss on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Defendant also argues that 22 plaintiffs' claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations for unjust enrichment in their state. Plaintiffs do not dispute Defendant's representations regarding each state's statute of limitations except for Alabama and New York (discussed in footnotes),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 23, nn. 12, 13, 14, but argue that the claims are tolled by virtue of the delayed discovery rule or fraudulent concealment. For the same reasons as above, however, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead tolling under the delayed discovery rule. They have, however, adequately pleaded fraudulent concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The table below summarizes the Court's holding with respect to each Plaintiff based on the foregoing.\n

Although the MDL process does not relieve a plaintiff of the burden of demonstrating personal jurisdiction (the transferee court would analyze its personal jurisdiction according to whether each transferor court possessed it), it does suggest that it is not unreasonable, per se, to require Defendant to litigate the out-of-state plaintiffs' claims in this Court.
