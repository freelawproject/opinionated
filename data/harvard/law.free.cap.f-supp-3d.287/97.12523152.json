FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 13, 2016, a grand jury indicted John Oliveira on two counts of distributing fentanyl in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <em>\n    Indictment\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1). On April 18, 2017, Mr. Oliveira pleaded guilty to both counts.\n   <em>\n    Min. Entry for Change of Plea Hearing\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 25). On September 27, 2017, the Court held a presentence conference at which the Court and the parties discussed whether Mr. Oliveira is subject to an enhanced guideline calculation as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.\n   <em>\n    Min. Entry for Presentence Conference\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 17, 2017, the Government filed a sentencing memorandum.\n   <em>\n    Gov't's Mem. in Aid of Sentencing\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 33) (\n   <em>\n    Gov't's Mem.\n   </em>\n   ). On November 8, 2017, the Defendant filed his sentencing memorandum.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Oliveria's Mem. in Aid of Sentencing\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 35) (\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Mem.\n   </em>\n   ). On November 14, 2017, the Government filed a reply memorandum.\n   <em>\n    Gov't's Reply to the Def.'s Mem. in Aid of Sentencing\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 36) (\n   <em>\n    Gov't's Reply\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Generally, the consequences of applying the career offender guideline are two-fold. First, a career offender's criminal history category is automatically adjusted to Category VI. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b). Additionally, a defendant's offense level is adjusted based on the offense statutory maximum term of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These adjustments to the criminal history category and offense level, in turn, affect a defendant's guideline imprisonment range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   If Mr. Oliveira does not qualify as a career offender, his criminal history would be IV, his base offense level would be 24, and his total offense level would be 21, after subtracting three-levels for acceptance of responsibility.\n   <em>\n    Revised Presentence Investigation Report\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18, 27-29, 36 (\n   <em>\n    PSR\n   </em>\n   ). He would face a guideline sentence range of 57 to 71 months.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 2. If the career offender enhancement applies, Mr. Oliveira's criminal history increases from Category IV to Category VI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) is twenty years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C), Mr. Oliveira's base offense level would increase from 24 to 32; meaning that his total offense level would increase from 21 to 29, after taking into account the three-level downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    PSR\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27-28,\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In summary, if the career offender enhancement applies, Mr. Oliveira's guideline imprisonment range would increase from 57 to 71 months to 151 to 188 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the Guidelines, a defendant is a career offender if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There is no dispute that Mr. Oliveira's offense of conviction is a felony that is a \"controlled substance offense,\" or that he was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the instant offense. The only issue is whether Mr. Oliveira has at least two prior felony convictions qualifying as either a \"crime of violence\" or a\n   \"controlled substance offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See Def.'s Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (objecting \"to the use of the robbery or aggravated assault and the unlawful trafficking convictions as predicates for a finding that he is a career offender\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Guidelines define a \"controlled substance offense\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). For purposes of Mr. Oliveira's case, it is critical to this definition that a defendant, who has been convicted of illegal possession of a controlled substance, do so \"with intent ... to distribute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Government has submitted evidence of three prior convictions that might serve as career offender predicates. On March 22, 2006, a Maine court convicted Mr. Oliveira of robbery under 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 651(1)(E).\n   <em>\n    Sentencing Ex.\n   </em>\n   5. The same day, the Maine court also convicted Mr. Oliveira of aggravated assault under \u00a7 208(1)(B).\n   <em>\n    Sentencing Ex.\n   </em>\n   7. On June 3, 2008, the Maine court convicted Mr. Oliveira of trafficking in cocaine under \u00a7 1103(1-A)(A).\n   <em>\n    Sentencing Ex.\n   </em>\n   2.

The Government contends that, because Mr. Oliveira's conduct did not involve heroin or fentanyl, he could only have been convicted under the definitions of \"traffick\" in 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1101(17)(A)-(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Government contends that\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   does not control here because the definition of trafficking for drugs other than heroin or fentanyl does require intent to distribute when defendants merely possess controlled substances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. The Government suggests that \u00a7 1103(3)(B) does not change this analysis, even though it \"gives rise to a permissible inference under the Maine Rules of Evidence, Rule 303 that the person is unlawfully trafficking in scheduled drugs\" if he or she possesses \"[f]ourteen grams or more of cocaine or 4 grams or more of cocaine in the form of cocaine base.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government urges that the analysis \"focuses on the elements of an offense, not on what inferences jurors can make under the rules of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Magasouba v.

Mr. Oliveira argues that possession with intent to do the acts in 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1101 (C), including \"selling, bartering, trading, etc.\" do not necessarily involve \"distributive intent\" as\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Mr. Oliveira also argues that Maine law \"criminalizes possession with no intent to manufacture or distribute\" because 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1103(3)(B) creates an inference or presumption that an individual is trafficking based on possession of fourteen grams or more of cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.

In this District, the Court commonly instructs juries that \"[Y]ou are not limited solely to what you see and hear as the witnesses testify.

You are not compelled to accept any inference established by law. You may reject an inference if you wish. The ultimate decision is up to you. But you must remember that the burden remains on the State to prove each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   presents no obstacle to finding a career offender predicate when a state operates like the federal courts and allows juries to infer distributive intent based on evidence that the defendant possessed quantities exceeding personal use levels. But when a state's laws weigh in on the specific quantity at which juries should make that inference,\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   suggests the Court should examine whether the quantity the state has chosen falls below the level the Sentencing Commission contemplated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   There is little purpose in a state specifying the quantity at which the jury may infer the intent to traffick from mere possession, other than to suggest to the jury what drug quantity the jury should consider to be an appropriate dividing line between possession and trafficking, something that presumably falls outside the common knowledge of most jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This analysis takes the Court one step beyond\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   because, unlike the possession of 2 grams of heroin, the possession of 14 grams of cocaine is not an element of the offense of trafficking cocaine. In distinguishing the ACCA definition of \"serious drug offense\" from \"violent felony,\" the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   was careful to observe that statutory language for \"serious drug offense\" used the phrase, \"involving ... possess[ion] with the intent to distribute,\" and did not use the phrase, \"as an element.\"\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276834\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/87/\">\n    854 F.3d at 95-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The guideline definition of \"controlled substance offense\" does not speak in terms of elements either:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Thus, unlike the ACCA definition of \"violent felony,\" the guideline definition of \"controlled substance offense\" does not restrict its definition to the elements of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Guided by\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that Maine's permissive inference instruction for cocaine demands similar treatment to its conclusive presumption for heroin and fentanyl addressed in\n   <em>\n    Mulkern.\n   </em>\n   Even with the cautionary language of the Maine Model Jury Instruction on permissible inferences, the trial judge's express instruction to the jury about the significance of\n   the possession of 14 grams or more of cocaine for purposes of its determination as to whether the state has proven trafficking is a powerful suggestion to the jury about the dividing line between possession and trafficking. Nor does it matter that Mr. Oliveira pleaded guilty and was not found guilty by a jury of the trafficking crime. Mr. Oliveira was, no doubt, advised by his counsel that if he went to trial, he would have faced the permissible inference instruction and it must have factored into his decision to plead guilty to the trafficking offense. In analyzing the impact of Maine's 14 gram threshold on the career offender guideline, it makes little difference as a practical matter for the accused person whether the state labels that threshold determination as a permissive evidentiary inference or as a conclusive presumption as part of the definition of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At least one other circuit reached a similar conclusion on the effect of a state presumption.

Because it appeared that the New York provisions \"might reach conduct that qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA and conduct that does not,\" the\n   <em>\n    Danielson\n   </em>\n   Court used the jury charge to resolve the ambiguity and concluded that \"it does not appear that Danielson was convicted on the basis of 'mere' possession.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753139\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/666/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Danielson\n   </em>\n   is consistent with the Court's conclusion that statutory presumptions or inferences do impact the analysis under the career offender guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Later, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   Court concluded that the guilty plea necessarily admitted both elements of the offense, possession and intent, which meant the defendant's conviction was an ACCA predicate despite the New York statutory presumption regarding the intent element.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556788\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556788\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/164/\">\n    at 172-173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This conclusion, however, ignores the reality that defendants and their attorneys are faced with the statutory presumption when making plea decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The First Circuit takes a more practical approach before applying the steep penalties of the career offender guideline enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mulkern\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276834\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/87/\">\n    854 F.3d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The difficult question is what is the right amount of drugs a person must possess before this presumption of an intent to distribute is appropriate\"). Functionally, it makes little difference how a state determines the quantity where mere possession implies distributive intent. Whether the state sets a lower bar through a statutory inference, presumption, or the definition of\n   the elements of the offense, the result is similar: federal courts cannot be sufficiently confident that the Sentencing Commission would have intended to apply the career offender enhancement to all of those convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The second question the Court must answer is whether the Maine threshold falls below the level at which federal courts are confident inferring distributive intent from possession.

In order for the career offender enhancement to apply to Mr. Oliveira, therefore, the drug trafficking conviction must qualify as a predicate, as well as either the robbery or the aggravated assault. The robbery and the aggravated assault cannot serve as the two career offender predicates by themselves.
