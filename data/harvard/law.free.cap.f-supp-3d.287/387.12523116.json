Ellis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the Appeals Council granted review of Mendoza's claim, Mendoza submitted a June 28, 2016, report from Dr. Ellis. R. 8, 893-902. Dr. Ellis reviewed the history of Mendoza's mental illness and treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   894-896. Dr. Ellis noted that Mendoza reported that she previously had trouble communicating with her doctors, in part because she had \"difficulty advocating for herself with doctors because she was raised to view them hierarchically and to always be deferential to them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   895. Dr. Ellis also stated that Mendoza reported having a hallucination\n   two weeks prior to her examination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Ellis also stated that although Mendoza had previously been treated with antipsychotic medication, that medication was \"discontinued by her psychiatrist ... at the end of last year.\" R. 894-95. Dr. Ellis recorded diagnostic impressions of \"schizoaffective [d]isorder, depressive type,\" \"[p]anic [d]isorder,\" and \"[a]goraphobia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   897.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Dr. Ellis also completed a mental impairment questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   898-902. It stated that Mendoza had experienced \"episodes of decompensation or deterioration in a work or work-like setting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   900. While Dr. Ellis found that Mendoza had some mild limitations, he found that she had \"marked\" limitations in a number of areas, including in her ability to maintain concentration, perform activities on a schedule, be punctual, work in coordination with others, complete a workday without interruptions from psychological symptoms, perform at a consistent pace, interact appropriately with the public, get along with coworkers, and maintain socially appropriate behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   901.

This statement, however, fails to address the fact that Dr. Ellis specifically states that his opinion related \"as far back as\" August 21, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   902. Given Dr. Ellis's statement, the Appeals Council should have concluded that it was required to consider Dr. Ellis's report because it met the regulatory requirements. It was new. It also related to the time period prior to the ALJ's decision. As for the materiality requirement, \"[e]vidence is material if it is relevant to the claimant's condition during the time period for which benefits were denied, and there is a reasonable possibility that the new evidence would have influenced the ALJ to decide the claimant's application differently.\"\n   <em>\n    Suttles v.

We have already noted Dr. Ellis's report's relevance to the appropriate time period. Moreover, because Dr. Ellis's report found more severe restrictions than other medical opinions considered by the ALJ, a \"realistic possibility\" existed that the ALJ might\n   have reached a different outcome had the ALJ considered Dr. Ellis's report. For example, the ALJ found Mendoza had at most moderate limitations in \"paragraph B\" criteria of listings 12.03 and 12.04, such as \"social functioning\" and \"concentration, persistence or pace.\" R. 34. Dr. Ellis's mental impairment questionnaire, by contrast, found marked difficulties in Mendoza's abilities to,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , \"maintain attention and concentration for extended periods,\" \"[p]erform activities within a schedule and consistently be punctual,\" \"[c]omplete a workday without interruptions from psychological symptoms,\" \"[p]erform at a consistent pace without rest periods of unreasonable length or frequency,\" and \"[m]aintain socially appropriate behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   901. Similarly, although the ALJ found \"no medically identifiable episodes of decompensation for an extended period\" in evaluating the \"paragraph B\" criteria,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   35, Dr. Ellis noted that Mendoza experienced \"episodes of decompensation or deterioration in a work or work-like setting,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   900. These inconsistencies could have affected the ALJ's assessment of Mendoza's RFC inasmuch as the ALJ noted that the RFC determination reflected \"the degree of limitation\" the ALJ found in the \"paragraph B\" mental function analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Commissioner contends that the Appeals Council did in fact consider Dr. Ellis's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm'r Mem. at 22. It is true that the Appeals Council stated at one point that it \"considered\" Dr. Ellis's report. R. 8. However, in the very next sentence, the Appeals Council explains that the report would not affect its decision because the report was \"about a later time\" than the ALJ's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, it appears that the Appeals Council was \"considering\" the report only to determine whether it met the threshold inquiry of whether the report should be considered new evidence. Additionally, we do not believe that the Appeals Council considered the evidence on the merits because it did not give any indication of what weight it gave Dr. Ellis's report, as is usual when the Commissioner considers medical opinions. Accordingly, we find the Commissioner did not consider Dr. Ellis's report and that the case must be remanded for consideration as to what weight it should be given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket # 22) is denied and Mendoza's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket # 11) is granted.

If an impairment fails to satisfy the paragraph B criteria, plaintiff may still meet the requirements of listings 12.03, 12.04, if she can meet the criteria listed in the more serious paragraph C of each section.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537802\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/172/#p180\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 12.03, 12.04. Mendoza does not argue that the record reflects that she meets the paragraph C criteria.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The ALJ also stated that an opinion from Dr. Eli Leiter on October 17, 2013 that Mendoza could not work due to her dysthymic disorder was at odds with that report's statement that Mendoza was psychologically improving, and also pointed out that Dr. Leiter never examined nor treated Mendoza.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    39. Similarly, the ALJ gave \"little weight\" to a FEGS report from July 2013 stating that Mendoza was unable to work because the opinion was based primarily on Mendoza's educational history and age, it was not rendered by an acceptable medical source, the source did not examine Mendoza, and the \"assessment of an unstable bipolar disorder on which the opinion was based stemmed from a one-time examination and the claimant's self-reporting.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Although the ALJ noted that \"[t]he vocational expert testified that a hypothetical individual with the above residual functional capacity could not return to past relevant work as a Housekeeping Cleaner,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    40, the VE in fact testified that a hypothetical individual with such residual functional capacity would be able to return to that job,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    73-74. The Appeals Council found that the ALJ's description of the VE's testimony was a typographical error.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    10.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Mendoza also submitted an additional report from May 21, 2013, from Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, but the Appeals Council dismissed this report as duplicative of evidence that was already considered by the ALJ. R. 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Mendoza argues that the Appeals Council \"refused to admit [Dr. Ellis's opinion] as an exhibit based on its conclusion that the evidence did not relate to the period at issue.\" Pl. Mem. at 9 n.23. However, the Commissioner later explained that the report was \"inadvertently omitted from the administrative record\" in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Supplemental Certification, filed Sept. 8, 2017 (Docket # 20).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Some courts, including this one, have referred to an additional requirement that a claimant show \"good cause\" for failure to introduce the evidence earlier.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Patterson v. Colvin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291877\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/24/356/#p372\">\n     24 F.Supp.3d 356\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). The \"good cause\" requirement cited, however, applies to evidence submitted to a district court, not to evidence submitted before the Appeals Council.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lisa v. Sec'y of Dep't of Health and Human Servs. of U.S.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521348\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/940/40/#p43\">\n     940 F.2d 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 43 (2d Cir. 1991). Thus, the issue of whether Mendoza had \"good cause\" for failing to submit the evidence earlier is not at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    We do not accept the Commissioner's argument that the mere fact that Mendoza's \"psychiatrist discontinued her antipsychotic medication at the end of 2015,\" R. 8, necessarily means that there is no realistic possibility that the ALJ's opinion might be influenced by Dr. Ellis's report.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Comm'r Mem. at 23.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Because we have found that the above grounds require remand, it is not necessary to determine whether remand is also appropriate based on the ALJ's assessment of Mendoza's credibility. Similarly it is not necessary to address Mendoza's arguments regarding the weight given to specific medical sources not addressed herein. The assessment of such evidence and of Mendoza's credibility will necessarily be reconsidered in the context of a record that includes the Commissioner's evaluation of Dr. Ellis's opinion and the State agency opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
