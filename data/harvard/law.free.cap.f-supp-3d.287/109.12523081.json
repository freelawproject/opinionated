CABELL, U.S.M.J.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises from a police encounter that led to plaintiff Christine Mercurio's (\"Mercurio\" or \"the plaintiff\") arrest. She contends that Sherborn Police Department (\"SPD\") officers used excessive force and arrested her without cause and she has brought a multi-count civil rights suit against several SPD officers and the town of Sherborn (\"the Town\"). The defendants move for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 57). The plaintiff opposes the motion and the matter has been fully briefed. (Dkt. No. 66). After careful consideration of the record, the parties' submissions, and the information adduced at a hearing on the motion, the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The reasons for this ruling are explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Arrest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 15, 2012, shortly before 11:00 p.m., the plaintiff was driving with her husband, Mohammed Kimakhe (\"Kimakhe\"), on a portion of South Main Street in Sherborn. (Concise Statement of Undisputed Facts In Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defendants' SUF\"), at \u00b6 7). SPD Officers Mark Scola (\"Scola\") and David Bento (\"Bento\") were dispatched to that area at around the same time, based on a report from a caller that a crime had been committed or was in progress, and that the caller could hear two individuals arguing by the side of the road. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15); Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Concise Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and Statement of Additional Undisputed Facts In Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiff's SUF\"), at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15). The parties agree that neither officer had previously met or interacted with the plaintiff. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 16). The parties also agree that an encounter took place between them when the officers arrived on scene, but offer conflicting versions of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    i. The Defendants' Version\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the defendants, when Officers Scola and Bento arrived, Officer Scola saw the plaintiff standing outside of a car next to a male later identified as Kimakhe. (Id., at \u00b6 17). Officer Scola could hear the plaintiff yelling as he approached. (Id., at \u00b6 18). Shortly thereafter, Officers Scola and Bento saw the plaintiff strike Kimakhe in the face with her fist. (Id., at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers separated the couple and Officer Bento spoke with the plaintiff while Officer Scola spoke with Kimakhe. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22-23). According to Officer Scola,\n   Kimakhe said that he and the plaintiff began to argue while they were driving down South Main Street. (Id., at \u00b6 24). Kimakhe subsequently pulled the car over to the side of the road so the plaintiff could exit the car and call her father, Frank Mercurio, to come and pick her up. (Id.). Kimakhe admitted that the plaintiff punched him in the face but he said that he was fine and did not require any medical attention. (Id., at \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff's father arrived soon afterwards and told Officer Scola that the plaintiff had called him for a ride because she and her husband were arguing. (Id., at \u00b6 26). Upon hearing that the plaintiff and Kimakhe were married, Officers Scola and Bento deemed the plaintiff's conduct to constitute domestic violence warranting an immediate arrest under Massachusetts law, and accordingly decided to place her under arrest. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28).\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The officers informed the plaintiff that she was under arrest and instructed her to place her hands behind her back so they could handcuff her wrists. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32). The plaintiff refused to comply; the officers attempted to gain control of her wrists, but she continued to resist by tightening her arms, shaking, and twisting her body. (Id., \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32-33). The officers subsequently brought the plaintiff to the ground and handcuffed her in the prone position. (Id., \u00b6 34). The officers then asked the plaintiff to rise so she could walk to the police cruiser. (Id., \u00b6 36). The plaintiff refused to get into the cruiser and continued to resist by moving sporadically, squirming, flailing her feet, and kicking. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 38). At some point, the plaintiff struck Officer Scola in the face with a shoe. (Id., \u00b6 39).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Officers Bento and Scola were eventually able to place the plaintiff in the cruiser and close the door. (Id., \u00b6 55). Still, the plaintiff continued to be recalcitrant, and attempted to kick out the rear window of the police cruiser. (Id., \u00b6 56). The officers chose not to secure the plaintiff in the back seat with a seatbelt in light of the difficulties they encountered in arresting her in the first place. (Id., \u00b6 58).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <em>\n     ii. The Plaintiff's Version\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The plaintiff avers that she and her husband were driving home when she asked him to pull over to the side of the road so she could get out and smoke a cigarette. (Id., at \u00b6 24). Kimakhe pulled over and they both stood outside the car while the plaintiff smoked a cigarette. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 24). The plaintiff and Kimakhe were conversing normally when Officers Bento and Scola arrived. (Id., at \u00b6 18). The plaintiff denies that she punched Kimakhe in the face. (Id., at \u00b6 19). Kimakhe also testified in his deposition that, contrary to Officer Scola's report, the plaintiff never struck him, and he did not have any apparent injuries. (Id., at \u00b6 23). Nonetheless, Officers Scola and Bento separated the plaintiff and Kimakhe and questioned each of them separately. While the officers were doing so, Frank Mercurio arrived and in due course told Officer Scola that the plaintiff and Kimakhe were married. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 26).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Following this exchange with Frank Mercurio, Officers Scola and Bento accused the plaintiff of striking Kimakhe in the face and suddenly threw her to the ground without warning or an opportunity to respond to the accusation. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32). Prior to throwing her to the ground, neither officer tried to handcuff the plaintiff or ever informed her that she was under arrest. (Id., \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34). The plaintiff did not struggle or otherwise resist arrest prior to being taken to the ground. (Id., at \u00b6 35).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Once they brought her to the ground, Officers Bento and Scola placed their knees on the plaintiff's back in an effort to hold her down, handcuffed her, and then \"dragged\" her to the police cruiser, where\n    she was \"thrown\" into it \"like a duffle bag.\" (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36, 37). And, because the officers failed to secure the plaintiff with a seat belt, she was \"thrown around the back of the police car\" as the car moved. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 56, 58).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    According to Frank Mercurio, the plaintiff was initially \"squirming around\" but she never resisted arrest and she did not hit Officer Scola in the face with a shoe. (Id., at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40, 55, 57).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n     <em>\n      The Booking Process\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The parties agree that when the officers brought the plaintiff to the Sherborn police station for booking, she complained of pain in her thumb and was given an ice pack. (Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 59). Officer Scola, however, did not observe any physical injuries on the plaintiff. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 59). Officers then handcuffed the plaintiff to a \"Murphy bar\" and instructed her to sit in a rolling chair and answer questions through a glass window. (Defendant's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 62, 68; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 62, 68).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The defendants claim that the plaintiff was uncooperative and continued to resist and kick at the officers but the plaintiff disputes this assertion and maintains that she was initially cooperative and answered the booking questions asked of her. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 69; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 69, 84). Still, both parties agree that at some point during the booking process the plaintiff began hitting the glass window in an effort to get the officers' attention. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 63; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 63). The plaintiff also made several remarks to the effect that she was contemplating suicide and would take her own life by any means necessary. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 70, 85).\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Based on these remarks, the defendants called for an ambulance to transport the plaintiff to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 71, 86, 88; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 71).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    According to the defendants, the plaintiff became increasingly agitated once the ambulance arrived and threatened to \"fight\" any officer who attempted to move her onto the stretcher. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 74, 96, 98). The plaintiff disputes this contention and maintains that she sat calmly with her head down on the Murphy bar, and at no point indicated that she would resist being transported to the hospital. (Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 74, 81, 96, 98).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Regardless, the parties agree that SPD Officer Tedstone pulled the chair from under the plaintiff while she was still handcuffed to the Murphy bar, causing her to fall to the ground. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 73, 75, 102; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 73, 102, 104). The parties also agree that once the plaintiff fell to the ground, she became increasingly combative with the officers attempting to move her onto the stretcher, by flailing her arms and legs, biting, spitting, scratching, and kicking at those around her. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 77, 78, 90; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 77, 78, 90). The plaintiff ultimately was placed in a four point restraint on the stretcher and transported to a local hospital. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 79, 93; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 79, 93).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     C.\n     <em>\n      State Court Proceedings\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The plaintiff was subsequently charged in state court with several criminal offenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 113; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 113). The criminal case was dismissed based on an opinion from the plaintiff's psychiatrist that the plaintiff was suffering from an acute psychotic episode at the time of the incident and was therefore not criminally responsible for her actions. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 108, 110; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 108, 110).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     D.\n     <em>\n      The Plaintiff's Mental Health History\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    In early 2002 the plaintiff was diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features; she has attempted suicide at least four times since then. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4). The plaintiff's condition causes her to experience psychotic episodes during unpleasant or traumatic events. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 6; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 6). During such episodes, the plaintiff hallucinates a male figure that unleashes an army of cockroaches that will bite and ultimately kill her. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 5; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 5).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The parties disagree as to when SPD officers first learned that the plaintiff suffers from a mental illness. The plaintiff maintains that Frank Mercurio told Officers Scola and Bento immediately prior to her arrest that the plaintiff suffers from a mental illness, and pleaded with them to allow him to transport her to a nearby hospital for an evaluation. (Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 41). The defendants state that they did not learn of the plaintiff's mental illness until sometime after arresting her. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 41).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Regardless, the plaintiff claims that she experienced a psychotic episode when Officer Scola and Bento threw her to the ground so they could handcuff her wrists. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6 43; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6 43). As a consequence, the plaintiff was \"in and out of reality\" for the remainder of the evening and could not remember portions of that evening. (Defendants' SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 44, 45; Plaintiff's SUF, at \u00b6\u00b6 44, 45, 53).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of \"assert[ing] the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and then support[ing] that assertion by affidavits, admissions, or other materials of evidentiary\n    quality.\"\n    <em>\n     Mulvihill v.

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    As a threshold matter, the complaint names SPD Officer John Coffey as a defendant but fails to allege any facts implicating him in any aspect of the plaintiff's arrest and/or subsequent treatment. Similarly, the facts-both the undisputed and disputed ones-evince no hint of Officer Coffey's participation in any of the underlying events, and the plaintiff was not able at oral argument to articulate any act or omission by Officer Coffey that might otherwise bring him within the scope of any of the plaintiff's claims.

A stationhouse video camera captured the incident but there was no audio to indicate what if anything Officer Tedstone or any of the several other individuals present said to the plaintiff, or what if anything she said to them. Consequently, even though there is no dispute that Officer Tedstone caused the plaintiff to fall when he deliberately pulled the chair out from under her, there is a dispute as to whether the plaintiff was acquiescent or resistant.

In that regard, there is no evidence or suggestion that either officer was seeking to harm the plaintiff or to do anything other than effect an arrest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    However, once the officers reportedly had the plaintiff on the ground in handcuffs, that is, under control, if they then dragged her along the ground and threw her into the car, that would be a different matter.

In that regard, the court has also reviewed the officers' deposition testimony and finds in it no evidence to suggest that the town of Sherborn failed to promulgate appropriate protocols or properly train its police officers how to proceed in confrontations with suspects who may have a mental health issue or illness.

The plaintiff contends that Officer Scola's police report from the incident provides evidence of such a failure because it does not mention Officer Tedstone's alleged misconduct in pulling the chair from under the plaintiff. The plaintiff reasons that an officer's report should properly report on another officer's misconduct and that, assuming Officer Tedstone's conduct amounted to misconduct,\n    Officer Scola's report should have mentioned it. Because it did not, so the plaintiff argues, the omission should be seen as prima facie evidence of a \"code of silence\" among the SPD and the Town to bury instances of misconduct. The court rejects this argument. Assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that Officer Scola (or some other officer) should have appropriately mentioned the chair incident in his report, it just does not follow that the failure to do so necessarily evinces a municipal policy to conceal such incidents from the public light or scrutiny.

In particular, the version given to the defendants contains a paragraph setting forth Dr. Erwin's opinion that the SPD officers who interacted with the plaintiff \"failed to recognize mental health symptoms\" when they first encountered the plaintiff, and \"compounded\" her trauma with their \"excessive physical control\" of the plaintiff, which was moreover \"exacerbated when the chair was pulled out from underneath her while she was handcuffed to the Murphy bar.\" That paragraph does not appear in the version submitted to the court. The dissonance between the two versions, while concerning, does not bear on the court's summary judgment analysis so it is not necessary at this specific point to determine how or why this happened.
