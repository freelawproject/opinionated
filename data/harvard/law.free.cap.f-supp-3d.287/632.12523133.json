FITZWATER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The court must decide whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge the City of Dallas' (\"City's\") removal of a statue of General Robert E. Lee from City property and to bring claims related to the removal of other Confederate monuments and to title to two cemeteries located within the City of Dallas. Concluding that plaintiffs lack standing, the court grants defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and dismisses this action without prejudice by judgment filed today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2017 the City's Mayor and City Council adopted a resolution (\"Resolution\") directing the City Manager to immediately remove the Alexander Phimster Proctor monument of Robert E. Lee at Lee Park (\"Lee Statue\"), located on City property, and safely store it until a mayoral task force (\"Task Force\") could make recommendations concerning the statue's disposition. The Resolution authorized the City Manager to transfer funds or appropriate funds from excess revenue to remove the Lee Statue and to take appropriate actions to seek private funding to reimburse the expenses associated with this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The same day the Resolution was adopted, plaintiffs Hiram Patterson (\"Patterson\") and Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. (\"SCV\") filed this lawsuit against the Mayor and City Council, in their official capacities, alleging violations of plaintiffs' constitutional rights to free speech and due process and seeking a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") preventing the removal of the Lee Statue and Confederate monuments at Pioneer Park in Dallas. The court temporarily restrained the removal of the Lee Statue. At the conclusion of a hearing held the following day, the court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to show that they were entitled to a restraining order and dissolved the TRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A few days after the court dissolved the TRO, the City removed the Lee Statue and placed it in storage. Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint and a second amended complaint (\"SAC\"). In the SAC, plaintiffs bring a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for alleged violations of their First Amendment free speech rights. They also assert that the City breached SCV's copyright interest in the Lee Statue; that the City breached the reversionary term in the grant of title in the Pioneer Park Cemetery; and that title to the Confederate Cemetery resides in the SCV because title was never delivered, and the City has not exercised possession of the property. Plaintiffs seek damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants now move under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) to dismiss the SAC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs oppose the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court first considers defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[T]he requirement that a claimant have 'standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.' \"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Reduced to its essence, plaintiffs' responsive argument appears to be that, because Patterson holds the political viewpoint that \"the men who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War deserve our respect,\" Ps. Br. 9, and because the Confederate monuments at issue also communicate the same viewpoint, the removal of these monuments from City property somehow infringes Patterson's First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court acknowledges that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury\" sufficient to satisfy Article III's standing requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Elrod v.

In this case, however, plaintiffs have not alleged that\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   has been deprived of any First Amendment freedom for any period of time. Plaintiffs contend that Patterson holds the political viewpoint that \"the men who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War deserve our respect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. But they do not allege that the City has ever taken any action that would prevent\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   from expressing this political view. They have at most alleged that Patterson\n   <em>\n    shares\n   </em>\n   the political viewpoint communicated to the general public by the Confederate monuments. This allegation, however, does not explain how the removal of Confederate monuments from City-owned property prevents Patterson from expressing\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   political viewpoint.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Serra v.

Plaintiffs have failed to cite any case in which a plaintiff's\n   agreement with the message conveyed by someone else's speech-here, the City's-transforms that speech into the plaintiff's speech for First Amendment standing purposes. Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that the City's removal of the Lee Statue and forthcoming removal of other Confederate monuments infringes\n   <em>\n    Patterson's\n   </em>\n   First Amendment free speech rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Patterson also lacks taxpayer standing.

Because this method of establishing standing does not rely on the independent standing of any of the organization's members or any other plaintiff, a challenge to this form of standing is facial unless the defendant adduces evidence attacking a jurisdictional fact on which standing relies.

Although plaintiffs do not separately address whether SCV has organizational standing, they contend in their response that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [t]he SCV's purpose is to protect Confederate-American memorials, images, symbols, monuments, and gravesites for the communication of the political viewpoint that Confederate-American heroes sacrificed for a noble cause that the victors in the war have almost uniformly\n   whitewashed from history. Individual plaintiff, the SCV, and all SCV members have made public affirmations of the values of the military service of their ancestors in the Civil War and in the restoration and reconciliation of the nation subsequently. When the City of Dallas removed [the Lee Statue] and is now threatening all other Confederate-American memorials and symbols in the city, the City's actions established past and imminent concrete injury-in-fact to plaintiffs by the infringement of their political viewpoint communicated by the Monuments....The City's suppression of the political viewpoint communicated in the [Lee Statue] injured plaintiffs, because the suppressed political viewpoint is the same viewpoint that plaintiffs have long protected and promoted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ps.

Plaintiffs filed their brief on motions for preliminary injunction and declaratory judgment on September 26, 2017. After moving on September 29, 2017 to dismiss plaintiffs' SAC, defendants responded on October 12, 2017 to plaintiffs' brief on motions for preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs seek to strike defendants' October 12, 2017 response on various grounds, including that defendants have submitted a redundant pleading, that the court expressly limited defendants to a single response brief, and that defendants' second brief, although styled as a responsive pleading, is formatted as a brief. In their amended motion to strike, plaintiffs maintain that the court should strike defendants' October 12, 2017 brief because it is redundant and was submitted in violation of the court's scheduling order; the court should strike both of defendants' briefs because the briefs are legally insufficient; and, if the court does not strike defendants' second brief, it should consolidate the two briefs and permit plaintiffs to reply to the consolidated brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On October 27, 2017 defendants filed their reply in support of their motion to dismiss. On November 8, 2017 plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions, characterizing the reply as a surreply and a \"second unauthorized pleading,\" Ps. 11/8/17 Br. 3, and requesting \"sanctions against defendants and defendants' attorneys for disobedience of the Court's Scheduling Order by filing unauthorized briefs or pleadings and subsequently refusing to withdraw\n   these pleadings when given the opportunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The court has reviewed defendants' filings and holds that they are procedurally proper.

And their October 27, 2017 reply brief filed in support of their motion to dismiss is authorized under the local civil rules. Accordingly, because defendants have complied with the requirements of the federal and local civil rules and have not violated any applicable scheduling order, the court denies plaintiffs' motions to strike and motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because the court is granting defendants' motion to dismiss, it denies as moot their November 3, 2017 objection and motion to strike affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons explained, the court grants defendants' motion under Rule 12(b)(1) to dismiss plaintiffs' action for lack of standing, and it dismisses this action without prejudice by judgment filed today.

In sum, defendants posit that plaintiffs have failed to allege an injury in fact, causation, or that any claimed injury would be redressed by a favorable decision.
