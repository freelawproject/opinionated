(Def. Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 15; Def. Mem. in Supp. of Def. Mot. (\"Def. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 15-1.)

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court assumes the truth of the factual allegations in the Complaint for the purpose of deciding Defendant's motion. At some time prior to August 31, 2016, Plaintiff allegedly incurred an obligation to Citibank, N.A. (\"Citibank\"). (Compl. \u00b6 15.) According to Plaintiff, \"[t]he ...obligation arose out of a transaction in which money, property, insurance or services, which are the subject of the transaction, are primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) At an unspecified time thereafter, Citibank contracted with Defendant to collect the debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Defendant then sent Plaintiff a written letter dated August 31, 2016, seeking payment in satisfaction of the debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; Def. Collection Letter dated Aug. 31, 2016 (\"Collection Letter\"), annexed to Compl. as Ex. A.) The bottom of the letter listed the creditor as Citibank, N.A., stated that the letter was regarding a \"Citi Mastercard,\" and listed Plaintiff's \"Current Account Balance\" as $26,658.34. (Collection Letter.) The top of the letter stated, in relevant part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The below is an itemized accounting of the debt as required by state statute:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Collection Letter.) Plaintiff filed suit on October 21, 2016 on behalf of himself and all other New York residents who received a collection letter from Defendant in substantially the same form. (Compl. \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant's attempt to collect \"post charge-off interest\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violates sections 1692e and 1692f of the FDCPA, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-47), and that the Collection Letter, in \"fail[ing] to disclose whether the balance may further increase due to interest and fees,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60), fails to \"clearly, explicitly and unambiguously convey the amount of debt\" in violation of section 1692g, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). Plaintiff seeks damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
