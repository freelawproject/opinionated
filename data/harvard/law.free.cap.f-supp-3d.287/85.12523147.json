This matter comes before me on Mentor's motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 5.) For the reasons set out below I\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Mentor's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Novak is one of dozens of individuals who have brought suit against Mentor for injuries allegedly caused by the ObTape. On December 3, 2008, the Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the Mentor ObTape cases before Chief Judge Land of the District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. Order,\n   <em>\n    In re Mentor Corp. ObTape Transobturator Sling Prods. Liab.

On January 14, 2016, Ms. Novak filed her Complaint in the Middle District of Georgia pursuant to a direct-filing order issued by Chief Judge Land on December 12, 2011.

Compl. \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 24, 2017, Mentor moved for summary judgment on all of Ms. Novak's claims. Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 1. The parties completed briefing on Mentor's summary judgment motion on May 15, 2017. On August 16, 2017, Judge Land found that the parties' briefing raised a dispute regarding when Ms. Novak's claims accrued under Maine law. Order of Transfer 2 (ECF No. 9). Judge Land accordingly transferred Ms. Novak's action to this Court. Order of Transfer 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 28, 2017, I issued an order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e)(4) requiring Ms. Novak to supplement the record. (ECF No. 26.) After Ms. Novak responded to that order, I permitted the parties to exchange brief memoranda regarding Ms. Novak's evidentiary submissions.

Def.'s Separate Statement of Material Facts \u00b6 1 (ECF No. 5-2) (\"\n   <strong>\n    DSMF\n   </strong>\n   \"). The ObTape was intended to treat Ms. Novak's stress urinary incontinence. DSMF \u00b6 1. Ms. Novak's surgeon, Dr. Krishna Bhatta, has testified that he cannot recall any specific representations that Mentor made to him regarding the ObTape sling, including any warnings regarding risks specific to that device. Pl.'s Additional Facts \u00b6 13 (ECF No. 6-1 at 7-9) (\"\n   <strong>\n    PSMF\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Dr. Bhatta was aware at the time of Ms. Novak's surgery that, as a general matter, implanting a foreign object into a human abdomen is associated with risks that include infection and abscess, erosion, pain during vaginal intercourse (in medical parlance, dyspareunia ), postoperative pain, bleeding, irritable bowel symptoms, urgency, stress urinary incontinence, and vaginal or pelvic pain. DSMF \u00b6 2. Dr. Bhatta warned Ms. Novak of these risks before he performed her ObTape surgery. Bhatta Dep. Tr. 32 (ECF No. 28-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Novak claims that she experienced several of these symptoms as a result of her ObTape. DSMF \u00b6 3. Shortly after her ObTape surgery, Ms. Novak began experiencing lower abdominal pain. DSMF \u00b6 4. Between eight months to one year after the surgery-toward the end of 2005-Ms. Novak began experiencing pain during sexual intercourse. DSMF \u00b6 5; PSMF \u00b6 4. And sometime before the end of 2006, Ms. Novak began to experience vaginal leaking and vaginal bleeding. DSMF \u00b6 6; PSMF \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Within two years of her surgery-before the end of 2006-Ms. Novak went back to Dr. Bhatta and told him that she was experiencing abdominal pain. PSMF \u00b6 2. Dr. Bhatta did not know what was causing Ms. Novak's pain and ordered several tests. PSMF \u00b6 2. Ms. Novak underwent one inconclusive round of testing but she did not complete the tests because she found them embarrassing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Novak Dep. Tr. 7-8 (ECF No. 7-1). Ultimately, Dr. Bhatta did not provide Ms. Novak with a diagnosis. PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3. Ms. Novak later consulted her regular physician, Dr. Michael MacDonald, who also did not offer an opinion on the cause of her abdominal pain. PSMF \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It was not until 2013 that Ms. Novak first attributed her abdominal pain, dyspareunia, and vaginal leaking and bleeding to the ObTape. PSMF \u00b6 10. On April 24, 2014, Ms. Novak underwent surgery at Broward Outpatient Center in Pompano Beach, Florida, during which Dr. Earle Pescatore removed part of her ObTape.

While the rule may seem harsh, statutes of limitations represent public policy decisions by state legislatures that balance several competing interests. As the Law Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   First, parties injured by the actions of others must be afforded an opportunity to pursue their meritorious claims and seek relief in the courts. On the other hand, potential defendants are entitled to eventual repose and to protection from being required to meet claims which could have been addressed more effectively if asserted more promptly. Difficulties in defending stale claims are caused by faded memories, dead or otherwise unavailable witnesses, and lost or destroyed evidence. Additionally, several courts have attributed to statutes of limitations the function of filtering out those claims which are spurious, inconsequential, and unfounded, because meritorious claims are not usually allowed to remain neglected. The intended effect, then, of statutes of limitations is to stimulate activity and to punish negligence and slumber.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Myrick v.

When it has applied the discovery rule, the Law Court has been moved by situations in which the plaintiff did not and could not know of her injury. For example in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

His right to seek recovery for that injury was not prejudiced by his inability to determine the exact scope of his injuries.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, Mentor asserts that Maine's six-year limitations period applies to bar Ms. Novak's claims for negligence, defective design, manufacturing defects, failure-to-warn, breach of implied warranties, breach\n   of express warranties, and negligent misrepresentation. Def.'s Mem. 1. As Ms. Novak filed suit on January 14, 2016, those claims are time-barred if they accrued before January 14, 2010. Def.'s Mem. 6-7. Mentor claims that it is undisputed that Ms. Novak began to experience the same symptoms that she has attributed to the ObTape-abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, vaginal leaking, and dyspareunia-no later than two years after her initial ObTape surgery on November 11, 2004. PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 6, 8. Mentor argues that because Ms. Novak therefore sustained an injury for which she could have sought judicial vindication no later than November 11, 2006, that is the latest date on which her claims could have accrued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In response, Ms. Novak initially argued that Maine's date-of-injury rule does not apply to this action because the \"Obtape was a condition ... which caused continuous harm to Ms. Novak for the entire time that the device remained implanted.\" Pl.'s Opp'n 5. She claimed that the ObTape's presence in her body therefore constituted a continuing tort and that the statute of limitations was tolled until she had the ObTape removed in 2014. Pl.'s Opp'n 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her supplemental brief Ms. Novak raised a new claim that a genuine dispute exists regarding when the ObTape first caused her injuries. Pl.'s Supp. Reply 1. Ms. Novak asserts that Mentor has produced no evidence that her symptoms in late 2006 were caused by the ObTape. Pl.'s Supp. Reply 1. Although she complains of the same symptoms now, she argues, essentially, that her early symptoms may have had a different cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ms. Novak's claim does not fall within the bounds of Maine's continuing tort doctrine. She has not alleged that Mentor took repeated wrongful actions that, in aggregate or in unidentifiable part, ultimately caused her harm. Instead, she has alleged that there was some finite act or set of acts (manufacture, design, inadequate warning, or misrepresentation) that led to her injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case aligns most closely with\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   where the Law Court refused to apply the continuing tort doctrine\n   despite ongoing harm and found that the statute of limitations began to run when cracks appeared in the siding and nails began to protrude three days after the contractor finished the job. In this case, Ms. Novak first began to experience symptoms of abdominal pain shortly after the operation in 2004, and pain during sexual intercourse, vaginal leaking, and vaginal bleeding began all before the end of 2006. By that time, at the latest, the statute of limitations had begun to run.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Plaintiff's additional claim-raised in her supplemental briefing-that there is a genuine dispute over whether her 2004-2006 symptoms were caused by the OBTape also is without merit. Mentor has provided evidence that the ObTape caused her early symptoms, and Ms. Novak has been unable to point to any contradictory evidence that would establish a genuine dispute. As Mentor explained in its opening brief, Def.'s Mem. 6, Ms. Novak's own expert, Dr. Christopher Walker, reported that Ms. Novak experienced bleeding, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain \"[s]hortly after her implant,\" and that in his medical opinion Ms. Novak's symptoms \"are complications of her ObTape implant.\" Walker Report 3 (ECF No. 5-8). Dr. Walker's report therefore serves as evidence that the symptoms Ms. Novak experienced shortly after her surgery were caused by her ObTape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only evidence that Ms. Novak\n   offers to dispute her own expert's opinion is the fact that neither Dr. Bhatta nor Dr. MacDonald drew any connection between her symptoms and the ObTape when she saw them in 2006. Pl.'s Supp. Reply 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The question before me is whether, on this evidence, a reasonable juror could find that the symptoms Ms. Novak experienced before January 14, 2010 were caused by something other than the ObTape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even drawing all reasonable inferences in Ms. Novak's favor, I find that conclusion to be unsupported. There is no evidence that Dr. Bhatta or Dr. MacDonald made any finding that contradicted Dr. Walker's later determination that Ms. Novak's symptoms were caused by the ObTape. Instead, the evidence shows that Dr. Bhatta's initial testing on Ms. Novak was inconclusive, and that she refused to return for further tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Novak Dep. Tr. 7-8 (ECF No. 7-1). As to Dr. MacDonald, there is no evidence in the record regarding his treatment of Ms. Novak beyond Ms. Novak's testimony that she spoke to him about her lower abdominal pain and that Dr. MacDonald prescribed Detrol to help with her vaginal leaking. Novak Dep. Tr. 9. On this record, a jury could not infer that something other than the ObTape caused Ms. Novak's symptoms without engaging in complete speculation.

Mentor argues that Ms. Novak's claimed injuries are simply the manifestation of those known risks, and that Ms. Novak has no evidence that an additional warning would have altered Dr. Bhatta's decision to implant the ObTape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ms. Novak initially responded by asserting that Dr. Bhatta \"may very well have decided not to use the ObTape if he had been informed about the foreseeable risks associated with the device, such as ObTape's greater risk of erosion as compared to other slings.\" Pl.'s Resp. 7-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Novak's unsupported assertion of fact and speculation regarding what a witness might say at trial are, of course, not evidence.

However, Ms. Novak has offered no evidence whatsoever that this information would have changed Dr. Bhatta's decision to treat Ms. Novak using the ObTape. The information presented in Ms. Novak's supplemental exhibits is not so one-sided that a lay jury could reasonably assume, without any further context, that it would have altered Dr. Bhatta's assessment of the ObTape's risks. And Dr. Bhatta's deposition transcript reflects that Ms. Novak's counsel failed to ask him whether additional information would have altered his decision to go ahead with Ms. Novak's ObTape surgery.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Bhatta Dep.

Counsel further conceded that to put such evidence into the record, they would need to submit an additional declaration or to question Dr. Bhatta at trial. Neither route is available to Ms. Novak. While Ms. Novak might have presented an additional declaration during summary judgment briefing, her counsel failed to do so even after I offered them an opportunity to supplement the record and despite having been on notice of this evidentiary gap since the day they received Mentor's opening brief.
