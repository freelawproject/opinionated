(Dkt. 17). On November 17, 2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order denying Respondents' motion to dismiss and granting Petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction (the \"November 17, 2017, Decision\"). (Dkt. 56). The Court ordered Respondents to immediately adjudicate or readjudicate the parole applications of all members of the putative class of asylum-seekers detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in conformance with their legal obligations, including their obligations under ICE Directive No. 11002.1:\n   <em>\n    Parole of Arriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear of Persecution or Torture\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 8, 2009) (the \"ICE Directive\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65). The Court also ordered Respondents to provide individualized bond hearings to members of the putative subclass who have been detained for six months or more, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66). Familiarity with the November 17, 2017, Decision is presumed for purposes of this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thereafter, on December 19, 2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order granting Petitioners' motion for class certification. (Dkt. 66). Specifically, the Court defined the certified class as follows: \"All arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear interview and who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and who have not been granted parole.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). The Court also defined the certified subclass as follows: \"All arriving asylum-seekers who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, and have been detained for more than six months without a bond hearing before an immigration judge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 8, 2018, Petitioners filed a motion to clarify the preliminary injunction (Dkt. 67), and a motion to expedite consideration of their motion to clarify (Dkt. 68). The Court granted, in part, Petitioners' motion to expedite, setting a briefing schedule for response and reply papers as well as a motion hearing date of January 26, 2018. (Dkt. 73). On January 11, 2018, Respondents filed an interlocutory appeal from this Court's November 17, 2017, Decision. (Dkt. 74). Respondents have since submitted response papers in opposition to Petitioners' motion to clarify (Dkt. 76), and Petitioners have submitted reply papers (Dkt. 78). On January 26, 2018, the Court held argument on the motion to clarify and reserved decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During oral argument, Respondents contended that the Court should not decide the motion without reviewing transcripts of the bond proceedings held before the Immigration Judges (\"IJ\"), which Respondents had neither submitted nor prepared in connection with this motion. The Court granted Respondents an opportunity to file a supplemental submission containing\n   these transcripts. The Court has since received and reviewed the transcripts of the bond hearings of five subclass members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before turning to the substantive issues raised by Petitioners' motion for clarification, the Court emphasizes the narrow scope of Petitioners' motion. Petitioners do not argue that any particular subclass member is\n   <em>\n    entitled\n   </em>\n   to alternative conditions of release or a reduction in the amount of bond. The sole question put to this Court is whether the November 17, 2017, Decision requires an IJ conducting a\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   -style bond hearing to consider alternative conditions of release and a detainee's ability to pay in setting bond after determining that release of the subclass member is appropriate. The Court answers that question in the affirmative, and, for the following reasons, the motion to clarify the preliminary injunction (Dkt. 67) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction Pending Interlocutory Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court first addresses its jurisdiction to entertain Petitioners' motion in view of Respondents' pending appeal. \"Generally, the filing of an effective notice of appeal divests the court of jurisdiction over the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Exp.-Imp.

The Court finds that an IJ's consideration of the subclass members' financial circumstances and alternatives to detention is imperative to the effective enforcement of the injunctive relief set forth in its November 17, 2017, Decision. Indeed, permitting the calculation of bond without requiring consideration of the detainee's ability to pay effectively erodes any legitimate governmental interests justifying continued detention that are set forth in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas v.

In light of Petitioners' submissions demonstrating that IJs have not taken these factors into account in several of the\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   -style bond hearings conducted after this Court's November 17, 2017, Decision (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 67-3), this Court is obligated to clarify what it had assumed went part and parcel with its original order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Therefore, the Court has jurisdiction over Petitioners' motion to clarify notwithstanding Respondents' interlocutory appeal of the November 17, 2017, Decision, pursuant to its inherent authority to supervise compliance with the injunctive relief granted therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Issues Raised in Petitioners' Motion are Related to the Claims Asserted in the Amended Petition and the Motion for Preliminary Injunction and are Meritorious\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioners contend that, although it is not explicitly stated in the Court's November 17, 2017, Decision, the preliminary injunction requires IJs, in setting\n   bond, to consider alternative conditions of release as well as the detainee's ability to pay once the IJ has determined that release is appropriate. Petitioners ask the Court to clarify as much. (Dkt. 67-1 at 12). Respondents argue that Petitioners are not asking for clarification of the preliminary injunction, but rather are seeking entirely new relief based on facts that occurred only after this Court issued the preliminary injunction. (Dkt. 76 at 9). According to Respondents, Petitioners have raised new claims and facts that are beyond the scope of the amended petition, are outside the requirements of the preliminary injunction, and are unrelated to the requirements that the Second Circuit imposed in\n   <em>\n    Lora,\n   </em>\n   the case on which this Court largely based the bond portion of its preliminary injunction decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Respondents further argue that the requested relief would not have been available to Petitioners even if raised in their motion for a preliminary injunction, because there is no relationship between the injury claimed here and the conduct that gave rise to the petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Respondents also argue, in the alternative, that Petitioners' motion for clarification fails on the merits because there is no requirement that an IJ consider an asylum-seeker's ability to pay or alternatives to detention in setting bail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17). Respondents take the position that an IJ\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   consider an alien's ability to pay, as well as alternative conditions of release, but that there is no Supreme Court, Second Circuit, or Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") precedent that requires the IJ to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Because the Court's resolution of that argument is inextricably linked with Respondents' argument that the relief requested in the motion for clarification is outside the scope of the preliminary injunction and the amended petition, the Court will address those arguments together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its November 17, 2017, Decision, the Court ordered Respondents to provide members of the class who have been detained for six months or more with individualized bond hearings, in conformance with\n   <em>\n    Lora.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 56 at 66). The Court found persuasive the reasoning of the majority of the courts in this Circuit, as well as the reasoning articulated by the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Robbins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047748\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/1127/\">\n    715 F.3d 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2013) (\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez II\n   </em>\n   \"), and\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Robbins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357405\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/1060/\">\n    804 F.3d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez III\n   </em>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30). That case law recognizes that prolonged detention is permissible only when it serves legitimate governmental interests. The failure to consider alternative conditions of release and ability to pay undermines the connection between the bond amount and the legitimate governmental interests that might weigh against release. Accordingly, for the following reasons, the Court now concludes that implicit in its November 17, 2017, Decision is a requirement that once an IJ has determined that release is appropriate and bond should be set, the IJ must consider the detainee's ability to pay, as well as alternative conditions of release, in setting the amount of bond. Thus, Petitioners' motion to clarify does not raise new claims and facts beyond the scope of the amended petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lora,\n   </em>\n   the Second Circuit held that, \"in order to avoid serious constitutional concerns raised by indefinite detention, an immigrant detained pursuant to [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ] must be afforded a bail hearing before an immigration judge within six months of his or her detention.\" 804 F.3d at 616.

Once the detainee has established that he \"would not pose a danger to property or persons,\" the IJ \"decide[s] the amount of bond necessary to ensure the [individual's] presence at proceedings\" in the future.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20140\">\n    at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those cases suggest that IJs have significant discretion to determine whether release on bond is appropriate. Once such a determination is made, the IJ's next task is to set bond in an amount that is \"appropriate\" and \"necessary\" to effectuate the government's interest in deterring flight while protecting the detainee's liberty interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although most of the factors that IJs consider in making bond determinations are discretionary, the Court concludes that once an IJ determines that release of the detainee is appropriate, an IJ\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   consider ability to pay and alternative conditions of release in setting bond for an individual detained under \u00a7 1225(b). Constitutional concerns compel that conclusion. As the Ninth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez,\n   </em>\n   \"[w]hile the temporary detention of non-citizens may sometimes be justified by concerns about public safety or flight risk, the government's discretion to incarcerate non-citizens is always constrained by the requirements of due process: no person may be imprisoned merely on account of his poverty.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/\">\n    872 F.3d at 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As explained above, the constitutional avoidance doctrine requires the Court to reach the same conclusion in the context of the detention of a non-citizen asylum-seeker pursuant to \u00a7 1225(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The cases cited by both Petitioners and Respondents make clear that the purpose of bond is to effectuate the government's legitimate purpose of ensuring the detainee's presence at future hearings, and that there must be a connection between the bond amount and that purpose. When a judge fails to consider ability to pay and alternative conditions of release and sets a bond amount plainly outside the reach of an individual's financial resources, such a decision amounts, for all practical purposes, to a denial of bond. The Court rejects Respondents' argument that Petitioners are requesting relief beyond clarification of the preliminary injunction. Petitioners have brought to the Court's attention conduct on the part of Respondents that amounts to a denial of bond for reasons estranged from the government's interest in mitigating the risk of flight or danger to the community. As the court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Celestin,\n   </em>\n   denial of bond under such circumstances \"contravenes the mandates and the logic of\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   .\" Transcript of Oral Argument at 8,\n   <em>\n    Celestin,\n   </em>\n   17 Civ. 2419. For the reasons explained above, an IJ's failure to consider ability to pay and alternative conditions of release in setting bond also raises serious due process concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court concludes that a requirement that IJs consider ability to pay and alternative conditions of release in setting the\n   bond amount is implicit in the November 17, 2017, Decision. Because\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   and the Due Process Clause require such considerations, Petitioners' motion for clarification does not raise new claims and facts beyond the scope of the amended petition and the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Petitioners' Motion is not Barred by\n     <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n      8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (e), and Petitioners are not Required to Satisfy Administrative Exhaustion Requirements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Petitioners are not seeking judicial review of the IJs' decisions; rather, Petitioners ask this Court to clarify whether, per the Court's November 17, 2017, Decision, an IJ, once he or she has determined that release on bond is appropriate, must consider the financial circumstances of each subclass member and alternatives to detention in setting the amount of bond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 67-1). In other words, the question is not whether the IJ could or should have considered those factors in setting the amount of bond, but whether the IJ\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   have done so to properly carry out the\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   -style hearings required by this Court's preliminary injunction.

Since the Court premised its November 17, 2017, Decision upon the constitutional avoidance doctrine, Petitioners' current motion to clarify seeks to vindicate these statutorily-derived process rights, and thus falls outside the scope of \u00a7 1226(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At oral argument, Respondents' counsel represented that the transcripts of the IJ bond hearings demonstrated that Petitioners had raised the issues of alternative release conditions and ability to pay at the\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   bond hearings, and thus, to the extent the issue was raised, the Court is without jurisdiction to review this application. Petitioners' counsel responded that the IJs presiding over the\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   bond hearings did not inquire into these issues, and rejected counsel's attempts to request reconsideration of the bond amount on this ground once the bond amount was set. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 67-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As noted above, Respondents have filed transcripts from the\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   -style bond hearings of five subclass members. The Court has reviewed those transcripts and has determined that Petitioners raised the issue of whether the respective subclass\n   members could afford the bond amount at several of these hearings. However, the question of whether that issue was \"raised\" is wholly different from the question of whether the IJ gave it meaningful consideration. In setting the bond amount in each case, the IJ made no mention of the detainee's ability to pay the bond. Accordingly, the Court does not find that the submitted transcripts rebut Petitioners' contention that the IJs did not consider alternative conditions of release or the subclass members' financial circumstances in setting the bond amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that \u00a7 1226(e) does not bar the relief sought by Petitioners' motion to clarify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Petitioners Were Not Required to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Respondents contend that even if \u00a7 1226(e) does not operate as a bar to Petitioners' request for relief, Petitioners are foreclosed from making this motion because they have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. (Dkt. 76 at 12-15). In reply, Petitioners argue that the doctrine of administrative exhaustion is not applicable to their motion for clarification, and, even if it were, any failure to exhaust administrative remedies should be excused because exhaustion would have been futile. (Dkt. 78 at 10-12). The Court agrees with Petitioners in both respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The district court also concluded that the petitioner was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies.
