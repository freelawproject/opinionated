The Court held hearings on November 27-29, 2017, December 8, 2017, December 19-20, 2017, and January 9, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing (held November 27, 2017), filed December 6, 2017 (Doc. 1545)(\"Nov. 27 Tr.\"); Transcript of Hearing (held November 28, 2017), filed December 6, 2017 (Doc. 1546)(\"Nov. 28 Tr.\"); Transcript of Hearing (held November 29, 2017), filed December 6, 2017 (Doc. 1547)(\"Nov. 29 Tr.\"); Transcript of Hearing (held December 8, 2017), filed December 15, 2017 (Doc. 1577)(\"Dec. 8 Tr.\"); Transcript of Hearing (held December 19, 2017), filed January 4, 2018 (Doc. 1608)(\"Dec. 19 Tr.\"); Transcript of Hearing (held December 20, 2017), filed January 5, 2018 (Doc. 1610)(\"Dec. 20 Tr.\"); Transcript of Hearing (held January 9, 2018), filed January 24, 2018 (Doc. 1683)(\"Jan. 9 Tr.\"). The primary issues are whether the out-of-court statements-largely statements of Defendants Daniel Sanchez, Anthony Ray Baca, Carlos Herrera, and Rudy Perez, and of cooperating Defendants and other inmates-that Plaintiff United States of America intends to offer in evidence at trial to prove the matter\n   asserted: (i) can be admitted notwithstanding the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America's Confrontation Clause; (ii) can be admitted for their truth, because-as coconspirator statements made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) -they are not hearsay; (iii) can be admitted, even though they are hearsay, as statements against penal interest made by an unavailable declarant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3) ; (iv) can be admitted for their truth, because, as admissions offered against Baca, Herrera, or Perez,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), they are not hearsay; (v) can be admitted, with a limiting instruction, in a joint trial if the statement is nontestimonial, incriminates multiple Defendants, and is admissible against some-but not all-of those Defendants; and (vi) necessitate sufficiently many limiting instructions that the Court should alter how the case should be tried. The Court analyzes individually the out-of-court statements at issue and concludes that it can admit nontestimonial statements that are admissible against only some of the Defendants if it gives a limiting instruction. While there will be multiple limiting instructions, the United States' willingness to\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   -ize\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baca's, Herrera's, and Perez' statements removes statements that one Defendant made and that directly incriminate other Defendants from the trial, so the jury will never hear those statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, while the Defendants are entitled to limiting instructions under the Federal Rules of Evidence,\n   there is not much, if anything, that the jury could meaningfully use against the non-declarant Defendants. Using the statements in this way does not violate the Fifth or Sixth Amendments, and the Defendants will receive a just and fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court takes its background facts from the Second Superseding Indictment, filed March 9, 2017 (Doc. 947)(\"Indictment\"). The background facts are largely unchanged from those that the Court provided in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, --- F.Supp.3d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206496441\">\n    2017 WL 6496441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed December 18, 2017 (Doc. 1585). The Court does not set forth these facts as findings or the truth. The Court recognizes that the factual background largely reflects the United States' version of events and that the Defendants are all presumed innocent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case deals with crimes that the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico (\"SNM\") allegedly committed through its members. Indictment at 2. SNM, through its members, operated in the District of New Mexico at all relevant times, and its members engaged in acts of violence and other criminal activities, \"including murder, kidnapping, attempted murder, conspiracy to manufacture/distribute narcotics, and firearms trafficking.\" Indictment at 2. SNM constitutes an enterprise \"as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 1959(b)(2), that is, a group of individuals associated in fact that engaged in, and the activities of which affected, interstate and foreign commerce.\" Indictment at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   SNM is a violent prison gang formed in the early 1980s at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (\"PNM\") after a violent prison riot at PNM during which inmates seriously assaulted and raped twelve correctional officers after taking them hostage. Superseding Indictment at 3. During the riot, thirty-three inmates were killed, and over 200 were injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 3. After the PNM riot, SNM expanded throughout the state's prison system and has had as many as 500 members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3. SNM now has approximately 250 members, and \"a 'panel' or 'mesa' (Spanish for table) of leaders who issue orders to subordinate gang members.\" Indictment at 3. SNM controls drug distribution and other illegal activities within the New Mexico penal system, but it also conveys orders outside the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3. Members who rejoin their communities after completing their sentences are expected to further the gang's goals, the main one being the control of and profit from narcotics trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3-4. Members who fail \"to show continued loyalty to the gang [are] disciplined in various ways, [ ] includ[ing] murder and assaults.\" Indictment at 4. SNM also intimidates and influences smaller New Mexico Hispanic gangs to expand its illegal activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. If another gang does not abide by SNM's demands, SNM will assault or kill one of the other gang's members to show its power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. SNM's rivalry with other gangs also manifests itself in beatings\n   and stabbings within the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. SNM further engages in violence \"to assert its gang identity, to claim or protect its territory, to challenge or respond to challenges, to retaliate against a rival gang or member, [and] to gain notoriety and show its superiority over others.\" Indictment at 4. To show its strength and influence, SNM expects its members to confront and attack any suspected law enforcement informants, cooperating witnesses, homosexuals, or sex offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 5. To achieve its purpose of preserving its power, SNM uses intimidation, violence, threats of violence, assaults, and murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 7. SNM as an enterprise generates income by having its members and associates traffic controlled substances and extort narcotic traffickers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 8. SNM's recent activities in a conspiracy to murder high-ranking New Mexico Corrections Department Officials inspired the Federal Bureau of Investigation's present investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The United States indicates that it does not oppose holding a \"pretrial hearing to determine the existence of a conspiracy before certain co-conspirator statements are allowed before the jury.\" Perez Motion Response at 1. The Perez Motion Response identifies several statements that Perez made:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Rudy Perez made statements while in NMCD that were recorded. Specifically, Perez stated that he supplied two pieces of metal from his walker to be fashioned into shanks for use during the murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Perez said that he even verified with co-defendant Daniel Sanchez that the weapons would be used for the murder. Perez went into detail on why the murder occurred, and why it was justified. Perez stated that he was proud to be assisting the SNM in this manner. These recordings took place in 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Perez was interviewed back in 2014 as part of the original investigation. However, at that time, Perez stated that he was taking a shower and when he got out of the shower, someone had removed a piece of metal from his walker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Perez Motion Response at 2-3. The United States asserts that, for a statement to be admissible under rule 801(d)(2)(E), the court needs to determine: \"(1) a conspiracy existed; (2) that both the declarant and the defendant were members of the conspiracy; and (3) that the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" Perez Motion Response at 3-4. The United States then provides several examples of statements made in furtherance of a conspiracy: \"[s]tatements made to induce enlistment or further participation in the group's activities, to prompt further action on the part of the conspirators, to reassure members of a conspiracy's continued existence, to allay a co-conspirator's fears, or keep co-conspirators abreast of an ongoing conspiracy's activities.\" Perez Motion Response at 5. The United States observes that \"[s]ome of the conspiracy evidence in this case arises from tape-recorded intercepts of direct conversations of the defendants/co-conspirators,\" and predicts that \"[m]uch of this evidence will meet all aspects of the three-part test for admitting co-conspirator statements on its own accord, with little need for independent evidence.\" Perez Motion Response at 7. The United States also predicts that \"a significant amount of evidence will not be introduced under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), but rather through Rule 801(d)(2)(A) as admissions by the defendant himself,\" and that other statements will be offered for purposes other than the truth of the matter asserted. Perez Motion Response at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The November 27-29, 2017 and December 8, 2017 Hearings\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court took up the Defendants' motions for a\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   hearing in its November 27, 2017 hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 10:12-14 (Court).

Garcia Motion at 7 (seeking \"timely pre-hearing disclosure of statements the government intends to introduce at the\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   hearing\"); B.

The Court also provided initial guidance regarding the\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   hearing's structure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   I don't think we should be trying to have a trial like this, and just relying upon the Government's linking it up down the road is the way to go. So I think that we will have a James hearing, and the Government will have to produce a live witness or witnesses. I don't think that a written proffer is enough. The Government-I mean, the Tenth Circuit has also indicated that those are not favored. And so I would prefer to have live witnesses, live witness or witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The Government has asked that they be able to put on a case agent that summarizes the co-conspirator statements. It seems the Tenth Circuit has\n   approved that. I'm not telling the Government how to try their case, and I'm not going to tell them how to do the James hearing. But you've got to make your proof by a preponderance of the evidence. If you think you can establish it with one agent, subject to cross-examination, bringing in the statements, then the Tenth Circuit seems to have approved that, and I will, too, but-so it's not the method that I'm approving. You just have a burden of proving it by a preponderance of the evidence. If you can do it with one witness or witnesses, that's-the Government always has to make that assessment as to how they're going to prove their case. And I can't tell you in advance whether one witness or more are going to be necessary. So you'll have to make that judgment. But in certain situations the Tenth Circuit has indicated that is appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 10:21-12:1 (Court). The United States then proffered \"about 14 plea agreements in this case which will establish at least the first two requirements of James, which is the existence of the conspiracy, as well as membership in the conspiracy.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 17:9-13 (Castellano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The United States stated that those plea agreements are \"basically the plea agreement of each defendant who has pled guilty in this case, including admissions that a conspiracy existed and admissions that other people remaining in the case were members of the conspiracy.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 18:11-15 (Castellano). The Court then asked whether any of the Defendants objected to the introduction of the plea agreements as \"documentary evidence.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 19:19-23(Court). B. Garcia objected, arguing that the United States drafts the plea-agreement statements and that those statements are \"not subject to any kind of evaluation here by the Court as to whether they're to be trusted.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 19:11-18 (Castle). B. Garcia admitted, however, that \"as long as the defense has the opportunity to call those witnesses and examine them ... that would probably be a sufficient remedy to allow us to contest the information within those plea agreements.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 20:9-21 (Castle). No other Defendant objected to the admission of the plea agreements, so the Court admitted those agreements as \"Government's Exhibits 1 through 14 ... for the purposes of the James hearing.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 23:9-13 (Court).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Later that day, the United States reported to the Court that it had reached an agreement with the Defendants regarding\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   hearing procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 102:8-23 (Castellano). The Defendants in the first trial group indicated a preference to proceed directly to a\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   hearing, \"since we're here, and it's the week after Thanksgiving, and we're going to be in front of a jury in two months, we'd just like to get a witness up and get it going.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 105:15-18 (Adams). The Court confirmed that \"everybody else,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the second trial group, \"is going to get bifurcated, get to see the statements first, then you get to decide whether you want a James hearing? Everybody in agreement on that?\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 108:25-109:3 (Court.) None of the Defendants voiced an objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 109:4-5 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The United States then began the\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   hearing for the statements it intends to offer under rule 801(d)(2)(E) at the first trial by calling Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Byran Acee to\n   the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 145:23-24 (Castellano). Acee's direct examination indicated that the United States intends to call \"a witness named Lupe Urquizo\" at trial. Nov. 27 Tr. at 146:21-23 (Castellano). According to Acee's testimony, Urquizo will testify that Baca told him \"to get with the shot callers down at the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility, or Southern,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and to let them know that Baca wanted Javier Molina hit ... and that if they didn't do it, he told Urquizo to just stab him.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 147:8-16 (Acee). That conversation, according to Urquizo, took place \"while he was still at the Level 6 up at PNM, the north facility.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 147:24-148:2 (Acee). Acee's direct examination disclosed another out-of-court statement that Urquizo will relate at trial: David Calbert, an uncharged SNM member, brought \"the paperwork indicating or substantiating the hit on Javier Molina,\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 148:8-11 (Castellano, Acee), and \"explained to Urquizo that Baca wanted the paperwork to go down to Southern in Las Cruces,\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 149:17-19 (Acee).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Acee testified that Urquizo was subsequently transferred to Southern,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 149: 22-25 (Castellano, Acee), and that, while Urquizo was in orientation at Southern, he \"didn't have his property\" and could not \"freely talk\" to other inmates, but he \"had a conversation with both Mario Rodriguez and Timothy Martinez,\" by holding notes up to a window. Nov. 27 Tr. at 150:4-25 (Acee). According to Urquizo, M. Rodriguez and T. Martinez asked, via note, whether he had the Molina paperwork, and Urquizo replied that he had the paperwork, \"[b]ut that it was still in his property.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 150:11-20 (Acee). Two days later, again according to Urquizo, \"Carlos Herrera inquired whether or not Urquizo had the paperwork,\" and Urquizo-who \"had just received his box of property\"-gave the paperwork to Herrera as well as \"Dale Chavez, Juan Mendez, and Alex Munoz,\" three other SNM members, \"and each made a comment to the effect of, Damn, this is it? It's just two sentences in this report.\" Nov. 27 Tr. at 151:1-13 (Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Acee also testified that M. Rodriguez sent a letter to Urquizo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   He sent it under the door. And in that Rodriguez-he communicated that Rodriguez and Sanchez were going to move on Molina. Rodriguez explained the plan. And apologized to Urquizo for moving so quickly. And that the reason he did that is during the Molina hit there were actually supposed to be three individuals that were supposed to be hit at the same time. However, the paperwork didn't come down supporting the subject being\n   hit that Urquizo wanted hit. So that's what that apology was about. And he wanted to-he, Rodriguez-wanted to make sure that Urquizo wasn't upset about that fact. He had a lot of respect for him, and just said, Hey, we've got to move, and it's going to happen quickly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   And that was generally what was in that letter. And Urquizo said he wrote back to Rodriguez and said he understood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 152:8-24 (Acee). Acee stated that \"Urquizo said he heard Daniel Sanchez yell, 'Fuck, yeah' \" toward the end of the Molina hit. Nov. 27 Tr. at 153:6-10 (Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The United States then turned its attention to \"a couple of [out-of-court] statements related to the Julian Romero assault\" that the United States may attempt to present to the jury via Urquizo's trial testimony. Nov. 27 Tr. at 153:11-13 (Castellano). According to Urquizo's account,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Julian Romero was down here at the Southern Facility at the time Urquizo and another member named Jonathan Gomez were in charge of the pod. Word had come down via Jonathan Gomez that they were to hit Julian Romero. And they picked Conrad Villegas to do that. They discussed that. They agreed to it, and they gave that instruction to Conrad. And he followed through with it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The other thing that Urquizo related was that it was important to Baca-that is Anthony Baca-that Julian not be killed; that he just be stabbed or beat up, but not killed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 153:19-154:5 (Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The United States then began questioning Acee about out-of-court statements concerning the Molina murder that-the United States contends-M. Rodriguez made on the day of the Molina murder and that the United States may introduce at trial via Montoya's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 154:6-13, 155:16-18 (Castellano, Acee). Acee testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Mr. Montoya told me that sometime after 5:00 p.m., while in the pod, Mario Rodriguez called out to him and told him to follow him to Rodriguez' cell. Rodriguez gave Montoya a shank and said that it was from Rudy Perez. Rodriguez told Montoya that it was time to put in some work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Montoya asked who, inquiring who was going to be the recipient of the work, if you will. And Rodriguez answered \"Javier.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Montoya asked, \"Why?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   And Rodriguez said, \"Because he's a rat.\" Montoya asked to see the paperwork, and Rodriguez said that it had already been passed to another pod, but that he didn't need to worry because he, Rodriguez, had verified it, as had \"Dan Dan\" or Daniel Sanchez. Montoya had some other questions and asked where he was to actually hit Molina. Rodriguez told him that it would be in Molina's cell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Montoya protested a little bit and said that he didn't think that would be a good location because of the cameras. He argued about the angles of the cameras with Rodriguez. And Rodriguez ultimately said, \"Dan doesn't want the cameras covered. He has an evidentiary hearing coming up, and needs to be seen on camera.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Mr. Rodriguez explained to Mr. Montoya that Jerry Armenta would also have a shank and would help, and that Daniel Sanchez had already talked to Armenta and Armenta was ready. He also told Montoya that \"Red,\" or Timothy Martinez would be helping; that he'd go into Molina's cell and get him high, and then knock him out, so that the two Jerrys, Jerry Montoya and Jerry Armenta,\n   could come in and commence with stabbing Molina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Dan Sanchez came in sometime later and asked, [\"]You know what's up?\" Montoya said, \"Yeah.\" Sanchez said, \"Okay, be trucha,\" which I understand to mean to be careful or to watch out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Armenta explained that he was-he, Armenta-was perching in front of his cell, which is just kind of squatting and hanging out. Daniel Sanchez signaled for Montoya to go upstairs because he'd been downstairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Montoya did. After getting to the top of the stairs, he squatted next to Armenta, and in a low voice said to him, said to Armenta that, \"It's him or us,\" and by \"him,\" he was referring to Molina. And Armenta basically repeated the same thing back, like, \"Yeah, it's either him or us.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 155:19-159:2 (Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The United States then presented, via Acee's examination, out-of-court statements regarding the Molina murder that it may present to the jury by calling T. Martinez as a witness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   So on the morning of the Molina murder, Tim Martinez had come back from his work detail at the wheelchair program. And shortly after entering the pod, Mario Rodriguez called him over, and then told him to go get high. Timothy thought that was an unusual request. I think he described himself as not a regular user of drugs. And so he asked Mario why. Mario Rodriguez again told him, \"Just trust me. Go get high.\" And Timothy kind of objected to that and kept questioning him. So Mario said, \"Sit down, I'll explain what's going on.\" And then they had a conversation about what was to take place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   It was explained to him that the paperwork on Molina had arrived; that he was a snitch, and that he was to get hit. And then from there they went into more detail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   And [M. Rodriguez explained] that Daniel Sanchez had insisted on Martinez participating. Specifically Rodriguez said, \"Dan is making you go.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Martinez said, \"Okay. What do I have to do?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Rodriguez answered, \"Dan wants you to go into the room and beat him up so he can't leave.\" By \"him,\" that would be Molina. \"So that he can't leave the room and Jerry and Jerry\"-being Montoya and Armenta-\"will go in and hit him. They have some bone crushers. And Molina has to go.\" By bone crushers, that's a slang term for larger shanks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   [Later,] Sanchez was in the cell next door to Martinez and began pounding on the wall. Sanchez asked of Martinez, \"Did 'Blue' talk to you\"-something to that effect, \" 'Blue' talk to you yet?\" And Martinez told him that he, \"Blue,\" or Rodriguez had talked to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Q. What was Daniel Sanchez' explanation to Timothy Martinez about why he should be involved?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   A. What Martinez told me-and this is a direct quote-\"You've got to do this. You got to earn your huesos,\" or your bones.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Sanchez went on about how the SNM had lost respect over the years, and they needed to take things back to the old days when the S used violence to get respect. Sanchez said, \"S is about violence. We get respect through violence.\" Martinez said that he questioned Sanchez about why Molina had to be hit and why he needed to be involved in it. Why he, Martinez, needed to be involved in it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   [Sanchez] basically said that Martinez hadn't done anything yet. He hadn't earned his bones, hadn't committed any violent acts, and that he needed to do something more significant than just bring drugs into the institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Martinez told me that Sanchez told him he'd have to do it or else. And Martinez took that to understand that \"or else\" would be you need to do this or you're going to get hit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Q. Now, did Mario Rodriguez at some point explain to Timothy Martinez that he didn't want him to go? By that I mean go to commit the murder?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   A. Yes. As Mr. Martinez explained it, they were friends, and that he had lobbied-he, Mario Rodriguez-had lobbied to have Timothy not go and to get a pass on it. But that Daniel Sanchez had insisted. And Rodriguez said-and this is a quote-\"But if it's your time, you've got to go. You got to do this for the family. Then it will be someone else's time.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Q. And was there an explanation by Mr. Martinez about something to do with Mr. Molina's shank?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   A. Yeah, quite by coincidence, Molina-I mean, he had a shank, but he gave it to Timothy Martinez that morning. He was going to go shower, if I recall. And he said, Here, hold my shank, hold my fiero, or whatever term he used. And Timothy Martinez took the shank and put it in his cell in his commissary bag. Timothy Martinez related that to Mario Rodriguez. And I think they both just thought it was, based on their comments, good fortune on their part that Molina wouldn't have a shank and be able to fight back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   Q. And what was Mr. Rodriguez' comment to Timothy Martinez about having taken the shank?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   A. He said, \"Perfect, now he can't stab you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 159:10-163: 25 (Castellano, Acee). Acee then testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Martinez told me that Sanchez, Daniel Sanchez, had obtained one of them [the shanks] from who they referred to as \"Fat Ass,\" which was sort of a in-house nickname for Rudy Perez. Sanchez had told Martinez that Perez had given him two pieces of metal from his walker, and that that's what they'd made the shanks out of. Sanchez had made the comment to Martinez, \"What else is Fat Ass going to do?\" And actually, the comment made after that was Martinez' opinion. So that concluded what Sanchez said about that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 164:4-14 (Acee). Acee added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   I specifically asked [T. Martinez] what conversation or what statements were made by Mario Rodriguez when they were in the cell, in Molina's cell. And Martinez said that Mario Rodriguez was standing in the doorway. And as Molina was getting up, Mario Rodriguez said, \"He's getting up. What the fuck?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 166:12-17 (Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The United States then transitioned to another set of statements, which Baca made almost two years after the Molina murder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 164:21-23 (Acee), that it intends to present to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Baca and Martinez [were] incarcerated up at the Level 6 at PNM North. And Baca told Martinez, \"If they would have let me out, Javier wouldn't be dead, and that man would still be alive. But they didn't, and what's done is done. When they wouldn't let me out we had to make a statement. They called my\n   bluff. And now they have a dead man on their hands.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Q. Was there ever any indication that Mr. Baca had kept in touch with Jonathan Gomez?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Q. And what was that discussion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   A. Jonathan Gomez, or \"Baby G,\" was and is often referred to as Mr. Baca's protege, and that communications would come down to other members through Jonathan Gomez, and that Jonathan Gomez had related to Timothy Martinez and others that \"Pup\" didn't trust Molina and to-they should keep their eye on Molina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 164:23-165:16 (Castellano, Acee). Acee testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   [A]fter Baca kind of went on a rant with Martinez about Javier Molina, and the fact that the Corrections Department should have listened to him, Baca.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Baca told Martinez that there was stuff in the works for Marcantel and Santistevan. Specifically, he said that he'd like to get the wardens, too. Baca explained that to Martinez, that \"If we hit them, what's the worst that's going to happen? They'll send us out of state, but then they'll ship us back. And then they'll know we're for real. It started with Javier Molina, and now it continues. Javier was a building block for bigger jobs for Marcantel and for the respect we once had.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 167:5-18 (Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Acee then described a set of statements attributed to C. Garcia that the United States may introduce via T. Martinez' testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Q. And what about statements relating from-to Timothy Martinez by Mr. Garcia, Christopher Garcia?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   A. That conversation took place after the first wave of indictments and take-down arrests. When they were out at the Otero prison facility, Martinez said that Chris Garcia-they were actually talking about the guy named Jeremiah Martinez, a/k/a \"Cyclone.\" And the conversation turned to Gregg Marcantel. At the time, Chris Garcia was upset about the situation and blamed it on Baca. He specifically said to Martinez, \"Pup\"-which is an alias for Baca-\"called me saying he needed guns. It was right after the Holly Holmes fight and people were shooting guns in the air. So \"Pup\" tells me he needs some guns for a job to hit Marcantel and Santistevan. And I thought: Who the fuck is going to do that? 'Pup' was talking all drunk, saying Krazo\"-who is Eric Duran-\"had a phone. I didn't trust Krazo so anyway.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Q. And that was a statement by Christopher Garcia?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   A. It was. He and Martinez continued to talk about it. And that's where this Jeremiah Martinez comes up, and how they acquire the firearm that's to be used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Q. What was the nature of that conversation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   A. Garcia was kind of laying out what happened with the Marcantel and the Santistevan hit, or the planned hit, and why it was so screwed up. And he said, \"I called 'Cyclone'\"-in this case that's Jeremiah Martinez-\"for the guns. He gave me some piece of shit .22 or .25\"-caliber. \"Those fucking things weren't going to do shit. They would have just made Marcantel mad. 'Cyclone' claimed it was good one. He had used it a few times.\" And Garcia said, \"It was a piece of shit, maybe one or two shots because the clip was all fucked up.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 167:19-169:6 (Castellano, Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The next day, the United States called FBI Agent Nancy Stemo to the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 40:2-7 (Castellano, Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Stemo described statements that the United States may offer at trial via Armenta's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Daniel Sanchez ordered Armenta to carry out the hit on Javier Molina because he needed to put in work for the SNM. And he stated that if Armenta refused, he could also be killed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Q. And what did he say that Mr. Sanchez said during the time that Mr. Armenta was assaulting Javier Molina?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   A.

What did Mr. Armenta tell you about conversations he had related to the Marcantel conspiracy to murder?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   A.

Okay. Now, I want to turn your attention to a conversation you had with Mario Rodriguez. Did you have a chance to speak to him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   A. I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Q. ... What did Mr. Rodriguez indicate about a statement made to him by Daniel Sanchez related to the Molina paperwork?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   A. While Rodriguez and Daniel Sanchez were reading the paperwork, Daniel Sanchez stated, \"It's done.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Q. And in what context was that made in terms of reviewing the paperwork?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   A.

And had Mr. Rodriguez volunteered to participate in the murder?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   A. He had.

And what was said from Mr. Sanchez about covering the cameras?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   A.

Stemo then identified a document as a \"transcript of a recording of conversations between Rudy Perez and [Billy Cordova],\" that Cordova recorded in February, 2016. Nov. 28 Tr. at 46:24-47-5. The Court admitted that transcript as Government's\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   Hearing Exhibit 16.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 28 Tr. at 48:4-5 (Castellano);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:16-19 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   On November 29, 2017, the United States called Acee to the stand again.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 29 Tr. at 228:11-12 (Acee).

Again, this is to Chavez, a/k/a \"Lonely,\" and Martinez is telling him that at the direction of the viejo, who we believe is Anthony Baca, and that it's about a list Anthony Baca and Chavez had previously discussed. Martinez said that Gregg Marcantel had degraded Anthony Baca and dishonored the SNM. In the letter he ordered Chavez to handle the hit carefully and discreetly. Martinez concluded the letter by threatening Chavez that there were other members on the street to take out any members who refused to carry out the hit. Martinez advised that there would be no more second chances. And then Martinez again referenced a hit list that Anthony Baca discussed with Chavez, and named Marcantel as the priority. And I'm quoting Martinez; he said, \"He must go,\" a reference to Marcantel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   Q.

Yes. Martinez gave Chavez the green light to take out any SNM members who refused to assist with completing the objective of killing Marcantel. Martinez also gave Chavez a deadline of August 31, 2015, at midnight, to complete the hit. Martinez also threatened Chavez that if he failed to do this or refused to conduct it, that he'd be hit as well, as would any other member that failed to go along with the mission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   He also claimed-Martinez claimed that there were three SNM members watching Chavez at the time Chavez was on the street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   Q.

In the letter Martinez gave Griego the flexibility to work out the details of the hits on his own. Martinez threatened Griego by stating if he failed to conduct the hits, he'd be taken out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   Martinez also told Griego that other SNM members would be in touch with him; that they should work together.

The CHS stated that Baca first ordered Billy Cordova, a/k/a \"Little Shadow,\" and Robert Sanchez, a/k/a, \"Tiny,\" to hit STIU Administrator Dwayne Santistevan back in 2014, when they were both released from prison. However, both got picked up while they were on parole, and were unable to enact that plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   Okay, so in October, on October 22, 2015, as part of our investigative strategy, Anthony Baca was returned to New Mexico from U.S. Prison-one of the facilities, one of the four facilities up in Florence, Colorado.

So this is November 29, 2015. The previous evening, Chris Garcia called Mario Montoya and said that he had the gun that was to be used to hit Marcantel. I didn't want to go out in the evening. It's more difficult to do surveillance. So Mario told Chris something, and we set it up for the following day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-330\">\n   So this is a transcript from a body wire that Mario wore when he went to Chris Garcia's house to pick up the firearm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-331\">\n   MR. CASTELLANO: And for purposes of the James hearing, Your Honor, I'm actually moving in the entire conversation as part of the coconspirator statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n   Q. Look at some of the highlighted areas, Agent Acee. There is discussion about a .22 long rifle. What is that referring to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-333\">\n   A. Ammunition, a bullet, a cartridge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n   Q. A .22 long rifle cartridge goes in what type of firearm?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   A. A .22 caliber firearm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-336\">\n   Q. And was there a firearm turned over from one person to another on that date?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-337\">\n   A. Yes. Chris Garcia gave Mario Montoya a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-338\">\n   Q. For what purpose?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-339\">\n   A. To kill Gregg Marcantel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-340\">\n   Q. Okay. And can you tell the Court what this reference is regarding the clip?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n   A. He's referring to the magazine. He says, \"Well, the firearm didn't have a magazine. It needs a magazine to be fully loaded.\" So what Garcia is explaining to Montoya is: \"Put the bullet in the fucker and then you can shoot it. Or you can get a clip and, you know, do it the right way. Order a clip.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-342\">\n   Q. Down here-this is on page 1086 at the bottom of this exhibit, there is a reference to somebody named \"Chuco.\" Can you tell us who that person is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-343\">\n   A. That's Mandel Parker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-344\">\n   Q. And can you tell the Court whether Mandel Parker became part of this conspiracy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-345\">\n   A. He did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-346\">\n   Q. What was the context in which he became involved?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-347\">\n   A. Mario Montoya contacted SNM members on the street, explained the mission that he was on. \"Chuco\" volunteered, and was actually eager to help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-348\">\n   Q. Did he show his interest in joining the conspiracy to murder Gregg Marcantel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-349\">\n   A. Enthusiastically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-350\">\n   Q. On the next page at the bottom is 1087. Tell us about the discussion here with the word feria?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-351\">\n   A. So here, the CHS is expressing some concern that-well, one he's trying to get some money out of this. And then I think that he's kind of negotiating that he should get some money because Marcantel is a, quote, \"big motherfucker.\" And at this point he's been given a .22 to kill him that can only hold one bullet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-352\">\n   Q. And so is there a concern that one .22 caliber round won't do the job for someone as big as Mr. Marcantel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-353\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-354\">\n   Q. And what's the discussion in here about River's Edge 3?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-355\">\n   A. This is where the CHS is reporting that-kind of how he's going to do the hit. They've done their reconnaissance or their scouting. And he's saying that Marcantel, he has two big old dogs. He lives over there on River's Edge 3. That's a housing neighborhood off-I think it's off 528 in either Rio Rancho/Bernalillo area. And he's just saying that he walks the dogs two or three times a week, and that that would be a good place to hit him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-356\">\n   Q. And you see further discussion about killing Santistevan, the question by Mr. Garcia?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-357\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-358\">\n   Q. And if you recall from this conversation, you know what they're talking about when they talk about giving him a double, and leaving him with everything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-359\">\n   A. Yes. They're talking about killing Mandel Parker, and then leaving the murder weapon and any other evidence with Parker, so it looked like he did it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-360\">\n   Q. On the next page at the bottom, it's 1088. Is there-the word \"gauge\" is used there. Do you remember what the discussion referred to at that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-361\">\n   A. Yes. Chris Garcia said that when Montoya expressed some concern about it just being a .22, Garcia said that he also had a shotgun, but he needed more time to get it. I think he said it was at his brother's house. And so he said he'd get the gauge too. It was a good one. He actually did follow up and tell-send Mario either a phone call or a text message saying that, Hey, he had the gauge, do you want to come get it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-362\">\n   Q. And what ultimately happened there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-363\">\n   A. Well, we didn't, because we ended up arresting everybody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-364\">\n   Q. Now, turning to page 1090 of the exhibit. Some discussion about somebody eating at Barelas Cafe. How can you put that in context for us?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-365\">\n   A. This is where Chris Garcia is telling the CHS that he saw Marcantel eating, and that he couldn't believe it. He was at the Barela's Cafe. He was eating by himself. And then later on down there, where you have the highlighted, it says, \"He carries a cuete, too.\" Garcia is telling the source that he carries a gun also, he being Marcantel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-366\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-367\">\n   Q. And at the bottom of the page under the next page it says, \"That's the one I'm going to send 'Pup' out of the state.\" Who is that referring to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-368\">\n   A. That's referring to Marcantel. After the Javier Molina murder, Marcantel is regarded by the SNM as being responsible for sending \"Pup\" and Mr. Sanchez and others out of state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-369\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-370\">\n   So this is just Mario Montoya, the CHS, and Chris Garcia talking about-they're talking about what \"Pup\" wanted, what \"Pup\"-excuse me, what Mr. Baca's instructions were to Mario. And they're talking about the neighborhood. They're talking about the gun. It looks like the fourth block down it says, \"See if I get this clip. If not, um, let me get that gauge, too. What he's saying is if I can order the clip in time for the magazine for this .22, sure. Otherwise, let me get the gauge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-371\">\n   And I had instructed Montoya to get whatever Garcia was providing for this. It didn't matter what they were.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-372\">\n   Q. What was Mr. Garcia's response?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-373\">\n   A. He says, \"Yeah, that gauge, that gauge is perfect. You could even tell what's his name where it's at.\" Some of that is unintelligible. \"If you're around the neighborhood where he walks the\n   dogs, there is going to be cameras.\" And Garcia is just warning them, \"I have cameras at my pad.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-374\">\n   The CHS goes on to say, basically he scouted it. \"There is a back way in. It's down there by the bosque.\" I think what he's referring to is below River's Edge is the Rio Grande River, so there are some walking trails and stuff like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-375\">\n   Q. What is Mr. Garcia's suggestion about going to the barber shop and getting hair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-376\">\n   A. You know, I'm actually-I have reviewed this, but that's not-I guess he's making reference to going to the barber shop to get some hair. Act like they had to use the restroom, and then maybe put it in your pocket and leave, to leave at the crime scene, somebody else's hair. That's what I'm discerning from that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-377\">\n   Q. So, in other words, if you left someone's hair at the scene, would that provide a DNA sample of other people?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-378\">\n   A. Yes. Either that or even attaching someone else's hair to your head. Either way, it's to throw off the crime scene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-379\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-380\">\n   It says-this is Garcia talking and there is some overlap. He's talking about what I believe is a light affixed to the shotgun. He says, \"This fucker is bright. You turn the bright on it, and I swear to God, the light on it is bright as fuck. And\"-unintelligible-\"during the daytime, like that, where the, where the\"-unintelligible-\"I got it\"-unintelligible-\"it's a pretty bright light.\" He goes on to say, \"You know what I mean brights\"-and the something-and so the CHS and Garcia are kind of interacting how to come up with this light affixed to it, I believe, and approach somebody, and all they can see is the light and then you see it says, \"Boom!\" there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-381\">\n   So that's based on my listening live at the time, reviewing this, and then debriefing the source immediately after, that that's what they were talking about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-382\">\n   The next one, I would turn the page to 1089. This was-this stood out with me starting at the top where they're talking about Andrew. And that's Andrew Romero. Now, he's not a defendant in this case. He was just convicted in the state of murdering the Rio Rancho Police Officer. And shortly after that he was brought into the SNM, while he was incarcerated at Central. And there has been some disagreement among members on whether or not he should be in or not, because he may have been a rat before. And that's what they're talking about here. But there is other conversation where that murder of that cop may have made him a good guy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   Nov. 29 Tr. at 234:10-269:8 (Castellano, Acee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   The United States finished examining Acee regarding Exhibit 26 on December 8, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 28 Tr. at 206:9-13 (Castellano, Court). The United States began with questions about Exhibit 26 statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-385\">\n   Q. Okay. I'm going to go ahead-and we've covered some other parts of the conversation, so I'll move to Bates stamp 1095 on that transcript. I'll start here with the highlighted portion, where the CHS says, \"I'm going to put this away and Imma come back.\" Can you tell us what's going on there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-386\">\n   A. The CHS has received a .22 caliber pistol from Garcia, and he's telling him that he's going to go put it away, and that he'll come back to the house afterward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-387\">\n   Q. Okay. Then tell us about the rest of the conversation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-388\">\n   A. Mr. Garcia brings up \"Chuco,\" who is Mandel Parker. Do you want me to read from this, or just tell you what I know of it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-389\">\n   Q. Yes, tell us what the rest of the conversation means in the context of this page.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-390\">\n   A. Sure. So Mr. Garcia says, \"Then with 'Chuco' too he has to be, like you said, right after we take him, if he looks\"-unintelligible. Both are speaking at the same time, there is overlap-\"take it all.\" Garcia says, \"At all just right there. Even if he has to take him to the fucking thing and get him and put the thing on him. The weapon on him, and leave it on, leave it there. A la verga. It's fucked up, but if he-if he right away gets out and says, What's up fool.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-391\">\n   Montoya says, \"I'm gonna say nothing. He's not gonna say nothing. You're gonna get down and do it and that's it. I mean\"-unintelligible-\"do it. I'm going to do it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-392\">\n   Garcia says, \"Yeah.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-393\">\n   Montoya says, \"I'll do it and then I'll do him right after, know what I mean. I already, I already pretty much got\"-unintelligible-\"good.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-394\">\n   Q. Let me stop there. What's going on in the context of that conversation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-395\">\n   A. Garcia is expressing some doubts about \"Chuco,\" Mandel Parker, who had previously agreed to help Mario Montoya kill Marcantel and Santistevan. And what they're discussing is \"Chuco,\" or Mandel Parker, might be a weak link. If he gets picked up, he might tell. So that they're discussing killing Parker, and leaving all the evidence, to include the murder weapon, with Parker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-396\">\n   Q. So was it your understanding from the operation that Mr. Baca, Mr. Garcia, and Mr. Parker had agreed to kill Secretary Marcantel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-397\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-398\">\n   Q. Okay. I'm turning to the next page. It's Bates stamped 1096. And I want to focus on the last statement highlighted on the page, which is Mr. Garcia's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-399\">\n   A. Garcia says, \"Give him a hotshot, you know, whatever. But hey, just tell him, yeah, fucking a, my only chance, let me put in some jale for you. I told him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-400\">\n   Q. What was your understanding of the discussion about the hotshot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-401\">\n   A. Garcia is suggesting to the CHS, Mario Montoya, that he give Mandel Parker a hotshot, which is a fatal dose of heroin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   Dec. 8 Tr. 207:12-209:23 (Castellano, Acee). The United States then asked Acee some questions about statements in Exhibit 16:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-403\">\n   Q. Okay. I want to turn attention to a statement here by Rudy Perez referring to \"Crocodile\" answering for it and BB answering for it. Do you see that portion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-404\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-405\">\n   Q. Can you tell us basically what the statement is and who was involved in the statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-406\">\n   A. Do you want me to read it first, or just-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-407\">\n   Q. Go ahead and read it, and then put it into context, please.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-408\">\n   A. Rudy Perez says, \"Yeah, and you know, check this out, a, and it's like what was discussed. 'Crocodile' about has to answer for it. BB has to answer for it, um, I think there is four or five that have to answer. Why it was never done the first the paperwork got sent down.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-409\">\n   Q. Do you know what that is a discussion about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-410\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-411\">\n   Q. What is it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-412\">\n   A. Mr. Perez is talking about the prior times the paperwork for Javier Molina was sent down to Southern. \"Crocodile\" is an SNM member who was\n   in charge of the pod; I don't remember his name. BB was another SNM member in charge of the pod down there. That's Javier Rubio. And they're going to have to answer for the fact that paperwork went down and Molina wasn't hit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-413\">\n   Q. And who is that statement attributed to? I'm going to draw your attention to the next portion there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-414\">\n   A. Mr. Perez is saying, \"I, I heard 'Pup' say they have to answer for that no matter how close I am to them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-415\">\n   Q. Okay. And so what type of conspiracy are we talking about when it comes to the paperwork and \"Pup,\" or Mr. Baca saying people have to be responsible?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-416\">\n   A. There was an expectation that when the paperwork was produced, the other members of the gang would act on it. They didn't. And in this statement Mr. Perez is saying that he heard from \"Pup,\" Anthony Baca, that they would have to answer for it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-417\">\n   Q. And is that because from the investigation you've learned that the paperwork went down previously, but the murder was not committed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-418\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-419\">\n   Q. The next statement is from DeLeon Bates stamp 20544. I'm going to direct your attention now to more discussion about paperwork. Who is making the statement this time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-420\">\n   A. Mr. Perez.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-421\">\n   Q. And what is the statement as it relates to paperwork?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-422\">\n   A. Within that statement he's saying, quote, \"He's got the paperwork a year before. That's when he told me, hey, we got it. Yes, but we're not gonna show it. So you just make sure you show some love, no?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-423\">\n   Q. Okay. And then continue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-424\">\n   A. The CHS says, \"Orale, so hey, that's-so that's why-so that's why that fool Javi, Javier was fucking always sending coffee to him because he knew he was a chaffa fucker.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-425\">\n   Perez says, \"He was. He was covering his ass, dog.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-426\">\n   Q. Can you tell the Court whether that was a further discussion of the paperwork that was discussed just a minute ago in your testimony?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-427\">\n   A. Yes, I believe it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-428\">\n   Q. And for purposes of context, are you familiar with the word \"chaffa\" that's on that page?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-429\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-430\">\n   Q. What does that generally refer to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-431\">\n   A. They're no good.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-432\">\n   Q. I'm drawing your attention to DeLeon Bates stamp 20555.

I'll start where you pointed, or-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-434\">\n   Q. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-435\">\n   A. So the CHS is asking, \"So that's what it was, it was the paperwork on Jesse Sosa.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-436\">\n   Mr. Perez responds, \"That, that, that, that was part of it, and then Archie's boy was the other half.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-437\">\n   Q. And I'll show you right here. Tell us what Mr. Perez says about his discussions with others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-438\">\n   A. Toward the bottom of his statement, Mr. Perez says, \"I told them vatos not like\"-unintelligible-\"think about that, and they basically told me, you know what, a this is going to happen regardless, just stay out of it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-439\">\n   Q. Now, what's your understanding of the context of this statement? Stay out of what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-440\">\n   A. The Molina hit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-441\">\n   Q. And was it your understanding from the investigation that there was a conspiracy to murder Javier Molina?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-442\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-443\">\n   Q. And once again, DeLeon 20557. I'm going to direct your attention here to a statement by Mr. Perez.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-444\">\n   A. Mr. Perez is saying, \"You feel me? Like I say, they told me to shut up and just stay out of it, and they did what they wanted to do. Then later on, suicide mission was there.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-445\">\n   Q. And what's the discussion about the pieces?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-446\">\n   A. CHS asked Mr. Perez, \"So why did you give them pieces, carnal?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-447\">\n   Q. Okay. Continue on down the page with the discussion, and tell us who was making each statement here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-448\">\n   A. They continue talking about the pieces, and Mr. Perez says, \"I just, I just get out of it, let them do their own thing. I was nobody, I just, fuck it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-449\">\n   The source says, \"Yeah, but they fucking got them\"-unintelligible-\"from your fucking, from your walker, carnal. Could have gotten you caught up, you know what I'm saying?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-450\">\n   Mr. Perez says, \"Oh, it did, it did. Look where I'm at.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-451\">\n   Q. Let me take you down the page here to Mr. Perez' explanation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-452\">\n   A. Mr. Perez says, \"I just got out of the hold\"-I believe that's a mistake; it should be hole-\"I was real sick. So for me to actually participate in doing some dirt\"-unintelligible-\"physically I wasn't able to. But we all have to do our part.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-453\">\n   Q.

One way or another, homes, everybody has to put their part. Do you feel me?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-455\">\n   Q. Now, taking you back to the pieces. What is that a discussion of?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-456\">\n   A. The shanks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-457\">\n   Q. From where?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-458\">\n   A. Mr. Perez' walker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-459\">\n   Q. And can you put it in the context of him saying he has to do his part?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-460\">\n   A. He just got done describing that he got out of the hole. He was sick. He physically wasn't able to do his part. But he was, by providing the metal that were fashioned into shanks to do the hit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-461\">\n   Q. Turning your attention to DeLeon Bates stamp 20558, and I want to draw your attention to the top of the page here, where it says, \"The old man was pissed.\" Can you tell us who made that statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-462\">\n   A.

Mr. Calbert passed the paperwork, in this case, two pages from an LCPD police report, that indicated Molina gave a statement to the police and cooperated. Mr. Calbert took that from the Level 6 at PNM to the Level 5 at PNM and gave it to Lupe Urquizo, \"Marijuano.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-485\">\n   Q. What was the purpose of moving the paperwork?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-486\">\n   A.

According to Perez, \"testimony at the James hearing conducted November 27-29, 2017,\" leads him to believe that \"Timothy Martinez will testify that co-defendant Daniel Sanchez told him that 'Sanchez had obtained [the shanks] from \"fat ass\" the nickname Sanchez used for Rudy Perez' \" and \"that Sanchez told him that Mr. Perez gave Sanchez pieces of metal from his walker to be made into shanks, because according to Martinez, Sanchez said 'What else is fat ass gonna do?' \" Perez MIL at 1 (alteration in the original). Perez also expects Montoya \"to testify that Mario Rodriguez provided him a shank to use to kill Javier Molina\" and that, \"when Rodriguez did so, he inexplicably volunteered that the shank came from Mr. Perez' walker.\" Perez MIL at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-496\">\n   Perez asserts that rule 801(d)(2)(E) does not apply to those statements, but he defers that argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Perez MIL at 3 (\"Mr. Perez will pursue this argument at the conclusion of the James hearing.\"), and instead \"seeks a ruling by the Court that the out-of-court statements of Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Rodriguez that it is expected Mr. Martinez and Mr. Montoya will testify about do not meet any other exception and constitute inadmissible hearsay as to Mr. Perez,\" Perez MIL at 3. Perez argues that the Court cannot admit Sanchez' and Rodriguez' out-of-court statements as statements against penal interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Perez MIL at 4. Perez contends that the Court cannot admit Rodriguez' out-of-court statements as statements against penal interest, because \"Rodriguez is expected to testify\" and the statement-against-interest\n   exception is available only when the declarant is unavailable. Perez MIL at 4 (citing Fed R. Evid. 804 ). Perez admits that Sanchez is unavailable, but he contends that Sanchez' out-of-court statements are not statements against his penal interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sanchez MIL at 4-6.

Garcia does not identify any particular statements, but he argues generally that \"[t]he use of codefendant's statements implicating or suggesting a defendant maybe [sic] highly prejudicial to jointly tried defendants,\" and violates their \"right to cross-examination pursuant to the Confrontation Clause ... when a co-defendant chooses not to testify.\" C.

According to Baca, Armenta \"acknowledged that he did not learn anything about Defendant Anthony Ray Baca's purported involvement in the matter until after the murder had taken place,\" and \"[n]othing about Armenta's statement reflected any first-hand knowledge on Armenta's part that Defendant Anthony Ray Baca was involved, in any way, with the Molina homicide.\" Baca MIL \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11, at 2. Baca argues that, because Armenta lacks first-hand knowledge, his testimony would be based on the out-of-court statements of others, and those statements \"could [not] be considered admissible under any theory or rule of evidence.\" Baca MIL \u00b6 11, at 2. Baca asserts that those out-of-court statements are not admissible via rule 801(d)(2), because \"Armenta is neither recalling any admission made by Defendant Anthony Ray Baca (he could not, since they never met each other), nor were the statements Armenta overheard in furtherance of the conspiracy as Armenta heard them after the objective of the alleged conspiracy had been achieved.\" Baca MIL \u00b6 11, at 2-3.

The Court asked Baca to \"refresh my memory as to what Mr. Armenta would say and how he would know what he's saying?\" Dec. 19 Tr. at 4-6 (Court). Baca described a videotaped interview, from October, 2015, in which Armenta\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-501\">\n   walks the State investigators through the Molina event. And at no time did he mention Mr. Baca at all, until he had gone through it. And then he was asked a pointed question by the folks that were talking to him, if Mr. Baca had anything to do with this at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-502\">\n   And his answer was interesting. But more to the point, he said, \"I didn't\n   know anything about that rumor\"-he describes it as a rumor that was going in the pod-until after the event altogether. And so it couldn't be in furtherance of any kind of conspiracy because he had no prior knowledge whatsoever. He talks about what he had heard from other people in the pod later, after the fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   Dec. 19 Tr. at 254:11-24 (Lowry). Baca clarified that \"we'd ask just that that portion of the video ... and then Mr. Armenta's testimony to the extent the Government is going to rely on it, not go into anything he learned after the fact, from the rumor mill.\" Dec. 19 Tr. at 254:25-255:5 (Lowry). According to Baca, Armenta's after-acquired knowledge is based on statements that were not made \"in furtherance of any kind of conspiracy,\" and Armenta lacks \"any kind of firsthand knowledge whatsoever.\" Dec. 19 Tr. at 255:10-13(Lowry). The United States admitted that Baca is correct, \"[i]f it's just rumors from uninvolved people.\" Dec. 19 Tr. at 255:22-23 (Castellano). On the other hand, \"if it's a rumor from somebody who is involved with the conspiracy, then that would be a statement that falls under the Smalls case, because it would be a statement against interest.\" Dec. 19 Tr. at 255:22-256:2 (Castellano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-504\">\n   On December 20, 2017, the Court briefly heard testimony from Acee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 150:5-151:14, 152:5-153:10 (Lowry, Acee), before asking the parties for argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 154:1-2 (Court).

Specifically, the United States asserted that M. Rodriguez', Montoya's, and T. Martinez' plea agreements show that there was a conspiracy to murder Javier Molina and its membership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 155:14-156:9 (Castellano). The United States also asserted that R. Martinez' and R.P. Martinez' plea agreements show that there was a conspiracy to murder Gregg Marcantel and Dwayne Santistevan and that R. Martinez, R.P. Martinez, and Baca were members of that conspiracy. Dec. 20 Tr. at 156:10-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-505\">\n   The Court then described its initial impression:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-506\">\n   It certainly seems to me there has been sufficient evidence for the Court to find by a preponderance of the evidence, which I think is the requirement on a James hearing, that I find that the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy exists; that the members, the defendants, and the declarants were members of the conspiracy, and that the statements that I have heard, that I've listened to carefully, that I've looked at were made in furtherance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-507\">\n   I think the Government has put on a fairly comprehensive demonstration for these statements. And these are the statements-remember, that they're going to introduce pursuant to the co-conspirator statements. And if they did not bring it into the James hearing, then we're not going to try to see it through the-we're not going to see the Government trying to get it in through a co-conspirator statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-508\">\n   So it's a fairly contained list of statements that the Government has brought forward. As I've listened to those, as I've read them, I have not seen anything that would not come in under the co-conspirator statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-509\">\n   I guess what I would do-I mean, ultimately, it's the Government's burden, but I think they've met their burden. Unless the defendants bring statements to me and say, you know, just as you would in the course of trial, you'd make an objection, and that's the way you note\n   that they haven't done it. So it would seem to me that, probably, the Government ought to sit down, and that I ought to be quiet, and see if anybody disagrees with the conclusion that I've reached. It's a tentative conclusion, subject to your arguments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-510\">\n   But I'm not sitting here seeing in the box that we've taken in James over several days, and now over several weeks-so if the defendants want to challenge some and have me relook at them, and think of them in general, and have the Government argue in specific, I'm game.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-511\">\n   But, otherwise, the box we have put the Government in these particular statements, I'm not seeing why they shouldn't come in under co-conspirator. They seem to meet all three prongs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-512\">\n   Mr. Castellano, unless you have something else you want to do, we might see if the defendants want to pick up some individual statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 159:17-161:16 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   The United States agreed to the Court's proposed methodology, with one caveat:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-515\">\n   I just want to add one statement that came out of Billy Cordova's testimony [in a separate pretrial hearing]. He was talking to Daniel Sanchez through the door. Daniel Sanchez told Billy Cordova, \"I already hit him up,\" meaning he had already taken the-taken or agreed to take the shanks from Mr. Perez' walker. I think that would clearly fall within James.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 161:18-24 (Castellano).

One on the Molina murder and then the other on the threats on Marcantel. And so those are the two conspiracies. So we've taken those separately. It seems to me that being precise, I think that those two conspiracies exist. And that, therefore, in the box that we did of each one, it seemed to me, listening carefully, I didn't see that-it seemed to me that they had established by a preponderance of the evidence conspiracies on both those boxes. So a little bit more precise. That's what I meant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-519\">\n   MR. LOWRY: Thank you, Your Honor.

Although, the way the Government has presented it, I think, has been that they are separate conspiracies. They all go to trying to advance the cause of the enterprise. But I think the way they've tried it, they mounted the burden of them being separate conspiracies, unless Mr. Castellano tells me something different or I missed something.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 162:25-163:25 (Court, Lowry).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   Baca then \"dr[e]w the Court's attention to the [transcript of the] recorded conversations with Mr. Perez that took place years after the homicide.\" Dec. 20 Tr. at 164:10-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baca asserted that the transcript contains statements that Perez, in the transcript, attributes to Baca.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 165:12-15 (Lowry). The United States then noted an example attributed statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-523\">\n   One discussion we were having outside before the hearing was, at the bottom of [Bates number] 20531 there is an example of Rudy Perez, a couple of years after the murder, recounting the conversation during the time of the conspiracy. So what he describes is people coming in to him, and they tell him, \"Look, Big Dog, something has to be taken care of. But we need squina. You don't have to do nothing, you don't have to do nada.\" And this is the discussion where they're saying: You don't need to do anything else other than provide your walker for the shanks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 167:8-18 (Castellano). Baca expressed indifference regarding that statement, because it does not involve Baca.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 168:19-24 (Lowry). Baca provided an alternative example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-525\">\n   MR. LOWRY: Absolutely, Your Honor. And you can see it right here, where this is Mr. Perez, and he's saying, quote, The old man was pissed bro, he was like, he was upset with them the other fools over there, why didn't they handle it a year sooner when they took the paperwork over there? Well you send paperwork up there.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-526\">\n   [THE COURT:] Well, it would seem to me-assuming \"Old man\" refers to Mr. Baca, which I think it does-his complaints to Mr. Perez, another member of the conspiracy, as has been proved by the Government, and Molina would be in furtherance. I mean, that's what people do when they're in a conspiracy. They complain to members of the group. And the reason you complain is to try to make the group better, or advance your purposes. So it seems to me that that would be classic co-conspirator exception material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-527\">\n   MR. LOWRY: Well, I'm having a hard time-if this complaint can be attributed to Mr. Baca, it's a complaint about after the fact, after the objective of the alleged conspiracy has been completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-528\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 177:2-22 (Lowry, Court). The United States expressed some uncertainty regarding the timing of the statement that Perez attributed to Baca, because \"we're not quite sure of the timeframe,\" but added that, \"even if it were to fall out of a James statement, I think we would be falling into Smalls' statements as a statement against interests.\" Dec. 20 Tr. at 177:17-20, 178:4-6 (Castellano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-529\">\n   Sanchez identified a statement that Molina made while he was being stabbed, and argued that Molina's statement was not a coconspirator statement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 200:12-15 (Jacks), and the United States agreed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 200:23-24 (Castellano). The Court accepted that such a statement would not be admissible for its truth under rule 801(d)(2)(E), but it predicted that such a statement would probably constitute admissible hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 201:5-12 (Court). Sanchez also argued that \"statements or puffery about prison politics\" do not qualify as coconspirator statements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 201:20-202:3 (Jacks), and the United States again agreed that such statements would not be coconspirator statements, but it argued that such statements would be admissible under rule 801(d)(2)(A),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 203:19-204:25 (Court, Castellano).

The next is the conspiracy to assault Julian Romero. That's one we don't discuss very much, but Mr. Baca is the only remaining defendant in that count. There is a conspiracy there. And\n   then a conspiracy to murder Dwayne Santistevan. And a conspiracy to murder Gregg Marcantel. I've generally spoken about Santistevan and Marcantel together, but they are two conspiracies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-532\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 215:18-216:1 (Castellano). The United States commented on the temporal relationship between the first two conspiracies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-533\">\n   [W]hen the SNM was locked down following the Molina murder, eventually they decided to lift the lockdown. And within hours, another person was assaulted, and that was Julian Romero. And that resulted in the SNM being locked down once again. And that is covered in one of the plea agreements I referenced earlier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-534\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 216:7-12 (Castellano). The United States identified several statements that were made in furtherance of the Molina murder:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-535\">\n   I believe one we introduced at the hearing, at least as related to Lupe Urquizo, is that \"Anthony Ray Baca told Mr. Urquizo to let the shot callers at Southern know that Baca wanted Javier Molina hit.\" The next statement was that, \"Baca told Urquizo to make sure the guys running Southern took care of Molina.\" The next statement is that, \"Baca told Urquizo if you guys down there don't handle it, then just stab him,\" referring to Molina-I'm sorry, that's Molina-I apologize, those are related to Mr. Molina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-536\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 218:6-18 (Castellano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-537\">\n   According to the United States, the conspirators in the \"Julian Romero assault\" include \"Gerald Archuleta, Conrad Villegas, and Mr. Baca, among others.\" Dec. 20 Tr. at 216:17, 21-22 (Castellano). The United States then provided background information about the Romero assault and identified statements that, it contends, were made during and in furtherance of that conspiracy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-538\">\n   So in terms of background, one of the things that causes some divides in the gang were that-maybe as far as 2003-Gerald Archuleta was in prison, if I recall correctly. He allowed Julian Romero to stay at his house. And he ended up sleeping with Gerald Archuleta's wife, or girlfriend. So, from that time forward, there was an ongoing conspiracy to murder Mr. Romero. And in 2003, he was actually shot as part of that conspiracy. And the conspiracy remained outstanding up until the time he was assaulted. And that's referenced on pages 4 and 5 of Gerald Archuleta's plea agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-539\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-540\">\n   The two statements we have from Mr. Urquizo are that \"Mr. Urquizo and Jonathan Gomez told Conrad Villegas to hit Julian Romero.\" And the next one was that, \"Anthony Baca sent down word to Southern that Romero should be beat but not stabbed or killed.\" And ultimately that's what happened. Those are at least two of the statements I can find right offhand that we introduced related to the Julian Romero beating or assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-541\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 217:17-219:1 (Castellano). The United States indicated, however, that Urquizo will testify at trial regarding the substance of the first statement-that Urquizo and Gomez instructed Villegas to assault Romero-so, according to the United States, there will be no need at trial to introduce an out-of-court statement for its truth on that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. 221:5-11 (Court, Castellano). The United States clarified that the second statement \"would be Mr. Urquizo telling the jury that Mr. Gomez told him that Mr. Baca only wanted the victim smashed or beat up, but not stabbed or killed.\" Dec. 20 Tr. at 229:14-17 (Castellano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-542\">\n   The Court then articulated its findings regarding statements in furtherance of the Romero conspiracy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-543\">\n   I think specifically as to Romero, I'm going to find that there is, by a preponderance of the evidence, evidence that a conspiracy existed. I don't think that there is much dispute on that. The question is whether or not Mr. Baca was a part of it, being a declarant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-544\">\n   And I think finding by a preponderance of the evidence there is evidence that-quite a bit that we've heard and I've read-that he is the leader, or at least at one time was acknowledged as the leader of the SNM Gang; that his orders were sent down and carried out. There may be times when he didn't, when they weren't carried out. But I don't think that that's the element of the hearsay exception. And I do think this was in furtherance of the conspiracy, how it would be taken care of, limitations on it. I think those were part. So I do think these statements in the Romero box, the conspiracy, do satisfy the hearsay exception. And so I will admit them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-545\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 241:15-242:9 (Court). The Court also articulated general findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-546\">\n   Let me now say for all four conspiracies-because I do want to take what Ms. Sirignano said seriously-for all four conspiracies I am finding that the statements that have been identified in the four conspiracies by the Government do come within the hearsay exception. I do think that they-the Government has established the four conspiracies. I think they have satisfied the members of it and the declarants are members of that conspiracy, and that the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-547\">\n   We have, this afternoon, identified a few statements that either lacked dates and specificity, that I will not rely on the hearsay exception for coconspirators. And for those that we identified this afternoon, I will be relying upon either present sense for Mr. Molina's stabbing, or statements against interests, or the person is testifying, the first declarant is testifying. But I will not be for those that we identified and found alternatives for. Those will be coming in, but they'll be coming a different way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-548\">\n   With one caveat-and I now want to ask the Government to help me because this was some stuff we covered this summer, and I want to make sure that I have a firm basis for what I've just said as far as the statement against interests. Let me-Mr. Castellano, take again the Mr. Perez and Mr. Cordova statements. I'm not concerned about a Bruton problem, I'm not concerned about particularly a Smalls or testimonial or Crawford issue, so I'm putting those aside. But I'll come back and reference them. But that's not my concern. But take Mr. Perez, for example, his statements to Cordova. I've said that the statements that are being made in Mr. Perez' statements are-come within the co-conspirator exception with some statements we identified this afternoon that we'll not be relying on. But all the others I will rely on. But I want to go back to Mr. Perez' statements. You and I, in our discussions earlier-and no defendant disputed this-we were relying upon the fact that Mr. Perez was a party opponent. I think Smalls deals with the Crawford-Bruton problem, so there is no constitutional problems. But I'm looking for the hearsay exception that gets the statements of Mr. Perez on the tape to be used against other people.... [P]resumably, the United States will want to use the Perez recording against Mr. Perez, which I think is quite all right....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-549\">\n   But it is only nonhearsay against Mr. Perez. It seems to me that something has to be done to make it nonhearsay against others, or is this a situation where we have to give a limiting instruction? Again, it's not a Bruton problem or Crawford problem or testimonial problem\n   to say that the jury cannot consider the statements of Mr. Perez against any other party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 242:10-245:8 (Court).

The United States then asserts that the statements which Perez, C.

Response at 6. The United States argues that Perez was a coconspirator viz. Sanchez and Rodriguez, \"[b]ecause Perez did, in fact, volunteer his walker to Sanchez to be put into shanks,\" and because Perez is \"a long-time member of the SNM in good standing.\" Response at 6. The United States also argues that Sanchez' and Rodriguez' statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy, because \"the knowledge that Perez's walker, as opposed to other shanks lying around ... helped the coconspirators avoid detection and prosecution for their crime, [which] renders these statements in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" Response at 7. According to the United States,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-554\">\n   law enforcement followed the red herring that the SNM planted about the hanks used in the Molina murder coming from the wheelchair program. Instead of following investigatory leads that would lead them to Perez's walker, and Perez's involvement in the Molina murder, they followed the rumors from all involved (and some not) about shanks coming from the SNMCF wheelchair program. Thus, Rodriguez's statement to Montoya and Sanchez's statement to Martinez about Perez providing the shanks from his walkers helped further the conspiracy by allowing all of the Defendants to know from where the shanks came, and from where they did not, which would lead to a dead-end investigation if inquired about by law enforcement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-555\">\n   Response at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-556\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     The Sanchez Motion in Limine\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-557\">\n   Sanchez filed a motion in limine on January 8, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sanchez MIL at 23.

Sanchez argues that, under\n   <em>\n    Michigan v. Bryant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Clark\n   </em>\n   , Perez' statements to Antonio Palomares, a New Mexico State Police Sergeant, and James Mulheron, the SNMCF Deputy Warden, during the Molina murder investigation are testimonial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sanchez MIL at 3-4, 9-10. Sanchez also argues that Perez' in-prison statements to Cordova, a confidential human source, and Baca's, C. Garcia's, and others' in-prison statements to Duran, also a confidential human source, are testimonial, because, according to Sanchez, Cordova and Duran are government agents, and used psychological interrogation tactics to obtain out-of-court statements to be used at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sanchez MIL at 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-558\">\n   Sanchez asserts that the statements which Perez made to Cordova were not made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy to kill Molin-charged in the Indictment's Count 6-because Perez made those statements over a year after Molina's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sanchez MIL at 13-14. Sanchez also asserts that Perez' statements to Cordova were not against Perez' penal interest, because Perez testified that he made those statements \"to allay concerns that he was informing about the crime,\" so \"a reasonable person in Perez's position may have made the statements even if they were not true,\" Sanchez MIL at 14-15, and because some of Perez' statements deflect or reduce his culpability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sanchez MIL at 14-15. Sanchez contends that statements in furtherance of the Counts 8-10 conspiracies would be inadmissible hearsay as against him-even if those statements are relevant-because he is not a Counts 8-10 conspirator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sanchez MIL at 16-17. Sanchez concludes by arguing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-559\">\n   It is a mind-boggling exercise to envision the type and number of limiting instructions needed to even attempt to protect each defendant's Due Process right not to be convicted on inadmissible evidence; and an even more impossible task for the jury to try to properly apply any such instructions. The only adequate protection to the defendant's individual rights to Due Process as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment is to either wholly exclude any hearsay statements that are inadmissible against any of the five trial defendants or to grant a severance of Counts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-560\">\n   Sanchez MIL at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-561\">\n   <strong>\n    8.\n    <em>\n     The January 9, 2018 Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-562\">\n   On January 9, 2018, Sanchez argued that Supreme Court of the United States of America precedent that post-dates\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smalls\n   </em>\n   implicitly overrules the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit's decision in that case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9 Tr. at 156:13-157:18 (Jacks). According to Sanchez,\n   <em>\n    Michigan v. Bryant\n   </em>\n   repudiates\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smalls\n   </em>\n   ' narrow focus on the declarant's primary purpose when determining whether an out-of-court statement is testimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9 Tr. at 156:13-157:18 (Jacks). It follows, again according to Sanchez, the Confrontation Clause inquiry regarding statements that Perez made and Billy Cordova recorded should consider \"that Billy Cordova went in there to the prison and made comments to Mr. Perez, as a government agent, in an effort to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution.\" Jan. 9 at 158:21-24 (Jacks). Further, in an effort to distinguish\n   <em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smalls\n   </em>\n   , Sanchez contended, regarding Perez' resulting statements, that \"you can[not] classify those remarks as an unwitting statement to a fellow inmate,\" because \"they were the product of that custodial interrogation, along with, I think, other circumstances, such as the fact that he was in isolation, he was unable to go to recreation, and he was on heavy doses of narcotic painkillers.\" Jan. 9 Tr. at 159:19-160:3 (Jacks).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-563\">\n   On the same day, Perez argued that Sanchez' out-of-court statement to T. Martinez regarding the source of the Molina murder weapon-\"it came from Fat Ass' or Fatso's walker. What else is he going to do?,\" Jan. 9 Tr. at 177:22-23 (Villa)-was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy to kill Molina,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9 Tr. at 178:8-13 (Villa). The United States replied \"that's a statement by a party opponent as it relates to Daniel Sanchez. But it's also a statement in furtherance of the conspiracy, because it identifies another member of the conspiracy was Mr. Perez.\" Jan. 9 Tr. at 182:4-8 (Castellano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-564\">\n   <strong>\n    9.\n    <em>\n     The Severance Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-565\">\n   About a week before trial, Perez moved to sever the trial of Counts 6-7 from Counts 8-12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Severance Motion at 1. Perez argues that a \"plethora of co-conspirator statements that will be offered by the government in its attempt to prove Counts 8-12 are not admissible against Defendants Sanchez, Herrera or Perez.\" Severance Motion at 2. According to Perez, \"the only way to prevent the reversible error that will otherwise surely occur is to sever Counts 6 and 7 from Counts 8 through 12.\" Severance Motion at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-566\">\n   <strong>\n    10.\n    <em>\n     The Sanchez Memo\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-567\">\n   Sanchez filed an additional memorandum in support of the Sanchez MIL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Daniel Sanchez's Supplemental Memorandum and Argument in Support of his Motion in Limine to Preclude the Admission of Un-Confronted, Out of Court Statements (Doc. 1616) at 2, filed January 22, 2018 (Doc. 1665)(\"Sanchez Memo\"). Sanchez argues that a \"serious and fundamental denial of due process ... will result if un-confronted out of court statements of Mr. Sanchez's Count 6-7 co-defendants are admitted at\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any joint trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , whether it be at a trial of Counts 6-12, or at an independent trial of Counts 6-7 only.\" Sanchez Memo at 2 (emphasis in original).

The first corresponds to Counts 6 of the Indictment,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Molina murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 215:18-19 (Castellano); Indictment at 13 (Count 6). The central aim of that conspiracy was accomplished with Molina's death on March 7, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 13. The United States alleges that Montoya, M. Rodriguez, Baca, Varela, Sanchez, Herrera, and Perez were members of that conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 12 (Count 6). The second is \"the conspiracy to assault Julian Romero.\" Dec. 20 Tr. at 215:19-20 (Castellano).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 13-14 (Count 8). The Romero conspiracy's central aim was accomplished when Romero was assaulted on July 13, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 13 (Count 8). The United States alleges that Baca, Archuleta, and Villegas were members of the second conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 216: 20-22 (Castellano); Indictment at 14 (Count 8). The third conspiracy is \"the conspiracy to murder Dwayne Santistevan.\" Dec. 20 Tr. at 215:22-23 (Castellano).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 14 (Count 9). The United States alleges that Baca, R.P. Martinez, and R. Martinez were members of the Santistevan conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 14 (Count 9). The fourth conspiracy is \"a conspiracy to murder Gregg Marcantel.\" Dec. 20 Tr. at 215:23-24 (Castellano).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 15 (Count 10). The United States alleges that Baca, R.P. Martinez, R. Martinez, and C. Garcia were members of the fourth conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 15 (Count 10). The United States has not identified a fifth separate conspiracy to conceal any of the four charged conspiracies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 215:16-18 (Castellano)(\"But I want to make sure we're talking about multiple conspiracies. I think four actually.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-736\">\n   The United States argues that \"Sanchez's statement to Martinez that Sanchez received the shanks from Perez, and Rodriguez's statements to Montoya that the shanks came from Perez's walker\" were made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy to kill Molina. Response at 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Perez MIL at 1 (\"Martinez is expected to testify that Sanchez told him that Mr. Perez gave Sanchez pieces of metal from his walker to be made into shanks ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (\"Jerry Montoya is expected to testify that Mario Rodriguez provided him a shank to use to kill Javier Molina. Montoya is expected to testify that when Rodriguez did so, he inexplicably volunteered that the shank came from Mr.\n   Perez's walker.\"). According to the United States, those statements furthered the conspiracy, \"by allowing all of the Defendants to know from where the shanks came, and from where they did not,\" which led to \"law enforcement follow[ing] the red herring that the SNM planted about the shanks used in the Molina murder coming from the wheelchair program,\" instead of following \"investigatory leads that would lead them to Perez's walker, and Perez's involvement in the Molina murder.\" Response at 7. The Court concludes that Sanchez and M. Rodriguez made statements regarding the source of the Molina murder weapon during and in furtherance of the Molina conspiracy, because they made those statements while arranging Molina's murder, and convincing T. Martinez and Montoya to participate in the Molina conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Tr. at 163:20-164:14 (Castellano, Acee)(regarding Sanchez' statement);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 183:6-13 (Lowry, Acee)(regarding M. Rodriguez' statement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-737\">\n   On the other hand, Perez made statements to Cordova, which Cordova surreptitiously recorded, in February, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 20 Tr. at 4-8 (Lowry). Those statements were not made during the conspiracy to kill Molina, because they post-date Molina's death by over a year. Likewise, those statements did not further the conspiracy to kill Molina, because it is impossible to further a terminated conspiracy. That multiple SNM members attempted to conceal SNM's crimes does not permit the Court to infer that those SNM members formed an agreement-tacit or otherwise-to conceal those crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grunewald v.

Accordingly, Perez' recorded statements do not qualify as coconspirator statements under rule 801(d)(2)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-738\">\n   Contrary to the United States' suggestion, that the Indictment alleges VICAR violations, some of which are based on conspiracy offenses, does not alter the conspiracies' scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8 (arguing that Perez' statements were in furtherance of the conspiracy, even though they occurred years after the Molina murder, \"[b]ecause the conspiracy is a VICAR conspiracy to murder, which includes as an element that it was done in furtherance of or to gain some type of benefit from the SNM gang,\" so Perez' statements indicating involvement in the Molina murder \"thus, further his standing in the SNM and the VICAR conspiracy to murder\"). That conspiring to commit murder \"for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity\" violates VICAR is immaterial for rule 802(d)(2)(E) purposes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The inquiry under rule 801(d)(2)(E) is whether a statement was made during and in furtherance of a conspiracy, but a VICAR violation is not, itself, a conspiracy even though it may have a conspiracy as its underlying offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-739\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     THE STATEMENTS BY ONE SNM MEMBER TO ANOTHER THAT CORDOVA AND DURAN RECORDED ARE NOT ADMISSIBLE HEARSAY UNDER THE STATEMENTS AGAINST PENAL INTEREST EXCEPTION\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-740\">\n   An out-of-court statement is admissible hearsay if the declarant is unavailable\n   and if \"a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made [the statement] only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it ... had so great a tendency ... to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability.\" Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3)(A). The statement must also be \"supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness, if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.\" Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3)(B). In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smalls\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit declared that \"[w]e may safely surmise that from time immemorial, only on the rarest occasion, if ever, has one of sound mind-even one of sound mind who is not particularly honest-falsely confessed a murder to an apparent acquaintance or friend.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053939\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/765/#p777\">\n    605 F.3d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-741\">\n   Making that surmise is not safe, however, when the declarant makes a statement while in prison to someone who is apparently a fellow prison-gang member and not just an acquaintance or friend. While people in ordinary situations expose themselves to both social censure and criminal liability when they falsely confess to committing a crime, prison-gang members speaking to fellow members earn social benefits-such as respect or an appearance of power-when they make inculpatory claims. Further, law enforcement agents are unlikely to learn of such claims from the declarant's fellow prison-gang members, because prison-gang members face violent retaliation for collaborating with law enforcement. Consequently, a reasonable prison-gang member might make self-inculpatory statements even if those statements were not true. Accordingly, such statements are not typically admissible under rule 804(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-742\">\n   That generalization is true in Perez' case, because, when Perez made his statements to Cordova, prison-yard rumors indicated, falsely, that Perez cooperated with the United States regarding the Molina murder. Perez' statements to Cordova suggest that those life-threatening rumors are false, because they demonstrate loyalty to the SNM, and because, if Perez helped carry out the Molina murder, then providing information to law enforcement would expose him to criminal liability. Consequently, a reasonable person in Perez' position might make self-incriminating statements regarding the Molina murder to another SNM member to combat life-threatening prison-yard rumors, even if those self-incriminating statements were not true. Accordingly, Perez' statements do not satisfy rule 804(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence and are not admissible as statements against the declarant's penal interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-743\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     AN OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENT IS ADMISSIBLE FOR ITS TRUTH UNDER RULE 801(D)(2)(A) TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS OFFERED AGAINST THE PERSON WHO MADE THE STATEMENT\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-744\">\n   A statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and it was \"made by the party in an individual or representative capacity.\" Fed.

The Court indicated that it was \"thinking about impaneling two juries,\" so one could consider the charges against Baca and Sanchez while the other would hear the charges against Herrera and Perez. Jan. 26 Tr. at 52:14-19 (Court). The Court could excuse the Baca-Sanchez jury when evidence was admissible only against Herrera or Perez, and vice versa.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jan. 26 Tr. at 52:16-25 (Court). The Court explained its reasoning:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-775\">\n    I'm not inclined to sever out [Counts] 6 and 7; that doesn't seem to me-it never has seemed to me to be quite the solution. But I do think that the defendants have pointed to enough problems that maybe the way to do it is to pick two juries, and have, at critical points, the juries excused so that the number of limiting instructions is greatly reduced. Or when they are given, they're given because they're allowed. But the evidence that we're asking the jury to ignore is not probative of the other defendant in that case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-776\">\n    Jan. 26 Tr. at 53:15-25 (Court).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-777\">\n    The next day, the United States indicated that-in lieu of impaneling two juries-it was willing to \"redact the recordings [of Baca, Herrera, and Perez] to take out references to the other co-Defendants on trial made by the declarant-Defendant.\" United States' Sealed Motion to Reconsider the Court's Two Jury Proposal at 6, filed January 27, 2018 (Doc. 1712)(\"Two Jury Motion\"). In the Two Jury Motion, the United States argues that the redacted recordings will incriminate Defendants other than the declarant, if at all, only indirectly, so the jury will be able to obey the Court's limiting instructions more easily.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Two Jury Motion at 6. The United States also observes that, even if the jury misuses the recordings, redacting the recordings minimizes any resulting prejudice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Two Jury Motion at 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-778\">\n    On the first day of jury selection, the Court indicated that it would accept the United States' proposal and present redacted transcripts to a single jury.

In 2003, I was an active member of the SNM. The person listed as J.R. in Count 8 of the Superseding Indictment was also a member of the SNM, and we were both engaged in racketeering activities for the SNM. J.R. and I had a falling out in 2003 and as a result, I put a \"green-light\" on J. R. Based upon my status in the SNM, this \"green-light\" was well known to members of the SNM. The \"green-light\" resulted in other members of the SNM shooting J.R. in 2003; however, J.R. survived the shooting. The \"green-light\" remained in effect in 2015; consequently, another member or associate of the SNM acted on the \"hit,\" and J.R. was assaulted while incarcerated at the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility in Dona Ana County, New Mexico. This attack and \"hit\" had been approved of by leaders of the SNM gang, including Anthony Ray Baca. As leader of the SNM gang in 2015, Baca was aware of the outstanding \"green-light\" and sanctioned it. Thus, from 2003 to July, 2015, I conspired with members and associates of the SNM gang to commit assault resulting in serious bodily injury to J.R.
