Satterfield alleged that she was a passenger in an automobile that was struck by an automobile driven by Taylor and as a result of Taylor's negligent operation of her vehicle, she (Satterfield) sustained injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Satterfield and Taylor \"settled all issues[,]\" Doc. 1-7, between them, and on June 21, 2017, Satterfield dismissed her claim against Taylor with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-9. On July 18, 2017, Satterfield,\n   with leave of court, filed an amended petition and named as defendant, her insurer, Government Employees Insurance Company (\"GEICO\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In her second amended petition filed on November 22, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-12, Satterfield alleged that on July 24, 2014, the date of the accident, she was insured by GEICO under an automobile policy, No. 4163-72-30-10 (\"Policy\"), which provided uninsured/underinsured motorist (\"UM\") benefits\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that she made a claim for such benefits. Satterfield further alleged that GEICO failed to reasonably and properly investigate and evaluate her claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and when it determined that she was not entitled to UM coverage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   GEICO not only breached the terms of the Policy, but also breached its implied duty to deal fairly and to act in good faith with its insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GEICO removed the action on November 22, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, and asserted in the Notice of Removal that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction under title 28, section 1332 of the United States Code because the citizenship of the parties is diverse\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at 5; Doc. 1-12 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The matter now comes before the Court on GEICO's Motion to Dismiss. Satterfield has responded, and GEICO has filed a reply in support of its argument that dismissal of this action is warranted under\n   Rules 12(b)(2) 5 and 12(b)(3), F.R.Civ.P., and title 28, section 1406(a) of the United States Code because the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over GEICO and venue is improper and in support of its alternate argument that transfer of this matter is warranted under title 28, section 1404(a) of the United States Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[J]urisdiction of the person traditionally has been analyzed in terms of two different elements[.]\" 1 R.
