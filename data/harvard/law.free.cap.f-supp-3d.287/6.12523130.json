Petitioner claims that he is entitled to such relief for three reasons: (1) he was denied the right to effective assistance of trial counsel; (2) his Confrontation Clause rights were violated by the admission of certain out-of-court statements that were not subject to meaningful cross-examination; and (3) his due process rights were violated when the District of Columbia courts failed to consider the cumulative effect of the errors committed at trial and in collateral proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court is Respondent's Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Petitioner contends that the\n   <em>\n    accumulation\n   </em>\n   of errors was not considered by the D.C.

But Petitioner's dissatisfaction with the outcome of his collateral attack in the D.C. courts does not mean he lacked \"any opportunity for judicial rectification.\" As the record shows, Petitioner did bring his due process claim premised on individual and cumulative trial errors and new evidence pursuant to section 23-110 before the D.C. Superior Court and then raised those claims on appeal. The D.C. Court of Appeals simply rejected them.

Opp'n at 1, 6-7. As raised in his habeas petition, this claim essentially challenges the D.C. Court of Appeals' decision in his direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874375,3847727\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/1141/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing Pet. Ex. F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In response to the Motion to Dismiss, Petitioner contends that his remedy under section 23-110 is inadequate as to his Confrontation Clause claim for two reasons. First, Petitioner argues that relief under section 23-110 would be inadequate because the D.C. Court of Appeals \"unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] ... established federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874375,3847727\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/1141/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But for reasons already discussed, section 23-110(g) presumptively precludes him from re-litigating a constitutional claim in federal court that the D.C. Court of Appeals considered and rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, Petitioner relatedly insists that his remedy under section 23-110 is inadequate because he is \"unable to challenge the Court of Appeals' decision through a \u00a7 23-110 proceeding,\" since the Superior Court cannot, absent special circumstances, countermand a decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874375,3847727\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/1141/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamen v.

This argument, however, is directly foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Garris.\n   </em>\n   As Petitioner does here, the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Garris\n   </em>\n   argued \"that th[e] very inability to\" to challenge the D.C. Court of Appeals' review of his Sixth Amendment claim \"rendered the remedy by motion [under section 23-110 ] inadequate, and enabled the [d]istrict [c]ourt to consider his habeas corpus petition.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610003,1591308\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/722/\">\n    794 F.2d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). The D.C. Circuit rejected this argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610003,1591308\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/722/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610003,1591308\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/722/\">\n    at 724, 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that \"[i]t is the inefficacy of the remedy, not a personal inability to utilize it, that is determinative, and [the petitioner's] difficulty here is simply that his circumstances preclude him from invoking it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610003,1591308\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/722/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610003,1591308\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/722/\">\n    at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So it is here.
