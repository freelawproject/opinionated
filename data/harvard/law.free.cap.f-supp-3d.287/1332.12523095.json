Thorpe\") and John Clark Williams, II (\"Williams\") (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\") filed a response in opposition (Doc. 26) and BJ's replied (Doc. 32). For the reasons that follow, the Motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of an alleged fall (the \"Incident\") that occurred in the men's restroom (the \"Men's Restroom\") on BJ's premises located at 8285 Red Bug Lake Road in Oviedo, Florida (the \"Oviedo Restaurant\"). (Doc. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13; Doc. 26 at 1.) On September 23, 2015, decedent John Clark Williams, M.D. (\"Dr. Williams\") was a patron at the Oviedo Restaurant. (Doc. 16 at 2; Doc. 26 at 3.) Dr. Williams was in the Men's Restroom with his son-in-law, Jerry Thorpe (\"J. Thorpe\"), when one of BJ's employees, Ray Jomark Alizea Vega (\"Vega\") opened the inward-opening Men's Restroom door. (J. Thorpe Deposition, Doc. 29-1 at 11:8-10; Vega Deposition, Doc. 29-2 at 23:13-17; DeJesus Deposition, Doc. 29-3 at 36:12-14.) Prior to going to the Men's Restroom, Vega was working on the pizza station at the Oviedo Restaurant, and he left the pizza station to use the Men's Restroom with no orders pending on his screen. (Vega Dep. at 29:13-21.) Although the Oviedo Restaurant was busy due to a lunch rush, Vega was able to clear his orders and take a restroom break. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:5-12, 29:13-21, 51:5-11.) Because the\n   employee restroom was occupied, Vega left the back area of the Oviedo Restaurant to access the front Men's Restroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:24-36:5.) By the time Vega returned to the pizza station after going to the Men's Restroom, he had more orders to complete. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:19-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to the date of the Incident, Dr. Williams had been to the Oviedo Restaurant on multiple occasions and used the Men's Restroom. (J. Thorpe Dep. at 22:11-14, 23:4-7.) Vega did not know that Dr. Williams was in the Men's Restroom prior to opening the door. (Vega Dep. at 23:13-16.) Vega did know, however, that the restroom door was an inward-opening door that did not have a handle or latch system that required turning a knob to gain entry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:21-28:2.) Vega testified that the Men's Restroom door was of a normal weight and could be pushed open. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:3-9.) Vega also stated that the Men's Restroom is smaller than restrooms at BJ's Lake Buena Vista location; however, Vega acknowledged that BJ's Lake Buena Vista location is bigger than the Oviedo Restaurant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:23-56:4.) Additionally, Vega admitted that patrons pass by the path of the Men's Restroom door when walking from the urinals to the sink. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:11-16.) Vega specifically stated that the Men's Restroom door, when opened, extends into the pathway from the urinals to the sinks, but that there might be enough clearance to walk from one of the urinals to the sinks without walking around the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:6-11, 36:19-3 7:10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Indisputably, Vega did not knock on the door of the Men's Restroom prior to opening it. (Vega Dep. at 29:22-25.) When Vega opened the door of the Men's Restroom, the door hit Dr. Williams, and Dr. Williams fell to the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:1-15.) Incontrovertible Dr. Williams was hit by the door when he was in the process of passing behind J. Thorpe to walk from the urinals to the sink. (J. Thorpe Dep. at 11:8-20.) J. Thorpe was standing at the bathroom sink with his back to the urinals and did not see the Incident. (J. Thorpe at 13:8-13.) However, J. Thorpe stated that he heard a loud thud and observed Dr. Williams on the restroom floor lying face up after he was hit by the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:20-14:2, 21:4-5.) Plaintiffs allege that the injuries suffered by Dr. Williams as a result of being hit by the Men's Restroom door led to his demise on July 9, 2016. (Doc. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 23, 2016, Plaintiffs, as Co-Personal Representatives of the Estate of Dr. Williams, filed their original complaint against BJ's and Esteban Antonio Murillo, an individual, in the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32-1 at 1.) On June 5, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") against BJ's, which BJ's removed to this Court on June 23, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1, 3.) In Count I of the Amended Complaint (Doc. 3), Plaintiffs attempt to bring a survival action for negligence against BJ's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.) In Count II, Plaintiffs purport to bring a wrongful death action against BJ's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-25.) BJ's now moves for summary judgment in its favor on Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Specifically, Plaintiffs attest that BJ's breached its duty to Dr. Williams by committing one or more of the following acts of negligence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a.

In fact, there is no evidence that, prior to the Incident, BJ's employees or guests complained to BJ's about the Men's Restroom door posing a hazard to individuals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debbie Nichols Affidavit, Doc. 16 at 79-80 \u00b6\u00b6 23-5.) There is also no evidence that the Men's Restroom door was broken in any way on the date of the Incident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeJesus Dep. at 47:21-48:7; Vega Dep. at 53:16-19.) Notably, according to the undisputed material facts of this case, J. Thorpe was alone in the Men's Restroom with Dr. Williams when Vega entered, and nobody witnessed the door making contact with Dr. Williams's body. (J. Thorpe Dep. at 13:11-13; Vega Dep. at 31:8-15.) J. Thorpe stated that he believed Vega opened the Men's Restroom door with a large amount of force based on the thud he heard and the short duration between when the door was opened and when it hit Dr. Williams. (J. Thorpe Dep. at 13:20-14:9, 58:7-21.) Vega testified that he walked to the Men's Restroom at a normal pace and opened the door by pushing it open with his hand. (Vega Dep. at 29:4-9, 32:6-9.) The record evidence shows that, although BJ's employees underwent orientation and tours of the Oviedo Restaurant and received and were required to attest to reading an employee handbook, BJ's did not provide store policies or training on restroom entry or safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:4-15:14, 20:11-19.) Vega admits that, if BJ's had policies or procedures in place requiring him to enter the restroom by opening the door slowly or partly opening the door and asking if it was safe to enter, he would have abided by same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:12-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Importantly, the record evidence demonstrates that the Men's Restroom abided by the applicable building code, both at the time of construction and as of August 31, 2017. As John Pike (\"Pike\"), the Chief Plans Examiner with the Seminole County Building Division, stated in his unrebutted affidavit, \"the [M]en's [R]estroom, including the [M]en's [R]estroom door, door opening, and clear maneuverable space, was designed in compliance with the [applicable] 2010 Florida Building Code and applicable ADA Accessibility Guidelines.\" (J. Pike Affidavit, Doc. 16 at 24-26, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7.) Pike further attested that, as of August 31, 2017, the Oviedo Restaurant had never been cited for a Building Code violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Pike visited the Oviedo restaurant on August 31, 2017 and found that the Men's Restroom, including the door, complied with the approved building plans on file with the Seminole County Building Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) According to Pike, as of August 31, 2017, \"the [M]en's [R]estroom, including the door, complies with all applicable Florida Building Codes[,] ... [and] all applicable ADA Accessibility Guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    (Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Indubitably, Dr. Williams visited the Oviedo Restaurant on numerous occasions and used the Men's Restroom on at least one (1) occasion prior to the date of the Incident. During Dr. Williams's visit, he had the opportunity to observe that the door of the Men's Restroom opened inward, as well as the opportunity to observe the layout of the Men's Restroom. Vega and DeJesus also testified to their knowledge regarding the size and layout of the\n   restroom and that the door of the Men's Restroom opened inward. The operation of the door and the possibility of a person walking in the path of the door when walking between the urinals and the sinks was open and obvious to Dr. Williams. While this open and obvious condition may not, in and of itself, warrant summary judgment, it does discharge BJ's duty to warn its invitees, like Dr. Williams, of the condition. Further, the undisputed material facts do not plausibly support Plaintiffs' allegations that BJ's failed to use ordinary care in keeping its premises in a reasonably safe condition. There is a glaring lack of record evidence that BJ's had actual or constructive notice of any dangerous condition pertaining to the Men's Restroom that it was obligated to address prior to the Incident. An inward-opening restroom door is open, obvious, and common, and the Men's Restroom door was not defective or broken, nor is there sufficient evidence that it was improperly designed, maintained, or inspected. The record evidence in this case is wholly insufficient to raise a jury question as to whether BJ's was negligent, either through its employee, Vega, or due to BJ's lack of policies or procedures, failure to correct a dangerous condition, or otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, BJ's is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant BJ's Restaurants, Inc.'s Dispositive Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Doc. 16) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to\n   <strong>\n    ENTER JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n   in favor of Defendant BJ's Restaurants, Inc. and against Plaintiffs Elizabeth Thorpe and John Clark Williams, II, and to thereafter\n   <strong>\n    CLOSE\n   </strong>\n   the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Orlando, Florida on this 8 day of December, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Plaintiffs do not specifically plead a cause of action for vicarious liability in the Amended Complaint; however, the Court notes that there is insufficient record evidence to show that Vega was negligent in how entered the Men's Restroom.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Court reviewed all of the record evidence in this case, including but not limited to the deposition of Maurice O'Donaghue. The Plaintiffs had \"an adequate opportunity for discovery\" and a sufficient factual record exists to appropriately grant summary judgment in BJ's favor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Snook v.
