BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 29, 2017, Team Worldwide Corporation (\"TWW\") filed suit against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC, Wal-Mart.com USA LLC, Sam's West, Inc. d/b/a Sam's Club (collectively, \"Walmart\" or \"Defendants\"), alleging infringement of U.S. Pat. No. 9,211,018, U.S. Pat. No. 7,346,950, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,246,394 (collectively, the \"Asserted Patents\"). On June 5, 2017, Walmart filed its answer. (Dkt. No. 16.) In July, this Court held a scheduling conference where counsel for TWW and Walmart appeared before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 2, 2017, Intex sought this Court's permission to intervene pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24. (Dkt. No. 29.) One day later, Coleman sought this Court's permission to intervene. (Dkt. No. 35.) On October 5, 2017, Bestway (USA), Inc. (\"Bestway\") also sought this Court's permission to intervene. (Dkt. No. 64.) In their Motions, each intervenor also expressed an intent, after being allowed to intervene, to seek severance for misjoinder, and to seek transfer of the newly severed cases for improper venue or convenience. On December 7, 2017, the Court allowed Intex, Coleman, and Bestway to intervene as of right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 88 at 10.) With respect to transfer, each intervenor argues that venue in this District is improper or, in the alternative, that venue is clearly more convenient in each intervenor's requested transferee District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.

R. Civ. P. 21 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20299\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because their intervention in this case is as of right. Thus, the intervenors contend that they are entitled to raise, personally, any defenses Walmart, the original party, could have raised. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , e.g., Dkt. No. 86.) In their view, severance is required \"because Plaintiff cannot plausibly allege that there is any overlap or shared technology between the Accused Products and Competitor products\" and \"there is no allegation of a joint venture.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, TWW argues that \u00a7 299 does not and should not apply because the intervenors have entered this action under Rule 24 (intervention) and not Rule 20 (joinder). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 102 at 2 (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     [T]his case is not about TWW's claims against\n     <em>\n      Intex\n     </em>\n     .\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   TWW has brought no claims against Intex. TWW's claims are against Wal-Mart.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nor has TWW joined\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Intex, Coleman, Aerobed, Bestway, or any other of the 'Competitors' that Intex complains are 'misjoined.' These voluntary intervenors entered the case on their own motions.\") (emphasis original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   TWW also argues that if the Court finds Section 299 applicable in this case, the intervenors and Walmart have waived their \"misjoinder\" defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20299\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (citing \u00a7 299(c) ) ). While recognizing the limited authority on \u00a7 299 waiver, TWW maintains that \"th[is] situation is akin to the other jurisdiction waiver that courts have applied to intervention,\" such as personal jurisdiction and venue. (Dkt. No. 102 at. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ultimately, the Court agrees with TWW. Section 299 does not and should not apply in this case because the intervenors did not enter this case under the joinder rules of Rule 20. By its own terms, Section 299 applies to joinder:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00a7 299.\n   <strong>\n    Joinder\n   </strong>\n   of parties:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (a)\n   <strong>\n    Joinder\n   </strong>\n   of Accused Infringers.-With respect to any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, other than an action or trial in which an act of infringement under section 271(e)(2) has been pled, parties that are accused infringers may be joined in one action as defendants or counterclaim defendants, or have their actions consolidated for trial, only if-\n   (1) any right to relief is asserted against the parties jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences relating to the making, using, importing into the United States, offering for sale, or selling of the same accused product or process; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) questions of fact common to all defendants or counterclaim defendants will arise in the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (b) Allegations Insufficient for\n   <strong>\n    Joinder\n   </strong>\n   .-For purposes of this subsection, accused infringers may not be joined in one action as defendants or counterclaim defendants, or have their actions consolidated for trial, based solely on allegations that they each have infringed the patent or patents in suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (c) Waiver.-A party that is an accused infringer may waive the limitations set forth in this section with respect to that party\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20299\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Joinder and intervention are different things. There is nothing in the statutory text that expands the scope of \u00a7 299 beyond joinder so as to apply to intervention. First, section (a) describes how, in limited circumstances, a plaintiff can join accused infringers in the same action. Section (b) explains that accused infringers may not be joined in one action based solely on allegations that each accused infringer infringed the patent or patents in the suit. Section (c) provides for a mechanism by which a party may waive a misjoinder defense. The word \"intervention\" is nowhere to be found in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Any discussion of intervention is also absent from the legislative history of \u00a7 299.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the House Report accompanying the AIA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The Act also addresses problems occasioned by the\n   <strong>\n    joinder\n   </strong>\n   of defendants (sometimes numbering in the dozens) who have tenuous connection to the underlying disputes in patent infringement suites.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Act amends chapter 29 of the Patent Act by creating a new \u00a7 299 that addresses\n   <strong>\n    joinder under Rule 20\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    consolidation of trials under Rule 42\n   </strong>\n   . Pursuant to the provision, parties who are accused infringers in most patent suits may be joined as defendants or counterclaim defendants only if (1) relief is asserted against the parties, jointly, severally, or in the alternative, arising out of the same transaction regarding the manufacture, use, or importation of the accused product or process; and (2) questions of fact common to all of the defendants will arise in the action. New \u00a7 299 also clarifies that\n   <strong>\n    joinder\n   </strong>\n   will not be available if it based solely on allegations that a defendant has infringed the patent(s) in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   H.R. REP. NO. 112-98 pt.1 at 54-55 (2011) (emphasis added). Congressman Smith, a named author of the bill, also explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The bill also restricts\n   <strong>\n    joinder rules\n   </strong>\n   for patent litigation. Specifically, it restricts\n   <strong>\n    joinder\n   </strong>\n   of defendants to cases arising out of the same facts and transactions,\n   which ends the abusive practice of treating as codefendants parties who make completely different products and have no relation to each other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   157 Cong. Rec. H4420 (June 22, 2011) (statement of Rep. Smith) (emphasis added). In the Senate, one key architect\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the AIA explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 19(d) of the present bill adds a new section 299 to title 35. Actually, this new section bars\n   <strong>\n    joinder of accused infringers as codefendants\n   </strong>\n   , or\n   <strong>\n    consolidation of their cases for trial\n   </strong>\n   , if the only common fact and transaction among the defendants is that they are alleged to have infringed the same patent. This provision effectively codifies current law as it has been applied everywhere outside the Eastern District of Texas. H.R. 1249 as introduced applied only to\n   <strong>\n    joinder\n   </strong>\n   of defendants in one action. As amended in the mark up and in the floor managers' amendment, the bill extends the limit on\n   <strong>\n    joinder\n   </strong>\n   to also bar\n   <strong>\n    consolidation\n   </strong>\n   of trials of separate actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [S]ection 299's purpose of allowing unrelated patent defendants to insist of being tried separately would be undermined. Section 299 thus adopts a common standard for both\n   <strong>\n    joinder of defendants\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    consolidation of their cases for trial\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   157 Cong. Rec. S5402 (Sept. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This legislative history further buttresses the text of the statute and confirms the Court's holding that \u00a7 299 does not apply here. The intervenors' argument only succeeds if Rule 24 Intervention and Rule 20 Joinder are one in the same, a proposition they actually advance. Intervenors are wrong. As Courts have repeatedly acknowledged, Rule 20 (joinder) is not the same as Rule 24 (intervention). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Binson v. J.E. Robert Co.\n   </em>\n   , the district court stated that \"[u]nlike a motion for joinder under Rule 20, which must be made by an existing party to the action, Rule 24 allows for the intervention of a new party to an action in the absence of a motion from an already existing party.\" No. 03-cv-3562 (JG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20101012\">\n    2006 U.S. Dist.

June 27, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the glaring absence of support from within the statutory text or legislative history, the intervenors ask the Court to focus on the \"policies\" behind \u00a7 299.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the intervenors, \"Congress adopted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20299\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to prohibit patentees from suing multiple competitors each selling distinct and unrelated products in the same case, because this tactic leaves such competitors in 'a mass pit with others to suit [P]laintiff's convenience.' \" (Dkt.

The intervenors also argue that there is nothing in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures or in the venue statutes that provides that \"an objection to venue is waived\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   by an intervenor as of right\" and that Rule 12 provides only specific circumstances in which 12(b) defenses may be waived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   TWW challenges the intervenors' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Ross,\n   </em>\n   arguing that \"decisions [like\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ] finding no jurisdictional waiver by intervenors are not persuasive, referring to them as a 'minority view point' with 'with questionable validity.' \" (Dkt. No. 101 at 3.) TWW also maintains that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 allows the Court to restrict challenges to venue and that even intervention as of right does not provide the intervenors the opportunity to go back in time and pretend that Plaintiff brought claims against the intervenors in the first instance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The intervenors further argue that the contrary authorities identified by TWW are distinguishable.

(Dkt. No. 88 at 15.) In\n   <em>\n    Trans World Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that a person intervening on either side of the controversy may not object to improper venue. However, the court qualified such waiver by stating that \"[b]y doing so without simultaneously or soon thereafter raising a motion directed to venue, [the intervenor] waive[s] a defense of improper venue it may have possessed as an intervenor.\" (Dkt. No. 88 at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Trans World Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"883931\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/339/56/\">\n    339 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   64 ).) The intervenors argue that they have met this qualification. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 88 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In this case, the intervenors arguments are unavailing. By definition, an intervenor\n   is \"[s]omeone who\n   <strong>\n    voluntarily\n   </strong>\n   enters a pending lawsuit because of a personal stake in it.\" INTERVENOR, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   James M.

For example, and unsurprisingly, courts have held that any objection to personal jurisdiction is waived when an absentee party intervenes and through intervention consents to jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Bayshore Ford Truck Sales, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045499,2598566\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/1233/\">\n    471 F.3d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249 (11th Cir. 2006) (\"Whereas it would not have been the case absent intervention, Westgate willingly submitted to the personal jurisdiction of the district court, and thereby agreed to be bound by the court's decision granting Ford the injunction it requested\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cty.
