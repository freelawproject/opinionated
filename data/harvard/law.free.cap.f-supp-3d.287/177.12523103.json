BRODIE, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff Tamika Daniel commenced a putative class action on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated against Defendant Mondelez International Inc. (Compl., Docket Entry No. 1.) Plaintiff alleges that \"non-functional slack-fill\" (\"excessive empty space\") in Defendant's Swedish Fish brand candy product (the \"Product\") misrepresents the amount of food, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-4), which violates sections 349 and 350 of New York's General Business Law (\"GBL\") and constitutes common law fraud under New York state law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 66, 72, 82). Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 71, 80, 87.) Defendant moves to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Def. Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 22; Def. Mem. in Supp. of Def. Mot. (\"Def. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 22-1.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants Defendant's motion to dismiss in its entirety. The Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend only her statutory claims and finds that she lacks standing to pursue injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts alleged in the Complaint are assumed to be true for the purpose of deciding Defendant's motion. Plaintiff is a citizen of the state of New York and resides in Kings County. (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of Virginia with its headquarters in Illinois.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant misleadingly \"label[s], packag[es], and advertis[es]\" its Product which is \"regularly sold at convenience stores, grocery stores, and supermarkets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to Plaintiff, the Product is \"packaged in a transparent plastic pouch inside a non-transparent thin cardboard box\" standing \"almost exactly [six] inches tall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Plaintiff asserts that the size of the box misleads purchasers by \"mak[ing] it appear as though [consumers] are buying more than what is actually being sold.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) While conceding that some \"slack-fill,\" (the empty space within the Product's packaging), may be justified, Plaintiff alleges that the current amount \"exceeds\" what is necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) By way of comparison, Plaintiff alleges that Trolli\u00ae Sour Brite Crawlers minis and Dots\u00ae, other gummy candies, are packaged in similar sized boxes with significantly less slack-fill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.) Relying on these comparisons, Plaintiff contends that the Product contains misleading slack-fill as defined by the Federal Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") Section 403(d) ( 21 U.S.C. 343(d) ), the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 part 100,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and parallel state laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff purchased two boxes of the Product relying on the size of the containers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff first purchased the Product on Long Island, New York in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite noticing the slack-fill, Plaintiff assumed that that particular box \"had been inadequately filled by accident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff only \"realized that the slack-fill was there by design\" after purchasing another box on December 8, 2016, at the\n   Atlantic Center Target Store in Brooklyn, New York for $1.08. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Having purchased the Product \"on the reasonable assumption that [the] box was filled to functional capacity,\" Plaintiff was disappointed by the extent of slack-fill, and \"would not have paid [$1.08] had she known that the box was more than half empty or had the box been proportioned to its actual contents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff includes in the Complaint photographs of the Product's packaging as well as that of the alleged comparator candies. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 8.) Defendant proffers additional photographs and details regarding the Product's packaging and that of the comparator candies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sandra Hanian Decl. in Supp. of Def. Mot. (\"Hanian Decl.\") \u00b6 3, Docket Entry No. 22-2.) Defendant's photographs include a snapshot of the Product's nutritional label listing various facts such as the serving size (seven pieces) and number of servings (two). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3(b).) Defendant also states that the candy boxes \"indicate that [the Product] is manufactured by Mondelez Global LLC\" while Trolli\u00ae Sour Brite Crawlers minis and Dots\u00ae are manufactured by Ferrara Candy Company and Tootsi Roll Industries, LLC respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff does not dispute the authenticity of the photographs and references in the Defendant's declaration and also relies extensively on the Product's packaging and that of the alleged comparators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Because the FDCA and parallel state statutes only find non-functional slack-fill to be misleading, these six enumerated reasons essentially serve as exemptions or \"safe harbors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiff conclusorily asserts that the Product contains \"excess\" slack-fill not \"justified as functional based on the exemptions in [section] 100.100(a).\" (Compl. \u00b6 31.) In support of this assertion, Plaintiff relies on the \"fact that other similarly sized candy boxes contain significantly less slack-fill.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)

While comparator products may provide evidence of non-functional slack-fill, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts to support its assertion that the candies and their packaging share any meaningful similarities to validate the comparisons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bautista\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270726\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/182/#p190\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190-91 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (granting motion to dismiss where plaintiff only provided \"wholly conclusory allegations\" while noting the potential value of expert testimony and comparisons to similar products).

Repeatedly asserting that the candies are the \"same\" does not make them so.

Plaintiff proffers a comparison between the Product and Assorted Swedish Fish Box (\"Assorted Box\"), presumably a later variation of the Product. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp'n 5-6.) While packaged in boxes \"identical in size,\" the Product and the Assorted Box contain candy pieces that are the same size, with the latter \"even includ[ing] red Swedish Fish that are identical\" to those\n   found in the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"The only physical difference between the [Product and the Assorted Box], other than color, is that the [Assorted Box] contains 3.5 oz. (17 to 18 pieces), whereas the Product contains 3.1 oz. (14 pieces).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff persuasively argues that because the only difference between the Product and the Assorted Box is in the color and number of candies enclosed, the Product must have\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   non-functional slack-fill.

Perhaps recognizing that her submissions undermine her argument, Plaintiff in her Opposition brief and accompanying declaration alleges for the first time that the\n   <em>\n    picture\n   </em>\n   of the candy on the front of the Product is misleading. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

(C.K. Lee Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Opp'n (\"Lee Decl.\") \u00b6 5, Docket Entry No. 25.) Rather than dispute the word's visibility, Plaintiff challenges the\n   <em>\n    meaning\n   </em>\n   a reasonable consumer would attach to the term \"enlarged.\" In doing so, Plaintiff makes a specious claim that it is unclear whether the word is in \"refer[ence] to the candies within or just the image.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A reasonable consumer does not lack common sense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weinstein v. eBay, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196580\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/819/219/#p228\">\n    819 F.Supp.2d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (\"[T]he applicable legal standard is whether a reasonable consumer,\n   <em>\n    not the least sophisticated consumer\n   </em>\n   , would be misled by Defendants' actions.\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    116 Boxes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661435\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/80/911/#p913\">\n    80 F.Supp. at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Infantile anticipation is not the test.\").

Plaintiff fails to explain why a reasonable consumer would not take the\n   <em>\n    shrunken\n   </em>\n   pictures into account. Furthermore, as Plaintiff acknowledges, consumers care about the density or volume of a product only as it relates to the amount or quantity of food.

Finally, to the extent Plaintiff is relying on the manner in which the Product may have been displayed by some retailers rather than the Product itself, it is unclear whether such a claim could be brought against Defendant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Druyan v. Jagger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684920\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/508/228/#p244\">\n     508 F.Supp.2d 228\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 244 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (noting that plaintiff failed to plead any facts \"tend[ing] to impute [one defendant's] alleged[ ] [misrepresentations by ticketmaster for concert] to any of the other [promoter] defendants\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Defendant asserts that \"Target-where Plaintiff claims to have purchased the [Product]-sells virtually all theater box candy, including [the Product], Crawlers, Dots\u00ae (among many others) for $1.00.\" (Def. Mem. at 23.) Defendants argue that this fact \"suggests that (a) the amount of slack-fill in each product has no impact on its price; and (b) Target not [Defendant] sets the retail price of the candy.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The Court does not find Defendant's arguments persuasive. In slack-fill cases, the fact that the price for all box candy is effectively the same does not necessarily indicate the absence of a price premium for Defendant's Product. Manufacturers can effectively \"inflate\" the price by decreasing the amount of product rather than raising the price. In addition, the fact that a third party would price all candies in similar sized boxed candies the same would appear to\n    <em>\n     incentivize\n    </em>\n    manufactures to increase the amount of slack-fill. If all box candies are valued the same by retailers, regardless of the amount of product, Defendant and other manufacturers could increase their profit margin by decreasing the amount of candy (assuming retailers also pay all manufacturers the same price for similarly sized boxes). In short, these alleged facts do not necessarily help Defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    As explained in\n    <em>\n     Greene\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264550\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/262/38/#p55\">\n     262 F.Supp.3d at 68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the Court finds that to the extent\n    <em>\n     Izquierdo\n    </em>\n    holds that Plaintiff must identify a precisely comparable product in order to allege a GBL section 349 or 350 claim under a price premium theory,\n    <em>\n     Izquierdo\n    </em>\n    contradicts the weight of the law in this Circuit.

The emphasis on \"\n    <em>\n     a material fact\n    </em>\n    \" suggests that a false statement may suffice as long as it is a significant factor that may have been relied upon.

Rather, the requirement for\n    <em>\n     reasonable\n    </em>\n    reliance appears to be the element that takes into account surrounding circumstances, i.e. context.
