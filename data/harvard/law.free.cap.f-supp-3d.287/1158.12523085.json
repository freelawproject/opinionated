BRYAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendant The GEO Group, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Class Action Complaint for Damages. Dkt. 8. The Court has considered Defendant's motion, Plaintiff Chao Chen's Response, Defendant's Reply, the Complaint, and the remainder of the file herein. Dkts. 1, 15, 16. The Court also considered oral argument held in open court on November 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Chen was a detainee at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, a facility that GEO operates under a contract with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division of the Department of Homeland Security. GEO uses detainees, including Mr. Chen, to assist in operating the facility under a Voluntary Work Program. In exchange for their work, GEO compensates detainees $1 per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Mr. Chen is entitled to compensation of $11 per hour because he is an \"employee\" as defined by the Washington State Minimum Wage Act. Defendant's motion seeks dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) under two theories: (1) State law is preempted, and (2) the Complaint fails to state a claim that detainees, including Mr. Chen, are \"employees\" deserving State minimum wage protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Facts.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Complaint.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts alleged in the Complaint are taken as true for purposes of Defendant's Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   GEO, a private corporation, has owned and operated the Northwest Detention Center, a 1,500 bed ICE facility, since 2005. Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 4.2. Northwest Detention Center detainees include Mr. Chen, who was detained pending immigration proceedings from October 2014 until February 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.1. Mr. Chen is a citizen of the People's Republic of China, but has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since the 1980s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.1. GEO relies upon detainees for its grounds maintenance, cooking, laundry, cleaning, and other services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4.4, 4.5. GEO has compensated detainees, including Mr. Chen, at $1 per day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4.7, 4.8. GEO has in some cases alternatively compensated detainees with more and better food.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Washington's minimum wage is $11 an hour. Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 4.11. The Complaint alleges that Mr. Chen is entitled to compensation at that rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Complaint seeks damages for lost wages, fees, and costs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of a proposed class, including Mr. Chen and others similarly situated. Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 6.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Dkt. 8 at 8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6 4.3. The contract central to the GEO-ICE relationship (\"the Contract\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) sets out terms for a ten-year operation of the facility. Dkt. 19 at 47. The Contract requires of GEO,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"[d]etainee labor shall be used in accordance with the detainee work plan developed by the Contractor, and will adhere to the ICE PBNDS [Performance-Based National Detention Standards] on Voluntary Work Program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. Further, \"the detainee work program shall not conflict with any other requirements of the contract and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Voluntary Work Program articulates standards,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , prohibiting discrimination, accommodating disabilities, limiting work to \"8 hours daily, 40 hours weekly,\" and compensating detainees. 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards, Section 5.8, Voluntary Work Program, available online at http://www.ice.gov/detention-standards/2011/ (last accessed Nov. 30, 2017). The detainee compensation provision of the Voluntary Work Program states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Detainees shall receive monetary compensation for work completed in accordance with the facility's standard policy. The compensation is at least $1.00 (USD) per day. The facility shall have an established system that ensures detainees receive the pay owed them before being transferred or released.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Irrelevant information.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant highlights facts surrounding the criminal conviction forming the basis for removal proceedings against Mr. Chen. Dkt. 8 at 9. These details are not relevant to resolving Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant seeks dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on two grounds, preemption and failure to state a claim. Concerning preemption, Defendant argues that the State's minimum wage provision is preempted by (1) express preemption, through 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(2), a provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), (2) field preemption, because Congress has occupied the field of immigration detention, which includes regulating detainee pay, and (3) conflict/obstacle preemption, because requiring GEO to follow the State's minimum wage creates a clear conflict between state and federal law and frustrates ICE purposes and objectives. Dkt. 8 at 15-22. Defendant argues, in the alternative, that the Complaint fails to state a claim that detainees, including\n   Mr. Chen, are \"employees\" deserving State minimum wage protections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff also argues that because employing unauthorized aliens is the act that IRCA \"sanctions,\" only state laws imposing sanctions for that conduct fall within IRCA's express preemption clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355054\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/137/#p147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Both parties agree that \u00a7 1324a(h)(2) is an express preemption statute. There are no other express preemption provisions under IRCA, so the key question is what Congress intended for \u00a7 1324a(h)(2) to preempt. Section 1324a(h)(2) prohibits states from imposing civil or criminal sanctions \"upon those who employ...unauthorized aliens[.]\" Put differently, states cannot penalize employers for employing unauthorized aliens. Even if, as Defendant argues, the provisions of the Washington Minimum Wage Act are construed as \"sanctions,\" they would not be imposed on account of employers hiring unauthorized aliens, but rather because of the failure to pay the prevailing minimum wage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 49.46.020.

Here, the pertinent area of regulation is detainee wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant has assembled a hodgepodge of federal statutes and argues that Congress intends to regulate the field of immigration detention generally, including detainee wages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16 at FN16, citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1225, 1226, 1226a, 1231, 1324a, 1555(d). Surveying the authority from Defendant, it cannot be said, with any degree of clarity, that Congress intends to occupy the field of detainee wages. At best, Defendant has highlighted general sources of authority for ICE agency action, but as discussed below, ICE has not created a regulatory scheme preempting state law through its policies, including the Voluntary Work Program. These statutes do not together show that Congress intends detainee wages to be part of IRCA's \"harmonious whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p399\">\n    567 U.S. at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p399\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The most to be gleaned about congressional intent to occupy the field of detainee wages can be found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201555\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Section 1555(d) authorizes congressional appropriations for \"payment of allowances [to detainees]...for work performed,\" but payment is limited to \"such rate\n   <em>\n    as may be specified\n   </em>\n   from time to time\n   <em>\n    in the appropriation Act\n   </em>\n   involved.\" \u00a7 1555(d) (emphasis added). Under this section, Congress arguably speaks to detainee wages when Congress appropriates payment of allowances to detainees for work performed, but although\n   \u00a7 1555(d) is still in effect, Congress has not specified any rate for detainee work since fiscal year 1979. At that time, Congress appropriated funds for \"payment of allowances (at a rate\n   <em>\n    not in excess of\n   </em>\n   $1 per day)...for work performed.\" PL 95-431 (HR 12934), PL 95-431, Oct. 10, 1978, 92 Stat 1021 (emphasis added). At least since fiscal year 1979, Congress has abandoned direct appropriations payment of allowances, despite its awareness of how to do so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, PL 114-113, December 18, 2015, 129 Stat 2242, 2497. From the text of \u00a7 1555(d), Defendant has not shown that Congress intended to preempt state law regarding detainee wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant has offered no satisfactory explanation for the congressional silence since 1979, other than to make general representations about congressional delegation of authority to ICE\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Congress could delegate the authority to create a framework regulating detainee wages to ICE, but Defendant has not made this showing. The question remains then, where the $1 per day detainee wage rate comes from, if not from Congress, and the only answer is the Voluntary Work Program. However, the Voluntary Work Program is an ICE policy with no preemptive force at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   If ICE intended for the Voluntary Work Program to preempt state law on the issue of detainee wages, ICE would need to follow at least two sets of requirements, which it has failed to do. First, as Plaintiff points out, ICE, like all federal agencies, is subject to Executive Order 13132, which requires agencies to follow specific rules when intending to preempt state law through agency policy. Dkt. 15 at 16; Federalism, 64 FR 43255, E.O. 13132 (1999). Second, for agency policy to have the force of law, agency rule-making processes must approach at least the spirit of Administrative Procedure Act (APA) formalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/\">\n    533 U.S. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) and its progeny. Defendant has made no showing that ICE made efforts to observe either set of requirements when creating the Voluntary Work Program. The policy's transience is highlighted by defense counsel's oral acknowledgement that ICE could modify the Voluntary Work Program at any time without notice. The Voluntary Work Program should not be viewed as a regulatory scheme with the legal force to preempt state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In summary, Congress has not chosen to occupy the field of detainee wages. There is no showing that Congress intended for its general appropriations after 1979 to delegate to ICE the authority to preempt state law as to detainee wages. ICE policy on detainee wages, specifically, the Voluntary Work Program, does not show a clear agency intent to preempt state law, where there is no showing that ICE attempted to observe formalities that underlie its authority to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant has not shown that the State minimum wage provision is field preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Conflict/obstacle preemption.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Conflict preemption exists \"where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,\" and obstacle preemption exists \"where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    English v.

Defendant argues that the State's minimum wage provision is preempted by both conflict and obstacle preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On conflict preemption, Defendant argues that IRCA, which prohibits the hiring of unauthorized aliens, and the State's minimum wage provision, which would require GEO to treat detainee-workers as \"employees\" deserving the State minimum wage, are in conflict, making it impossible for GEO to comply with both. Dkt. 8 at 8; Dkt. 16 at 11. \"Hiring virtually any detainee\" would violate IRCA, Defendant opines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Plaintiff contests Defendant's representation that GEO could not abide by both IRCA and the State's minimum wage provisions and represents that \"many\" detainees could work lawfully within IRCA's constraints. Dkt. 15 at 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant's conflict preemption argument is premature, because it relies on factual determinations about the status of detainees. Defendant has challenged the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), which means that the Court must resolve the motion based on allegations in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant's obstacle preemption argument is wandering and opaque,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 20-22; Dkt. 16 at 11-13, but Defendant appears to point to several federal objectives and purposes that may be obstructed: increased costs to ICE, and, ultimately taxpayers; a \"balkanized patchwork\" of state laws; and the undermining of ICE's authority to care for detainees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant's obstacle preemption argument is also premature, because addressing whether the federal objectives and purposes will be obstructed would require resolution of factual determinations far beyond the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, the conflict/obstacle preemption issues may become ripe at summary judgment or at trial, but at present factual issues abound that preclude a decision based on the pleadings, and before discovery. Defendant has not shown that the State minimum wage provision is conflict or obstacle preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Admittedly, at first blush the issue of preemption would seem to favor Defendant, given the long history of federal legislation and agency action in the area of immigration detention generally. After peeling back the rhetoric and examining the actual statutes and regulations, on the issue of detainee wages, an area of traditional state prerogative, the Court cannot find evidence of congressional intent-either express or implied-sufficient to overcome the presumption against preemption. Defendant's motion to dismiss based on preemption should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant contends that the Complaint fails to state a claim because detainees are not \"employees\" under Washington law. The Washington Minimum Wage Act defines \"employee\" generally as \"any individual employed by an employer,\" subject to an enumerated list of exceptions. RCW 49.46.010(3). Defendant argues that detainees fall under an exception, subsection (3)(k), which excepts from the general definition, \"Any resident, inmate, or patient of a state, county, or municipal correctional, detention, treatment or rehabilitative institution[.]\" RCW 49.46.010(3)(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Beginning with the statute itself, it is plain that the definition excepts residents of \"state ... detention\" facilities, not federal facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 49.46.010(3)(k). The Northwest Detention Center is a federal detention facility and thus does not fall under the exception. This conclusion is reinforced by Washington law narrowly construing exceptions in favor of the employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anfinson v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021791\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/851/#p870\">\n    174 Wash.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=281%20P.3d%20289\">\n    281 P.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Anticipating this result, Defendant urges an expansive interpretation of the\n   exception to federal detainees. (This is an ironic request, because elsewhere Defendant argues that the State deliberately omitted federal detainees from the statutory exception because it would be \"outlandish\" for the State to include them.)
