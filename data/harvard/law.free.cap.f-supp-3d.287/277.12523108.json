Bianco, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are two competing motions requesting that the Court (1) consolidate three related securities class actions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) appoint movant as lead plaintiff, and (3) approve movant's selection of lead counsel, pursuant to Section 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B), as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"PSLRA\"). The pending motions were filed in\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   , the first-filed action, one by Umang Khetarpal, Benjamin Webb, Gang Chen, Timothy Heath, and Minh Nguyen (collectively, the \"Cemtrex Investor Group\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 20),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the\n   other by Zarrin Nelson (\"Nelson,\" and together with the Cemtrex Investor Group, \"movants\") (ECF No. 23). The Cemtrex Investor Group and Nelson filed their motions on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of Cemtrex, Inc. (\"Cemtrex\" or the \"Company\") securities\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the period of defendants' alleged Exchange Act violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants include Cemtrex, as well as Cemtrex's Chief Executive Officer, Saagar Govil, Executive Director, Aron Govil, and Vice President of Finance and Principal Financial Officer, Renato Dela Rama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, because the Court finds that the three class actions present common questions of law and fact, and consolidation would serve the interests of judicial economy, the Court grants the motions to consolidate. Second, based on its determination that the Cemtrex Investor Group has the largest financial interest, and that the presumption under the PSLRA that the Cemtrex Investor Group is \"the most adequate plaintiff\" to represent the class has not been rebutted, the Court appoints the Cemtrex Investor Group as lead plaintiff. Finally, the Court approves the Cemtrex Investor Group's selection of Levi &amp; Korsinsky, LLP, as lead counsel. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(v).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A. The Securities Class Actions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the complaints, Cemtrex is a technology company, or a self-described \"world leading industrial and manufacturing company\" that provides electronic manufacturing services for \"advanced electric system assemblies, instruments &amp; emission monitors for industrial processes, and industrial air filtration and environmental control systems.\" (ECF No. 1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 19-20;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl.\") \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 7, 16.) Plaintiffs brought the instant actions on February 24, 2017, following the February 22, 2017 publication of a blog post entitled \"Cemtrex: Documents And Photos, All Signs Point To Deception And Failure,\" on\n   <em>\n    SeekingAlpha.com\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Seeking Alpha\n   </em>\n   \"), a popular investing website. (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 29;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 28;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 20.) The\n   <em>\n    Seeking Alpha\n   </em>\n   post claimed that Cemtrex was involved in conduct that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") had previously found, with regard to other companies, to be fraudulent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The post discussed problematic conduct and omissions including payments by \"Cemtrex insiders\" that were not disclosed to investors, and which had resulted in securities fraud suits in similar cases; the apparent failure to disclose insiders' sales of shares; and fraudulent conduct by Cemtrex's auditor. (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 29.) Plaintiffs allege that, \"on this news\" (or \"in reaction to the shocking disclosures\" in the\n   <em>\n    Seeking Alpha\n   </em>\n   post), the price of Cemtrex common stock fell $1.72 per share, or 33.5%, \"on unusually heavy trading volume\" that same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their complaints in the three related actions on February 24, 2017, claiming in each that defendants violated the Exchange Act through their materially false and/or misleading statements and failure to disclose material adverse facts about Cemtrex's \"business, operations, and prospects\" during the class period, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 49-59;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 53-63;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 32-41.) Plaintiffs name the same defendants in all three actions. (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-17;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-18;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.) In addition to their Exchange Act claim against all defendants, plaintiffs in the three actions bring a separate claim against the individual defendants, whom they allege acted as controlling persons and are liable for violating Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-63;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-67;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-47.) Plaintiffs in the three actions bring their claims on behalf of a putative class of investors (the \"class\") who had acquired Cemtrex securities during the class period and suffered damages as \"a direct and proximate result of Defendants' wrongful conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 56, 59;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32, 60, 63;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 38, 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs' factual allegations are largely similar. All three complaints describe the same alleged \"scheme\" to \"deceive the investing public,\" through which defendants caused the class to purchase Cemtrex's common stock at artificially inflated prices. (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 50;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 54;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 38.) Among other overlapping allegations, the complaints all point to the same alleged failure to disclose:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) that Source Capital was at risk of having its registrations terminated for wrongdoing; (2) that the Company was utilizing paid stock promoters to artificially inflate the price of the Company's stock; (3) that Aron Govil, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, was secretly paying stock promoters via an undisclosed entity; (4) that Company insiders were selling their stock during the paid promotion, taking advantage of the artificially inflated stock price; (5) that the Company's purported audit firm claimed to operate at a location that was actually vacant; (6) that the controlling partner behind the Company's auditor was banned by the SEC and [the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB\") ] for conducting fraudulent audits or reviews of public companies while performing little or no work and without being licensed; (7) that the Company's auditor was signing off on the Company's financial disclosures without conducting a proper review; and (8) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' statements about Cemtrex's business, operations, and prospects, were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 3, 30;\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Though largely similar, the three complaints vary in certain respects. Most significantly, the complaints all use different class periods:\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   defines the class period as February 11, 2016 through February 22, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    Cullinan\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1),\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   defines the class period as December 7, 2016 through February 21, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    Monteil\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1), and\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   defines the class period as October 26, 2016 through February 22, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    Guerrier\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Motions for Consolidation, Appointment as Lead Plaintiff, and Approval of Lead Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 3, 2017, defendants filed a letter informing the Court of their intention to move to consolidate these three related actions. (ECF No. 11.) Defendants have not since moved for consolidation, but various plaintiff groups have filed or acquiesced to such a motion. Guerrier's counsel, for instance, submitted a letter in response to defendants' letter, stating that counsel was \"puzzled by Defendants' request as consolidation is routinely sought in cases like this,\" and, \"[h]ad Defendants reached out to the undersigned we (and likely the plaintiffs in the other related cases) would have consented to consolidation.\" (ECF No. 12 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 25, 2017, four separate plaintiffs or plaintiff groups filed motions (1) to consolidate the related actions, (2) for appointment as lead plaintiff, and (3) for approval of their selection of lead counsel. The following plaintiffs subsequently submitted letters withdrawing their motions, and expressing their support for another potential lead plaintiff: (1) Ajith Chennadi, Wei Cao, Mark Mitchell, Thanh Monat, and Ben Webb\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Cemtrex Investor Group 2\") withdrew their motion for appointment\n   as lead plaintiff on May 8, 2017 (ECF Nos. 15, 25), and (2) Lewis Monteil withdrew his motion on May 3, 2017 (ECF Nos. 17, 24). The Court granted the motions to withdraw on October 24, 2017. The Cemtrex Investor Group and Nelson filed the two motions presently pending before the Court. On withdrawal, Cemtrex Investor Group 2 indicated that it \"does not oppose [Nelson's] competing lead plaintiff motion.\" (ECF No. 25 at 3.) Monteil, in withdrawing, expressed his support for the Cemtrex Investor Group's motion. (ECF No. 24 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Nelson and the Cemtrex Investor Group filed their oppositions. (ECF No. 26 (\"Nelson Opp.\"); ECF No. 27 (\"Cemtrex Investor Group Opp.\").) Both movants submitted replies on May 16, 2017. (ECF No. 28 (\"Cemtrex Investor Group Reply\"); ECF No. 30 (\"Nelson Reply\").) On July 17, 2017, Nelson submitted a notice of supplemental authority, bringing to the Court's attention the decision in\n   <em>\n    Galmi v. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-cv-558 (SRU), --- F.Supp.3d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%207261318\">\n    2017 WL 7261318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. July 11, 2017). (ECF No. 32 (\"Nelson Supp. Auth.\").) On December 20, 2017, the Cemtrex Investor Group submitted a notice of supplemental authority, bringing to the Court's attention the decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-4846-WFK-PK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206403513\">\n    2017 WL 6403513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2017). (ECF No. 36.) Nelson responded to the Cemtrex Investor Group's notice of supplemental authority on December 21, 2017. (ECF No. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court has fully considered the submissions of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Motion to Consolidate Related Cases\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \"[i]f actions before the court involve a common question of law or fact, the court may ... consolidate the actions; or ... issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a). The district court has broad discretion to determine whether consolidation is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537555\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/1281/#p1285\">\n    899 F.2d 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285 (2d Cir. 1990). Although \"considerations of judicial economy favor consolidation,\" on the other hand, \"[c]onsiderations of convenience and economy must yield to a paramount concern for a fair and impartial trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537555\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/1281/#p1285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537555\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/1281/#p1285\">\n    at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In determining whether consolidation is appropriate, the court must consider:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [W]hether the specific risks of prejudice and possible confusion [are] overborne by the risk of inconsistent adjudications of common factual and legal issues, the burden on parties, witnesses, and available judicial resources posed by multiple lawsuits, the length of time required to conclude multiple suits as against a single one, and the relative expense to all concerned of the single-trial, multiple-trial alternatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537555\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/1281/#p1285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (citation omitted). The Court has considered each of these factors and finds that, in light of the highly similar allegations and claims in the three class actions against Cemtrex, consolidation is appropriate in order to serve the interests of judicial economy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v. Castillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218563\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/612/369/#p373\">\n    612 F.Supp.2d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (\"Consolidation would further the goal of 'judicial economy' because discovery in each case is likely to be identical, [and] motion practice and trial in the two cases would most likely cover the same facts and some identical issues of law.\").

As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , these similarities include, among others, that the complaints: (1) were prompted by the publication of and alleged market response to the\n   <em>\n    Seeking Alpha\n   </em>\n   blog post, (2) challenge Cemtrex's auditor's qualifications and criticize Cemtrex for underpaying its auditor, (3) claim that Cemtrex paid stock promoters to artificially inflate the price of Cemtrex's stock, and (4) claim that Cemtrex insiders were selling their shares, undisclosed, during the paid promotion to take advantage of the artificially inflated share price. More generally, plaintiffs in these three actions all sued the same four defendants, on behalf of essentially the same putative class,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging the same Exchange Act violations, based on \"largely the same\" material misrepresentations and omissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For these reasons, the Court agrees with the parties' determination that the cases present common questions of law and fact, and finds that consolidation would serve the interests of judicial economy. In light of the Court's independent determination that consolidation is appropriate, as well as the parties' support for consolidation, the Court grants the motions to consolidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B. Motion to Appoint Lead Plaintiff\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1. Applicable Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The PSLRA sets forth the following standard for selecting a lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action: \"the court ... shall appoint as lead plaintiff the member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the 'most adequate plaintiff').\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i). The PSLRA establishes that courts shall adopt a presumption that the \"most adequate plaintiff\" is the class member or group that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a notice under subparagraph (A)(i);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii). This presumption can be rebutted \"only upon proof\" by a class member that the movant for appointment as lead plaintiff: (1) \"will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\"; or (2) \"is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, the PSLRA provides that (1) the plaintiff(s) who filed the complaint shall publish a notice advising members of the purported class of the pendency of the action \"[n]ot later than 20 days after the date on which the complaint is filed,\" and (2) \"not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class\" may move to serve as lead plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(A)(i). In cases where multiple actions were filed, only the plaintiff or plaintiffs in the first-filed action are required to publish a notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a threshold matter, the notice of pendency and motions for appointment as lead plaintiff were timely filed in the instant action. Cullinan, as the plaintiff in the first-filed action, was the only plaintiff required to publish a notice, and he satisfied the requirement to publish within 20 days of filing the complaint. (ECF Nos. 1, 22-1.) Then, as required, the Cemtrex Investor Group and Nelson both moved for appointment as lead plaintiff within 60 days of the date counsel for Cullinan published the notice. (ECF Nos. 20, 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   a. Aggregating Plaintiffs for Selection as Lead Plaintiff\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Cemtrex Investor Group and Nelson both satisfied the first requirement for a lead plaintiff by timely moving for appointment. Thus, the Court must next determine which of the two has \"the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii). Before turning to the method of assessing financial interest, the Court addresses the issue of whether the Cemtrex Investor Group should be permitted to aggregate individual members' financial losses for purposes of appointment as lead plaintiff-the main issue that Nelson disputes.

Nelson points to case law requiring that a plaintiff group demonstrate that \"such a grouping would best serve the class,\" and in which courts have considered the following factors: \"(1) the existence of a pre-litigation relationship between group members; (2) involvement of the group members in the litigation thus far; (3) plans for cooperation; (4) the sophistication of its members; and (5) whether the members chose outside counsel, and not\n   <em>\n    vice versa\n   </em>\n   .\" (Nelson Opp. at 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Khunt v.

Based on the Court's review of the Cemtrex Investor Group's submissions, the Court finds that the Cemtrex Investor Group has sufficiently demonstrated its group members' plans for cooperation and involvement in the litigation. The Cemtrex Investor Group submitted a joint declaration along with their opposition to Nelson's competing motion, in which they stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [T]he members of the Cemtrex Investor Group communicated, with counsel, about the benefits of working together jointly to prosecute the litigation in a collaborative and cohesive manner ... as well as the procedures and mechanisms for communication and decision-making that will ensure that the putative Class will benefit from our supervision of counsel....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [W]e will exercise joint decision-making and work together to actively monitor the activities of counsel as set forth herein....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   We have implemented communication procedures to enable us to confer via phone and/or email on short notice to ensure the Cemtrex Investor Group is able to make timely decisions.

We will continue to direct counsel and actively oversee the prosecution of the Actions for the benefit of the putative Class by, among other things, reviewing pleadings and conferring amongst ourselves.

In these and other affirmations, the Cemtrex Investor Group members discuss past communications, plans for future collaboration-including specific procedures to ensure that they are able to \"make timely decisions\"-and their commitment to overseeing counsel's activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In arguing that the Court should reject the Cemtrex Investor Group's motion, Nelson urges that a proposed lead plaintiff group must present evidence that the members of the group \"chose outside counsel, and not\n   <em>\n    vice versa\n   </em>\n   \" (Nelson Opp. at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Khunt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360035\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/102/523/#p532\">\n    102 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   533 ) ), and that the Cemtrex Investor Group has failed to do so. This purported requirement is, however, simply one of the factors some courts have considered in deciding these motions; it is not an actual requirement. In\n   <em>\n    Blue Apron\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the\n   court not only did not include the aforementioned factors discussed in\n   <em>\n    Khunt\n   </em>\n   in its opinion, but the court also approved a group that was clearly lawyer-assembled: \"none of the proposed lead plaintiffs claim to have any relationship with one another beyond their participation in this litigation, much less a meaningful one.

Regardless of whether this Court considers this factor to be significant, the Court finds that the Cemtrex Investor Group members submitted sufficient evidence of their involvement in the formation of the group: \"[i]n order to formalize our joint leadership of the Actions, the members of the Cemtrex Investor Group communicated, with counsel, about the benefits of working together jointly to prosecute the litigation.\" (Cemtrex Investor Group Decl. in Supp. of Opp. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Based on its review of the record, the Court finds that the Cemtrex Investor Group is far from the type of makeshift, lawyer-driven group Nelson describes. The Cemtrex Investor Group members have even attested to their willingness to personally travel to and participate in litigation proceedings. The Cemtrex Investor Group has more than adequately demonstrated that its members \"will be able to function cohesively and to effectively manage the litigation apart from their lawyers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206403513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Varghese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3175568\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/388/#p393\">\n    589 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   392 ).

This Court will also utilize this framework in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, based on movants' submissions, it is clear that the Cemtrex Investor Group has the largest financial interest. The Cemtrex Investor Group alleges that it acquired more than 90,000 shares of Cemtrex securities during the class period, and suffered a loss of approximately $182,000 \"as a result of the revelations of the fraud.\" (ECF No. 21 (\"Cemtrex Investor Group Mem. of Law\") at 6-7; ECF No. 22-3 (\"Summary Loss Chart of the Cemtrex\n   Investor Group\").) Nelson, by comparison, alleges that she suffered a loss of approximately $90,000 during the class period. (ECF No. 23-1 (\"Nelson Mem. of Law\"); ECF Nos. 23-4, 23-5 (\"Nelson's Trades in CETX Securities\").) Nelson did not put forward any arguments as to why the Court should assign greater weight to a\n   <em>\n    Lax\n   </em>\n   factor other than loss, and financial loss was the only figure she included in support of her motion for appointment as lead plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blue Apron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206403513\">\n    2017 WL 6403513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (determining \"largest financial interest\" based on the parties' representations as to their approximate losses, which the court found to be \"an appropriate proxy for the movants' overall financial interest\" because the parties focused their arguments on those figures and did not argue that any other factor should weigh more heavily).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In her opposition, Nelson argues that, due to the timing of movant Khetarpal's sales of some of his Cemtrex shares, movant Khetarpal's individual loss during the class period was actually $70,392.86 rather than $98,282.66, as the Cemtrex Investor Group alleges.

Even if the Court were to accept Nelson's argument, the Court would still find the Cemtrex Investor Group's loss to be significantly greater than Nelson's. Additionally, directing the Court to the other\n   <em>\n    Lax\n   </em>\n   factors, the Cemtrex Investor Group submitted a table comparing movants' relative financial interests, and demonstrating that its interest is greater than Nelson's under all four metrics. (Cemtrex Investor Group Opp. at 1-2.) The Court finds that, based on its assessment of the fourth and most important factor, as well as the four\n   <em>\n    Lax\n   </em>\n   factors together, the Cemtrex Investor Group has the largest financial interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   c. Rule 23 Requirements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition to meeting the first two requirements, the Court finds that the Cemtrex Investor Group has made a preliminary prima facie showing that it otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and is, therefore, presumptively the most adequate plaintiff. Rule 23 establishes that a class action may proceed only if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Fed.

The Cemtrex Investor Group argues that the\n   typicality requirements are satisfied because, like the proposed class, (1) the Cemtrex Investor Group claims that \"defendants' material misstatements and omissions concerning Cemtrex's business, operations and financial prospects violated the federal securities laws,\" and (2) the Cemtrex Investor Group \"purchased Cemtrex securities in reliance on defendants' alleged misstatements and omissions and was damaged thereby.\" (Cemtrex Investor Group Mem. of Law at 8.) The Court finds that the Cemtrex Investor Group has made the requisite prima facie showing that the lead plaintiff and class claims arise from the same course of events-the purchase of Cemtrex securities in reliance on defendants' alleged misstatements-and are based on similar legal arguments surrounding defendants' violation of the federal securities laws and the resulting harms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In order for a lead plaintiff to satisfy the Rule 23 adequacy requirement, \"(1) there should be no conflict between the interests of the class and the named plaintiff nor should there be collusion among the litigants; and (2) the parties' attorney must be qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Fuwei Films\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3142278\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/247/432/#p437\">\n    247 F.R.D. at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

(Cemtrex Investor Group Mem. of Law at 8.) The Cemtrex Investor Group also asserts that the financial losses it suffered \"ensure that it has sufficient incentive to ensure vigorous advocacy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court finds that the Cemtrex Investor Group has made a sufficient showing at this stage of its adequacy to represent the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   d.

As the Court now grants the Cemtrex Investor Group's motion for appointment as lead plaintiff, it also considers the Cemtrex Investor Group's selection of lead counsel, Levi &amp; Korsinsky, LLP.

Mr. Webb was unaware that he had been referred by the Goldberg firm to The Rosen Law Firm. Having never directly spoken to anyone at the Rosen firm, Mr. Webb was also unaware that the Rosen firm was seeking his appointment for lead plaintiff as part of the Cemtrex Investor Group 2. Upon learning that the two lawsuits were the same, Mr. Webb promptly sought to withdraw as a client of the Goldberg firm and, thus, from the Cemtrex Investor Group 2. On May 8, 2017, the Rosen firm withdrew the Cemtrex Investor Group 2's motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and represented in the withdrawal that its members did \"not oppose the competing lead plaintiff Motion of Nelson\" (the \"Withdrawal\"). Again, Mr. Webb was unaware that the Withdrawal was being filed, did not consent to its filing and, contrary to the representations in the Withdrawal,\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      does\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    oppose the Nelson motion ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    (ECF No. 27 (\"Cemtrex Investor Group Opp.\") at 6-7 n.5 (internal citations omitted).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Thomas Cullinan, one of the plaintiffs in the instant action, is the only plaintiff who has not submitted a letter or motion to the Court concerning consolidation; however, Cullinan has also not filed anything in this case after filing his complaint and summons.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Although the different class periods alleged in the three complaints could impact which putative class members would, in fact, qualify, none of the parties raises this issue or opposes consolidation on this basis.
