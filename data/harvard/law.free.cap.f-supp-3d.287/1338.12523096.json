DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants have renewed their motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b), asserting they are entitled to judgment in their favor because (1) the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tiffany's v. Ebay\n   </em>\n   controls the contributory liability analysis and requires evidence of specific notice of infringement; (2) Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate evidence of Defendants' willful blindness; (3) Plaintiffs failed to establish the individual liability of Jerome Yeh, Donald Yeh, and Alice Jamison via corporate veil piercing, or that the individual Defendants engaged in sufficient activities to create individual liability independent of their roles as officers or shareholders of Airport Mini Mall, LLC or Yes Assets, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In\n   <em>\n    Tiffany\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals adopted a narrow interpretation of the Supreme Court's contributory infringement standard in\n   <em>\n    Inwood Labs., Inc. v.

According to Defendants, all of Plaintiffs' evidence at trial failed to establish their liability under these parameters. Defendants have simply repackaged their arguments previously rejected by the Court on summary judgment and in ruling on the pretrial motions in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants assert that neither the November 21, 2014 raid, nor Plaintiffs' December 2014 and April 2015 pre-suit notice letters, provided sufficient prior notice or warning to Defendants of counterfeit RayBan or Oakley sales by their tenants to establish contributory liability for trademark infringement. First, Defendants contend there is no evidence they were aware of any tenants selling counterfeit Ray-Ban or Oakley merchandise before the November 2014 raid. Plaintiffs, however, offered evidence demonstrating that Defendants knew, or had reason to know, about the raids, seizures, and arrests of the tenants at the Discount Mall related to counterfeit sales of Luxottica and other luxury brand merchandise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Plaintiffs introduced evidence of an April 5, 2013 search warrant and arrest of the tenant at booths J9/K8 for selling counterfeit merchandise,\n   including counterfeit Oakley and Ray-Ban items. (Pls.' Exs. 656, 848.) College Park Police Detective, Dustin Matthews, testified that he notified the Discount Mall security officer of the warrant and arrest and left a copy of the search warrant and inventory list of what was seized at the booth. (TR Vol II at 273-75, 285-86, Doc. 179.) Defendants renewed the lease for this tenant at booths J9/K8 in 2014. (Pls.' Ex. 196.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants further contend that even after the raid and their receipt of Luxottica's December 2014 notice letter, they still had no notice of which tenants were alleged to be engaging in infringing sales. The November 21, 2014 raid of the Discount Mall was central to the evidence presented at trial. The jury heard evidence that officers from the College Park Police Department and United States Department of Homeland Security raided the Discount Mall after a series of prior undercover buys indicated a significant amount of counterfeit goods were being openly sold by multiple mall vendors. (Pls.' Ex. 849, 528, 535.) More than a dozen tenants were arrested and nearly 3,500 counterfeit Ray-Ban and Oakley items were seized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants' onsite property manager for the Discount Mall, Greg Dickerson testified that he learned that arrests were made during the raid, and personally witnessed the tenants being escorted from the building, placed in handcuffs, and driven away in police vehicles. (TR, Vol VII at 1172-73, Doc. 184.) After the raid, Dickerson spoke with his tenants who indicated they were arrested for possible counterfeiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1176-77, 1183-84.) Dickerson worked with his security personnel who were present inside the Discount Mall the day of the raid to put together a \"rough list of what appeared to be businesses that were impacted\"-meaning a list of the tenant booths from which counterfeit merchandise was seized including a list of the merchandise that was seized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1179-80.) Dickerson also admits to receiving both of Luxottica's cease and desist letters: (i) the December 2014 letter expressly placing Defendants on notice that their tenants were engaged in selling counterfeit Luxottica merchandise; and (ii) the April 2015 letter that specifically identified booths A-6, B-8, E-8 and J-13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The evidence, including Dickerson's testimony, is sufficient to demonstrate that Defendants had notice that certain identified tenants were known to sell counterfeit Luxottica merchandise, contrary to Defendants' assertions now that they had no such notice. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Judgment as a matter of law on the basis that Plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence under governing law that Defendants had the requisite prior knowledge of their tenants' infringing sales to support a finding of contributory liability for trademark infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidence of Defendants' Willful Blindness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants acknowledge in their motion that \"willful blindness may be sufficient to establish a contributory trademark infringement claim.\" (Doc. 170-1 at 11.) They assert, however, that while a defendant can be found liable if he suspects wrongdoing and deliberately fails to investigate, a defendant cannot be found liable\n   for failing to take reasonable precautions against sales of counterfeit items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the issue of contributory infringement and willful blindness, the Court instructed the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A defendant has no affirmative duty to take precautions against the sale of counterfeit goods or to seek out and prevent alleged trademark violations and cannot be found liable if he or she simply fails to take reasonable precautions against sales of counterfeit items. As explained above, however, a defendant may be contributorily liable for infringement if the defendant continues to supply its services including but not limited to space, utilities, parking, advertising and customers to any tenant/vendor whom the defendant either knew or had reason to know was selling, offering for sale, or distributing products bearing counterfeits of Plaintiffs' trademarks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Willful blindness\" means that the landlord or its agents had reason to suspect that counterfeit goods were being offered or sold, but deliberately failed to investigate, or looked the other way to avoid seeing such activity. Willful blindness may be sufficient to establish a contributory trademark infringement claim, but mere negligence is not. Willful blindness asks what the defendant suspected and what he did with such suspicion. Thus, a defendant can be found liable for contributory trademark infringement if he or she suspects wrongdoing and deliberately fails to investigate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Doc. 155 at 14, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants assert they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law in their favor based on evidence that: (1) Defendant AMM prohibited the sale of counterfeit items in all tenant leases; (2) Defendants' manager, Greg Dickerson, spoke to the tenants after receiving Luxottica's letters and was assured that the tenants' sunglasses were legitimate; (3) Defendants' attorney met with the tenants in December 2014 and informed them that the sale of counterfeit items was prohibited and that AMM would take legal action to dispossess any tenant if AMM received evidence it could use in a court to prove a tenant's sale of counterfeit goods; (4) In January 2015, AMM distributed flyers to tenants reminding them that the sale of counterfeit items was prohibited; (5) Upon receipt of Luxottica's April 2015 letter, Dickerson directed tenants to remove all Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses or provide evidence they were an authorized dealer; (6) Defendants sought assistance from Plaintiffs' investigator, Geanie Johansen, to identify tenants who were selling counterfeit merchandise and to dispossess those tenants; (7) Plaintiffs refused to provide requested assistance in October/November 2015 in dispossessing a tenant identified by Defendants as selling counterfeit sunglasses; and (8) Defendants sought assistance from law enforcement to secure records and information regarding counterfeiting but received no such assistance. According to Defendants, they were improperly found liable for what in essence amounted to negligence based on their lack of expertise to distinguish counterfeit merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants' motion, however, fails to acknowledge other evidence presented at trial by Plaintiffs from which the jury could find Defendants were willfully blind to the infringing conduct of their tenants, that Defendants had reason to suspect and had knowledge of the counterfeit sales, and deliberately failed to take serious, corrective action in light of what was known from the various notice letters and law enforcement raids. Plaintiffs submitted evidence from which the jury could find that Defendants exhibited willful blindness by failing and refusing to take action to stop the\n   counterfeit sales after dozens of their tenants were arrested and thousands of counterfeit items were seized by law enforcement during the November 2014 raid. Plaintiffs offered evidence that counterfeit merchandise continued to be openly displayed for sale on multiple occasions in the Discount Mall after Mr. Dickerson claims he met with the tenants. (Pls.' Exs. 551, 536, 537, 539, 554-560, 669.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Luxottica's notice letters advised Defendants that \"If, while policing your property, you see a product bearing [Luxottica's] marks, it is a counterfeit product. Luxottica does not offer its merchandise for sale through individuals, street vendors, unauthorized retail locations, or flea markets.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 2.) At trial, Mr. Dickerson admitted that he disregarded this information because he asserted he had no specific proof that the tenants' merchandise was counterfeit. (TR, Vol VIII at 12118-22, Doc. 185.) He acknowledged, however, that he believed there was a possibility the tenants were selling counterfeit merchandise, but that Defendants maintained the position that they would not take action to evict the tenants without a criminal prosecution being taken against the tenants by the merchandise brand owners (i.e. Luxottica). (TR, Vol VII at 1183-84, Doc. 184; TR, Vol VIII at 1252-53, Doc. 185.) Plaintiffs introduced evidence that Defendants repeatedly renewed the leases of tenants who Defendants had notice were found to have engaged in repeated counterfeit sales, including tenants who were arrested or whose merchandise had been seized during the November 2014 raid. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Exs. 209-212, 215, 216, 218, 219 and 224.) Luxottica also introduced evidence that its undercover investigators returned to the Discount Mall on several occasions in 2015 and made purchases of counterfeit Ray-Ban and Oakley merchandise and that another raid in 2016 resulted in the seizure of thousands of counterfeit items bearing Luxottica's trademarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As Luxottica advised in the pre-suit notice letters, a landlord may be held liable for contributory trademark infringement by continuing to lease space to a tenant whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement even without direct control over the infringing conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duty Free Americas, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331476\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1248/#p1276\">\n    797 F.3d at 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"under appropriate facts, contributory trademark infringement might be grounded upon a [defendant's] bad faith refusal to exercise a clear contractual power to halt the infringing activities\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodfellow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576622\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/498/#p503\">\n    717 F.3d at 503-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a flea market owner and operator who \"provide[d] ... rental booths and storage units for vendors\" was contributorily liable when he had reason to know of trademark infringement committed by\n   <em>\n    some vendors\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    Fonovisa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7627541\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/259/#p264\">\n    76 F.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 265 (noting that \"it would be difficult for the infringing activity to take place in the massive quantities alleged without the support services provided by the [flea market] ... includ[ing],\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the provision of space, utilities, parking, advertising, plumbing, and customers\");\n   <em>\n    Hard Rock Cafe Licensing Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11291586\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/955/1143/#p1148\">\n    955 F.2d at 1148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying common law tort doctrines to claim for contributory infringement and stating that a landlord \"is responsible for those it permits on its premises 'knowing or having reason to know that the other is acting or will act tortiously' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court instructed the jury that Defendants could be found contributorily liable for infringement if they possessed the power and authority to exercise control over the means of their tenants' sale of counterfeit merchandise, i.e., that Defendants possessed the right, ability or authority to control either (i) the use of the physical retail space that it rented at the Discount Mall, or (ii) the activities that any of its vendors could engage in while occupying\n   such space at the Discount Mall. The Court further instructed the jury on the following provisions of Georgia commercial landlord/tenant law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [U]nder Georgia law, if, under the terms of a commercial lease, a landlord has the right to terminate a lease for breach of rules established by the lease, for specific reasons identified in the lease, or if it has the right to reenter and take possession of the premises immediately or within a specified number of days advance notice, the landlord may do so without filing or going through a dispossessory proceeding in court if this can be accomplished. A landlord is therefore entitled to rely upon default provisions in a commercial lease agreement, which gives him the right to terminate the lease or reenter and take possession without resort to legal proceedings or a dispossessory proceeding, and he properly acts pursuant to the terms of lease in reentering and taking possession of premises upon default by tenants, without being subject to liability to the tenant for trespass, breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment of the premises, or breach of terms of lease agreement. A landlord similarly has the right to terminate or decline to renew a commercial property lease at its date of conclusion and then reenter and take possession of the premises without filing or resort to a dispossessory proceeding, so long as he can take possession without a breach of the peace. A breach of the peace is a violation or disturbance of the public tranquility and order. If a commercial landlord is unable to reenter the premises and take possession without a breach of the peace, he is required to file a dispossessory lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Doc. 155 at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs presented evidence that Defendants had the authority under the terms of their lease agreements to evict a tenant, terminate a tenant's lease, or decline to renew a tenant's lease based on the tenant's sale of counterfeit merchandise in violation of the lease provisions prohibiting such sales. The lease terms did not require a criminal conviction for counterfeiting or formal dispossessory proceedings as conditions before Defendants could exercise their lease remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the totality of the evidence at trial, not just Defendant's one-sided version, a reasonable jury could find either for or against the Defendants as to whether it took real action, whether the Defendants were willfully blind and failed to properly investigate whether the goods their vendors were selling were authentic or counterfeit, even though they had good reason to suspect that the goods were likely counterfeit. A reasonably jury could have found that Defendants' choice not to exercise their rights under the lease and Georgia law was the result of their blind acceptance of the tenants' denial of the allegations and their hands-off approach in the face of evidence of repeated and systemic acts of infringement within the Discount Mall. Or, A reasonable jury could have found from the evidence at trial that Defendants took sufficient measures to prevent the sale of counterfeits at their Discount Mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As the Court finds the evidence sufficient to support a jury determination of contributory infringement based on a failure by Defendants to take action against the tenants within the bounds of their leases to address the continued sale of counterfeit goods, Defendants' Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
