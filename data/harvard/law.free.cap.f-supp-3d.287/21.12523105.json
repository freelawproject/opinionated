Title III,\" on the ground that the orders authorizing the intercepts were \"facially insufficient.\" Defs.' Mot. Suppress T.

The defendants' suppression motion, followed by their motions to compel discovery, are discussed in turn.</p><p id=\"p-14\"><strong>A. Defendants' Joint Motion to Suppress Title III Intercepts</strong></p><p id=\"p-15\">The government conducted a 22-month wiretap investigation between February 2013 and December 2014, during which the government submitted and obtained 27 applications for electronic intercepts and ultimately intercepted \"thousands of pertinent electronic communications (Blackberry Messenger text messages ['BBMs'] )\" from \"over [59] different devices.\" Gov't's Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts (\"Gov't's First Opp'n T. III Intercepts\") at 2-3, ECF No. 68. The first wiretap application and order targeted the electronic communications of Panfilo, who was using \"Target Device 1.\" <em>Id.</em> at 3-4. Over the course of the investigation, three additional BlackBerry devices used by Panfilo were subject to court-authorized interception. <em>Id.</em> In total, \"[t]he government intercepted approximately 12,500 pertinent electronic communications between Panfilo and other [alleged] co-conspirators.\" <em>Id.</em> at 4. Apparently, these pertinent BBMs of Panfilo's were intercepted during thirteen months in 2013 and 2014: February through October, 2013, and May, June, July, and December 2014. <em>See</em> Gov't's Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Compel Discovery (\"Gov't's Opp'n Defs.' Discovery Mots.\") at 3-4, ECF No. 44 (listing \"periods of time\" in which intercepted communications \"are between Panfilo and various co-conspirators\"); Defs.' Suppl. Reply Supp. Mot. Suppress T.

Agustin was imprisoned during the interceptions, and none of his communications were intercepted. Gov't's First Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 4.</p><p id=\"p-16\">The government's initial application, seeking to intercept electronic communications over Target Device # 1 was granted by the District Court in the Western District of Texas, on February 19, 2013. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 2-3; <em>see also id.</em> , Ex. 1, Application for Interception for Electronic Communications (\"Initial T.

That first application and order, as well as the twenty-six that followed, all contained \"the same information-a Government attorney's name in the application and order, and reference [to] the appropriately designated [Department of Justice ('DOJ') ] official,\" as is required by <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202516\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516</extracted-citation>(3) for interceptions of electronic communications. Gov't's First Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 3. Although \"the Government sought only to intercept electronic communications when it first applied for judicial authorization,\" the wiretap also intercepted some \"wire (voice) communications,\" mostly \"in the form of 'voice notes,' \" which are in a compressed audio Adaptive Multi-Rate (\"AMR\") file format. Gov't's' Third Suppl. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts (\"Gov't's Fourth Opp'n T. III Intercepts\") at 3-4, ECF No. 113. The interception of these voice notes, or AMR files, was due to BMM's functionality in transmitting both audio and text communications over the same network and the Blackberry service provider's inability to disaggregate the two formats of communications. Gov't's Suppl. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts (\"Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts\") at 3-4, ECF No. 89. As the government explains, BBM is BlackBerry's \"proprietary instant messaging service,\" and \"[u]sers of BBM are able to attach video and audio files, including 'voice notes,' to standard text conversations and send these messages as BBM communications utilizing [BlackBerry's] network.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202516\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202516\"> at 3</extracted-citation>. BlackBerry announced the voice notes functionality in December 2012, three months before the wiretap investigation in this case began. Defs.' Third Reply Supp. Mot. Suppress Title III Intercepts (\"Defs.' Fourth Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts\") at 2, ECF No. 129.</p><p id=\"p-17\">The government does not dispute that wire communications in the form of AMR files were intercepted, along with the court-authorized electronic communications. To deal with the occurrence of unauthorized intercepted wire communications, monitors at the reviewing site in El Paso, Texas were directed, in accordance with the instructions in the government's applications and orders, promptly to minimize such communications. Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 4; <em>see also, e.g.</em> , Initial T. III App. at 8; Initial T. III Order at 6-7, ECF No. 68-2. The government instructed monitors not to listen to any unauthorized intercepted wire communications in both verbal instructions and in signs taped to monitors' computers that stated \"Do Not Listen to Any Audio Files.\" Jt. Stm. Discovery \u00b6 5. At trial, the government plans to use as evidence only \"lawfully intercepted electronic communications.\" Gov't's Opp'n Defs.' Discovery Mots. at 3-4.</p><p id=\"p-18\">The government has dribbled out information regarding the wiretaps, prompting over four rounds of briefing and two status conferences to clarify the basic facts related to this aspect of the government's <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"29\" href=\"#p29\" id=\"p29\">*29</a>investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This approach to discovery is both unhelpful and unnecessarily time-consuming for the Court and the parties. Now, in the face of more complete discovery from the government, the defendants advance an evolved argument for suppression based on their understanding of the government's interceptions as being \"hybrid\" in nature and, as such, requiring authorization pursuant to the \" 'wire' standard,\" instead of the standard for electronic communications. Defs.' Fourth Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts\" at 8-9; Defs.' Reply Gov't's Second Suppl. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts (\"Defs.' Third Reply Mot. Suppress T.

Reply Supp. Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 4, ECF No. 82 (making same argument, citing Ian Austen, <em>BlackBerry Phones Get Free Calls Over Wi-Fi</em> , N.Y. TIMES (Dec. 10, 2012), https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/blackberry-phones-get-free-calls-over-wi-fi/). To underscore the point, the defendants cite the 170 AMR files intercepted, seven of which were erroneously marked \"pertinent,\" as well as the government's representation that the first AMR file was intercepted on March 23, 2013, just over a month after the initial application in the wiretap, and that later wiretap affidavits and orders actually sought authorization to intercept wire communications. Defs.' Third Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 3; Defs.' Fourth Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts 2-7.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given the interceptions of \"hybrid\" communications, in the defendants' view, the government should have sought authorization \"to intercept 'wire communications' <em>ab initio</em> ,\" and such authorization, unlike for electronic communications, statutorily requires inclusion of the name of the authorizing high-ranking DOJ official on all applications and orders. <em><extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202516\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202516\"> at 1</extracted-citation>. Absent the name of the authorizing high-ranking DOJ official, the defendants contend the interception orders are \"facially defective\" and must be suppressed under <em>United States v. Scurry</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257275,12310511\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1/\">821 F.3d 1</extracted-citation> (D.C.

Thus, the defendants' challenge to the facial validity of the wiretap applications and orders rests on whether, in light of Blackberry's functionality and associated challenges in disaggregating different communication formats, the government was required to seek authorization to intercept wire communications and comply with statutory requirements applicable to wire communications, when only electronic communications were targeted for use at trial, with other communication formats minimized.</p><p id=\"p-21\">At the outset, the government concedes that the seven AMR files improperly marked as pertinent must be suppressed. Gov't's Fourth Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 5 (citing <em>United States v. Suggs</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3123572\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/531/13/#p24\">531 F.Supp.2d 13</extracted-citation>, 24 (D.D.C. 2008), <em>aff'd sub nom.</em> <em>United States v.

The government posits, however, that suppression of the intercepted electronic communications is not warranted because the government only targeted electronic communications in connection with Panfilo and, thus, did not need to satisfy any different statutory authorization requirements applicable to <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"31\" href=\"#p31\" id=\"p31\">*31</a>wire communications with respect to those intercepts. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 1. The fortuity \"that voice notes can be transmitted over the BlackBerry system does little to alter the fact that the Government did not seek to intercept such communications for the first six months of this investigation.\" <em>Id.</em> at 4. The government argues that the defendants' theory \"would yield an absurd result\" because \"it would require the Government to adhere to the standards for interception of wire communications even where the Government seeks no such communications and lacks probable cause for such communications, simply because it is technically possible to intercept wire communications concurrently with electronic communications.\" <em>Id.</em><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees with the government.</p><p id=\"p-22\"><em>1.

The government maintains, and the defendants do not dispute, that Ms. Goldbarg is an attorney for the government, as contemplated by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See</em> FED. R.

This leads directly to the key issue raised by the defendants that, in light of the \"hybrid\" interceptions of BBMs and AMR files, the applications and orders issued in connection with the underlying investigation should have complied with the statutory requirements applicable to wire communications.</p><p id=\"p-29\">As noted, the defendants' evolved position, which relies heavily on legislative history, is that the government should have sought and obtained authorization to intercept both wire and electronic communications. <em>See</em> Defs.' Fourth Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 8-10; Defs.' Third Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 1-2. In particular, the defendants point to a House Judiciary Committee Report on ECPA, stating that: \"The Committee understands that [DOJ] will apply for a court order under the 'wire' standards in cases where a tap may intercept mixed wire and electronic communications,\" and \"[a]s long as the wire standards are followed a single court order should suffice to authorize the interception of both wire and electronic communications involving the same lines of instruments.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\"> at 2</extracted-citation> (quoting H.R.

REP. NO. 99-647, at 35. In context, the purpose of this language appears to be to urge use of the \"wire\" standard when the targeted \"transaction\" contains different types of communications, subject to differing rules of disclosure; hence the report goes on to instruct that where interception of the entire communication is sought, \"a single court order should suffice to authorize the interception of both wire and electronic communications involving the same lines or instruments.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\"> at 36</extracted-citation>.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This language simply begs the question at issue here of whether compliance with this \"wire\" standard is required when the \"wire\" parts of the communication are not part of the \"transaction\" targeted for interception.</p><p id=\"p-30\">In short, this House Judiciary Committee Report language may bear on situations in which the government is actually seeking to capture both electronic and wire forms of communications, but this was not the government's intent here. The government only began collecting these AMR files in this case because of \"a technological limitation.\" Gov't's' Second Suppl. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts (\"Gov't's Third Opp'n T. III Intercepts\") at 14, ECF No. 101-2. Indeed, as the government explains, BlackBerry was \"unable to discern [whether] a particular BBM contain[ed] an embedded wire communication unless it manually reviewed the data for audio files, and concluded the audio files included the human voice,\" which BlackBerry declined to do. Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 4; <em>see also</em> Status Conf. Hr'g (<em>rough</em> ) Tr. (Aug. 17, 2017) at 70-79. As a result, BlackBerry \"automatically\" forwarded data, without separating the electronic from the wire communications, to the FBI Data Intercept Technology Unit (\"DITU\") server, which then \"automatically forwarded the messages in this case to specialized equipment located at the FBI El Paso Division, where it was reviewed by the monitors.\" Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 3. To address this technical challenge of disaggregating AMR files from the court-authorized electronic intercepts, the government took steps to ensure monitors minimized and did not listen to any unauthorized AMR and other audio files. <em>See</em> Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 4; Jt. Stm. Discovery \u00b6 5 (discussing verbal instructions and signage on minimization).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-31\">The government contends that \"simply because it is technically possible to intercept wire communications concurrently with electronic communications,\" law enforcement should not be required to seek authority to intercept both under the wire standard. Gov't's Fourth Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 4. The perverse result of such a requirement would be that some communication technologies might be put outside the reach altogether of Title III surveillance or, alternatively, more intrusive surveillance may ensue. For example, if the government seeks, and only has probable <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"35\" href=\"#p35\" id=\"p35\">*35</a>cause sufficient, to intercept electronic communications, but due to the unique technology involved, the targeted electronic communications are transmitted simultaneously with wire communications, the government would be unable to obtain court authorization for the interception, at least or until, sufficient probable cause were developed to meet the standard for wire communication interceptions as well. Likewise, where the government may be able to establish probable cause to intercept wire communications, but only wants to obtain electronic communications, the government would have to seek authority for a hybrid wiretap, leading to more expansive surveillance, with concomitant privacy intrusions for the targets of the surveillance and the increased burden on the government to manage surveillance of multiple communication formats. This simply makes no sense as a policy matter, and is not required by the wiretap statute, which instead expressly contemplates using minimization procedures to address the capture of unauthorized communications, either in terms of format or content. <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518</extracted-citation> (instructing that \"[e]very order and extension thereof ... shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter\").</p><p id=\"p-32\">The Court concludes that the government took appropriate steps to minimize wire communications, which were intercepted due to the technology subject to surveillance, and that the Title III applications and orders at issue are facially valid since they sought only the interception of electronic communications and, consequently, reflect the appropriate authorizing government attorney's approval.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-33\">The final issue raised by the defendants is whether the interception of seven AMR files, which the government concedes are wire communications and therefore were improperly marked \"pertinent,\" requires suppression of the entire wiretap. <em>See</em> Defs.' Second Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 2; Gov't's Fourth Opp'n T. III Intercepts 4-5. As noted, the government reports that approximately 170 AMR files were intercepted, 163 of which were minimized and seven of which were \"erroneously marked pertinent.\" Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 4. The monitors were instructed \"not to open or listen to an AMR files because they did not have authorization to intercept wire communications.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> According to the government, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"36\" href=\"#p36\" id=\"p36\">*36</a>the seven AMR files marked pertinent \"were all received within the same [monitoring] session by the same monitor.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\"> at 5</extracted-citation>. \"Based upon discussions with law enforcement agents, the monitor who marked the seven (7) AMR files as pertinent did not listen to the audio contained within them.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\"> at 4-5</extracted-citation>.

In this case, the government took reasonable efforts, given the technical obstacles to avoiding collection of AMR files during court-authorized interception of electronic communications, to minimize the wire communications. Indeed, the only alternative suggested by the defendants is for the government to have sought and obtained additional authority to expand the surveillance to encompass all wire communications, <em>see</em> Defs.' Second Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 3, which is no solution at all to the minimization challenge.</p><p id=\"p-35\">The proper remedy here is to suppress only those seven AMR files erroneously marked pertinent, similar to situations in which partial suppression is ordered when the government has failed to minimize certain intercepted communications properly.

With respect to the alleged co-conspirators' intercepts, Panfilo suggests that \"if the Defendant is not the subject of nor any of his communications captured in any of the intercepts of his co-conspirators, these communications have apparent exculpatory value.\" Panfilo's Reply Discovery Mot. at 3. As noted, <em>supra</em> note 20, Panfilo's absence from certain pertinent intercepts of co-conspirators does little to rebut the inculpatory evidence contained in the approximately 12,500 Panfilo intercepts the government seeks to use at trial. <em>See</em> <em>U.S. v. Scarpa</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538261\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/993/#p1011\">913 F.2d 993</extracted-citation>, 1011 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"A defendant may not seek to establish his innocence ... through proof of the absence of criminal acts on specific occasions.\"). Moreover, far easier methods to establish the fact that Panfilo is not a party to the requested co-conspirator intercepts are available than wholesale production of those intercepts. A straight-forward question to an appropriate law enforcement agent or a stipulation with the government regarding the fact that the government has identified intercepts as containing communications of co-conspirators, and not Panfilo, come to mind.</p><p id=\"p-48\">Agustin has provided a similarly vague rationale for seeking the minimized and co-conspirator intercepts: \"The defense must have access to all the intercepts in order to analyze their contents and determine what evidence exists that both potentially inculpates or exculpates him of the charges in this case.\" Agustin's Discovery Mot. at 4. As a threshold matter, the government has stated that the undisclosed intercepts will not be introduced in the government's case-in-chief, and, accordingly, the inculpatory nature of any of these communications is not material. Moreover, Agustin has provided absolutely no information about why communications to which he was not a party because he was incarcerated would contain any exculpatory information about him. The defendants' mere desire to \"search\" the intercepts \"for exculpatory information,\" Jt. Stm.

The government reiterated this point during the August 2, 2017 hearing and added that the members of the Meza Flores DTO (the distribution cell of a larger Mexican drug trafficking organization at issue in this case) used many different modes of communication. <em>See</em> Status Conf. Hr'g (<em>rough</em> ) Tr. (Aug. 2, 2017) at 38-39. Thus, even if Panfilo were not a participant in all of the intercepted Blackberry messages among DTO members, this would not necessarily be exculpatory. Based on the government's written and oral assurances, the Court is satisfied that the government has been and will remain \"vigilant in ensuring that it fulfills its discovery and <em>Brady / Giglio</em> obligations.\" <em>Karake</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9084584\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/281/302/#p306\">281 F.Supp.2d at 306</extracted-citation> (accepting the government's assertion that it was aware of \"no <em>Brady</em> information of the type described\").</p><p id=\"p-51\">The next reason given by the defendants for compelling discovery of the minimized Panfilo and co-conspirator intercepts shows plainly that this discovery demand is not intended to prepare a defense in response to the government's case-in-chief. The defendants argue that receiving <em>all</em> intercepts, including those of alleged co-conspirators and minimized, will help show that the government improperly minimized the communications. <em>See</em> Jt. Stm. Discovery \u00b6 7. Although the erroneous marking of seven AMR files as \"pertinent\" rightfully raises some concern, seven is a \"small number\" compared to the approximately 12,500 electronic communications marked pertinent and not minimized. Gov't's Third Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 18. In addition, given the detailed description provided by the government of the minimization procedures employed, and the fact that the seven AMR files were all received in the same session by the same monitor and have no accompanying transcript, Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 5, the defendants' argument that additional minimization violations may be uncovered through the requested compelled discovery is purely speculative.</p><p id=\"p-52\">This defense effort to find additional evidence to bolster arguments challenging the minimization procedures used during the wiretap phase of the investigation does not refute any of the government's direct evidence against the defendants. To the contrary, even if additional minimization violations were found, the wiretap statute does not provide a suppression remedy for Panfilo's intercepted electronic communications, which could still be used in the government's case-in-chief. Consequently, the defendants' wishful thinking of finding additional minimization violations does not justify the requested discovery under Rule 16. <em>See, e.g</em> ., <em>United States v.

Gov't's BBMT Mot. at 2. According to the government, if literal translations are used, the translator \"would be unable to testify that the translation is a fair and accurate translation of the Spanish communication based upon her expertise and based on the context of the conversation,\" since interpreting the import of the communication requires more than \"taking statements in one language and expressing them in a different language\" but instead reflects \"a continuing exercise of judgment and analysis of what is meant or intended to be said by the parties.\" <em>Id.</em> at 6-7 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p><p id=\"p-57\">Specifically, the government has enumerated eleven words set out in the chart below that have been translated differently from the literal meaning to reflect the common slang understanding. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-58\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"43\" href=\"#p43\" id=\"p43\">*43</a><strong>Intercepted</strong> <strong>Literal Translation</strong> <strong>Slang Translation Used in Proposed</strong> <strong>Spanish Word</strong> <strong>BBM Transcripts</strong> 1 <em>Sim\u00f3n</em> Simon yes 2 <em>Sale</em> leave alright 3 <em>Jale</em> pull work, job, stuff 4 <em>Fierro</em> iron guns; also interjection like \"Alright\" or \"go for it!\" 5 <em>Paro</em> Stop; strike; stoppage \"hacerme el paro\" is to do me a favor 6 <em>Chale</em> chalet No way!; Oh my God!; sure 7 <em>Aguitarse</em> <em>(no definition)</em> bummed; bummed out 8 <em>Parrque</em> park ammunition; ammo 9 <em>Morros</em> snout/nose kid; boy 10 <em>Pedo</em> fart <em>no hay pedo</em>; there's no problem 11 <em>Vato</em> <em>(no definition)</em> dude</p><p id=\"p-59\">Here, without identifying any of the eleven words or other particular words or phrases used in the proposed transcripts as disputed, the defendants have generally challenged the transcripts' accuracy and requested \"a pre-trial hearing to determine the admissibility of the materials.\" Defs.'

He points out that: the last three alleged events do not support Count Two, since the December, 2009 evidence falls outside the two-year date range of the firearms charge; the September 2010 evidence amounts to an attempt, which is \"a theory that is not included in the Indictment\"; and the October 2013 evidence occurred after the Indictment had been returned on May 2, 2012. <em>Id.</em> at 4-5. Agustin concedes that more generalized testimony from cooperating witnesses about his possession of firearms in the course of drug trafficking activities would be sufficient to support the charge, but nonetheless urges inspection of the grand jury minutes apparently to ensure that such generalized evidence was, in fact, provided and to assess whether some undefined \"appropriate steps\" must be taken to avoid constructive amendment of the indictment at trial, with the concomitant risk \"of infecting the trial with reversible error,\" <em>id.</em> at 5, by \"supplement[ing] the factual basis of criminal liability at the trial,\" Def.'s Reply Mot. GJ Inspection at 2.</p><p id=\"p-69\">At the outset, the government's response lacks any specific assurances about the evidence presented to the grand jury to support Count Two. <em>Id.</em> at 1 (noting that \"Government has [not] even offered an informal 'proffer' as to the evidentiary predicate for Count Two presented to the grand jury\"). Nevertheless, as Agustin concedes, the government had cooperating witnesses' testimony available in some form to present to the grand jury, and such evidence would be sufficient to support Count Two. Thus, despite his denial that he is challenging the sufficiency of the grand jury evidence, Agustin's request for <em>in camera</em> review of grand jury minutes to ascertain what evidence was presented to support the grand jury's finding of probable cause to believe the defendant committed the firearms offense charged, amounts to the same thing. Yet, the law is well-established that challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the grand jury are not permitted. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>United States v.

III Intercepts at 2 (discussing hearing). In subsequent submissions, the government acknowledged that 170 AMR files were sent by BlackBerry to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit (\"DITU\") for review, and that 163 of these files were minimized and seven \"were erroneously marked \"pertinent\" by a monitor. <em>Id.</em> at 3-4.

Defs.' Second Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 2. The government responded by explaining that \"[t]he raw data exported for production in discovery to Defendants caused ... three (3) unique MP4 files to be replicated within the raw data and to erroneously appear 25 different times within the raw data produced to the Defendants.\" Gov't's' Second Suppl. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts (\"Gov't's Third Opp'n T. III Intercepts\") at 5-6, ECF No. 101-2. With respect to the MP3 data, the government further explained that \"MP3 files were not intercepted in this investigation and any reference to MP3 files within the communications is due to a feature of BBM which alerts a user when another contact is available.\" <em>Id.</em> at 13.</p><p id=\"p-90\">The defendants assert a new argument in their most recent brief as a \"second-and independent-basis for suppression.\" Defs.' Fourth Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 2. Based on the government's assertion that it maintains \"all the intercepted communications ... on an FBI server in Quantico, Virginia,\" the defendants contend that the government has \"fail[ed] to comply with the 'sealing' requirements of the Title III wiretap,\" and \"[t]his failure warrants suppression of all the intercepts.\" <em>Id.</em> at 2, 11-12 (citing <em>United States v. Ojeda Rios</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634004\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/257/#p263\">495 U.S. 257</extracted-citation>, 263, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634004\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/257/#p263\">110 S.Ct. 1845</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634004\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/257/#p263\">109 L.Ed.2d 224</extracted-citation> (1990) ; <em>United States v.

The government, in this case, after ordered to respond to this new argument, see Min. Order (dated Dec. 12, 2017), represents that \"all target devices and interceptions were sealed by the authorizing court and there was no delay in the sealing.\" Gov't's Fourth Suppl. Opp'n Defs. Mot. Suppress at 1, 4, ECF No. 134. Only duplicate intercepts are maintained on the FBI servers in Quantico for investigative purposes, as permitted by the wiretap statute. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518</extracted-citation>(8)(a) (\"Duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of section 2517 of this chapter for investigations\"); <em><extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 2517(1)-(2) (permitting investigative or law enforcement officer to disclose contents of a wiretap investigation to another officer or use content of the wiretap to the extent such disclosure or use \"is appropriate to the proper performance of the official duties\" of the officers involved). Accordingly, no statutory sealing violation has occurred, and the government's maintenance of intercepted communications for investigative purposes on FBI servers in Quantico does not present any statutory violation, let alone a violation supporting suppression.</p><p id=\"p-91\">As belatedly detailed by the government, during discrete time periods, after the first six months of the investigation, the government sought court authorization to intercept both wire and electronic communications, but only in five of the 27 applications and for only four devices not used by Panfilo out of the total 59 devices subject to the wiretaps. Gov't's Fourth Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 3-4 (noting the first of the five applications targeting wire and electronic communications was filed in August 2013); Defs.' Fourth Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 1 (listing the dates of the five applications for wire communications as August 12 and 30, 2013, January 27, 2014, August 14, 2014, and September 11, 2014); Gov't's Third Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 14-15 (noting that \"[i]n the August 12 affidavit ... the Government sought authority to intercept electronic communications over Target Device[ ] 1 (Panfilo's Device),\" as well as \"electronic ... and wire communications over Target Device 10,\" which was not Panfilo's device). These facts show that had the government wished to target interception of Panfilo's <em>wire,</em> in addition to his <em>electronic,</em> communications, such authority would have been sought, as with the four devices subject to court-authorized wire interception.</p><p id=\"p-92\">The government also argues that \"Agustin lacks standing to challenge the electronic interceptions evidence because he fails to meet the statutory criteria of an 'aggrieved party' under Title III.\" Gov't's First Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 2, 13-17. This standing argument need not be addressed as this motion is resolved on alternative grounds.</p><p id=\"p-93\">ECPA added a definition of \"electronic communications\" to mean \"any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, but does not include,\" <em>inter alia</em> , \"any wire or oral communication.\" <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202510\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510</extracted-citation>(12).</p><p id=\"p-94\">The D.C. Circuit did not expressly state that the intercepts at issue in <em>Scurry</em> involved wire communications, as opposed to electronic communications, but a review of the record indicates that the warrants issued authorized the relevant law enforcement authorities to intercept wire communications from the defendants' cell phones. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Savoy</em> , Crim. No. 10-310 (RCL) (D.D.C. 2012), ECF Nos. 59, 77, 90, 105, 108; <em>see also</em> <em>Scurry</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257275,12310511\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1/\">821 F.3d at 6</extracted-citation> (referring to a \"wiretap on Scurry's cell phone\" and \"Scurry's tapped calls\"). In addition, the D.C. Circuit's textual analysis addressed only wire and oral communications since the Court cited <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202516\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516</extracted-citation>(1), <em>Scurry</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257275,12310511\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1/\">821 F.3d at 8</extracted-citation>, which governs \"wire and oral communications,\" whereas a separate subsection of the same provision governs \"electronic communications,\" <em>see</em> <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202516\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516</extracted-citation>(3).</p><p id=\"p-95\">Confusingly, the initial application and order authorizing interception of the electronic communications on Target Device # 1 uses language pertinent to oral and wire communications. <em>See, e.g.,</em> Initial T. III App. \u00b6 3 (stating that, \"[p]ursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 2516, an appropriate official of the Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, having been specially designated by the Attorney General pursuant to Order Number 3055-2009 dated February 26, 2009, has authorized this application.\"); Initial T. III Order at 4 (stating that, \"pursuant to the application authorized by an appropriate official of the Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, who has been specially designated by the Attorney General of the United States to exercise the power conferred on him by Title 18, United States Code, Section 2516 are authorized to intercept electronic communications ... to and from TARGET DEVICE # 1.\"). Notwithstanding that both the application and order include language pertinent to authorizing wire and oral communications, since \u00a7 2516 does not require sign-off by a high-level DOJ official, this surplusage does not alter the validity of the order. <em>See</em> <em>Scurry</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257275,12310511\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1/\">821 F.3d at 8</extracted-citation> (\"To determine whether a wiretap order is facially insufficient, a reviewing court must examine the four corners of the order and establish whether, on its fact, <em>it contains all that Title III requires it to contain</em> .\") (emphasis added); <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257275,12310511\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1/\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257275,12310511\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1/\"> at 12</extracted-citation> (noting that the D.C.

Cir. 2013), \"left open the possibility that a 'technical defect' in a wiretap order might not rise to the level of facial insufficiency, but rather would render the order 'imperfect' \"). As the government explains, \"[t]he Title III application language ... regarding the identification of the 'appropriate official' reflects DOJ policy to secure additional internal approval of applications for interception of electronic communications,\" but this is \"DOJ policy and is not statutorily required.\" Gov't's First Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 11 n.4 (citing U.S. Dep't of Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual , \u00a7 9-7.100, https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-7000-electronic-surveillance#9-7.100); <em>see also</em> Gov't's Third Opp'n T. III Intercepts at 16 (further explaining that, in April 2013, government \"began including the name of the high-level DOJ official in the applications ... based upon internal protocols and guidance of the Office of Enforcement Operations of the Department of Justice, not due to statutory requirements.\").</p><p id=\"p-96\">The defendants also cite a handbook on surveillance prepared by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Criminal Tax Division that focuses on the identical language of the House Judiciary Committee Report but expressly states that the handbook is \"not intended to have the force of law\" or \"replace thorough research.\" <em>See</em> Defs.' Fourth Reply Mot. Suppress T. III Intercepts at 9; <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235468,3726015\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/509/\">id.</extracted-citation></em> , Ex. 1, IRS Criminal Tax Division, Surveillance Handbook at i, 39, ECF No. 129-1. Thus, this IRS handbook does little to advance the defendants' argument.</p><p id=\"p-97\">This somewhat opaque language in the House Judiciary Committee Report relied upon by the defendants is notably absent from the Senate Judiciary Committee's Report on ECPA, which report also makes a point of \"recogniz[ing] that a transaction may consist, in part of both electronic communications and wire or oral communications\" and that \"different aspects of the same communication might be characterized differently.\" S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 16 (1986), <em>as reprinted in</em> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3570.</p><p id=\"p-98\">According to the government, even though audio files without the human voice would constitute electronic communications under Title III, \"in an abundance of caution,\" the government \"instructs monitors not to listen or retain any audio files when it does not have authority to intercept wire communications in addition to electronic communications.\" Gov't's Second Opp'n T. III Intercepts 4 n.1.</p><p id=\"p-99\">In any event, even the defendants were able to show some statutory violation, which they have not, suppression of the intercepted BBM communications is not available here. As noted, the ECPA amendments to Title III did not add \"electronic communications\" to either \u00a7 2515 (directing that \"no part of the contents\" of \"any wire or oral communication\" may be introduced at trial \"if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter\") or \u00a7 2518(10)(a) (authorizing motion by \"aggrieved person ... to suppress the contents of any <em>wire or oral communication</em> intercepted pursuant to this chapter\" if, <em>inter alia</em> , the order authorizing the interception of such communications is \"insufficient on its face\") (emphasis added). Thus, ECPA \"does not apply the statutory exclusionary rule contained in title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to the interception of electronic communications.\" S. Rep. No. 99-541 at 23 (1986); <em>see also</em> <em>United States v.

Stm. Discovery \u00b6 7. This discovery request is discussed <em>infra</em> in Part I.B.</p><p id=\"p-101\">Despite initially refusing, the government ultimately produced these materials to Agustin. <em>See</em> Gov't's Resp. Suggestion of Court Regarding Discovery (\"Gov't's Resp. Discovery\") at 1, ECF No. 80. The government has also produced, pursuant to the defendants' initial motions to compel: (1) to both defendants, minimization documents, including minimization instructions in Government counsel's possession, <em>see</em> Gov't's Opp'n Defs.' Discovery Mots. at 5 (distinguishing \"minimization documents\" from \"minimized intercepts\"); Jt. Stm. Discovery \u00b6 5; Gov't's Resp. Discovery at 1, and (2) to Panfilo, \"the [California] state-authorized pertinent intercepts,\" which the government only discovered around the time of filing its original opposition to the motions to compel, <em>see</em> Gov't's Opp'n Defs.' Discovery Mots. at 5; <em>see also</em> Agustin's Reply Mem. Supp. Discovery Mot. (\"Agustin's Reply Supp. Discovery Mot.\") at 1 n.1, ECF No. 57.</p><p id=\"p-102\">The defendants also seek this discovery to \"independently determine when audio files were first intercepted,\" Jt. Stm. Discovery \u00b6 7, but this reason seems particularly weak. The government has already conceded that the first wire intercept occurred on March 23 2013, just over a month after the wiretap surveillance began, <em>id.</em> at \u00b6 6, and \"independent\" verification of this, or an even earlier, date of minimized communications is entirely immaterial.</p><p id=\"p-103\">As with Agustin's motion to suppress the wiretaps, the government challenges Agustin's discovery motion on standing grounds, reasoning that \"[b]ecause Defendant Agustin lacks standing to challenge the Title III electronic interceptions, he has failed to show that the pertinent intercepts and corresponding Title III documents are material to his defense.\" Gov't's Opp'n Defs.' Discovery Mots. at 7-8. Agustin counters that \"[t]he issue of this defendant's 'standing' to challenge the wiretap is ... irrelevant to the question of whether the materials should be produced under Rule 16.\" Agustin's Reply Supp. Discovery Mot at 4. Since this motion is resolved on alternative grounds, the government's standing argument need not be addressed. <em>See supra</em> note 8.</p><p id=\"p-104\">In his latest filing on this issue, Panfilo argues that \"the minimized communications\" are \"relevant under Rule 16(a)(1) (B(i) [sic] as statements of the Defendant, his role in the alleged conspiracy, and must be reviewed by the defense to aid in determining if the Government fulfilled its minimization requirements.\" Panfilo's Reply Discovery Mot. at 3 (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(B)(i) ). \"Rule 16's provision for the discovery of oral statements is intended, in part, to 'facilitate the raising of objections to admissibility prior to trial,' \" which \"contributes to the efficient administration of justice,\" protects \"the defendant's right to a fair trial,\" and \"prevents unfair surprise.\" <em>United States v. McElroy</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502624\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/697/459/#p463\">697 F.2d 459</extracted-citation>, 463-64 (2d Cir. 1982) (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 advisory committee's note to the 1974 amendments); <em>see also</em> <em>United States v. Smith</em> , Crim. No. 16-91-01-JL, <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20201062\">2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201062</extracted-citation>, at *19-20 (D.N.H.

Since minimized intercepted communications, by definition, are not going to be used by the government in its case-in-chief or at all, a defendant has no need for disclosure of such material in order to raise any admissibility challenge. Moreover, to the extent a defendant seeks disclosure of such minimized intercepted communications as somehow exculpatory, this argument fails. <em>See</em> <em>U.S. v. Scarpa</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538261\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/993/#p1011\">913 F.2d 993</extracted-citation>, 1011 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"A defendant may not seek to establish his innocence ... through proof of the absence of criminal acts on specific occasions.\"). For these reasons, minimized communications are not automatically \"relevant\" within the meaning of Rule 16(a)(1)(B)(i), and absent any such showing of relevance, Panfilo is not entitled to compel disclosure of any oral statements captured in minimized AMR files.</p><p id=\"p-105\">The government was directed to provide the Defendants with \"literal\" translations of the intercepted BBM communications by August 15, 2017, <em>see</em> Minute Order (Aug. 11, 2017) (directing government \"to re-produce to the defendants, by August 15, 2017, transcripts for Blackberry intercepts, containing <em>literal</em> translations of all words\"), and the government generally complied by providing \"updated\" transcripts. In the instant motion, the government seeks to use the original transcripts produced on August 8, 2017.</p><p id=\"p-106\">The defendants mentioned the word \"<em>perico</em> \" as an example of an inaccurately translated word, Status Conf. Hr'g (<em>rough</em> ) Tr. (Aug. 11, 2017) at 4, but the government indicates this word may be literally translated at \"cocaine,\" Gov't's BBMT Mot. at 1 n.1 (noting that the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola (\"RAE\"), a recognized Spanish dictionary, lists \"cocaine\" as an acceptable definition of the word \"<em>perico</em> \"). The defendants do not contest this assertion in their opposition. <em>See generally</em> Defs.' Opp'n Gov't's BBMT Mot., ECF No. 100.</p><p id=\"p-107\">The defendants initially contended that insufficient information was provided about the qualifications of the government's translator \"to determine if she even has the expertise to translate the materials,\" citing the lack of any \"expert notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702 for the witness,\" or \"information concerning the qualifications and methodology used to create the English language transcripts,\" or \"what materials the translator was provided in this case.\" Defs.' Opp'n Gov't's BBMT Mot. at 1-3.
