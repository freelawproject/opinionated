(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) M.W. was thirteen\n   years old and in the eighth grade during the 2012-2013 school year.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Tr. 69:8-18.) During the meeting, the CSE reviewed a February 9, 2012 psychoeducational evaluation; a February 8, 2012 classroom observation conducted by Fochetta; and reports for terms 1 and 2 of the 2011-2012 school year from Aaron detailing M.W.'s performance. (Jt. St. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The psychoeducational evaluation indicated that despite being in the eighth grade, M.W.'s letter-word decoding skills were at an early fifth-grade level and that his skills appeared to deteriorate with more complicated words. (Ex. 4, at 2.) His language comprehension was below a fourth grade level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He had increasing difficulty understanding the central meaning of verbal narratives that he had to read. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As narratives became more complicated and difficult, M.W. had more difficulty with actual word reading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He had weaknesses in spelling and attention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The psychoeducational evaluation also indicated that M.W.'s scores on the WISC-IV, commonly known as an \"I.Q. test,\" were in the average range and that his scores in academic achievement, as measured by the Woodcock-Johnson test, were in the average to low-average range. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4; Jt. St. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   M.W.'s IEP for the 2012-2013 school year classified M.W. as having a learning disability. (Jt.

St. \u00b6 9; IEP 12.)

(Ex. 3.) On August 15, 2012, the Parents sent a letter informing the DOE of their belief that M.W. \"ha[d] not been offered an appropriate program/placement by the DOE for the 2012-13 school year,\" and of their intent to unilaterally place M.W. at Aaron for the 2012-2013 school year.

Therefore, I address their testimony in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Fochetta Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Rose Fochetta, a New York state certified school psychologist, (Tr. 62:2-13, 63:10-16), observed M.W. in a science class at Aaron on February 8, 2012, and prepared a report on that observation, (Jt. St. \u00b6 7; Ex. 5). The class Fochetta observed lasted one hour, and had a student to teacher ratio of 9:1:1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. 5, at 1.) During the classroom observation, M.W. repeatedly fiddled with items that were on the adult desk where he was sitting, and called out when he was not called upon to answer the teacher's questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) During the class, the assistant teacher took out a \"sensory tool box,\" and M.W. grabbed a red ball and began to manipulate the red ball. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Although M.W. continued to engage in the fidgeting behavior, \"he remained engaged\" in the classroom discussion and \"he was able to participate throughout\" the lesson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; Tr. 71:14-72:9, 114:3-115:1.) At one point, he got up and walked around the room, and had to be directed to take his seat. (Ex. 5, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fochetta stated that she was very familiar with Aaron, (Tr. 103:22-105:5), and acknowledged that they follow general education curriculum \"[w]ith supports,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   105:6-15). She testified that the curriculum being taught in the class she observed was \"certainly appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   71:14-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There were nine students in the class she saw, and that was the largest number of students in any of M.W.'s classes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   106:1-107:15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the CSE meeting, Fochetta expressed her opinion that M.W. was capable of handling a general education environment with a modified curriculum and that a 12:1:1 class and smaller settings were too restrictive for M.W. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   77:25-80:8.) T.W. and Moss disagreed with these opinions. (Ex. 2, at 2; Tr. 337:22-339:15, 428:25-429:16, 432:22-433:12, 445:11-18.) During the Impartial Hearing, Fochetta testified concerning her opinion that, although M.W. attended small classes at Aaron, he could function in an ICT class of approximately thirty students because, before attending Aaron, he had attended a general education Catholic school, where, beginning in around fourth grade, he received special education teacher supports. (Tr. 79:13-80:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Haber Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Tracy Haber was M.W.'s head teacher in sixth grade (2010-2011 school year); his math teacher in seventh grade (2011-2012 school year); his history teacher in eighth grade (2012-2013 school year); and provided him with additional homework support in ninth grade (2013-2014 school year). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   187:2-10.) Haber testified that M.W. has \"a really hard time maintaining attention during class\" and was \"constantly ... getting up,\" which required getting his attention back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   187:14-23.) Haber testified that M.W. has \"a lot of difficulty with executive functioning ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   187:23-25.) This difficulty manifested itself in various ways, including in his organization (both of his materials and of his writing) and time management. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   188:1-17.) Specifically, Haber testified that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A lot of times [M.W. will] leave things in one class, you know, in the previous class and then go to the next class. He'll leave things at home that he needs or leave things at school that he needs to take home. And that also manifests in his writing. He has a hard time organizing, you know, anything he needs to write. And then it also affects his ability to time manage so, you know, when he has to study for a test or if he has to plan a project he needs a lot of support in doing that. And then in terms of [M.W.'s] reading, he has a hard time with reading comprehension. He does a lot better with listening comprehension because he does understand a lot of concepts, but he has a hard time, you know, making that transition from reading it to understanding itself himself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   188:1-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Moss Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Matthieu Moss, the head math teacher at Aaron, served as M.W.'s science teacher during sixth grade, head teacher-teaching science and humanities-during the seventh grade, and during the eighth and ninth grades would help M.W. with his homework in the morning-although Moss was not M.W.'s teacher at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   411:16-25.) Moss described in detail the extra supports provided to M.W. at Aaron that were not included in the IEP. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   426:9-428:24.) Moss testified that M.W. was \"easily frustrated by a lot of noise, and voiced it out loud to staff members consistently, including [to Moss] and the teacher, and would get off topic easily, if there were either peer noise or outside classroom noise, and would need to be redirected.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   429:21-430:1.) If M.W. was very distracted, he sometimes took breaks outside the classroom to gather himself, with the assistant teacher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   431:17-19.) Moss testified that because of his distractibility, M.W. needed a small class size for his core subjects, in lunch and gym, and during transitions, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   429:6-16), and that even though M.W.'s testing showed average scores, because of\n   his executive functioning needs, he would not be able to complete his work without extended supports such as those he receives at Aaron. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   445:11-18.) Moss also testified that the ICT class proposed \"is way too big for [M.W.] to effectively learn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   433:9-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    4. T.W. Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   T.W., M.W.'s mother, testified that M.W. was first found to be eligible for special education services in the third grade and that he has had an IEP each year since. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   318:4-15.) Prior to enrolling at Aaron, M.W. attended a parochial school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   400:4-6.) T.W. testified about the CSE meeting on April 16, 2012, noting that she informed those assembled at the meeting that socially, M.W. was not a regular education student. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   338:25-339:15.) She testified that M.W. was not able to \"keep up with conversation\" with a peer his age, \"so there would be other social issue[s] of him being in a regular ed[ucation] class.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   339:9-15.) During the CSE, certain DOE representatives told T.W. that \"they felt that [M.W.] needed to be part of general ed[ucation] and that they wanted him to go into a classroom with [she] believe[d] they said up to-that the Board of Ed[ucation] allows up to almost 30 students and that a certain amount of those students in the class would be special ed[ucation] or have IEPs and that there would be a special education teacher that was with those IEP students.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   338:1-9.) T.W. pointed out that the previous year M.W. was recommended-presumably in M.W.'s IEP-to be in a smaller classroom size with two teachers. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   338:25-339:3.) T.W. was told by Rose Fochetta and Feng Ye that a placement in a regular education class might improve M.W.'s social skills; however, neither Fochetta nor Ye explained the basis for their belief or how such improvement would happen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   339:16-24.) T.W. stated that she thought the program recommendation decision had been made before the IEP meeting and before she or Moss spoke about M.W.'s challenges and goals, because neither Fochetta nor Ye discussed any other recommendations and they told her that they reached their decision on M.W.'s program recommendation \"based on the paperwork.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   340:3-342:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   T.W. described M.W. as being ambidextrous, and that the occupational therapist explained that he had hesitation when he went to write, which was painfully slow because he must first determine in which direction the words were properly written, so taking notes in a classroom was difficult for him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   342:21-343:14.) T.W. stated that she \"didn't understand how a 3.8 [referring to M.W.'s reading grade level] with ten other children that have IEPs and one other adult that's special ed[ucation], how he was going to keep up with eighth grade work,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   341:8-13) and that she \"couldn't imagine him being able to keep up with [an ICT] classroom,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   343:13-14). She voiced these concerns but was told that \"co-teaching had been successful,\" and that \"[M.W. was] a good candidate for it and [her] objections had been noted; however, the Board of Ed[ucation] was recommending that this was the best path for [M.W.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   341:20-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The IHO Decision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nancy M. Lederman, Esq, the IHO, rendered her decision on March 28, 2014 (the \"IHO Decision\"). (Jt. St. \u00b6 17.) The IHO explained that \"[a]n appropriate educational program begins with an IEP that accurately reflects the results of evaluations to identify the student's needs, establishes annual goals related to those needs, and provides for the use of appropriate special education services.\" (IHO Op. 22.) In her decision, the IHO found that the DOE failed to provide M.W. with a FAPE because it failed to justify the program recommendation of an ICT class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-25.) The IHO's conclusion was well-reasoned\n   and weighed the considerable evidence provided by the parties. To summarize the IHO's detailed opinion, the IHO reasoned that, given M.W.'s \"undisputed ... weaknesses in spelling, understanding what he was reading, executive functioning, organization, attention, time management, and writing long assignments ... Fochetta's reliance on [M.W.] being 'cognitively intact' did not justify her conclusion that he had to be in a class with a general education population.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) The IHO found that Fochetta's statement that M.W. had done \"okay\" in a general-education parochial school setting \"failed to accurately portray the child's educational history\" and was \"simply unsupported and inaccurate, given the significant support services for his disabilities [M.W.] had received from the DOE when still in early grades and the small classroom setting and more intense support he had been receiving at [Aaron]\" by April 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The IHO found Fochetta's \"conclusions concerning [M.W.'s] reading comprehension and distractibility minimized the extent of his deficits and the effect on [M.W.'s] learning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IHO noted that Fochetta argued that M.W. remained engaged in the class she observed even though he exhibited increased distractibility; however, she failed to take into account the fact that she observed M.W. in a class of only nine students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, the IHO \"note[d] the very specific description of [M.W.'s] difficulties in motor control and need to move around,\" in finding that M.W.'s \"sensory needs ... could not be supported by the recommended twice weekly [occupational therapy] services pushed into the classroom.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The IHO found that the CSE, in opining that a larger class would not be overwhelming for M.W., \"failed to address the central issue of whether he would be likely to receive educational benefit in the recommended program,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24), and failed to adequately explain \"why a smaller class would not be appropriate,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Rather, \"the reasoning advanced by the DOE did not amount to reasonable justification for the child's placement in an ICT class\" and \"[t]he CSE response that it was too restrictive was a cookie cutter response that failed utterly to address the many special education needs displayed by [M.W.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IHO further found that Fochetta's conclusion that decoding \"wouldn't necessarily help [M.W.]\" ignored the explicit assessment of the DOE's psychoeducational evaluation that M.W.'s decoding skills deteriorated with complicated words. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) The IHO noted, and credited, Moss's testimony concerning the importance of a small class size to meet M.W.'s attentional needs and his opinion that issues such as attention, distractibility, frustration with noise, vocalizations, and sensory needs made an ICT class inappropriate for M.W. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The IHO then analyzed the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Burlington/ Carter\n   </em>\n   test, and found that Aaron was an appropriate unilateral placement for M.W. because it offered a program designed to meet his individual special education needs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.) The IHO noted that the Aaron witnesses were uniform in describing M.W.'s deficits, emphasizing his distractibility and difficulties with decoding and comprehension, writing, math, executive functioning, and motor skills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) In addition, the IHO emphasized that the small classes and adult support at Aaron cited by all witnesses were important in addressing M.W.'s needs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IHO summarized the extensive testimony by Haber, Moss, and T.W. regarding M.W.'s improvements in reading, writing, organization, and math while at Aaron. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.) The IHO also acknowledged Fochetta's testimony that M.W. was \"doing fine\" at Aaron and that the curriculum in the class she observed\n   was \"certainly appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally-noting the Parents' clearly stated objections at the IEP meeting-the IHO found that equitable considerations do not operate to deny or reduce an award of funding or reimbursement to the Parents for M.W.'s Aaron tuition or services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) In other words, the IHO found that nothing that the parents did or did not do warranted the denial or reduction of reimbursement if they were otherwise entitled to such reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The SRO Decision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The DOE appealed portions of the IHO Decision to the New York State Office of State Review, and on January 9, 2015, SRO Carol H. Hauge sustained the DOE's appeal, holding that the evidence in the hearing record demonstrated that DOE had met its burden to establish that it had offered M.W. a FAPE for the 2012-13 school year, (the \"SRO Decision\"). (Jt. St. \u00b6 20.) Specifically, the SRO held that, \"given the student's overall average cognitive and academic abilities, along with the student's need for support in the areas of executive functioning and reading comprehension, the hearing record supports a finding that the April 2012 CSE's recommendation for ICT services, along with the other accommodations, annual goals, [occupational therapy], and counseling services included on the IEP, was reasonably calculated to provide the student with educational benefit.\" (SRO Op. 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SRO did not reach the second or third prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Burlington/ Carter\n   </em>\n   test, and therefore did not address the issues of whether Aaron was an appropriate placement or whether equitable considerations weighed in favor of the Parents' request for tuition reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) It appears that the Parents did not challenge P.S. 123's ability to implement the program recommended in the IEP, but only challenged the IEP's program recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Parents commenced this action by filing a complaint on May 6, 2015. (Doc. 1.) The DOE answered the complaint on June 26, 2015. (Doc. 5.) As is typical with challenges under the IDEA, the parties proceeded directly to filing cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed their motion, (Doc. 18), with a memorandum of law in support, (Doc. 19), and a joint statement of undisputed fact, (Doc. 20), on December 23, 2015. On January 25, 2016, the DOE filed its cross-motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 21), with a declaration, attaching an exhibit, (Doc. 22), and a memorandum of law in support, (Doc. 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed their reply on February 25, 2016, (Doc. 26), and the DOE filed its reply on March 25, 2016, (Doc. 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The SRO Decision Is Not Deserving of Deference\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on an independent review of the administrative record and the decisions of the IHO and SRO, I find that the SRO Decision is not deserving of deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The SRO Decision ignores much of the record evidence and the findings of the IHO based upon that evidence, and relies on flawed logic to find that M.W. was offered a FAPE:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Fochetta] indicated that during the classroom observation-the class consisted of one teacher, a teacher assistant,\n   and nine students despite the student's difficulties with attention-he focused, took notes, and responded to teacher questions, which supports the conclusion that the student could function within a larger general education placement with ICT services. The February 2012 psychoeducational evaluation report that the April 2012 CSE reviewed did not indicate the student required a small class to exhibit progress. Additionally, according to the 2011-12 Aaron School student reporting system reports, the student performed well academically;\n   <em>\n    however, the reports did not indicate that the student could not make progress in a larger class setting\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (SRO Op. 5 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).) First, the SRO's conclusion that Fochetta's classroom observation-during which M.W. focused, took notes, and responded to teacher questions-supports the conclusion that M.W. could function within an ICT class, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), defies logic. The fact that M.W. obtained an educational benefit in a class with a student-to-teacher ratio of 9:1:1 does not, without more, support a conclusion that he could obtain the same benefit in an ICT class of up to thirty students with a student-to-teacher ratio almost three times as large. In fact, at best, the observation could be said to be evidence that the class size and supports provided at Aaron were adequate to meet M.W.'s educational needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, the SRO's reliance on the fact that the 2011-2012 Aaron progress reports did not indicate that M.W. could not make progress in a larger class setting, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), is similarly illogical. The purpose of a teacher's evaluation of a student is to discuss the student's progress in the student's current placement, not to opine as to whether a different type of placement might or might not also allow the student to obtain an educational benefit. Therefore, since an opinion/analysis concerning M.W.'s ability to make progress in a larger class size is not something that is required or even expected to be contained in such progress reports, the absence of such an opinion/analysis proves nothing. Stated another way, any omissions as to what alternative educational settings in which M.W. might achieve a benefit cannot be read as support for the finding that M.W. could in fact make educational progress in alternative settings. Using the SRO's logic, the fact that the progress reports did not state that M.W. could not progress in a class of forty, fifty, or even 100 students and one teacher would somehow point to the conclusion that he could make progress in such environments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Third, the SRO uncritically relied on Fochetta's testimony concerning the adequacy of the ICT class to meet M.W.'s needs, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6), and did not discuss Moss's testimony (1) that M.W. was \"easily frustrated by a lot of noise, and voiced it out loud to staff members consistently ... and would get off topic easily, if there were either peer noise or outside classroom noise, and would need to be redirected,\" (Tr. 429:21-430:1); (2) that because of his distractibility, M.W. needed a small class size for his core subjects, in lunch and gym, and during transitions, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 429:6-16); (3) that the ICT class is \"way too big\" for M.W. to effectively learn, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 433:9-12); and (4) that even though M.W. tests on an average level, due to his executive functioning needs, without extended supports similar to what he received at Aaron, he would not be able to complete his work, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 445:11-18). Indeed, the SRO only mentioned Moss's testimony in general terms. (SRO Op. 5 (noting that M.W.'s Aaron School teacher indicated that M.W. required a small class).) The SRO did not engage in any critical analysis, or any analysis for\n   that matter, of the various issues raised by Moss's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In short, the SRO Decision relies solely on illogical arguments and testimony from one CSE participant who observed M.W. for one hour, while disregarding the testimony of T.W. and the Parents' witnesses, including Moss, who had much more experience working with M.W. I find that the SRO Decision was not \"well-reasoned\" or \"based on substantially greater familiarity with the evidence and the witnesses than the reviewing court.\"\n   <em>\n    F.O. ex rel.

The IHO reasoned that, given M.W.'s many deficits, the fact that he was \"cognitively intact\" did not justify Fochetta's conclusion that he should be in a general education classroom. (IHO Op. 23.) The IHO noted that, while Fochetta observed that M.W. remained engaged in the class she observed even though he exhibited increased distractibility, Fochetta failed to take into account the fact that she observed him in a class of only nine students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IHO concluded that M.W.'s sensory challenges-difficulties in motor control and need to move around-could not be adequately addressed by twice-weekly in-classroom occupational therapy services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IHO found that Fochetta's conclusion that decoding \"wouldn't necessarily help [M.W.]\" ignored the psychoeducational evaluation's explicit assessment that M.W.'s decoding skills deteriorated with complicated words. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IHO further concluded that the CSE team failed to adequately explain why a smaller class would not be appropriate, and dismissed its response that such a class was too restrictive as \"a cookie cutter response that failed utterly to address the many special education needs displayed by [M.W.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) I am \"persuaded by the IHO's reasoning, and ... thus defer to the IHO's conclusion\" that the proposed program in the IEP did not offer M.W. a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119699\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/826/#p836\">\n    744 F.3d at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The DOE argues that I should not defer to the IHO Decision in part because the IHO misquoted Fochetta as testifying that M.W. had done \"okay\" in parochial school when Fochetta was actually referring to M.W.'s performance at Aaron. (Def.'s Mem. 18.) However, as the DOE acknowledges, the misquote is not \"substantively important,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and it therefore does not alter my analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The DOE also contends that the IHO Decision does not merit deference because it discredited Fochetta's testimony based in part on the assumption that M.W. had received \"significant support services for his disabilities ... from the DOE when still in early grades,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   18-19), even though M.W. received only an IESP beginning in about fourth grade, (Tr. 79:19-80:8). As an initial matter, T.W.'s testimony indicates that M.W. had an IEP every school year since the third grade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   318:4-15.) Even if the services M.W. received prior to enrolling in Aaron were not as supportive as those proposed in the IEP, the simple fact that M.W. \"already sat in a general education setting for many years without the types supports [proposed in the IEP],\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   80:3-8), does not lead to Fochetta's conclusion that a general education setting would be appropriate for M.W. several years later during the 2012-2013 school year. Without examining how M.W.'s needs during elementary school compared to his needs as an eighth grader, or how M.W. performed in the general education setting in elementary school, Fochetta's reasoning has no basis in fact and is speculative. I therefore find no reason to disagree with the IHO's conclusion with respect to whether the IEP offered M.W. a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Therefore, based on the evidence cited by the IHO, as well as other evidence in the record, I agree with the IHO's conclusion that Aaron provided M.W. an education specifically designed to meet his unique needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645063\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/356/#p363\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645063\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/356/#p363\">\n    at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The IHO noted that the IDEA provides that an award of tuition reimbursement may be reduced or denied if the parents, at the most recent CSE meeting prior to removal, neither inform the CSE of their objections to the proposed placement and their intent to place their child at a private school at public expense nor provide the DOE with written notice of such information ten business days before removal. (IHO Op. 26-27 (citing 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii).) The IHO found that the Parents adequately voiced their objections to the IEP at the IEP meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) In addition, while there were difficulties in sending the IEP and the final notice of recommendation to the Parents, the Parents informed the DOE of their objections to the proposed placement and their intent to place M.W. at Aaron in a letter dated April 29, 2012 and again in a letter dated August 15, 2012. (Ex. C, at 1.) I therefore agree with the IHO that equitable considerations do not require a reduction or denial of tuition reimbursement to the Parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and Defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment is DENIED.

The parties are directed to confer in an effort to reach an agreement concerning attorneys' fees. If no agreement is reached, Plaintiffs shall submit a fee application on or before March 30, 2018.
