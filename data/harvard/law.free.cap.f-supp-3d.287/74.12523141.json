Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs in this matter are D.C. Code offenders who remain incarcerated for serious felonies committed before March 3, 1985. Plaintiffs brought this action challenging the United States Parole Commission's practice of applying to Plaintiffs' parole eligibility determinations the Commission's regulations that were adopted in 2000, instead of the 1972 guidelines of the now-defunct District of Columbia Parole Board, which were in effect when Plaintiffs committed their offenses. After over five years of litigation, which included a successful appeal by Plaintiffs to the D.C. Circuit, the parties reached a Settlement Agreement on December 18, 2015. Under\n   the settlement's terms, the Commission agreed that it would hold remedial parole hearings for Plaintiffs and, \"in good faith,\" apply to those proceedings a newly adopted Commission regulation that incorporated key elements of the 1972 guidelines. Additionally, the parties stipulated that this District Court would maintain jurisdiction over the matter to enforce the terms of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs now have returned to court because they assert that the Commission is in breach of the Settlement Agreement. They contend that, contrary to the Settlement Agreement, the Commission is not in good faith applying the criteria for parole determinations contained in the 1972 guidelines. Additionally, they contend that the Commission is acting contrary to the 1972 guidelines by routinely scheduling rehearings more than one year into the future for Plaintiffs who were denied parole. Plaintiffs have moved to compel the Commission to comply with the Settlement Agreement and to adhere to the 1972 guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After considering the parties' legal memoranda and the record, the court finds that: (1) the record does not support Plaintiffs' assertion that the Board is not faithfully applying the 1972 guidelines when making parole determinations, but (2) that the Commission, by regularly setting parole rehearing dates more than one year after denying a Plaintiff parole, is acting inconsistently with the 1972 guidelines. Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, the court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiffs are individuals who were convicted of serious felonies under the D.C. Code that occurred before March 3, 1985, have completed their minimum sentences, and thus are eligible for parole. Pls.' Mem. in Support of Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 82 (under seal) [hereinafter Pls.' Mem.], at 1. This action challenged the Commission's application of parole rules created in 2000, rather than the rules that were in place at the time of Plaintiffs' offenses, as violating the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution and Plaintiffs' due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 50, \u00b6\u00b6 1-7, 190-214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time of Plaintiffs' offenses, the District of Columbia Board of Parole (\"D.C. Board\") administered parole for persons convicted of violations of the D.C. Code and did so using parole guidelines that it issued in 1972.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7\u00a7 105.1, 103 (1972).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress, however, eliminated the D.C. Board in 1997 and tasked the Commission with making parole decisions for persons convicted\n   of violations of District of Columbia law. Pub. L. 105-33, \u00a7 11231(a), (b); Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Subsequently, the Commission adopted a new set of guidelines in 2000 and began applying them to Plaintiffs as they became eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiffs objected to the Commission's use of the 2000 guidelines out of concern that those rules would inappropriately prolong their incarceration because they were more punitive than the 1972 guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-54, 56, 62, 69. Plaintiffs alleged that the 2000 guidelines made it \"impossible for an offender convicted of a violent crime resulting in death to be found suitable for parole at the initial hearing,\" and that such offenders were \"presumed non-suitable for parole\" until they served substantial periods of time beyond their minimum sentences.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88. By contrast, they maintained that under the 1972 guidelines, an offender could be paroled after serving the minimum sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. Plaintiffs also alleged that decisions using the 2000 guidelines placed greater weight on disciplinary infractions committed during their incarceration, as compared to the emphasis placed on that factor under the 1972 guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 95, 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court dismissed the Complaint, but the D.C.

The New Regulation, which took effect on October 19, 2015, requires the Commission to apply the factors set forth in the D.C. Board's 1972 guidelines when making parole determinations for persons convicted of violations of the D.C. Code that occurred on or before March 3, 1985.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(4). The New Regulation accomplishes this by copying, nearly verbatim, the text of the 1972 guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(4)-(5),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7\u00a7 105.1, 103;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 88, at 1 (noting that the adopted rule \"modelled the 1972 guidelines verbatim\"). Thus, with regard to parole suitability criteria, the New Regulation applicable to Plaintiffs provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (4) Factors considered: Among others, the U.S. Parole Commission takes into account some of the following factors in making its determination as to parole:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (i) The offense, noting the nature of the violation, mitigating or aggravating circumstances and the activities and adjustment of the offender following arrest if on bond or in the community under any pre-sentence type arrangement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (ii) Prior history of criminality, noting the nature and pattern of any prior offenses as they may relate to the current circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (iii) Personal and social history of the offender, including such factors as his family situation, educational development, socialization, marital history, employment history, use of leisure time and prior military service, if any.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (iv) Physical and emotional health and/or problems which may have played a role in the individual's socialization process, and efforts made to overcome any such problems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (v) Institutional experience, including information as to the offender's overall general adjustment, his ability to handle interpersonal relationships, his behavior responses, his planning for himself, setting meaningful goals in areas\n   of academic schooling, vocational education or training, involvements in self-improvement activity and therapy and his utilization of available resources to overcome recognized problems. Achievements in accomplishing goals and efforts put forth in any involvements in established programs to overcome problems are carefully evaluated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (vi) Community resources available to assist the offender with regard to his needs and problems, which will supplement treatment and training programs begun in the institution, and be available to assist the offender to further serve in his efforts to reintegrate himself back into the community and within his family unit as a productive useful individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(4). Notwithstanding this detailed set of six factors, the New Regulation, like the 1972 guidelines, provides no direction on how to evaluate or weigh these criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The New Regulation also adopts the D.C. Board's rule with respect to setting a subsequent parole hearing, or \"rehearing,\" after the denial of parole. If the Commission denies an applicant parole, the Commission must schedule a \"rehearing\" to consider anew the person's suitability for parole. The time between the hearing at which parole is denied and the subsequent hearing is known as a \"set-off.\" With respect to the setting of rehearings, the New Regulation tracks nearly verbatim the 1972 Guidelines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (5) A prisoner who committed the offense of conviction on or before March 3, 1985 who is not incarcerated as a parole violator and is serving a maximum sentence of five years or more who was denied parole at their original hearing ordinarily will receive a rehearing one year after a hearing conducted by the U.S. Parole Commission. In all cases of rehearings, the U.S. Parole Commission may establish a rehearing date at any time it feels such would be proper, regardless of the length of sentence involved. No hearing may be set for more than five years from the date of the previous hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(5).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    with\n   </em>\n   9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 103 (\"Prisoners serving a maximum sentence of five years or more who were denied parole at their original parole hearing ordinarily will receive a hearing one year after the last action taken by the Board.\").

The present rate at which the Commission has rejected parole recommendations tells the court little about the Commission's good faith in adhering to the New Regulation because the court has no historical, statistical data against which to compare the Commission's actions. Critically, the court does not have before it any evidence about the rate at which the D.C. Board granted parole to D.C. Code offenders who, like Plaintiffs, were convicted of the most serious felony offenses, when it was operating under the 1972 guidelines. The D.C. Board may have granted parole at a greater or lesser rate to such persons. The court simply does not know. The court therefore cannot find, based solely on the Commission's present rate of rejecting\n   hearing examiner recommendations, that the Commission has not in good faith applied the 1972 guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Giving Undue Weight to the Offense of Conviction and Disciplinary History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Next, as evidence of breach, Plaintiffs assert that the Commission's parole decisions have assigned too much weight to the nature of their offenses and to dated disciplinary infractions, relative to other factors from the 1972 guidelines.

Yet, in denying Smith's petition for parole, the Commission remarked on Smith's older disciplinary incidents and noted that his offense was \"highly aggravated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Grayson's hearing examiner noted that Grayson had no disciplinary incidents for more than two decades and had worked to improve himself while incarcerated, including by developing work skills.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.73\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the 1972 guidelines granted the D.C. Board broad discretion in deciding whether to grant parole, and the Commission inherited that discretion through the near-verbatim adoption of those guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Austin v.

Board's paroling authority as \"almost unbridled\" and \"totally unfettered\" (citations omitted) ). Although the 1972 guidelines enumerated six factors for the D.C.

Board's guidelines \"had no formalized scoring system\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7870948\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/652/634/#p635\">\n    652 A.2d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (D.C. 1995) ). Additionally, the 1972 guidelines did not limit the D.C. Board's evaluation to six factors. In a preamble to its listing the suitability criteria for parole, the 1972 guidelines provided: \"\n   <em>\n    Among others\n   </em>\n   , the Board takes into account\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the following factors in making its determination as to parole[.]\" 9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 105.1 (emphasis added). Thus, the 1972 guidelines made clear that the D.C. Board could consider factors other than those listed, as well as select the most relevant factors on a case-by-case basis. In the end, the 1972 guidelines textually prescribed no particular formula for parole decisions by the D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Board, and that remains true today as the Commission applies the Board's criteria under the New Regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs have provided no evidence of the D.C. Parole Board's practice in applying the parole eligibility factors to a similar class of offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garner v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/#p256\">\n    529 U.S. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/#p256\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/#p256\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (noting that the practices and policies of an agency, such as a state parole board, often will reveal how the agency exercises its discretion). The closest Plaintiffs come to doing so is in a sworn declaration from Walter Ridley, the chairman of the Board from 1985 to 1986, who states that historically the Board made parole decisions based on whether there was a \"reasonable probability\" that the applicant would not commit future crimes and whether release was \"not incompatible with the welfare of society.\" Pls.' Mem., Ex. 1, ECF No. 82-1 [hereinafter Ridley Decl.], at 2. But in so stating, Ridley does no more than quote verbatim the statutory criteria for parole, as set forth in the 1972 guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 105. Such an attestation is of no value in trying to discern whether the Commission has applied the New Regulation in a materially different way than the D.C. Board. Thus, the court cannot conclude, based on the factors emphasized in the Commission's decisions, that the Commission has breached the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Commission's Explanations for Denial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the court considers Plaintiffs' assertion that the Commission's lack of good faith in applying the 1972 guidelines can be inferred from the Commission's terse notices of action rejecting parole recommendations. Plaintiffs complain that, in more than half of the cases in which the Commission rejected hearing examiners' parole recommendations, the Commission did so \"without explaining specifically how the Hearing Examiners had misapplied the 1972 guidelines or what factor under those guidelines led the [Commission] to disagree with the Hearing Examiners' analyses and recommendation.\" Pls.' Mem. at 10. This lack of transparency, Plaintiffs assert, demonstrates the Commission's lack of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   That argument is unpersuasive. The 1972 guidelines are silent as to how much detail the D.C. Board was required to provide when denying parole, and Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence to fill that void. Indeed, when asking the court to order the Commission to provide greater explanations of its future parole decisions, Plaintiffs acknowledge that \"more detailed explanations are not ordinarily required under Defendant's procedures.\" Pls.'

To be sure, the Commission's decisions-most are just a paragraph-lack the thoughtful, robust analysis that Plaintiffs reasonably would hope to receive given the significance of a parole decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Parole Hr'g Records. However, in the absence of any policy or evidence of practice that the D.C. Board provided\n   fulsome explanations when denying parole, Plaintiffs could not have had a \"justified expectation[ ]\" of anything more than they have received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8990336\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/890/194/#p201\">\n    890 A.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the court does not view the Commission's limited explanations for parole denials as evidence of breach of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In summary, the court finds that there is insufficient evidence before it to conclude that the Commission has breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to apply in good faith the 1972 guidelines' parole suitability criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ordering Set-Offs of More than One Year\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   That leaves the second part of Plaintiffs' motion, in which Plaintiffs claim that the Commission has breached the Settlement Agreement by consistently imposing set-offs of two or more years for Plaintiffs who were denied parole. Plaintiffs support their contention by pointing to numerical evidence of the Commission's set-off decisions. Of the 37 offenders who were denied parole at their first hearing under the 1972 guidelines, the Commission gave one-year set-offs to only four. Pls.' Mem. at 5;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8990336\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/890/194/#p201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2, ECF No. 82-1 (under seal). The majority-21 of the 37-received three-year set-offs; six received two-year set-offs; and six received five-year set-offs. Pls.' Mem. at 5. In addition, Plaintiffs offer Ridley's sworn statement to buttress their position. According to Ridley, the Board \"very seldom\" scheduled set-offs for greater than one year following a denial of parole; it imposed a longer period until the rehearing date \"only if the person had serious disciplinary infractions or other institutional problems since their last parole hearing.\" Ridley Decl. at 1-2. Ridley further states that \"[w]e did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consider the severity of an individual's original offense\" in determining the set-off term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Accordingly, based on the empirical evidence presented and Ridley's declaration, Plaintiffs assert that the Commission is not \"ordinarily\" imposing one-year set-offs after denying parole to Plaintiffs, as the New Regulation and the 1972 guidelines require it to do. 9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 103;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On this issue, the court agrees with Plaintiffs. Unlike the open-ended factors analysis for parole determinations, the 1972 guidelines provided clear direction on the scheduling of set-offs. The rule was that offenders, like Plaintiffs, serving maximum sentences of five years or more who were denied parole \"ordinarily will receive a rehearing one year after the last action taken by the Board.\" 9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 103. The Commission's New Regulation modifies that text slightly by demarcating the start time of the set-off as \"after a hearing conducted by the U.S. Parole Commission,\" instead of \"after the last action taken.\" But, importantly, the New Regulation maintains the presumptive one-year set-off, as it provides that those persons denied parole \"ordinarily will receive a hearing one year after a hearing conducted by the U.S. Parole Commission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(5). By employing the word \"ordinarily,\" both the 1972 guidelines and the New Regulation require one-year set-offs to be the norm rather than the exception.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Ordinary\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"Occurring in the regular course of events; normal; usual.\"). Despite this clear directive, as applied to these Plaintiffs, one-year set-offs have been the\n   <em>\n    rare\n   </em>\n   exception and not the norm, as the numbers bear out. In fact, less than 11% of Plaintiffs who were denied parole in their hearing under the New Regulation received a one-year set-off. Moreover, the Commission offers no evidence to contradict Ridley's testimony that the D.C. Board's practice was to impose a longer set-off only in cases of recent institutional misconduct. In short, the record before the\n   court leads to one clear conclusion: The Commission has not applied the 1972 guidelines in good faith when setting rehearing dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Commission's defense of its decision-making is unconvincing. First, the Commission argues that the 1972 guidelines granted the D.C. Board discretion in how long to fix a set-off. The Commission points to a portion of the 1972 guidelines, which provides that, \"[i]n all cases of rehearings, the Board reserves to itself the right to establish a rehearing date at any time it feels such would be proper, regardless of the length of the sentence served involved or the time remaining to be served.\" 9 D.C.C.R. \u00a7 103. The New Regulation contains identical language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(5) (\"In all cases of rehearings, the U.S. Parole Commission may establish a rehearing date at any time it feels such would be proper, regardless of the length of sentence involved.\"). The Commission's present position, however, directly contradicts its own publicly acknowledged understanding of how the 1972 guidelines operated. During the notice and comment period for the New Regulation, the Commission received from \"[m]any commenters\" a recommendation \"that the rule include the provision in the D.C. Board's 1972 regulations that called for\n   <em>\n    annual\n   </em>\n   rehearings.\"\n   <em>\n    Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Prisoners Serving Sentences Under the United States and District of Columbia Codes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C115\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 63,115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01, 63,115 (Oct. 19, 2015) (emphasis added). The Commission responded to that recommendation by stating: \"The final rule\n   <em>\n    restates\n   </em>\n   the D.C. Board's regulation calling for\n   <em>\n    annual\n   </em>\n   rehearings as suggested, but includes the portion of the D.C. Board's regulation that permits the Commission to establish a rehearing date 'at any time it feels such would be proper.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Commission's response to public comments is telling. It makes clear that the Commission interprets and understands the New Regulation to incorporate the D.C. Board's practice of holding annual rehearings, while still retaining some discretion to deviate from that norm. The Commission cannot announce one position to the public during the rulemaking process and then take another during litigation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars, LLC v.

Defendants suggest that the multi-year set-offs given to the 33 Plaintiffs is warranted even under the New Regulation because those Plaintiffs are \"an extraordinary group based upon their violent conduct, lengthy criminal records, or violent records while in prison.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 8. But that logic is circular: This group is subject to the 1972 guidelines precisely because they were convicted for violent conduct that resulted in lengthy prison sentences. After all, Plaintiffs would not still be incarcerated this many decades later if they had been convicted of lesser crimes. Plaintiffs cannot both be subject to the 1972 guidelines because of their offenses, yet be told by the Commission that those guidelines do not really apply to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally,\n   the Commission contends that this group of Plaintiffs \"\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   the exception to the rule the Board had in mind when it promulgated the exception to the 12-month rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/#p2125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Nothing in the 1972 guidelines, however, supports such a reading. And the only evidence before the court is to the contrary. Ridley states that the D.C. Board \"did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \" consider the severity of the original offense when making the set-off decision. Ridley Decl. at 2. Accordingly, Defendant has not proffered a persuasive justification for consistently imposing longer set-offs in Plaintiffs' cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   What then does this all mean for Plaintiffs who received set-offs of greater than one year? The court reads the Settlement Agreement as having granted each Plaintiff, through the New Regulation, an \"original\" parole hearing under the 1972 guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(1) ; Settlement Agreement \u00b6 3.

For all Plaintiffs who fall into that category, that year has now passed. Therefore, as to those Plaintiffs who are not yet paroled and who received set-offs of greater than one year but have not yet received a rehearing, the Commission shall hold rehearings for them as soon as practicable. Only Plaintiffs who have had verifiable disciplinary problems since their original hearing are not subject to the presumptive scheduling of a rehearing after one year.

A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    For ease of reference, the court in this opinion uses the term \"Plaintiffs\" to refer to the group of D.C. Code offenders to whom the Settlement applies and who have not been paroled since the Settlement's effective date. The original plaintiffs' claims are now moot, but the court permitted Stanley Grayson and Kevin Smith to be substituted as the named plaintiffs and as putative class representatives.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Daniel v. Grayson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365207\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/310/5/#p9\">\n     310 F.R.D. 5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 9 (D.D.C. 2015). Grayson and Smith were denied parole and remain incarcerated and therefore have standing to seek enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mem. in Support of Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 82 (under seal), at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    All citations to D.C. Rules and Regulations are to the 1972 version.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The four prisoners who received the one-year set-offs have since been released or granted parole. Def.'s Notice of Filing, ECF No. 93, at 1-2; Hr'g Tr. (draft), Nov. 20, 2017, at 4. As to them, this motion is moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Although 19 of the 56 prisoners who qualified for and received a parole hearing under the 1972 guidelines received parole following their initial parole hearing, the parties only explain the circumstances of 10 of the 19 successful parole applicants-the 10 who received parole recommendations from hearing examiners which were then accepted by the Commission.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Joint Suppl. Filing at 2;\n    <em>\n     see generally\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp'n; Pls.' Mem. Neither party explains the circumstances of the nine others who apparently were granted parole under the New Regulation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Commission acknowledges as much, conceding that, \"[i]n some cases, the reasons that were provided to the prisoner may not have been as complete as would be desirable[.]\" Def's Opp'n at 7. Moreover, in response to Plaintiffs' lawyers' inquiries regarding the Commission's fulfillment of the Settlement Agreement, the Commission initiated its own review of Plaintiffs' cases and, as a result, \"decided to clarify the reasons that it provided for its decision\" in seven cases.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-5;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp'n, Exs., ECF No. 88-1, at 3-5. The Commission's re-issuance of notices of action with more fulsome explanations underscores the lack of reasoning contained in many notices of action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Nor does the group's institutional disciplinary history explain the longer set-offs. The records show that the Commission imposed longer set-offs even to prisoners whose disciplinary violations are old or nonviolent, or who had no disciplinary problems.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Parole Hr'g Records at 29-30, 33 (giving prisoner a three-year set-off despite no disciplinary violations during his more than three decades in prison);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 64, 69 (giving prisoner a three-year set-off despite only one disciplinary violation, for possessing pornography, from two or three years earlier).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
