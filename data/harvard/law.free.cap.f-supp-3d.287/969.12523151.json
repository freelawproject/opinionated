This was despite the fact that a certain percentage of the water to be transferred would be transferred from one place outside SMWD's boundaries to another place outside SMWD's boundaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court finds the situation in\n   <em>\n    CBD v. San Bernardino\n   </em>\n   analogous to the present case. Although some of the transfers at issue in the present case may originate and terminate in water districts outside the Authority's boundaries, the Authority has a more significant role in the overall project than does DWR. The Court agrees with the Authority that it is important to remember that \"[w]ater transfers are voluntary actions proposed by willing buyers and sellers and are not initiated by state agencies.\" ECF No. 48 at 34 (citing AR 27422). DWR will not be a party involved in negotiating the transfers identified in the EIS/EIR, nor will the agency be party to any of the transfer contracts. AR 27422. The Authority, not DWR, has the greatest responsibility for determining the water needs of its members and in helping to obtain necessary water for those needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CEQA Administrative Record (\"CAR\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   14; AR 25370-71, 25430-32 \"DWR will have a coordination role in the process because it will coordinate with Reclamation on review of potential transfer information packages (to help ensure consistency between CVP-related transfers and non-CVP-related transfers). DWR may also help facilitate transfers through [SWP] facilities in some years.\" AR 27422. The Court agrees with the Authority that \"[t]his is not a role with 'principal responsibility' such that DWR should be the CEQA lead agency.\" ECF No. 48 at 34. DWR, notably, has no responsibility over transfers that do not pass through its facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 25443-44, 27421-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that while the Authority \"has a duty to comply with CEQA for\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   water transfers, [it] has no 'principal responsibility' for other entities' water transfers in which [the Authority] has no role at all.\" ECF No. 51 at 1. This is true, but does not mean that DWR provides \"greater legal, policy, and technical responsibility\" for the Project as a whole. As explained above, the Authority's role is somewhat more significant than DWR's overall. That is all the law requires, particularly in light of\n   <em>\n    CBD v. San Bernardino\n   </em>\n   , which demonstrates by way of example that a lead agency can still qualify as such even though it has little to no control over implementation of some aspects of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs make several additional arguments on the lead agency issue that merit serious consideration. First, as mentioned, a lead agency is defined as having \"authority to require feasible changes in any or all activities involved in the project in order to substantially lessen or avoid significant effects on the environment.\" CEQA Guidelines at \u00a7 15041. Plaintiffs argue that the Authority fails to satisfy this definition because it has no authority over transfers\n   in which it is not involved. ECF No. 51 at 2. More specifically, Plaintiffs emphasize that the FEIS/R relies on the mitigation measures that depend upon DWR for implementation, including \"WS-1\" and \"GW-1\",\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   which are designed to reduce impacts to surface water and groundwater supplies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Under WS-1, a streamflow depletion factor will be applied to transfers \"to mitigate potential water supply impacts from the additional groundwater pumping due to groundwater substitution transfers.\" AR 25526. \"The streamflow depletion factor equates to a percentage of the total groundwater substitution transfer that will not be credited to the transferor and is intended to offset the streamflow effects of the added groundwater pumping due to transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20898\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The exact percentage of the streamflow depletion factor will be assessed and determined on a regular basis by Reclamation and DWR in consultation with buyers and sellers based on the best technical information available at that time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20898\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Reclamation and DWR require the imposition of a streamflow depletion factor because they will not move transfer water if doing so will violate the no injury rule.\" AR 25526-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Mitigation measure GW-1 requires monitoring of groundwater and/or surface water levels during transfers to, among other things, avoid potential effects to other legal users of water and mitigate significant environmental effects. AR 25759. Pursuant to GW-1, potential sellers must submit well data \"for Reclamation and, where appropriate, DWR review, as part of the transfer approval process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record does support Plaintiffs' position that the Authority has no legal mandate to ensure groundwater and surface water impacts felt in other jurisdictions are fully mitigated or avoided. In contrast, DWR does have some role to play in overseeing groundwater management under California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (\"SGMA\"). Under SGMA, local agencies are tasked with creating Groundwater Sustainability Plans (\"GSP\") that must comport with requirements set forth in SGMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Water Code. \u00a7\u00a7 10723, 10727.2. DWR oversees this process in various ways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010733.8\">\n    Cal.

Building on the CEQA Guideline definition of a lead agency as one having \"authority to require feasible changes in any or all activities involved in the project in order to substantially lessen or avoid significant effects on the environment,\" CEQA Guideline \u00a7 15126.4(a)(2) provides: \"Mitigation measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally-binding instruments. In the case of the adoption of a plan, policy, regulation, or other public project, mitigation measures can be incorporated into the plan, policy, regulation, or project design.\" Although the Court can locate no cases interpreting these Guidelines provisions in relevant ways, additional guidance can be found in other, similar provisions of CEQA that require mitigation measures be \"fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other measures.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2021081.6\">\n    Cal.

Interpreting this related provision, at least one California\n   court has found that an agency may adopt mitigation measures made enforceable through another agency with regulatory authority over the impact being mitigated.\n   <em>\n    Citizens Opposing a Dangerous Env't v.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that a lead agency does not lack \"authority\" to require feasible changes simply because it lacks ultimate enforcement authority over the mitigation measure. More would be required to demonstrate a mitigation measure is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that reliance on the Authority as lead agency prejudiced the environmental document by undermining the efficacy of these critical mitigation measures, \"since key elements of each mitigation measure are illegally deferred to future DWR review and approval.\" ECF No. 45 at 10. This is a complaint about the structure and nature of the mitigation measures. Plaintiffs would be able to raise the same or similar complaint (i.e., that key elements are illegally deferred to future review) about the mitigation measures even if DWR were the lead agency. The Court does not find this to be a basis for finding the Authority is not the proper lead agency for this Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs are correct that most if not all of the Project's potentially significant impacts to water resources fall outside the boundaries of the Authority's member districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Authority counters by citing CEQA Guidelines section 15051(a), which provides: \"If the project will be carried out by a public agency, that agency shall be the lead agency even if the\n   project would be located within the jurisdiction of another public agency.\" Here, the Authority is anticipated to be negotiating transfer agreements with potential sellers on behalf of participating members. AR 27421;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 25442-44 (Authority identified as a common participant in most past water transfers); AR 25370 (Authority members identified as majority of potential buyers for transfers analyzed in FEIS/R). The fact that potentially significant impacts of the Project lie outside the Authority's boundaries does not render them per se an improper lead agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, the Authority is a proper lead agency for the Project.

Storing water in Shasta Reservoir from April through June would help facilitate these types of transfers; however, Shasta Reservoir has a very limited capacity to store transfer water from April through June because of downstream temperature requirements. Reclamation is required by [State Water Resources Control Board] Water Rights Orders 90-05/91-01 to meet average daily temperature requirements as far downstream as practical when temperatures could affect fish. To meet requirements, Reclamation must carefully manage the cold water pool in Shasta Reservoir by releasing larger quantities of water earlier in the season; larger flows maintain cooler temperatures for a longer distance downstream. Reducing releases to hold transfer water in storage could affect Reclamation's ability to meet these downstream temperature requirements. Reclamation would only consider storing water for transfers if it would not affect releases for temperature or if it could be \"backed up\" into another reservoir (by reducing releases from that reservoir). Backing up water may be possible if the Delta is in balanced conditions and instream standards are met. The decision to back up transfer water would be\n   made on a case-by-case basis, but storage is analyzed in this EIS/EIR so that the analysis is complete in the event Reclamation determines that storage is possible in a specific year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Because of the limitations associated with storing transfer water, crop idling transfers would be more difficult to implement Cropland idling cannot be started partway through the irrigation season, so the water made available from April through June would bypass the pumps and become Delta outflow if it cannot be stored. Sacramento River sellers and buyers would generally prefer water transfer options that are more flexible, such as starting groundwater substitution pumping when Delta pumping capacity for transfers is available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Proposed sellers divert water from various locations along the Sacramento River or the Sutter Bypass. If a seller shifts from using surface water to groundwater when a transfer is implemented, river flows would not decrease from Shasta Reservoir to the point of diversion absent transfers. River flow would then increase from the seller's usual diversion point downstream to the buyer's point of diversion because water is not diverted for use until it reaches the Delta.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   If Reclamation determines that it can store water in Shasta Reservoir, the flows in the Sacramento River between Shasta Reservoir and the point of diversion absent transfers would decrease from April through June. Flows downstream of the point of diversion would not change during this period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   AR 25468-69.

Buyers and sellers must implement measures incorporated into the Proposed Action to avoid or reduce potential environmental impacts to obtain Reclamation approval of the transfer. Reclamation technical experts review all proposed transfers prior to approval of the transfer to ensure that impacts of the proposed transfer are within the scope of analysis in this EIS/EIR (or require the preparation of further environmental documentation in the event that new or substantially more severe adverse impacts are presented by the proposed transfer). Reclamation ensures that the identified mitigation measures are implemented through review of monthly reports, field visits, and necessary coordination with transfer participants.

The final quantity of water, if any, to be transferred is dependent on numerous factors, including future changes in hydrologic conditions, export capacity available for transfer water, negotiations between buyers and sellers, and Reclamation approval.

The referenced page provides the text of one aspect of that comment letter, in which Teeter, relying on DWR's own reports, points out that an Index based on Net Delta Outflow (\"NDO\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the sum of all inflows and outflows into the Delta used by the CVP and SWP to manage operations, underestimates flow during wet periods and overestimates flow during dry periods.

Put another way, Plaintiffs have failed to explain how any problems they or others may have with the way the NDO works renders the Project's description of carriage water insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Plaintiffs also cite their own comment letter on the Final EIS/R. ECF No. 45 at 16 (citing AR 30462). In the letter, Plaintiffs argue that the EIS/R \"cannot continue to rely on D-1641 standards when these standards are regularly relaxed,\" and demand that the EIS/R consider how water transfers will impact the environment in years when D-1641 outflow and salinity requirements are relaxed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20398\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 30462-63);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 27513-14 (similar comment referenced in the EIS/R pointing out that in January 2014, Reclamation and DWR jointly filed a Temporary Urgency Change Petition (\"TUCP\") to modify D-1641 standards including the Delta Outflow Objective, and objecting that the EIS/R does not evaluate impacts of water transfers on water quality during these extreme conditions). What Plaintiffs appear to be arguing by citing this comment letter is that the project description's reliance on\n   carriage water is unclear in the context of the regular relaxation of outflow and salinity requirements because it is unclear whether the EIS/R's assertion that carriage water \"will maintain water quality\" means water quality will be maintained at the then-existing level of quality (i.e., at the level set by the then-present water quality requirements, as modified by any TUCP), or whether that term is being used in some other way, such as to mean the water will be used to achieve additional gains in water quality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45 at 16 (questioning whether during times when water quality is relaxed \"carriage water [will] maintain that impaired condition ... or will it achieve condition by making repairs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The record belies any confusion Plaintiffs may be attempting to sow. What the EIS/R means by \"maintaining water quality in the Delta\" is relatively straightforward, at least on a conceptual level. It is a mechanism for maintaining balanced conditions when exports take place. AR 15749 (\"Carriage water is defined as the extra water needed to carry a unit of water across the Delta to CVP/SWP export facilities while maintaining a constant salinity.\"). The DEIS/R explains how water quality relates to the concept of balanced conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   The Delta can be in either a balanced or surplus condition. Balanced conditions, as defined in COA, are those periods when DWR and Reclamation agree that releases from upstream reservoirs plus unregulated flow approximately equals the water needed to meet Sacramento Valley in-basin uses plus exports. Conversely, excess or surplus conditions are periods when it is agreed that releases from upstream reservoirs plus unregulated flow exceed Sacramento Valley in-basin uses plus exports.\n   <em>\n    Sacramento Valley in-basin uses include Delta water quality\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   AR 15741 (emphasis added). Accordingly, if Delta water quality standards are relaxed, the part of the balanced water equation made up by Sacramento Valley in-basin uses would change, making it possible (at least in theory) to export more water while maintaining balanced conditions. But, even if Delta water quality standards are relaxed, carriage water still serves the purpose of maintaining balanced conditions (i.e., to maintain salinity at whatever point the water quality standards require) whenever transfer water is to be exported from the CVP/SWP export facilities. Carriage water \"maintain[s] water quality in the Delta\" by preventing shifts in salinity that would be caused by the process of exporting transfer water. While the explanation of this arrangement could have been more direct, the Court does not agree that the FEIS/R is unlawful because it fails to explain how carriage water \"will maintain water quality in the Delta.\" On this ground, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED and the Authority's cross-motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Does Description of Carriage Water as an Environmental Commitment Improperly Compress Analyses of Impacts and Mitigation Measures?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the way in which carriage water is described in the project as an \"environmental commitment\" improperly compresses the analysis of impacts and mitigation measures into a single issue, in violation of a principle set forth in\n   <em>\n    Lotus v.

First, Plaintiffs appear to be asserting that, despite the significant revisions, the FEIS/R nonetheless still failed to describe lawfully the Project's environmental setting. Second, Plaintiffs argue that the Authority should have re-circulated the FEIS/R for public comment. Plaintiffs make separate sets of arguments in connection with the FEIS/R's description of (a) existing groundwater levels\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (b) existing groundwater contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     Description of the Existing Groundwater Levels\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   It is somewhat difficult to tell whether Plaintiffs intend to challenge the content of the FEIS/R's description of the Project's environmental setting in connection with groundwater levels. Plaintiffs critique at length the content of the DEIS/R's discussion of groundwater elevations and other conditions related to the volume of accessible groundwater, and then concede that the FEIS/R makes \"substantial revisions\" thereto. ECF No. 45 at 20. Plaintiffs also take care to point out that after additional information was added to the DEIS/R, the document concluded that \"[c]omparisons of spring groundwater levels in the last decade (Spring 2004 to Spring 2014) indicate steep declines in groundwater levels up to 40 feet.\" AR 25627. Plaintiffs do indicate that \"the picture would have been bleaker still had the EIS/R disclosed groundwater conditions in the fall, rather than disclosing only spring levels immediately following winter rains,\" ECF No. 45 at 20 (citing AR 30459), and assert that the FEIS/R omitted any evaluation of deep well data,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20P.3d%20499\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 27894). But, Plaintiffs do not explain how these omissions of fall and deep well data render the FEIS/R's description of existing environmental conditions legally inadequate. Rather, they return to the argument that the \"\n   <em>\n    new data added to the FEIS/R\n   </em>\n   , showing 10 years of declining groundwater levels in the Sacramento Valley (and omitting any deep well data, AR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   27894), resulting in a slew of wells running dry in 2014, show a very different existing environmental condition than the resilient and ever-recharging groundwater levels the [F]EIS/R describes.\" ECF No. 45 at 20. It is impossible to tell whether Plaintiffs, in pointing to the \"resilient and ever-recharging groundwater levels the EIS/R describes,\" are referring to the DEIS/R or the FEIS/R. Moreover, they do not provide a citation to the FEIS/R that presents picture of \"resilient and ever-recharging groundwater levels.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, Plaintiffs fail to point out with any specificity how or why the description of the groundwater levels in the FEIS/R is inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiffs argue, generically, that the \"steep decline\" in groundwater levels significantly calls into question the effectiveness of mitigation measure GW-1, but fail (at least in this section of their brief) to explain why this might be the case. ECF No. 45 at 20. Plaintiffs also argue that the FEIS/R fails to consider a concurrent decline in surface water connected to the groundwater basins in question. ECF No. 45 at 21 (citing 27813 (showing FEIS/R's failure to address comment letter pointing to data that tends to show \"stream accretion generally decreases at approximately the same rate as groundwater pumping increases\") ). But, again, Plaintiffs fail to elaborate upon this point in any way. It is not the Court's obligation to flesh out a parties' argument. The Court is left with no choice but to conclude that Plaintiffs have not met their burden to establish that the FEIS/R fails to adequately describe existing environmental conditions related to groundwater levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument morphs into a somewhat different one in their reply, arguing, for example, that \"in continuing to rely on its modeled baseline for its impact analysis, the [F]EIS/R ignores the dramatic depletion of groundwater levels in parts of Glenn, Colusa and Tehama County within the Sacramento Valley; 135 wells in the Sacramento Valley groundwater basin were reported to have gone dry in 2014 alone.\" Doc 51 at 7 (citing AR 27426). The cited page of the AR (27426) is part of one of the Common Responses to comments contained in Appendix J of the FEIS/R. In Common Response 4, the FEIS/R presents the data in question indicating that 135 wells went dry. Plaintiffs' separate argument that these new additions required recirculation is discussed below. To the extent Plaintiffs are challenging what the FEIS/R\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   with this information in its analysis, that issue is misplaced in the context of a challenge to the way the project\n   <em>\n    describes\n   </em>\n   the environmental setting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     Is Recirculation Required in Light of Changes Made to the DEIS/R Pertaining to Information about Groundwater Levels?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The FEIS/R describes the \"affected environment/existing conditions\" to include\n   \"Redding Area Groundwater Basin; Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin; San Joaquin Valley Groundwater Basin; Santa Clara Valley Groundwater Basin; and Gilroy-Hollister Valley Groundwater Basin.\" AR 25600. The majority of groundwater substitution pumping proposed by the Project would occur in the Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin. AR 25463-66, AR 25601. Commenters raised the concern that the DEIS/R had failed to characterize accurately and sufficiently the groundwater resources in these basins. For example, U.S. EPA's comments succinctly articulate the asserted failure of the DEIS/R:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   The DEIS is internally inconsistent in defining and treating baseline/existing groundwater elevations. The characterization of existing groundwater conditions uses data sets that conclude at dates ranging from 1995 to 2013, and none include data from the 2013-2014 critical drought year. Where older, outdated data are used, it is possible that recent trends in groundwater elevation or land subsidence are not represented in the analysis. The current drought is perhaps the most severe the state has ever experienced and would be the relevant baseline for additional impact from the proposed action, slated to commence in 2015. According to the [DWR's] November 2014 Drought Update, over 50 percent of monitored wells in the Central and Sacramento Valleys have experienced groundwater level decreases of 2.5 feet or more from spring of 2013 to spring of 2014, with over 20% experiencing decreases of more than 10 feet. For the period from spring 2010 to spring 2014, nearly 30% of monitored wells have experienced declines in excess of 10 feet. While the most severe declines occur in the San Joaquin basin, precipitous declines are none-the-less prevalent across a majority of the sellers' service area. Due to these recent declines, some of the monitored wells in the sellers' service area may have reached historic low levels. Consequently, we are concerned that the extent of, or potential for, land subsidence may be greater than is reflected in the DEIS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   AR 27462;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 27890-27891 (similar comment submitted by Plaintiffs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   It is undisputed that the FEIS/R made revisions to the description of groundwater levels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 25625-25666 (adding dozens of maps and charts to describe existing conditions);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 27813 (\"Section 3.3.1.3, Affected Environment has been revised to clarify the impacts of current drought conditions to the groundwater resources within the area of analysis.\").

While it is true that the period from 2004 through 2014 has been drier than both the long-term average and the average for the period of analysis, this does not invalidate the analysis supporting the discussions in the environmental document. Hydrology in the period of analysis adequately represents the historical range and the variability that has occurred in the Sacramento Valley, and includes two multi-year droughts: 1976-77 and 1987-92. The drought of 1976-77 was more severe than any single year or 2-year period from 2004 through 2014, and the 1987-92 drought was more prolonged than any recent 6-year period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   Additionally, the EIS/EIR is intended to assess environmental conditions resulting from implementation of the range of potential transfer activities under the Proposed Action for a 10-year period. A key consideration, therefore, is whether there exists within the period of analysis any 10-year period that is representative of a reasonable worst-case condition for Sacramento Valley hydrology. Within the period of analysis, there are several 10-year periods that are considerably drier than the 2004 through 2014 period. For example, the average annual runoff for the 10-year period 1985 through 1994 is 12.7 MAF.

Put another way, the FEIS/R discusses each potentially impacted groundwater basin through the use of both modeling and real data-the real data extending up through and including 2014.

ECF No. 69 at 4-7. This is despite the fact that the record suggests SACFEM2013 is the model used to evaluate groundwater levels and demands. AR 27430. The Court will not entertain new arguments regarding CalSim II in the context of Plaintiffs' challenge to how the FEIS/R treats\n   <em>\n    groundwater\n   </em>\n   demand in its description of the baseline. Plaintiffs do make one other argument about SACFEM2013, asserting that the Authority \"cannot point to substantial evidence demonstrating that the model considers trends in groundwater demands such that the [F]EIS/R could meaningfully assess the extent to which additional groundwater pumping caused by the project would exacerbate trends in groundwater demands that have cause persistent drawdown over the course of decades. Relying on 2005 demands, the [F]EIS/R does not even describe existing conditions at the time of the [Notice of Publication of the FEIS/R].\" ECF No. 69 at 5. Here, Plaintiffs appear to confuse the fact that the CalSim II model set its level of demand at 2005 levels, while the SACFEM2013 model used demand set at\n   2010 levels. The Court is not in a position to tease out an argument from this confusion and finds nothing in Plaintiffs' response to the request for supplemental briefing that undermines its earlier conclusion that the Authority did not act unlawfully by utilizing a 2010 level of demand for its SACFEM2013 modeling efforts.

Specifically, as part of Plaintiffs' critique of the FEIS/R's use of an \"arbitrary baseline period of 1970-2003,\" Plaintiffs argue that this period \"fails to account for ongoing increases in global temperatures.\" ECF No. 45 at 23.

For example, the FEIS/R reviews several major reports on the impacts of climate change on California, each based on different global climate models and emissions scenarios, and presents the range of projected changes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 25861-65862. With respect to impacts of climate change on snowpack and streamflow, the FEIS/R indicates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   Snowpack and streamflow amounts are projected to decline because of less late winter precipitation falling as snow and earlier snowmelt (Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe 2014).\n   <em>\n    In California, snow water equivalent (the amount of water held in a volume of snow) is projected to decrease by 16 percent by 2035\n   </em>\n   , 34 percent by 2070, and 57 percent by 2099, as compared to measurements between 1971 and 2000 (Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe 2014). By the end of the century, late spring streamflow could decline by up to 30 percent (CEC 2011).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   AR 25864 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' comments on the DEIS/R suggested that the Lead Agencies use these figures to calculate projected loss of snowpack over the life of the project, as snowpack is a factor in surface water supply projections. AR 21832. Instead of doing so, the FEIS/R acknowledges that \"changes to annual temperatures, extreme heat, precipitation, sea level rise and storm surge, and snowpack and streamflow are expected to occur in the future because of climate change,\" but concludes: \"Because of the short-term duration of the Proposed Action (10 years),\n   any effects of climate change on this alternative are expected to be minimal. Impacts to the Proposed Action from climate change would be less than significant.\" AR 25874. Again, this conclusion appears to be in conflict with the data disclosed in the FEIS/R itself. With snow water equivalent predicted to decline by 16 percent by 2035, one cannot escape the obvious deduction that snow water equivalent is likely to decline by some (possibly significant) fraction of 16 percent by the end of the Proposed Action in 2024.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     CEQA Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The Authority takes the position that CEQA does not require an agency to analyze significant effects of climate change on a project.

[Public Resources Code s]ection 21060.5 defines 'environment' as 'the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, objects of historic or aesthetic significance.' ( [Pub. Res. Code,] \u00a7 21060.5.) Given the text of [Public Resources Code] section 21083 and other relevant provisions of the statutory scheme to which it belongs-including CEQA's statute-wide definition of 'environment'-the phrase in question is best interpreted as limited to those impacts on a project's users or residents that\n   <em>\n    arise from the project's effects on the environment\n   </em>\n   .

First, Federal Defendants point to the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (\"Draft Bay Delta EIR/EIS\"), which incorporated temperature and precipitation projections drawn from \"multiple general circulation models and emissions projections\" into rainfall runoff models. ECF No. 67 at 2 (citing AR 139843-58). The results of these runoff models were compared to runoff modeling results based on historic temperature and precipitation information to \"define the influences of climate change centered on these future periods.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201502.15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The results predict that, on an annual basis, inflow to key reservoirs in California will not be substantially different from historic patterns.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201502.15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citing AR 139849-58). For example, the ratio of projected average inflow in 2025 to historic inflow to Shasta Reservoir is 1:1. AR 139844-45, 139851-52. In theory, this record evidence demonstrating that precipitation overall will not change as a result of climate change could justify reliance on modeling that utilized historic datasets, were it not for a significant limitation of the analysis on which Federal Defendants rely. Plaintiffs point out, correctly, that the modeling results to which Federal Defendants refer are based upon predictions of\n   <em>\n    annual\n   </em>\n   inflows to reservoirs. They argue that reviewing only annual trends misses a key factor: changes in the timing of precipitation. Plaintiffs point to information in the record that indicates \"[r]educed snowpack and earlier snow melt will alter the timing and amount of water supplies, posing significant challenges for water resource management in the West.\" AR 82878. An appendix to the Draft Bay Delta EIR/EIS entitled \"Climate Change Effects on Hydrology in the Study Area Used for CALSIM Modeling Analysis\" (\"CalSim II Appendix\") acknowledges this, indicating: \"The simulated projected changes in monthly and annual runoff from projected future climate change generally reflect the expected shift from snowpack runoff (in April, May, and June) to rainfall runoff (in January, February, and March).\" AR 139843. This is not academic nit-picking. As the CalSim II Appendix explains, this \"decrease in inflow during the peak irrigation period of June, July and August will be particularly difficult for existing agricultural water supplies, and\n   <em>\n    will likely require additional groundwater recharge in the spring with increased groundwater pumping in the summer months\n   </em>\n   .\" AR 139849 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Federal Defendants' focus on annual patterns ignores a critical aspect of the impact in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Second, Federal Defendants suggest that the predicted 16 percent snow-water equivalent decrease emphasized by Plaintiff was based upon modeling of a \"worst case scenario.\" ECF No. 67 at 3-4. Specifically, the relied-upon prediction came from the \"A2\" emissions scenario, one of several modeled scenarios.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 25861-62. According to Federal Defendants, \"A2\" scenario predicts the \"highest and worst-case events and assumes continued increases in emissions throughout the century.\" ECF No. 67 at 3 (citing AR 83089, 83545-547). Presumably, Federal Defendants make this argument because NEPA does not require worst-case analysis.\n   <em>\n    Methow Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p349\">\n    490 U.S. at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p349\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, as\n   Plaintiffs point out, ECF No. 51 at 11, the A2 scenario is not a \"worst case\" scenario, at least not in the way that term is generally understood, in part because the record reflects that \"[r]ecent carbon dioxide emissions have, in fact, been\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   than in the A2 scenario. Whether this trend will continue is not possible to predict because it depends on societal choices.\" AR 83903 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Federal Defendants make one other argument that is simply illogical, asserting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   The global dispersion of greenhouse gases means that localized environmental impacts cannot be traced to California's particular emissions. Even if there were a way to trace state-specific emissions to particular climate change impacts, record evidence demonstrates that emissions in California are decreasing,\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR82457 (indicating that greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 1.6 percent between 2000 and 2012 in California), and that the State has set goals for future reduction in coming years, including over the life of the Project.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   AR82461. Thus, given this and other information in the record discussed above, it was not contradictory for Federal Defendants to conclude that \"any effects of climate change on [the Proposed Action] alternative are expected to be minimal. Impacts to the Proposed Action from climate change would be less than significant.\" AR25874.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   ECF No. 67 at 4. In this argument Federal Defendants rely on information demonstrating greenhouse gas\n   <em>\n    emissions\n   </em>\n   from California sources are decreasing to argue that impacts\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   the Proposed Action\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   climate change would be less than significant. This adds nothing but confusion to the discussion.

Plaintiffs complain that the FEIS/R fails to mention that Reclamation and DWR \"routinely request relaxation of these standards.\" ECF No. 45 at 28 (citing AR 30364). The SWRCB relaxed D-1641's outflow and salinity requirements in 2014 and 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 30364.

Among other things, as the Authority points out, carriage water is used to maintain compliance with whatever water quality standards are in force and effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 48 at 10-12\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also supra\n   </em>\n   at part IV.A.2.b.

ECF No. 45 at 29 (citing AR 25559). This argument builds upon the argument, discussed above, that the FEIS/R failed to accurately describe existing groundwater contamination.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.3.a(3). As mentioned, the FEIS/R revealed that there were numerous active groundwater clean-up sites in the Sacramento Valley, but that most of these sites were clustered around urban areas. AR 25673. As the FIES/R explains, \"[g]roundwater substitution transfers would use groundwater for irrigation instead of surface water.\" AR 25559. However, \"[t]he amount of groundwater substituted for surface water under the Proposed Action would be relatively small compared to the amount of surface water used to irrigate agricultural fields in the Seller Service Area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Groundwater would mix with surface water in agricultural drainages prior to irrigation return flow reaching the rivers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, \"[c]onstituents of concern that may be present in the groundwater\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   enter the surface water as a result of mixing with irrigation return flows.

Because the Court dedicates a lengthy section of this decision to evaluating an ESA challenge to the BiOp pertaining to GGS,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   at Part IV.B, and because that discussion informs its analysis of the CEQA challenge, the Court addresses the CEQA challenge after the ESA discussion.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   at Part IV.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <strong>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Analysis of Biological Impacts of Reductions to Delta Outflows (CEQA)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the FEIS/R fails to adequately analyze impacts resulting from acknowledged reductions to Delta outflows. ECF No. 45 at 32. Specifically, they argue that the FIES/R's threshold of significance related to this particular impact is arbitrary and therefore violates CEQA and that the cumulative impact analysis fails to take into consideration the already degraded condition of the Delta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   In connection with the direct (as opposed to cumulative) impact analysis, the FEIS/R indicates that \"[m]odeled changes in Delta outflow or X2\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   relative to existing conditions were considered substantial and required further analysis if they were greater than ten percent.\" AR 25904. In selecting this threshold, the FEIS/R relied upon environmental studies evaluating impacts to fish habitat caused by decreased flows in freshwater streams and rivers. AR 25903. These studies revealed a \"consensus that differences in modeled flows [in those circumstances] of less than ten percent would be within the noise of the model outputs and beyond the ability to measure actual changes.\" AR 25903. Plaintiffs complain that applying this ten percent threshold, derived from studies of impacts to streams and rivers, to Delta outflow is inappropriate because \"non-tidally influenced systems,\" such as rivers and streams, \"are different from tidally-influenced waterbodies,\" such as the Delta. ECF No. 51 at 16. Plaintiffs maintain that while \"a 10% reduction in flow in a purely freshwater system simply means that less water is in the channel, the same is not true in the delta. Instead, reducing freshwater flows changes the chemistry of the water itself. Uncritically adopting the freshwater standard is therefore not adequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiffs cite no factual information to support this assertion. They do cite\n   <em>\n    San Luis v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180707\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/581/#p591\">\n    747 F.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for that case's explanation that\n   decreased inflow into the Delta from upstream sources increases Delta salinity, which in turn affects the location of X2, which (at least for purposes of the environmental document evaluated in\n   <em>\n    San Luis v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ) serves as a proxy for the location of the habitat for at least one protected fish species. But,\n   <em>\n    San Luis v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   directly or even indirectly support Plaintiffs' factual assertion that a 10% threshold of significance is less appropriate for Delta outflow impacts than it is for streamflow impacts. Information contained in the FEIS/R could support the opposite assertion: because tidal fluctuations can be huge (average daily changes on the order of 170,000 cfs), the modeled changes in outflow (reductions of not more than 147 cfs), would be miniscule in comparison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 25920. Without more, the Court is simply not in the position to question the FEIS/R's reliance on a 10% threshold of significance for direct impacts, given that the use of such a threshold seems to be well supported in the related context of freshwater streamflow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiffs' arguments regarding the analysis of cumulative impact to Delta outflow to be more compelling.

Yet, the FEIS/R fails to account for this in its cumulative impacts analysis, focusing instead on the fact that changes to Delta outflow and X2 position would be \"small\" (less than three percent) and that this and all other projects would be subject to numerous regulatory constraints, including requirements imposed under the ESA and D-1641:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   <em>\n    The Proposed Action in combination with other cumulative projects could cause Delta outflows to be lower than under the No Action/No Project Alternative.\n   </em>\n   Long-term water transfer actions under the Proposed Action would have a less than significant impact on fisheries resources that may be influenced by Delta outflow, as changes in Delta outflow and X2 location would be small (less than three percent) in all months and water year types. In addition, all cumulative water operations projects affecting Delta exports would be required to meet Delta water quality standards (e.g., D-1641) and meet the requirements of the USFWS and NOAA Fisheries BOs for the long term coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP. Because changes in Delta outflow and X2 location are predicted to be small and there are additional protections for fisheries and aquatic resources already in place under the ESA and D-1641, these impacts would be less than significant.

Although no party makes any effort to define this language for the Court, the Court assumes that the plain meaning of the term \"totalizing\" is pertinent: \"to add up; to express as a whole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the frequency of the reading only reflects how often the meter is read, not whether the meter captures variable flow rates. Moreover, any such impacts from the pumping at transfer wells would, presumably, be captured by groundwater level monitoring at those wells and surrounding/nearby monitoring wells. Therefore, the Court does not find error in the FEIS/R's monitoring requirements for pumping well flow rate meters. On this issue, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED, and the Authority's cross-motions are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   GW-1 also requires that monitoring of groundwater\n   <em>\n    levels\n   </em>\n   at both participating transfer wells and monitoring wells will occur prior to transfer (at least monthly \"where possible\"), at the start of transfer (the day of, prior to the pump being turned on), during the transfer period (at least weekly \"unless site-specific information indicates a different interval should be used\"), and post transfer (weekly for one month, then monthly through March of the year following the transfer). AR 25760. To the extent Plaintiffs suggest that \"monthly\" monitoring will not capture impacts as a result of groundwater extraction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45 at 37, GW-1 generally requires weekly monitoring during extraction\n   and for a month after. Nothing in the record suggests this is insufficient to recognize impacts in a timely manner. On this issue, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED, and the Authority's cross-motions are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Plaintiffs do raise a more significant concern with the seemingly open-ended exceptions to the \"minimum\" monitoring requirements set forth in GW-1, questioning what the FEIS/R means by requiring pre-pumping monitoring on a monthly basis \"where possible\" and during-pumping monitoring weekly \"unless site specific information indicates a different interval should be used.\" ECF No. 45 at 37. The Authority makes only minimal effort to address this concern, asserting that the monitoring requirements set forth in GW-1 are only \"minimum\" requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No 58 at 11. But the Authority cites documents that merely regurgitate the language of GW-1, which in turn incorporates the above-mentioned exceptions into the minimum requirements. The public is left guessing what these exceptions mean and, critically, the extent to which monitoring might be lessened and under what circumstances. The presence of such open-ended exceptions makes it impossible for the Court to find that the monitoring program is enforceable or will be effective at avoiding potential significant impacts. On this issue, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED and the Authority's cross-motion is DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   <strong>\n    (4)\n    <em>\n     GW-1 Performance Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   An EIR may not defer the formulation of mitigation measures to a future time, but mitigation measures may instead specify performance standards which would mitigate the project's significant effects and that may be accomplished in more than one specified way.

Likewise, here, the menu of options includes measures (e.g., suspending pumping) that will curtail non-reversible subsidence and correct damage to infrastructure caused by subsidence. The Court finds that the FEIS/R complies with CEQA insofar as it does not fail to spell out the criteria by which its effectiveness will be avoided: avoiding non-reversible subsidence. It is not impermissible for the Authority to use a mechanism that requires monitoring for reversible subsidence and then curtails or modifies activities to halt the impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct that GW-1 may allow a certain amount of irreversible subsidence to occur before mitigation procedures are triggered. But the Court cannot identify any authority suggesting this is per se unlawful, so long as the mitigation measures overall reduce the impact to less than significant. As to the specific argument that GW-1 is unlawful for failing to identify performance standard, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED and the Authority's motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Plaintiffs separately raise a number of arguments all going to the question of whether the record supports a finding that the measures associated with land subsidence in GW-1 will be effective. ECF No. 45 at 41-42. Plaintiffs criticize the monitoring frequency for subsidence-related impacts. Specifically, whenever measured groundwater levels remain below the historic low level, the seller \"will stop transfer-related pumping or begin land surface elevation measurements in strategic locations within and/or near the transfer related-pumping area .... on a\n   <em>\n    monthly\n   </em>\n   basis during the transfer.\" AR 25762 (emphasis added). The Authority rejoins by citing record evidence that groundwater flows more slowly than surface water, because groundwater flows through porous media rather than in open channels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 48 at 24-25. Specifically, groundwater flows at a \"very slow rate, usually less than 1,000 feet per year because of the great amount of friction resulting from movement through the spaces between grains of sand and gravel.\" AR 74372. In addition, the Authority argues that \"[m]ore frequent measurements would serve no purpose because subsidence generally occurs in small increments, and shorter intervals would not be expected to provide reliable data outside the margin of error.\" ECF No. 58 at 12-13. The record indicates \"[s]ubsidence generally occurs in small increments during dry years when groundwater pumping lowers groundwater levels below historical lows in areas that are geologically susceptible because they have compressible clays.\" AR 25667. Plaintiffs fail to cite any record evidence to suggest that the movement of groundwater (or any other aspect of the subsidence) would warrant more than monthly monitoring. Taking all of this together, the record supports the FEIS/R's implied conclusion that monthly monitoring of subsidence is sufficient. Accordingly, on this issue, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   and the Authority's cross-motion GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Plaintiffs next challenge a number of specific aspects the mitigation approach set forth in of GW-1 \"Stage 3\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n   <em>\n    Stage 3: Local Investigation\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   If the threshold of 0.2 foot of ground surface elevation change is exceeded, the seller shall cease groundwater substitution pumping for the transfer until one of the following occurs: (1) groundwater levels recover above historic low groundwater levels; (2) seller completes a more detailed local investigation identifying hydrogeologic conditions that could potentially allow continued transfer-related pumping from a subset of wells (if the seller can provide evidence that this pumping is not expected to cause additional subsidence); or (3) seller completes an investigation of local infrastructure that could be affected by subsidence (such as water delivery infrastructure, water supply facilities, flood protection facilities, highways etc.) indicating the local threshold of subsidence that could be experienced before these facilities would be adversely affected. Any option should also consider the effect of non-transfer pumping that may be causing subsidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   AR 25766. Plaintiffs complain that item 1 in the above paragraph \"simply does not mitigate land subsidence at all, as groundwater levels could have recovered due to any number of reasons, even where land elevations have not. Moreover, the mitigation measure fails to provide direction to the seller if groundwater level[s] never recover.\" ECF No. 45 at 42. This ignores the record evidence discussed above indicating that subsidence is caused by groundwater withdrawal and irreversible subsidence is not irreversible if it does not exceed the threshold levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the second element is ineffective because it \"provides no criteria by which the agencies would make this determination to allow groundwater pumping to continue even where groundwater levels have dropped to below historic lows, and land surface elevations have been measured to appreciably drop.\" ECF No. 45 at 42. This is an overly cramped reading of the second element, which permits it to operate as an exception to the prohibition against further pumping only if \"the seller can provide evidence that this pumping is not expected to cause additional subsidence.\" AR 25766. This provides a criterion: no additional subsidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs complain that the third element \"impermissibly prioritizes 'infrastructure,' such as the transferring agencies' own 'water supply facilities,' above physical environmental features not considered, such as local residences, or the capacity of the aquifer itself, impacts to which GW-1 is silent.\" ECF No. 45 at 42. On this point, the Court agrees. The use of the operative \"or\" in the paragraph quoted above indicates that a seller may resume pumping if it satisfies any of the three factors. Therefore, this paragraph indeed suggests that if a seller is able to demonstrate that subsidence would not exceed \"the local threshold of subsidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   that\n   could be experienced before these facilities would be adversely affected,\" the seller may continue to pump even though there might be other, non-infrastructure related impacts, such as impacts to aquifer capacity. AR 25697. This creates an unlawful loophole in the mitigation plan that would permit impacts to occur.

The citations provided by Federal Defendants are simply too generic to establish a valid distinction in terms of water use efficiency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 59 at 7 (citing AR 26379 (indicating contractors in BSA \"have already implemented (or are currently implementing) [water use efficiency] measures,\" but providing no basis for comparison with upstream of delta (seller) agencies/contractors); AR 26365 (same); AR 27977 (same) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   The decision to reject the BSA conservation alternative could, alternatively, be justified by the FEIS/R's conclusion that such an alternative would not satisfy the Project's stated purposed and need because it would not provide an \"immediate benefit.\" As quoted above, the FEIS/R defines the immediacy criteria as follows: \"Immediate: the term proposed for this EIS/EIR is 2015 through 2024. This period is relatively short, and measures need to be able to provide some measurable benefit within this time period.\" Plaintiffs suggest that a component would satisfy the immediacy requirement if it provided some benefit by\n   2024, and argue that \"[i]t defies common sense to claim that no conservation measures could be implemented in 10 years. Without more information, [Reclamation] has utterly failed to demonstrate that no additional conservation measures could be implemented in the BSA that would provide \"some measureable benefit by [the time period of 2015-2024].\" ECF No. 45 at 46. While Federal Defendants assert in reply that \"because immediately implementable conservation methods are already being used in the buyer service area ... there is no room for more water saving this way.\" ECF No. 59 at 7. But, again, the record does not fully support this assertion. The FEIS/R indicates that BSA \"Districts and farmers would need to identify and invest in additional district-level or on-farm practices to improve irrigation efficiencies,\" AR 26365, and that \"[a]dditional measures would generally require substantial infrastructure and investment and would not be immediately implementable,\" AR 26379, but nowhere does the record provide information to support the proposition that further improvements in BSA efficiency would not be possible within the timeframe of the Project. Again, the record citations do not support such a conclusion, especially in light of the contrary conclusion reached regarding the potential for seller efficiency gains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   The third screening criterion screened for measures \"that have the capability of providing additional water to regions that are experiencing shortages.\" AR 26379. According to the screening protocol, if a measure did not meet a criterion, it was screened out from further consideration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050039\" index=\"471\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/1209/#p1245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FEIS/R independently supports its rejection of the BSA conservation alternative by concluding that such an alternative would not \"provide substantial water,\" because it \"would not provide any additional supply.\" AR 26380. Plaintiffs do not argue that the \"provide substantial water\" criterion itself or the screening protocol is unlawful. Rather, they argue that \"other measures that advanced to the Project Alternative stage were not required to individually satisfy all CPV shortages. (AR 26382) (noting that Groundwater Substitution would allow water transfers that would \"reduce potential shortages.\"); AR 26384 (discussing fact that reservoir releases \"could reduce potential CVP shortages.\").\" ECF No. 45 at 47. This is an overly cramped view of the record. The \"provide substantial water\" criterion explained that \"project participants need measures that have the capability of providing additional water to regions that are experiencing shortages.\" AR 26379. The other measures to which Plaintiffs refer were found to satisfy this criterion (and the other two). For example, groundwater substitution would permit surface water to be transferred to the BSA. AR 26382. The reservoir release alternative would do the same, because it would involve release by sellers of water stored in upstream non-CVP reservoirs \"for transfer through the Delta to the [BSA].\" AR 26384. Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the inclusion of the \"provide substantial water\" criterion is improper or was improperly applied. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment that an alternative requiring BSA conservation was improperly rejected is DENIED; Federal Defendants' cross-motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Buyer Area Transfers Alternative\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   Plaintiffs next challenge the FEIS/R's treatment of an alternative that would have included transfers solely within the BSA. ECF No. 45 at 47. The FEIS/R declined to consider this alternative, claiming that additional transfers within the BSA would not provide substantial water because \"[e]ven after in-basin transfers occur, CVP contractors continue to face shortages.\" AR 26384. Again, Plaintiffs argue that the treatment of the BSA transfers\n   alternative was inconsistent with the way other alternatives were treated in the FEIS/R. Specifically, an alternative that would involve sellers using groundwater substitution in lieu of surface water passed the screening stage because the FEIS/R found it would \"provide substantial amounts of water for local irrigators and allow for CVP water to be transferred to the Buyer Service Area to reduce potential shortages.\" AR 026382. Similarly, an alternative that would have called upon seller agencies upstream of the Delta to release water from local (non-CVP) reservoirs passed the screening phase because this would produce water that \"would not have otherwise been released downstream,\" and would therefore \"provide water to reduce potential CVP shortages.\" AR 26384.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   The Court does not find an internal inconsistency here. The FEIS/R explained that the \"provision of substantial water\" criterion was designed to confirm a measure's \"capability of providing additional water to regions that are experiencing shortages.\" AR 26364. The record indicates that agencies in the BSA experience the most severe water constraints due to shortages. AR 25427 (\"Water shortages lead to severe water constraints especially in the southern portion of the CVP.\"); AR 25556 (\"Under the No Action/No Project Alternative, significant water shortages are anticipated in the [BSA].\"). This fact provides sufficient basis to distinguish measures that would produce water in the seller areas from those that would produce water in the buyer areas. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED on this ground; Federal Defendants' cross-motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Land Retirement Alternative\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge the FEIS/R's elimination of an alternative that included land retirement in the BSA. ECF No. 45 at 47. The FEIS/R considered but eliminated such an alternative because it did not comply with the project's purpose as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-392\">\n   Under the San Luis Drainage Feature Re-evaluation, Reclamation is working to retire 194,000 acres of drainage impaired farmland. Irrigation water for retired lands will be distributed to other lands in the San Luis Unit. This [alternative] measure proposes to retire additional land above the 194,000 acres. Identifying and negotiating land retirement agreements with willing landowners would take several years to implement. This measure is not flexible because land would go out of irrigated agricultural production permanently. Further, land retirement does not provide additional water to address basin-wide CVP shortages, but rather provides a way for users to address shortages in the No Action/No Project Alternative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   AR 26382;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 27586 (land retirement alternative \"not carried forward for more detailed analysis because it did not meet the key elements of the purpose and need or basic project objectives as it would not be immediate or flexible, and would not provide additional water\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   As with the BSA conservation alternative, Plaintiffs complain, among other things, that Reclamation has failed to justify the FEIS/R's finding that this alternative fails to satisfy the \"provide substantial water\" requirement. They argue that the \"position that retiring land will not provide water\" is \"baffling,\" particularly in light of the fact that the FEIS/R finds that land retirement in the seller area does provide water. ECF No. 45 at 48 (citing AR 26382). Again, Plaintiffs' real concern here is with the definition of the Project itself. The Project proponents have defined the Project as one designed to bring additional water from the seller service areas to the\n   BSA. Plaintiffs have failed to identify anything unlawful about this Project definition, nor with the specific criterion which embodies this purpose. Absent such an argument, the Court cannot find the alternatives analysis unlawful. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED on this ground; Federal Defendants' cross-motion is GRANTED. Because this basis, standing alone, is sufficient to support the FEIS/R's refusal to subject this alternative to further analysis, the Court declines to address Plaintiffs' other arguments regarding this alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Alternative that Excluded Reservoir Releases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   As mentioned, the FEIS/R did consider an alternative that would have called upon seller agencies upstream of the Delta to release water from local (non-CVP), reservoirs for transfer through the Delta to the BSA. AR 26384. At least one third party commenter requested that the FEIS/R consider another alternative that would have included all other water supply source concepts except reservoir releases, \"so reservoir release impacts from the water transfers could have been identified, characterized, quantified and disclosed.\" AR 27587. Plaintiffs complain that the FEIS/R failed to provide any justification for its decision not to evaluate this alternative. Plaintiffs point out that Alternative 3 eliminated crop modification and Alternative 4 eliminated groundwater substitution, allowing for the analytical isolation of the effects of these sources of water. AR 25452. However, the FEIS/R gives some explanation for why it might not be necessary to create an alternative that selectively eliminated each water source scheme. As the FEIS/R explains, the Alternatives \"mix and match\" elements so that the analysis would allow decision-makers to \"create an alternative that would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any significant environmental effects.\" AR 25452. The Court can identify nothing legally or factually inappropriate with this as a general matter. More specifically, as Federal Defendants indicate, ECF No. 49-1 at 23-24, the impacts from reservoir releases are evaluated in the FEIS/R in a manner that permits those impacts to be distinguished from other impacts, even though the are not isolated from yet another alternative as Plaintiffs request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 25522-23, 25525 (Table 3.1-2); 25561-62; 25574. The Court further notes that Plaintiffs do not address this issue in their reply brief. ECF No. 51 at 22-24. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is DENIED on this ground; Federal Defendants' cross-motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     Public Trust Doctrine\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that \"the [F]EIS/R failed to evaluate consistency with the Public Trust Doctrine.\" ECF No. 45 at 49-50.

Long-term fallowing can reduce or eliminate habitat, yet short-term fallowing can ultimately improve rice agriculture and associated habitat components and sustain them over the long term while reducing chemical inputs and discharges (J. Roberts in litt. 2011, referenced in Service 2012). When rice fields are left out of production there is a substantial reduction or elimination in the use of the surrounding and nearby water conveyance structures by snakes where water supply is dependent upon surface or ground water from non-adjacent or on-site sources (Service 2012). Radio tracked snakes are known to leave previously occupied rice land sites when fallowing is continued for more than one season (Wylie pers. Comm. 2008, E Hansen 2008). If rice fields are planted with a rotation crop, especially one that is irrigated, essential habitat components for the snake may be maintained, and the long term values may be enhanced if the rice crop is made more sustainable where it otherwise might be eliminated (Service 2012). Fallowing fields alternately in a 'checkerboard' pattern may minimize the impacts to snakes (Service in litt. 2008 referenced in Service 2012).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-428\">\n   Recent studies have concluded that snakes have adapted to the mosaic of seasonal wetlands and upland habitats that rice cultivation mimics, and use flooded rice fields for foraging, and irrigation dikes for basking sites (Service 2012). Regular long-term water transfers have the potential to reduce significantly the amount of rice lands and the temporary and artificial wetlands they produce (Service 2012). Impacts may be especially severe in those areas adjacent to State and Federal wildlife refuges which may function as the core habitat to lead recovery efforts (Service 2012).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   AR 7939.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   The BiOp next evaluated the \"effects of the action,\" assuming that a maximum of 60,693 acres of rice land will be fallowed each year for 10 years if the full amount of permitted transfer water is transferred as a result of cropland idling/crop shifting.

What Plaintiffs overlook, however, is that the legal standard does not require FWS to adopt conservation measures that \"best protect\" GGS. As discussed previously, the question is whether FWS lawfully determined that the conservation measures avoid jeopardy. In sum, Plaintiffs do not point to better data that could have been used to generate the maps presented in Attachment A, nor do they point to a better methodology FWS should have relied upon in this effort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Luis v.

Generally, FWS described the new conservation measures as: \"focus[ing] on cropland idling restrictions in areas where snakes have a high likelihood of occurrence.\" AR 7924. However, close inspection of the conservation measures reveals a troubling lack of clarity in how the restrictions are described (and therefore how they would be implemented). As mentioned, in finding that the Project would not jeopardize GGS, FWS imposed certain terms and conditions on the Project, including that Reclamation incorporate within any contract certain conservation measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   \"Areas with known priority snake populations,\" including lands \"adjacent to naturalized lands and refuges and corridors between these areas,\" will not be permitted to participate in cropland idling/shifting transfers. AR 7926. The BiOp indicates that water sellers can request a \"case-by-case evaluation\" of whether a specific field would be precluded from participating in long-term transfers and provides the following examples of lands where cropland idling/shifting transfers will not be permitted because they encompass \"[a]reas with known priority snake populations\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-455\">\n   Fields abutting or immediately adjacent to Little Butte Creek between Llano Seco and Upper Butte Basin Wildlife Area (WA), Butte Creek between Upper Butte Basin and Gray Lodge WAs, Colusa Basin drainage canal between Delevan and Colusa National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), Gilsizer Slough, Colusa Drainage Canal, the land side of the Toe Drain along the Sutter Bypass, Willow Slough, and Willow Slough Bypass in Yolo County, Hunters and Logan Creeks between Sacramento and Delevan NWRs; and Lands in the Natomas Basin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-456\">\n   AR 7926. As Plaintiffs point out, however, some of the maps in Attachment A designate\n   <em>\n    known observations\n   </em>\n   of GGS that are inexplicably\n   <em>\n    not included on this list\n   </em>\n   . ECF No. 51 at 28.

Or. 2010). Here, is impossible to tell from the record whether idling transfers will be permitted from areas marked on Attachment A maps as having known snake occurrences or whether \"case-by-case\" evaluation would result in transfers being precluded from these areas. This is because the BiOp does not define the term \"known priority snake population,\" and the exemplar locations suggest that not all marked occurrences qualify for treatment as an area of known priority snake population. This must be clarified on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   Relatedly, as the BiOp indicates, \"by far the most serious threat to snakes continues to be loss and fragmentation of habitat.\" AR 7939. Plaintiffs argue that the BiOp fails to consider harm to GGS from habitat fragmentation. ECF No. 45 at 53; ECF No. 51 at 29. In the effects analysis section of the BiOp, the BiOp reasons that \"[b]y\n   <em>\n    requiring crop idling/substitution to occur away from high priority habitat\n   </em>\n   and areas with high likelihood of snake occurrence, and by maintaining movement corridors for snakes in areas where crop idling occurs, it is expected that snakes will be able to reach suitable habitat despite drying due to crop idling.\" AR 7943 (emphasis added). But, at least one aspect of the above sentence is inconsistent with the language of the actual conservation measures, which do not \"requir[e] crop idling/substitution to occur away from high priority habitat areas,\" or at least do not clearly delineate how such prohibitions would apply. To the contrary, the BiOp\n   <em>\n    permits\n   </em>\n   crop idling/substitution in so-called \"priority habitat\" so long as \"adequate water\" remains available for those \"priority habitat\" areas. AR 7925. The BiOp's use of the term \"adequate water\" is confusing and requires some explanation. First, the conservation measures require all water sellers will keep \"adequate water\" in major irrigation and drainage canals. AR 7925. In connection with this requirement, the BiOp defines \"adequate water\" as water at depths similar to years when transfers do not occur, or at least two feet where information on existing water depth is limited.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038073\" index=\"571\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/716/982/#p1002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, water sellers proposing transfers from idled rice fields will ensure that\n   \"adequate water is available for priority habitat with a high likelihood of giant garter snake occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038073\" index=\"572\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/716/982/#p1002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Priority habitat\" is defined as \"fields abutting or immediately adjacent to federal wildlife refuges\" and areas indicated on the priority habitat maps discussed above.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038073\" index=\"573\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/716/982/#p1002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The very next paragraph explains what adequate water means in the context of \"priority habitat\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-460\">\n   Maintaining water in smaller drains and conveyance infrastructure supports key habitat attributes such as emergent vegetation for snake for escape cover and foraging habitat.

If the BiOp intended the \"\n   <em>\n    high\n   </em>\n   priority areas\" in which it promises to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   permit crop idling to be something other than the \"priority areas\" indicated in the above-quoted conservation measures section, it provides no clear explanation of that distinction. This too must be clarified on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the conservation measures were legally inadequate because (1) they permitted idled parcels to be located adjacent to or across from other idled parcels; and (2) they permitted idling of individual parcels on more than two consecutive years. The Final BiOp acknowledges that fallowing fields in a \"checkerboard pattern\" may be beneficial to snakes and indicated that long term fallowing can reduce or eliminate habitat. AR 7939. So far as the Court can determine, the BiOp does not explain how, in light of these findings, the conservation measures avoid jeopardy. A BiOp is arbitrary and capricious if it fails to \"consider the relevant factors and articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629422\" index=\"574\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/1101/#p1121\">\n    698 F.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1121 (9th Cir. 2012). Here, the BiOp explicitly considers the issue of fallowing patterns (both spatial and temporal) and acknowledges the import of those patterns, but then fails to articulate why the conservation measures avoid jeopardy, in light of the fact that the measures contain no constraints on how close fallowed fields may be to one another nor any limit on the number of consecutive years a field may lie fallow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   Relatedly, Plaintiffs argue the BiOp's acceptance of these conservation measures as avoiding jeopardy conflicts with the BiOp's own findings that: (1) \"\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   rice fields and canals are important habitats for the snake\" (AR 7932); and (2) \"[d]itches, canals and other agricultural conveyances typically provide limited cover\" and that large predators are typically more prevalent in ditches and canals (AR 7942). The BiOp appears to explain that the conservation measures' focus on prioritizing retention of water in drains and canals is sufficient because \"canals and ditches known to be suitable for snakes ... represent 85% of the known snake occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629422\" index=\"575\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/1101/#p1121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, even assuming snakes are found more frequently in canals and ditches, this does not explain why it is acceptable to focus on retention of water in canals and ditches to the detriment of maintaining appropriate rice field habitat the BiOp itself considers \"important.\" This is particularly troubling in light of the discussion above finding that the conservation measure that prohibits cropland idling/shifting in \"[a]reas with known priority snake populations,\" unlawfully imprecise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the above described\n   areas of concern, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment that the BiOp's conservation measures are unlawful is GRANTED; Federal Defendants' and Defendant Intervenors' cross-motions are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   Several other specific challenges leveled by Plaintiffs are less compelling. For example, Plaintiffs suggest that adopting the conservation measures was arbitrary and capricious because they contain no block size restrictions. ECF No. 45 at 53. Mr. Hanson's letter states that the 320 acre block size restriction imposed in the past was the product of \"expert consensus\" reflecting \"special extent consistent with documented giant garter snake movement patterns\" based upon \"extensive mark-recapture and radiotelemetry data on [GGS] home range and movement\" in fragmented rice landscapes since the 1990s. AR 47654. But, neither Mr. Hanson nor Plaintiffs point to any study or record document that suggests the 320 acre block size restriction (or, for that matter, any block size restriction at all) is the ideal (let alone the only) approach to GGS conservation that would avoid jeopardy. In fact, as Federal Defendants point out, in a 2010 BiOp, FWS acknowledged that it had \"no data\" that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-465\">\n   indicate the extent that snakes successfully relocate and assimilate into adjacent or nearby habitat when rice lands are fallowed, the extent to which the configuration of the landscape mosaic of rice fields and fallowed rice affects the success of individuals to assimilate, the extent to which snake population trends respond not only to following but to subsequent increases in rice cultivation, or the degree to which fluctuation in rice acreage over time mirrors variability in the snake population over time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   AR 652. Without more, this boils down to a disagreement among experts that must be resolved in favor of Federal Defendants.\n   <em>\n    San Luis v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180707\" index=\"576\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/581/#p591\">\n    747 F.3d at 603-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen specialists express conflicting views, an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an original matter, a court might find contrary views more persuasive.\") (internal citation and quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge the following additional conservation measure that requires all Reclamation contracts with sellers to reflect that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-468\">\n   Sellers will continue to voluntarily perform snake best management practices, including educating maintenance personnel to recognize and avoid contact with snakes, cleaning only one side of a conveyance channel per year, and implementing other measures to enhance habitat for snakes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   AR 7926. Plaintiffs argue that requiring Reclamation to include in its contracts the requirement that a contractor abide by \"voluntary\" best management practices is meaningless, as \"including a voluntary term in a contract does not transform it into a mandatory term.\" ECF No. 51 at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-470\">\n   The Court does not agree. This is imprecise drafting, at best, but the Court accepts Federal Defendants' position that Reclamation's project description and the BiOp require implementation of the best management practices. ECF No. 59 at 16-17. As to these remaining issues Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment that the BiOp's conservation measures are unlawful is DENIED; Federal Defendants' and Defendant Intervenors' cross-motions are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-471\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Remaining CEQA Challenge to Assessment of Impacts to Giant Garter Snake\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-472\">\n   As explained above, Plaintiffs argue that the FEIS/R fails to satisfy CEQA's requirements with respect to analysis of the Project's impacts on Giant Garter Snake (\"GGS\"). The FEIS/R concludes that \"[c]ropland idling/shifting actions under the Proposed Action would have a less than significant impact on giant garter snakes because a relatively small proportion (no more than 10.5 percent of the rice acreage) would be affected in any given year\" and the \"Environmental Commitments\" described in the Project would \"avoid or reduce many of the potential impacts associated with this activity and the displacement of giant garter snake that could result.\" AR 26016. Plaintiffs take issue with this conclusion on two central grounds. First, they argue the FEIS/R fails to explain how fallowing 10.5 percent of rice acreage is less than significant in light of the fact that, according to the BiOp, \"[b]y far the most serious threat[ ] to [GGS] continues to be loss and fragmentation of habitat from urban and agricultural development and loss of habitat associated with changes in rice production.\" AR 7939;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45 at 30-31. In particular, the BiOp indicates \"the quantification of habitat loss as a result of the proposed action serves as a\n   <em>\n    direct surrogate\n   </em>\n   for the snakes that will be lost.\" AR 7945. Thus, Plaintiffs contend, \"a loss of 10.5% of available habitat would presumably result in the same or similar percentage of population loss.\" ECF No. 45 at 31. Plaintiffs point out that the FEIS/R does not explain how such a loss would not constitute a \"substantial adverse effect\" on the GGS population.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180707\" index=\"577\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/581/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-473\">\n   The Authority responds by pointing out, correctly, that Plaintiffs' description of the factual picture is overly simplistic, in part because, \"idling would be focused in areas where [GGS] occurrence probability is low.\" AR 27449. But, as discussed above, the Environmental Commitments designed to ensure that idling would be focused in areas where GGS occurrence probability is low are fatally unclear. As a result, the Court finds that the FEIS/R cannot lawfully rely on the Environmental Commitments to avoid evaluating what may otherwise be a substantial adverse effect. As to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment that the FEIS/R's reliance on Environmental Commitments in relation to its analysis of impacts to GGS violates CEQA, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED; the Authority's cross-motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   Plaintiffs raise a separate challenge to the FIES/R's CEQA analysis under\n   <em>\n    Lotus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758032\" index=\"578\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/223/645/#p655\">\n    223 Cal.
