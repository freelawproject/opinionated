Nash was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release for theft of government property. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. Nash argues that the district court plainly erred by imposing (1) three conditions of her supervised release that improperly delegated a judicial function to a probation officer and (2) one condition that was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Although the district court plainly erred in delegating to the probation officer the decision whether Nash should participate in a mental health program, <em>see United States v. Heath, </em>419 F.3d 1312,1315 (11th Cir.2005), the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>court did not err in imposing the remaining two conditions, both of which were specifically recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines. We vacate and remand in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">Nash pleaded guilty to one count of theft of governmental property for fraudulently receiving $41,416 in Social Security benefits. Nash had prior convictions for petit larceny, eight instances of issuing worthless checks, unauthorized use of public assistance, and petit theft. The district court sentenced Nash to eight months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release. The district court also ordered $41,416 in restitution to be paid in monthly installments of not less than $90 per month. Nash did not object to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">The court imposed fourteen standard conditions and four special conditions on Nash\u2019s supervised release. Special Condition One states, \u201cAs deemed necessary by the Probation Officer, the defendant shall participate in mental health counseling, which may include inpatient treatment.\u201d Special Condition Four states, \u201cThe defendant shall secure prior approval from the probation office before opening any checking, credit, or debit account.\u201d Standard Condition Thirteen states, \u201cAs directed by the probation officer, the defendant shall notify third parties of risks that may be occasioned by the defendant\u2019s criminal record or personal history or characteristics and shall permit the probation officer to make such notifications and to confirm the defendant\u2019s compliance with such notification requirement.\u201d Nash appeals these conditions of her supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">We review the terms of a supervised release for abuse of discretion, but where the defendant fails to object at the district court, we reverse only for plain error. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1088 (11th Cir.2003). We review constitutional issues <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for plain error where the defendant fails to object at the district court. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>59 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">Nash argues that Special Condition One, Special Condition Four, and Standard Condition Thirteen of her supervised release are an improper delegation of judicial authority because they do not limit the discretion of the probation officer. Nash also contends that Standard Condition Thirteen is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define when and to whom notice is required. We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">\n<em>A. Whether the District Court Delegated Judicial Functions?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-14\">Nash contends that the district court plainly erred because Special Condition One, Special Condition Four, and Standard Condition Thirteen of her supervised release are improper delegations of judicial function in violation of Article III of the United States Constitution. <em>See </em>U.S. Const., art. III. \u201cTo find reversible error under the plain error standard, we must conclude that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights.\u201d <em>Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1088. If these three criteria are met, we may reverse for plain error if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 730-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-15\">To determine if a court improperly delegated the judicial authority of sentencing, we have drawn a distinction between the delegation to a probation officer of \u201ca ministerial act or support service\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>and \u201cthe ultimate responsibility\u201d of imposing the sentence. <em>See United States v. Bernardine, </em>287 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Heath, </em>419 F.3d at 1315; <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>338 F.3d 1280, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1092. Although \u201c[a] probation officer is an \u2018arm of the court,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bernardine, </em>237 F.3d at 1283 (quoting <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>580 F.2d 177, 178 (5th Cir.1978)), and \u201cis statutorily mandated to \u2018perform any ... duty that the court may designate,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3603(10)), Article III courts may not delegate the \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d of judicial functions to probation officers, <em>id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>48 F.3d 806, 808-09 (4th Cir.1995)). Because probation officers \u201cplay a vital role in effectuating the sentences imposed by district courts,\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>338 F.3d at 1284, courts may delegate duties to probation officers \u201cto support judicial.functions, as long as a judicial officer retains and exercises ultimate responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson, </em>48 F.3d at 808-09). \u201cIndisputably under our constitutional system, the right ... to impose the punishment provided by law, is judicial.\u201d <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. 27, 41-2, 37 S.Ct. 72, 74, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916). \u201c[WJhere the court makes the determination of <em>whether </em>a defendant must abide by a condition, ... it is permissible to delegate to the probation officer the details of where and when the condition will be satisfied.\u201d <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>424 F.3d 876, 880 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">We have upheld conditions of supervised release that unequivocally impose a requirement on the defendant, but subject the defendant to the \u201capproval\u201d or \u201cdirection\u201d of a probation officer. For example, we concluded that the district court did not plainly err by imposing a condition that stated the defendant <em>\u201cshall </em>participate <em>as directed </em>in a program of mental health treatment including a sexual offender treatment program <em>approved by the probation officer.\u201d Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1092 (emphasis added). We also affirmed, under an abuse of discretion standard, a condition of supervised release that required the defendant \u201cto participate in a mental health program ... <em>approved by the probation officer, </em>and abide by the rules, requirements and conditions of the treatment program, including submitting to polygraph testing.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>338 F.3d at 1283 (emphasis added). In both decisions, we noted that the Sentencing Guidelines \u201c \u2018expressly permit[ ]\u2019 the district court to require defendants to \u2018participate in a mental health program approved by the United States Probation Office.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5B1.3(d)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">We also recently- concluded that a district court plainly errs when- it delegates \u201cto the probation officer the authority to decide <em>whether </em>a defendant will participate in a treatment program.\u201d <em>Heath, </em>419 F.3d at 1315 (emphasis added). In <em>Heath, </em>the district court imposed a condition that \u201c[t]he defendant shall participate <em>if and as directed </em>by the probation' office in such mental health programs as recommended by a' psychiatrist or psychologist .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 (emphasis added). We stated that this condition \u201cdelegated to the probation officer not only the administrative supervision of Heath\u2019s participation in the mental health program, but also the authority to make the ultimate decision of whether Heath had to participate at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\"at 1315. Because \u201cimposing a sentence on a defendant is a judicial function\u201d that affected the terms of the sentence and \u201c[a] violation of Article III through the improper delegation of a judicial function\u201d \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d we concluded that the district court had plainly erred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">We apply these principles to the challenged conditions of Nash\u2019s supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>release. Special Condition One of Nash\u2019s supervised release constitutes plain error because it delegates the \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d of sentencing to the probation officer. It states that <em>\u201c[a]s deemed necessary by the Probation Officer, </em>the defendant <em>shall </em>participate in mental health counseling.\u201d \u201c[T]he sentencing guidelines expressly permit the court, and only the court, to impose \u2018a condition requiring that the defendant participate in a mental health program.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5B1.3(d)(5)). Although the condition states that Nash \u201cshall\u201d participate in mental health counseling, this order is subject to the conditional phrase \u201c[a]s deemed necessary by the Probation Officer.\u201d In other words, whether Nash \u201cshall\u201d participate in mental health counseling turns on the judgment of the probation officer, not the court. Like the condition we rejected in <em>Heath, </em>the district court has delegated to the probation officer the \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d of whether Nash must participate in mental health counseling instead of the \u201cministerial function\u201d of how, when, and where the defendant must participate. The district court plainly erred when it imposed Special Condition One. <em>See Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">Special Condition Four and Standard Condition Thirteen, by contrast, impose clear directives on the defendant subject to the administrative supervision of a probation officer. Special Condition Four states, \u201cThe defendant <em>shall </em>secure prior approval from the probation office before opening any checking, credit, or debit account.\u201d Nash is required to seek prior approval of the probation office as a condition of her supervised release; the sentence imposed leaves to the probation officer only the ministerial approval of the accounts Nash may open. Further, the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly recommend \u201ca condition prohibiting the defendant from incurring new credit charges or opening additional lines of credit without approval of the probation officer\u201d where restitution is imposed. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(2); <em>see also Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1092 (finding no plain error where a condition of supervised release was \u201cconsistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d). Special Condition Four mandates the defendant to abide by a condition of supervised release subject only to the administrative \u201capproval\u201d of the probation office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Standard Condition Thirteen likewise does not improperly delegate a judicial function to a probation officer. Nash is obligated to \u201cnotify third parties of risks that may be occasioned by [Nash]\u2019s criminal record or personal history or characteristics\u201d <em>\u201c[a]s directed </em>by the probation officer.\u201d The probation officer may \u201cdirect\u201d when, where, and to whom notice must be given, but may not unilaterally decide whether Nash \u201cshall\u201d do so at all. The language of this condition is also specifically recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines as a term of supervised release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(2). Standard Condition Thirteen directs the probation officer to oversee the enforcement of Nash\u2019s supervised release, but does not relegate the \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d of determining Nash\u2019s sentence to the unfettered discretion of the probation officer. The district court did not plainly err by imposing Special Condition Four and Standard Condition Thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">\n<em>B. Whether Standard Condition Thirteen Is Vague and Overbroad?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">Nash argues that Standard Condition Thirteen is vague and overbroad because it does not state the risks, third parties, or history and characteristics that would otherwise guide a probation officer in the enforcement of this condition. The Sentencing Guidelines permit the court to impose conditions of supervised release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>that are \u201creasonably related\u201d to the sentencing factors, \u201cinvolve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth,\u201d and \u201care consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d); <em>Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1089. Conditions of supervised release are not vague and overbroad when they are \u201cundeniably related\u201d to the sentencing factors. <em>Taylor, </em>338 F.3d at 1285; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The factors that the district court may consider when imposing a sentence include \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); (a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">Standard Condition Number Thirteen is \u201cundeniably related\u201d to Nash\u2019s current conviction, previous convictions, restitution obligation, and the need to protect the public from Nash\u2019s financial fraud. Nash admitted that she fraudulently received Social Security benefits and has prior convictions for check fraud, petit larceny, petit theft, and unauthorized use of public assistance. Nash\u2019s convictions inform the probation officer as to which parties \u201cmay be occasioned\u201d to be harmed by Nash. Nash\u2019s criminal history and restitution obligation direct the probation officer to enforce this condition of her supervised release with a view toward the prevention of future fraud and the fulfillment of her restitution obligations. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). In the light of Nash\u2019s previous and current convictions and the mandated restitution, Standard Condition Number Thirteen is neither vague nor overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">Because the district court plainly erred by imposing Special Condition Number One, we vacate and remand for resentenc-ing. Because Special Condition Number Four and Standard Condition Number Thirteen only delegate ministerial duties to the probation officer and Standard Condition Number Thirteen is not vague or overbroad, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART, AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
