The application is not opposed as to the property of the judgment debtor, if she has any, and a reference is directed accordingly to a master in the county where she resides. The answer, however, appears to contain a full denial of the alledged fraud in the sale to Franklin; and that, in this stage of the cause, is sufficient to prevent the application being granted as to him. So much of the motion, therefore, as seeks the appointment of a receiver of the property assigned or sold to the defendant Franklin, is denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
