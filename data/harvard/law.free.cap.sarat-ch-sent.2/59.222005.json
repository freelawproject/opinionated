The bill stated that the defendant was insolvent and out of the state, and that the mortgage did not contain any power of sale. The chancellor held that in such a case the court has jurisdiction, if the mortgaged premises are worth more than $100, although there is less than $100 due ; upon the ground that there is no other remedy, and there would otherwise he a failure of justice. <em>(See </em>2 <em>Paige, </em>324.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
