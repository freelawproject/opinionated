A jury found him guilty of four counts of committing a lewd act on a child, one count of battery, and eight counts of contacting or communicating with a minor with the intent to commit an enumerated sex offense (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 288.3, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Section 288.3, subdivision (a) reads as follows: \u201cEvery person who contacts or communicates with a minor, or attempts to contact or communicate with a minor, who knows or reasonably should know that the person is a minor, with intent to commit an offense specified in Section 207, 209, 261, 264.1, 273a, 286, 288, 288a, 288.2, 289, 311.1, 311.2, 311.4 or 311.11 involving the minor shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for the term prescribed for an attempt to commit the intended offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Defendant appeals, raising five constitutional challenges to section 288.3 (including one to the proposition that contains the section) and an argument regarding what he believes is a lesser included offense of section 288.3. Finding no merit in these contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">K. was 15 years old at trial. Since the time K. was in sixth grade, defendant had been the boyfriend of K\u2019s mother. They all lived together in an apartment in Carmichael, and K\u2019s grandmother lived a \u201ccouple of doors down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">The first time defendant molested K. was in 2006 when she was 12 and in sixth grade. She and defendant were home alone watching a movie in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>mother\u2019s bed. He started giving K. a \u201cmassage\u201d that began on her back and finished on her \u201cbutt.\u201d She was \u201c[surprised\u201d and went to her bedroom. She was \u201cconfused\u201d and did not tell her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The last time defendant molested K. was in summer 2009 when she was 14 and transitioning between eighth and ninth grade. It was nighttime, and she had fallen asleep on the couch in the living room. She awoke to defendant touching her vagina with his fingers. She told him to \u201c \u2018[s]top\u2019 \u201d and went into her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In between these incidents were several more. Before she turned 14, defendant touched her \u201cbutt\u201d while she was playing \u201cGuitar Hero.\u201d When she was 13 and at her grandmother\u2019s apartment, defendant \u201cgrabbed [her] [buttocks]\u201d while she was \u201cstanding next to [him]\u201d while he was at a computer. Another time at K.\u2019s grandmother\u2019s apartment, defendant \u201cgrabb[ed] [K.\u2019s] butt\u201d when K. was sitting' in his lap while he was on the computer playing \u201c[M]y World of Warcraft.\u201d K. \u201cstood up and turned away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In addition to molesting K., defendant left sexually explicit writings and objects in K.\u2019s bedroom. He left her a book entitled Nervous, which contained numerous passages describing sex acts, along with a note saying, \u201cI like this part.\u201d He left her a vibrator. He left her numerous letters and notes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> K.\u2019s mother found one of these letters and asked her about it. That was the first time K. talked \u201cabout this.\u201d A few days later, K. told her best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>friend. The mother of K.\u2019s best friend eventually called \u201cC.P.S.\u201d (child protective services) after K.\u2019s mother said she \u201cwanted to deal with the situation herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Both K. and defendant were interviewed by police. K. told police about specific instances when defendant had molested her. Defendant told police his involvement with K. was a \u201cmisplaced attraction thing,\u201d owing to \u201cloneliness\u201d because K.\u2019s mother worked nights. He knew what he did was \u201cwrong.\u201d He described specific instances when he had molested K., including one time at her grandmother\u2019s apartment. At the suggestion of police, defendant wrote K. an apology letter. He wrote what he did was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d He was \u201csorry [he] put [K.] in a no win situation and made [her] feel trapped and alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Defendant presented no witnesses at trial. In closing argument, defense counsel conceded defendant\u2019s guilt with respect to two lewd acts (touching of K.\u2019s buttocks while watching the movie and touching her vagina) and all the lining counts with the exception of the one based on the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\n<em>Constitutional Challenges to Section 288.3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Defendant raises five constitutional challenges to section 288.3, including one to the proposition that contains the section. Specifically, he claims (1) section 288.3 unconstitutionally restricts the freedom to travel; (2) section 288.3 is void for vagueness; (3) section 288.3 improperly restricts free speech; (4) section 288.3 violates the equal protection clause; and (5) Proposition 83 that contains section 288.3 violates the single-subject rule. We address each argument in turn, finding merit in none.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">\n<em>Freedom to Travel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Defendant contends section 288.3 is unconstitutional because \u201cit improperly restricts the freedom of movement of any person the state identifies as having a sexual attraction towards children.\u201d According to defendant, this improper restriction comes from the statute\u2019s failure to \u201crequire the intent to commit an immediate sex act.\u201d These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u201c[T]he nature of our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty . . . require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.\u201d <em>(Shapiro v. Thompson </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 618, 629 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 612, 89 S.Ct. 1322].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Section 288.3 does not unconstitutionally restrict the right to travel because it does not \u201cunreasonably burden or restrict . . . movement.\u201d <em>(Shapiro v. Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. at p. 629 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 612].) Rather, it burdens or restricts movement only to the extent that movement is contact or communication with a minor or an attempt to do so with the specific intent to commit an enumerated sex offense. (\u00a7 288.3, subd. (a).) That restriction is reasonable because the statute which contains it is \u201cone of many penal statutes by which \u2018the Legislature has evidenced a long-standing and consistent history of specifically protecting minors from sexual exploitation and predation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hsu </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 976, 988-989 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 184].) That the statute does not require the intent to commit a sex act to be immediate is immaterial. Defendant has pointed to no constitutional requirement requiring the intent be imminent for the contact or communication to be punishable. In addressing a similar type of argument dealing with a challenge to a state \u201chate crime\u201d statute, our Supreme Court rejected an argument that the federal Constitution always requires the threatened harm to be imminent for the threat to be constitutionally punishable. <em>(In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 706, 711 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">For these reasons, defendant\u2019s challenge to section 288.3 as an unreasonable restriction on the freedom to travel lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Defendant contends section 288.3 is void for vagueness because it \u201callows for the personal predilections of law enforcement officials to establish standards for what constitutes \u2018contact with a child\u2019 and how the required intent is shown.\u201d He claims that a glance, wink, or smile could suffice, as could \u201c[w]alking by a child, riding on the same bus with a child, or standing next to a child in a line at the store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The problem with defendant\u2019s examples is they do not address the issue of vagueness. \u201c[T]he mere fact that close cases can be envisioned\u201d does not \u201crender[] a statute vague.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(2008) 553 U.S. 285, 305, 306 [170 L.Ed.2d 650, 670, 128 S.Ct. 1830].) \u201cClose cases can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>imagined under virtually any statute. The problem that poses is addressed, not by the doctrine of vagueness, but by the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>Williams, </em>the Supreme Court rejected a vagueness challenge to a statute criminalizing the pandering and soliciting of child pornography. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>553 U.S. at p. 306 [170 L.Ed.2d at p. 670].) The court explained, \u201cWhat renders a statute vague is not the possibility that it will sometimes be difficult to determine whether the incriminating fact it establishes has been proved; but rather the indeterminacy of precisely what that fact is.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">There is no such indeterminacy here. The statute requires the defendant to contact or communicate with a minor or attempt to do so with the specific intent to commit an enumerated sex offense. (\u00a7 288.3, subd. (a).) Those are questions of fact. Whether a defendant made the contact or communication and had the requisite intent are yes-or-no determinations, not subjective judgments. \u201cTo be sure, it may be difficult in some cases to determine whether these clear requirements have been met. \u2018But courts and juries every day pass upon knowledge, belief and intent\u2014the state of men\u2019s minds\u2014 having before them no more than evidence of their words and conduct, from which, in ordinary human experience, mental condition may be inferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v. Williams, supra, </em>553 U.S. at p. 306 [170 L.Ed.2d at p. 671].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">For these reasons, defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge to section 288.3 lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">\n<em>Free Speech</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Defendant contends section 288.3 improperly restricts free speech. He claims the statute \u201ceffectively prohibits potential child molesters from communicating with children. If a person is sexually attracted towards children, he violates the statute anytime he communicates with a child because he has the intent to molest children if given the opportunity.\u201d Defendant is wrong on his factual assertion and on his legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">His factual assertion\u2014a person who is sexually attracted to children violates section 288.3 anytime he communicates with a child\u2014is not true. The only time the communication is criminal is if it is motivated by a specific intent to commit an enumerated sex crime. (\u00a7 288.3, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">While there is a limit on free speech to the extent that section 288.3 criminalizes otherwise protected communications with a minor, the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>has been written in a way that does not unconstitutionally restrict protected speech. Before the statute is violated, the defendant must know or reasonably should have known the other person was a minor, have the specific intent to commit an enumerated sex offense, and then contact or communicate with that minor or attempt to do so. (\u00a7 288.3, subd. (a).) Thus, without the unlawful sexual intent, the statute is not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In this way, it is similar to another statute aimed at protecting minors from sexual exploitation, section 288.2, which prohibits distributing or exhibiting \u201charmful matter\u201d to a minor, including by the Internet. Section 288.2 has been upheld in the face of a First Amendment challenge. <em>(People v. Hsu, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pp. 988-989.) There, too, while there was a limitation on sending otherwise protected material, there was no constitutional problem with the statute because those limits were \u201con the conduct of those who would use otherwise protected speech to seduce minors.\u201d <em>(Hsu, </em>at p. 989.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Defendant contends section 288.3 violates the equal protection clause because it \u201csingles out potential child molesters to impose upon them what is basically a thought crime,\u201d while not criminalizing potential thieves or muggers who \u201cintend[] to commit a future theft or future assault.\u201d Again, defendant is wrong on his factual assertion and on his legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">His factual assertion is wrong because section 288.3 does not create a thought crime. It requires the act of contacting or communicating with a minor or an attempt to do so coupled with the specific intent to commit an enumerated sex crime. (\u00a7 288.3, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">His legal assertion is fundamentally wrong because a person who violates section 288.3 is not similarly situated to a potential thief or mugger. \u201cThe constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the laws means simply that persons similarly situated with respect to the purpose of the law must be similarly treated under the law. [Citations.] If persons are not similarly situated for purposes of the law, an equal protection claim fails at the threshold.\u201d <em>(People v. Buffington </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1155 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 696].) Those who violate section 288.3 are not similarly situated to those who are thinking about committing a theft or assault. Those who violate section 288.3 have communicated or contacted a minor or attempted to do so with the specific intent to commit an enumerated sex crime. The others identified by defendant have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>Single-subject Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Defendant contends Proposition 83, which contains section 288.3, violates the California Constitution\u2019s single-subject rule, which states, \u201c[a]n initiative measure embracing more than one subject may not be submitted to the electors or have any effect.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 8, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">An initiative measure does not violate the single-subject rule if its various provisions are \u201c \u2018 \u201creasonably related to a common theme or purpose.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Manduley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 537, 575 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 168, 41 P.3d 3].) In <em>Manduley, </em>the California Supreme Court considered a claim that Proposition 21, titled the Gang Violence and Juvenile Crime Prevention Act of 1998, violated the single subject rule. <em>(Manduley, </em>at pp. 544-546.) As described by the court, Proposition 21 addressed three subjects: gang violence, the sentencing of repeat offenders, and juvenile crime. <em>(Manduley, </em>at p. 575.) The petitioners argued each subject was \u201cdistinct and unrelated to one another\u201d and \u201calthough the subjects addressed by Proposition 21 might be related to the general goal of reducing crime, such a goal is too broad to satisfy the requirements of the single-subject rule.\u201d <em>(Manduley, </em>at p. 575.) The court disagreed, finding that \u201cthe purpose of the measure is narrower than that identified by petitioners. The general object of the initiative is to address the problem of violent crime committed by juveniles and gangs\u2014not simply to reduce crime generally.\u201d <em>(Manduley, </em>at pp. 575-576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Here, the provisions of Proposition 83 were summarized for voters as follows: (1) \u201cIncreases penalties for violent and habitual sex offenders and child molesters\u201d; (2) \u201cProhibits registered sex offenders from residing within 2,000 feet of any school or park\u201d; (3) \u201cRequires lifetime Global Positioning System monitoring of felony registered sex offenders\u201d; (4) \u201cExpands definition of a sexually violent predator\u201d; and (5) \u201cChanges current two-year involuntary civil commitment for a sexually violent predator . . . and subsequent ability of sexually violent predator to petition court for sexually violent predator\u2019s conditional release or unconditional discharge.\u201d (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) official title and summary of Prop. 83, p. 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">From this summary, the common purpose of the provisions of Proposition 83 is to protect Californians from the threat posed by sex offenders. The proposition accomplishes this by increasing penalties for certain sex offenders, prohibiting registered sex offenders from living close to schools or parks, tracking their whereabouts, and expanding the reach of the sexually violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>predator law. Proposition 83\u2019s purpose is no broader than that of Proposition 21. In fact, Proposition 83\u2019s purpose is narrower in that it addresses one problem instead of two interrelated ones. For these reasons, defendant\u2019s challenge to Proposition 83 based on the single-subject rule lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>Section 288.4 Is Not a Lesser Included Offense of Section</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\n<em>288.3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Defendant contends the court should have instructed the jury the crime of arranging a meeting with a minor for the purpose of engaging in lewd and lascivious behavior (\u00a7 288.4, subd. (a))<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was a lesser included offense of contacting a minor with the intent of committing a lewd act (\u00a7 288.3, subd. (a)). Defendant is wrong because section 288.4 is not a lesser included offense of section 288.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">One of the tests used to determine whether a lesser offense is necessarily included in the charged offense is the elements test. <em>(People v. Hamlin </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1456 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 402].) The elements test is satisfied if the greater offense cannot be committed without also necessarily committing the lesser offense. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Here, defendant contends the elements test is satisfied because the two crimes share \u201cremarkably similar elements.\u201d That is not the test. Rather, as we have just stated, the test is whether the greater offense cannot be committed without also necessarily committing the lesser offense. Here, the greater offense (\u00a7 288.3) <em>can </em>be committed without committing the lesser offense (\u00a7 288.4). Section 288.4 requires the element of \u201carrang[ing] a meeting\u201d while section 288.3 does not. So, although as a factual matter, the crime of luring a minor (\u00a7 288.3) may be carried out by arranging a meeting with that minor (\u00a7 288.4), it is possible to commit the crime of luring a minor without arranging a meeting with that minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">HI-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Nicholson, Acting P.
