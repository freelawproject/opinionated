Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1790, 1793.2, subd. (d)(2); the Act), arising out of Joyce\u2019s purchase of a new 2005 Ford F-250 truck.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ford moved for nonsuit at the close of Joyce\u2019s case-in-chief arguing that the truck fell outside the Act\u2019s protection because it was bought or used primarily for business purposes and had a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds. Following a jury verdict in Joyce\u2019s favor, the trial court granted the motion and entered judgment in favor of Ford. The trial court also granted Ford\u2019s motion for directed verdict on the issue of civil penalties (\u00a7 1794, subd. (c)), made following Ford\u2019s case-in-chief, which removed this issue from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">On appeal, Joyce challenges both of these rulings. With respect to the motion for nonsuit, he argues (1) Ford\u2019s admission that the F-250 was a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act conclusively established the matter against Ford; (2) Ford did not properly disclose this as a potential defense in response to Joyce\u2019s discovery requests; and (3) sufficient evidence establishes that the F-250 qualifies as a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2). With respect to the directed verdict motion, Joyce argues that substantial evidence supports a finding that Ford\u2019s failure to comply with the Act was \u201cwillful\u201d within the meaning of section 1794, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">We conclude that the truck qualifies as a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act. We also conclude that Joyce submitted sufficient evidence of willful conduct to allow the jury to decide whether or not to award civil penalties. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to reinstate the jury verdict and hold a new trial limited to the issue of civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">In September 2005, Joyce bought a new Ford F-250 truck from Coming Ford Mercury Kia for $35,323.87. The track had a three-year, 36,000-mile warranty. Joyce, a licensed contractor, had his own excavation business and bought the track to serve as his \u201cwork truck.\u201d The track weighed 6,787 pounds and had a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds. Before the truck was delivered to Joyce, Coming Ford replaced a vacuum pump on the air-conditioning system to stop air from flowing out of the wrong vents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">In January 2006, Joyce received an emissions recall notice from Ford explaining that his new track \u201cmay be releasing air pollutants which exceed California standards.\u201d The notice directed Joyce to return to the dealer to have the engine and transmission control modules reprogrammed with the latest software to enhance the performance of the fuel injection and onboard diagnostic systems, and to have the exhaust pressure sensor replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">The next month, Joyce brought the track to another dealer, Novato Ford, for the recall service. Joyce was also concerned that his seatbelt would \u201clock up\u201d when he tried to lean forward, the light under the hood appeared to have a short, and some screws had fallen out of the tailgate. Novato Ford performed the recall service, ordered a hood light switch and seatbelt retractor, and scheduled another service appointment to have these components replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">Following the recall service, Joyce immediately noticed a difference in the track\u2019s performance. As he explained: \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like the same truck. I hadn\u2019t had it that long, but I knew something wasn\u2019t right. ... I would step on the gas, and there wasn\u2019t any real response.\u201d When Joyce called Novato Ford to complain, he was advised to wait until his next service appointment, and if the problem persisted, they would address it then.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">About three weeks later, Novato Ford replaced the hood light switch and seatbelt retractor. The Ford emblem was also replaced. During the service appointment, Joyce told the technician about the track\u2019s lack of power and acceleration. The technician explained that the reprogramming done to address the recall should not have affected the track\u2019s performance. No other repairs were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">In March 2006, Joyce returned to Novato Ford with the same complaints. In the meantime, he had taken his family on a road trip to Southern California, and as he tried to pass another vehicle while climbing over the Tej\u00f3n Pass, \u201cthe engine completely lost all the horsepower.\u201d Afraid that he was about to cause an accident, Joyce stepped on the gas pedal a couple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>times, which caused the horsepower to return. However, throughout the trip, the truck remained \u201ctotally sluggish.\u201d As Joyce explained the situation to the service department at Novato Ford: \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with my truck. I don\u2019t know what it is-. Now my engine is cutting out. I don\u2019t have any\u2014I don\u2019t have the acceleration. I don\u2019t have the horsepower. I don\u2019t have the torque. . . . Something\u2019s wrong. And now the engine is cutting out on me.\u201d Joyce also complained of a \u201cpopping\u201d noise that sounded like \u201cminiature backfires\u201d coming from under the hood. Novato Ford replaced the VGT (variable geometry turbocharger) sensor, which did not remedy the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">A short time later, Joyce returned to Novato Ford. Instead of scheduling an appointment, Joyce went straight to the service technician who had replaced the VGT sensor, Mark Fox, and explained that the problems persisted. Fox did not have an answer, but advised Joyce to bring the truck in immediately after he experienced the loss of power. A couple weeks later, Joyce returned with the same complaints. This time, Fox took the truck for a test drive, concluded that the turbocharger needed to be replaced, and told Joyce to schedule an appointment. These unscheduled meetings with Fox were not documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">In June 2006, Novato Ford replaced the turbocharger. This repair fixed the problem Joyce described as the engine \u201cgo[ing] completely flat,\u201d but the problems with horsepower and acceleration continued. Following the replacement, Joyce noticed an oil leak and brought the truck back to Novato Ford. Again, instead of scheduling an appointment, Joyce went straight to Fox, who assured him that the leak was \u201cno big deal,\u201d but that he would fix it the next time the truck was there for a scheduled appointment. Joyce also told Fox that he continued to experience hesitation with respect to the truck\u2019s acceleration. Fox scanned the truck with his computer, but found nothing wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">About a month later, Joyce brought the truck in for another unscheduled visit with Fox. Fox again scanned the truck with his computer. But this time, he found and performed two updates on the vehicle. After these updates, the truck \u201cran a little bit better\u201d and regained some of its horsepower. Joyce returned about four months later because the updates did not fix the hesitation problem. Fox was unable to locate any updates to perform on the truck. These unscheduled meetings with Fox also went undocumented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">In May 2007, Joyce returned to Novato Ford, this time because the truck\u2019s \u201ccheck engine\u201d light was on. He scheduled an appointment and informed the service advisor that he was still experiencing the hesitation problem and also wanted to have the oil leaks fixed. Novato Ford performed an update on the PCM module (powertrain control module), which caused the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light to go out, but did nothing to address Joyce\u2019s other concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>In February 2008, Joyce brought his truck to Novato Ford and complained that his limited slip differential was not working. A limited slip differential \u201cessentially helps provide traction when one wheel starts to spin or take off.\u201d Joyce first noticed a problem with the differential when he was trying to drive up a fire road on his way to a jobsite and the truck became stuck in the mud. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts to drive out of the mud, Joyce engaged the truck\u2019s four-wheel drive and was able to reach the jobsite. He did not think much of the situation until the owner of the company who had hired him arrived at the jobsite in a Porsche. According to Joyce, between this incident and the February 2008 service appointment, he brought the truck to Novato Ford \u201c[a]t least a dozen\u201d times. But because he neither scheduled an appointment nor talked to a service advisor, these visits also went undocumented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">During the service appointment, the technicians performed a series of tests and found nothing wrong with the differential. The service manager, Joe Galileo, then e-mailed Ford\u2019s field service engineer, who referred him to the technical hotline. Following this phone call, the technicians performed another test on the truck, which also revealed no problems with the differential. Not satisfied, Joyce returned home and performed his own test on the truck, placing a block under the axle so that one rear tire was on the ground and the other rear tire was an inch off of the ground. When he tried to drive off of the block, the elevated tire simply spun while the other tire remained motionless. Joyce then returned to Novato Ford and convinced Galileo to perform the same test. After making some phone calls and consulting the shop manual, the technicians were able to get the truck to drive off of the block by briefly engaging the parking brake. Galileo then explained to Joyce that according to the shop manual, when the vehicle is on an \u201cexcessively slippery surface,\u201d slight application of the parking brake would help the clutches within the differential to engage, which would enable him to get out of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">Still not satisfied, Joyce called Ford\u2019s customer service number and complained about the differential and Novato Ford\u2019s handling of the situation. After a 40-minute conversation, the voice on the other end of the line explained that there was nothing he could do for Joyce, except register the complaint with Ford. At this point, Joyce threatened to file a lawsuit if Ford refused to repair his vehicle and stated: \u201cYou guys either fix it or give me my money back.\u201d The record of this phone call lists the issue as closed and states that Ford agreed with Novato Ford\u2019s conclusion that the differential worked properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">\n<em>The Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">In May 2008, Joyce filed this lawsuit against Ford. As already indicated, Joyce alleged that Ford violated section 1793.2, subdivision (d)(2), by failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>to either replace his F-250 truck or make restitution following Ford\u2019s inability to repair the vehicle to conform to the express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts. The matter was twice tried before a jury. In the first trial, the jury rendered a verdict for Joyce in the amount of $510,000 ($210,000 in actual damages, plus $300,000 in civil penalties). Because the jury improperly awarded $175,000 in actual damages based on its estimation of the hourly rate charged by Joyce\u2019s attorneys, the trial court ordered a new trial on both liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">The facts adduced during the second trial are those described above, with the following additions. During trial, Joyce\u2019s expert testified that his inspection of the vehicle revealed significant hesitation with respect to acceleration, the transmission did not work properly, the limited slip differential was defective, and the vehicle had some oil leaks. Ford\u2019s expert testified that the vehicle experienced a normal amount of \u201cturbo lag,\u201d which he described as a brief \u201clag time\u201d before the engine \u201cramps up,\u201d but explained that this is common to all diesel engines. He found no abnormal hesitation with respect to acceleration, no transmission shifting errors, and no problems with the limited slip differential. He also found that the truck had \u201cplenty of power\u201d and \u201coperated fine.\u201d Ford\u2019s expert did confirm the oil leaks, but testified that these leaks were repairable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">Ford moved for nonsuit at the close of Joyce\u2019s case-in-chief, arguing that the truck was not a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2), and therefore fell outside the protection of the Act\u2019s refund-or-replace provision. (\u00a7 1793.2, subd. (d)(2).) This was so, argued Ford, because the truck was bought or used primarily for business purposes and had a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds. Joyce responded by arguing that Ford admitted, in response to a pretrial request for admissions, that the truck was a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act, that Ford did not properly disclose this as a potential defense in response to Joyce\u2019s discovery requests, and that substantial evidence supported a jury finding that the truck qualified as a \u201cnew motor vehicle,\u201d either because it was \u201cbought or used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes,\u201d or because it was \u201cbought or used primarily for business purposes\u201d and had \u201ca gross vehicle weight under 10,000 pounds.\u201d (\u00a7 1793.22, subd. (e)(2).) The trial court deferred ruling on the motion and allowed Ford to go ahead with its defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">At the close of the defense case-in-chief, Ford moved for a directed verdict on the issue of civil penalties under section 1794, subdivision (c), arguing that Joyce presented no substantial evidence to support a jury finding that Ford willfully violated the refund-or-replace provision. Specifically, Ford argued that there was \u201cno evidence of sufficient substantiality to show . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>that Ford was other than reasonable and in good faith in believing that the truck had been repaired to match the Ford warranty after reasonable opportunities to repair.\u201d In response, Joyce argued that the jury could reasonably conclude Ford\u2019s violation of the refund-or-replace provision was willful because he personally informed Ford about the problems with the differential, threatened to file a lawsuit if Ford did not repair the truck, and Ford had access to the vehicle\u2019s warranty history, which would have revealed the other problems he had with the truck. The trial court granted the directed verdict motion, stating; \u201cAs I see the evidence, if there is a defect or defective vehicle claim proven in this case, it wasn\u2019t because Ford intentionally failed to try to do something. It would be incompetence, not intentional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">The jury returned a verdict in Joyce\u2019s favor in the amount of $35,323.87. The trial court then granted the motion for nonsuit and entered judgment in favor of Ford, ruling as a matter of law that the truck was not a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">\n<em>Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-8\">Enacted in 1970, the Act \u201cregulates warranty terms, imposes service and repair obligations on manufacturers, distributors, and retailers who make express warranties, requires disclosure of specified information in express warranties, and broadens a buyer\u2019s remedies to include costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and civil penalties. [Citations.] It supplements, rather than supersedes, the provisions of the California Uniform Commercial Code. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Kriegerv. Nick Alexander Imports, Inc. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 205, 213 [285 Cal.Rptr. 717]; <em>see Park City Services, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., Inc. </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 295, 301-302 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 373]; Stats. 1970, ch. 1333, \u00a7 1, p. 2478.) \u201c[T]he Act is manifestly a remedial measure, intended for the protection of the consumer; it should be given a construction calculated to bring its benefits into action.\u201d <em>(Kwan v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 184 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">The refund-or-replace provision states in relevant part: \u201cIf the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle, as that term is defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 1793.22, to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>motor vehicle in accordance with subparagraph (A)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] or promptly make restitution to the buyer in accordance with subparagraph (B).[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] However, the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement, and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.\u201d (\u00a7 1793.2, subd. (d)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">Section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2), defines \u201cnew motor vehicle.\u201d As relevant here, it provides: \u201c \u2018New motor vehicle\u2019 means a new motor vehicle that is bought or used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. \u2018New motor vehicle\u2019 also means a new motor vehicle with a <em>gross vehicle weight </em>under 10,000 pounds that is bought or used primarily for business purposes by a person, including a partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or any other legal entity, to which not more than five motor vehicles are registered in this state.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">Section 1794 governs civil actions under the Act and provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any buyer of consumer goods who is damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under this chapter or under an implied or express warranty or service contract may bring an action for the recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief. [][] (b) The measure of the buyer\u2019s damages in an action under this section shall include the rights of replacement or reimbursement as set forth in subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2 .... HD . . . [f] (c) If the buyer establishes that the failure to comply was willful, the judgment may include, in addition to the amounts recovered under subdivision (a), a civil penalty which shall not exceed two times the amount of actual damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">Thus, if Joyce\u2019s F-250.was a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and Ford was unable to service or repair the truck to conform to the express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts, then Joyce was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>entitled to replacement of the vehicle or restitution of the purchase price, along with consequential and incidental damages. And if Ford\u2019s violation of the statute was willful, then Joyce was also entitled to civil penalties. With this overview in mind, we turn to Joyce\u2019s contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">\n<em>Grant of Nonsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">Joyce contends that the trial court improperly granted Ford\u2019s motion for nonsuit because (1) Ford\u2019s admission that the F-250 was a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act conclusively established the matter against Ford, (2) Ford did not properly disclose this as a potential defense in response to Joyce\u2019s discovery requests, and (3) sufficient evidence establishes that the truck qualifies as a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act. We conclude, based on Ford\u2019s admission and undisputed evidence, that the truck qualifies as a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-7\">\u201cA nonsuit is proper only if there is no substantial evidence to support a jury verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. In determining whether the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is sufficient, the court may not weigh the evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses. The evidence favorable to the plaintiff must be accepted as true and any conflicting evidence disregarded. If facts sufficient to support a verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor may logically and reasonably be inferred from the evidence, the motion must be denied even if the evidence is also susceptible to conflicting inferences. Nonsuit may be granted only if there is no substantial evidence upon which reasonable minds could differ. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hoch v.

Accordingly, the matter is conclusively established against Ford. This is so regardless of the fact that Ford prefaced its responses to the request for admissions with a general objection that it had not \u201ccompleted its investigation of the facts,\u201d and that the responses were prepared \u201con the basis of information presently available to and located by [Ford] upon reasonable investigation.\u201d If Ford lacked sufficient information or knowledge to admit or deny whether the truck qualified as a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d under the Act, then it should have stated as much in response to that specific request for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 2033.210, 2033.220.) Ford cites no authority, nor have we found any, establishing that an unqualified \u201cAdmit\u201d given in response to a specific admission request can be negated by prefacing the entire document with a general disclaimer that the investigation was ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">Nor was Joyce required to seek an order compelling further responses to his request for admissions. He received the response he was looking for: \u201cAdmit.\u201d Indeed, it was Ford that should have moved the trial court to allow it to withdraw or amend this response prior to moving for nonsuit on a matter conclusively established against it. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 2033.300, 2033.410.) Such a motion would have been granted as long as the trial court determined that Ford\u2019s mistake in admitting the matter was not clearly inexcusable and withdrawal would not substantially prejudice Joyce.

However, as we explain immediately below, even if Ford had properly withdrawn its admission prior to moving for nonsuit, this would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>altered the undisputed evidence establishing the truck to be a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">\n<em>Undisputed Evidence the F-250 Is a \u201cNew Motor Vehicle \u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">As a preliminary matter, we agree with Ford that Joyce provided no substantial evidence the truck was \u201cbought or used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d Despite the fact that someone checked this box on the installment sale contract, Joyce\u2019s own testimony established beyond any legitimate dispute that the truck was \u201cbought or used primarily for business purposes.\u201d (\u00a7 1793.22, subd. (e)(2).) Indeed, when Ford\u2019s trial counsel asked whether he bought the truck \u201cfor business use,\u201d Joyce responded: \u201cYes.\u201d Joyce also repeatedly referred to the vehicle as his \u201cwork truck\u201d and explained that he bought the truck because he \u201cwanted something [he] could count on for work.\u201d Accordingly, in order for the truck to qualify as a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act, it must have a \u201cgross vehicle weight under 10,000 pounds.\u201d (\u00a7 1793.22, subd. (e)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">Ford does not dispute that the F-250 actually weighs less than 10,000 pounds. The invoice states that the truck\u2019s shipping weight was 6,787 pounds. Joyce added a diesel fuel tank to the back of the truck, which weighed about 700 pounds when full. Joyce also added a rack to hold pipe, an isolator to provide an additional power source, and a back-up camera. However, Ford does not contend that these additions brought the vehicle\u2019s weight to 10,000 pounds. Instead, Ford argues that when the Legislature drafted section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2), the phrase \u201cgross vehicle weight\u201d was intended to mean \u201cgross vehicle weight rating.\u201d And because the F-250 had a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds, it does not qualify as a \u201cnew motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the Act. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">Issues of statutory interpretation are questions of law subject to de novo review. <em>(Coburn v. Sievert </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1492 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 596].) \u201cOur fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose. We first examine the statutory language, giving it a plain and commonsense meaning. We do not examine that language in isolation, but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment. If the language is clear, courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the Legislature did not intend. If the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation, courts may consider other aids, such as the statute\u2019s purpose, legislative history, and public policy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Coalition of Concerned Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 733, 737 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 676, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>101 P.3d 563]; see <em>San Leandro Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of San Leandro Unified School Dist. </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 822, 831 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 164, 209 P.3d 73]; <em>Park City Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., Inc., supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at pp. 305-306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">We agree with Joyce that the phrase \u201cgross vehicle weight\u201d is clear and unambiguous. To determine the plain meaning of statutory language, courts often look to dictionaries. <em>(People ex rel. Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 302 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042]; <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Poway Unified School Dist. </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 567, 592 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 285].) Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition, defines the word \u201cweight\u201d to mean \u201cthe amount that a thing weighs.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet. (11th ed. 2006) p. 1419, col. 1.) This dictionary also defines \u201cgross\u201d to mean \u201coverall total exclusive of deductions.\u201d <em>(Merriam-Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at p. 513, col. 2.)  Accordingly, the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cgross vehicle weight\u201d is the overall total amount that the vehicle weighs. And there is no dispute that the F-250 in this case weighs less than 10,000 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">Despite the plain meaning, Ford would have us read the word \u201crating\u201d into the statute. According to Ford, because \u201c \u2018gross vehicle weight\u2019 is not defined in the statute or universally applied,\u201d we must refer to the legislative history,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which \u201cclearly shows that \u2018gross vehicle weight\u2019 was understood to mean the vehicle\u2019s \u2018weight rating.\u2019 \u201d However, as the F-250\u2019s owner\u2019s manual states, the \u201cGVW (Gross Vehicle Weight)\u201d means \u201cthe Vehicle Curb Weight + cargo + passengers.\u201d The owner\u2019s manual also defines the \u201cGVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating)\u201d to mean \u201cthe maximum allowable weight of the fully loaded vehicle (including all options, equipment, passengers and cargo).\u201d Thus, Ford understood there to be a difference between a vehicle\u2019s gross vehicle weight and gross vehicle weight rating. This understanding was shared by other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>manufacturers in the industry. Indeed, other truck manufacturers do not use the term \u201cGVW (Gross Vehicle Weight)\u201d to describe the maximum allowable weight of the vehicle, as Ford would have us read into the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also, the federal Department of Transportation defines \u201c[t]he terms \u2018GVWR\u2019 and \u2018GVW\u2019 [to] refer to the manufacturer\u2019s gross vehicle weight rating and the actual gross vehicle weight, respectively\u201d in its safety regulations relating to brake performance. (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 393.52(e) (2010).) This undercuts Ford\u2019s assertion that the term \u201cgross vehicle weight\u201d is not universally understood or applied in the industry. It is. And it does not mean \u201cgross vehicle weight rating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">Nor does the legislative history reveal that the Legislature intended the phrase \u201cgross vehicle weight\u201d to mean \u201cgross vehicle weight rating.\u201d Ford relies on the Governor\u2019s press release announcing his signing of Senate Bill 1718 and a revised enrolled bill report drafted by the State and Consumer Services Agency. Each of these documents states that the bill \u201cexpands Lemon Law protections to those vehicles with a <em>manufacturer\u2019s weight rating </em>of less than 10,000 pounds.\u201d (Governor\u2019s Press Release (Sept. 26, 2000); State and Consumer Services Agency, Rev. Enrolled Bill Rep. on Senate Bill 1718 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) prepared for Governor Davis (Sept. 13, 2000) p. 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">While we are bound to take judicial notice of the enrolled bill report (see <em>Eisner v. Uveges </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 915, 934, fn. 19 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 102 P.3d 915]), we do so with the understanding that \u201cenrolled bill reports cannot reflect the intent of the Legislature because they are prepared by the executive branch, and then not until after the bill has passed the Legislature and has become \u2018enrolled.\u2019 Moreover, to permit consideration of enrolled bill reports as cognizable legislative history gives the executive branch an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>unwarranted opportunity to determine the meaning of statutes. That is the proper and exclusive duty of the judicial branch of government.\u201d <em>(Kaufman &amp; Broad Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Performance Plastering, Inc. </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 42 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 520].) We also take judicial notice of the Governor\u2019s press release. (See <em>People v. Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, 520 [156 Cal.Rptr. 450, 596 P.2d 328]; contra, <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1535, 1554, fn. 16 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 166].) However, while we do so, we similarly conclude that this announcement cannot reflect the intent of the Legislature, and is therefore not cognizable legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">The actual legislative history cuts against Ford\u2019s position that the Legislature meant \u201cweight rating\u201d when it used the word \u201cweight.\u201d The third reading analysis states that the bill, as amended August 25, 2000, was intended to bring \u201cwithin the scope of the lemon law new motor vehicles bought or used primarily for business purposes <em>weighing </em>less than 10,000 pounds.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Consumer Protection, 3d reading analysis of Senate Bill 1718 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 25, 2000, p. 1, italics added.) The Senate Rules Committee\u2019s analysis of the bill confirms that the bill, as amended August 30, 2000, \u201crevises the definition of a new motor vehicle to include only a new motor vehicle with a gross <em>vehicle weight </em>under 10,000 pounds bought or used primarily for business purposes, as specified.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Unfinished Business Analysis of Senate Bill 1718 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 30, 2000, p. 1, italics added; see also Sen.

We have found no committee report or bill analysis informing the legislators who voted on the bill that \u201cgross vehicle weight\u201d meant the maximum allowable weight of the vehicle as opposed to the actual weight of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">Because there is no dispute that the truck actually weighed less than 10,000 pounds, the trial court erred in granting Ford\u2019s motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\"><em>Directed </em>Verdict<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to reinstate the jury verdict and hold a new trial limited to the issue of civil penalties.
