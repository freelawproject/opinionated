Before the grand jurors were sworn in the defendant by counsel appeared and filed a paper objecting to such individuals, collectively and severally, as grand jurors, and moved to 'set aside and discharge the entire number because each and every one had been obtained pursuant to the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881 (which was claimed to be unconstitutional and void), and not in the manner prescribed by the Revised Statutes. It was thereupon consented by both parties that the motion should stand over without prejudice to defendant\u2019s rights or to the right and duty of the court; that if an indictment should be found the objections should be considered and determined with the same force and effect as if decided prior to the organization of the grand jury. The grand jury then organized and found an indictment against defendant. About three months after an order was made in the oyer and terminer, that as to said defendant the body impanneled as a grand jury be set aside and discharged as of the date of the first presentation of the objections; that the said indictment be not received and stand as quashed; that nothing in the order was to affect the action of said grand jurors as to persons not having made such objection. On appeal from such order:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-5\"><em>Held, first, </em>that it was improper to quash or set aside the panel as to defendant, and yet in effect hold it good as to all other persons charged with crime who omitted to interpose objections, inasmuch as the objections raised a question of jurisdiction. If the panel was without jurisdiction as to defendant\u2019s case, it was equally without jurisdiction as to all others similarly charged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-6\"><em>Second. </em>The objections urged in defendant\u2019s behalf, <em>i. e., </em>that the grand jury was drawn from names selected under an unconstitutional law, cannot be maintained by \"one charged with a criminal offense, further than to see that the action or proceeding, challenged as irregular and void, was taken under the color of lawful authority; and it would not alter the case even if such action involved some proceeding of an officer or of officers taken under an unconstitutional law. The court would still retain their jurisdiction over the matter and the proceedings.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-7\"><em>Third. </em>An indictment found by a body drawn, summoned and sworn as a grand jury before a competent court and composed of good and lawful men fulfill this constitutional guaranty. A jury so framed is a <em>defacto </em>jury because selected and organized under the forms of law. A defect in its constitution owing to the invalidity of a law under which a panel is drawn affects no substantial right of one charged with crime, and herein an objection based thereon is not available to him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-8\"><em>Fourth. </em>An indictment found by a grand jury of good and lawful men selected and drawn under color of law is a good indictment by a grand jury within the sense of the constitution, although the law under which the selection was made is void <em>(Reversing S.

The defendant could not raise the constitutional questions set forth in the paper filed by him, and stated in his objections to the grand jury, for the reason that no rights of his were involved. The manner in which the jurors were selected is something to which the defendant cannot take exception; it is something in which he has no interest. The only thing that the law guarantees him against is that an indictment shall not be found against him by his prosecutors or by the witnesses against him <em>(Friery </em>agt. People, 2 <em>Keyes, </em>425; <em>also Cox </em>agt. People, 19 <em>Hun, </em>430; <em>Carpenter </em>agt. <em>People, </em>64 <em>N. Y., </em>483; <em>Pierson </em>agt. <em>People, </em>79 <em>N. Y., </em>424-431). The manner in which the jury was selected and drawn was something in which the defendant had no interest; no rights of his were involved. * * * The defect in its constitution (the grand .jury), \u201c owing ,to the invalidity of the law of 1881, affected no substantial right of the defendant \u201d <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Petrea, </em>65 <em>Hun, </em>59). The court will not listen to an objection made to the unconstitutionality of an act by a party whose rights it does not affect, and who, therefore, has no interest in defeating it <em>(Cooley's Const. Lim., </em>163). A question of constitutionality can be raised only by those injuriously affected <em>(Pierpont </em>agt. <em>Loveless, </em>72 <em>N. Y., </em>211-216; <em>Wellington's </em>Petition, 16 <em>Pick., </em>87; <em>Commonwealth </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>42 <em>Am. R., </em>203; 3 <em>R. S.

The objection of the people in the court below to the consideration by the court of the paper filed, to the objections therein set forth, and the motion based thereon, as being unknown to the law and contrary to the rules provided by the Code of Criminal Procedure, should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>sustained. The whole proceeding in the \"court below, both by court and the defendant, was not only unwarranted by, but contrary to the law of the state. The proceedings that may be taken by a defendant at the organization of the grand jury are set forth in sections 237 and 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; and section 238 forbids a challenge to the panel or array. The objections made here constituted a challenge to the array <em>(People </em>agt. Petrea,, 64 <em>How. </em>169, <em>opinion by </em>Bocees, <em>J.). \u201c </em>The Code, by defining the causes for which the indictment may be set aside, must, by the general rule of construction, be held to exclude the entertaining of the motion for other causes than those specified <em>(People </em>agt. Petrea, 64 <em>How., </em>169). And again: \u201cWe think the objection to the grand jury was not one. which by the new procedure the defendant could take after indictment, and as it involved no constitutional right that it was properly overruled \u201d <em>{People </em>agt. <em>Harvey, </em>1 <em>N. Y. Crim. R., </em>285, 286).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">III. The court below, in its struggle to dispose of the grand jury, finally claims to do it under subdivision 1 of section 238 of the Code. A moment\u2019s consideration will convince anyone that that is a mere pretense to show that the Code permits such practice. The whole claim of defendant\u2019s counsel, and the argument of the learned judge to sustain his action, is that the law does not and cannot permit a grand jury to be drawn from any other source than the grand jury box. Yet here is an open confession that the Code permits, by strong implication at least, a grand jury to be drawn from some other place than the grand jury box of the county. That is the logical and necessary result of the learned justice\u2019s construction of subdivision 1 of section 238. No one does, no one can believe that that is the proper construction. It refers to the number of jurors drawn, not the place they are drawn from. The law contemplates no other place than the grand jury box. Now, the provision of the Code under which the court claimed to act is, \u201c the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>may, * * * discharge the panel and order another to be summoned,\u201d because; 1st. That the requisite number of ballots \u201c was not drawn from the grand jury box of the county.\u201d This is a matter for tiie court entirely. It is not a matter for the defendant to raise or of which he can take advantage. \u201c2d. It contemplates the <em>actual </em>discharge of the panel and the summoning of another in place of it.\u201d Now, the order is that as to these particular cases the grand jury be deemed set aside and discharged, but as to those cases where no objection has been filed the\" grand jury stands. Such a proceeding is' not a discharge of the grand jury. The grand jury cannot be discharged as to one case and held as to another. As a matter of fact and of law both, the grand jury finding this indictment was never discharged. It could not be discharged in one case and not as to another. The indictment found by it was a valid indictment. The order setting it aside should be reversed, and the defendant directed to plead.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-5\"><em>Reilly &amp; </em>Hamilton, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">I. The court has jurisdiction to discharge a panel before indictment, and to allow defendant\u2019s objections to the array before impannelment <em>(Code of Crim. Pro., sec. </em>238). The power to discharge the panel, where - the requisite number of ballots was not drawn from the grand jury box of the county, is expressly conferred by this section, if exercised before indictment <em>(People </em>agt. Petrea, 1 <em>Cr. Rep., </em>244). The prohibition of a \u201c challenge to the panel or array <em>of </em>the grand jury,\u201d does not prevent objections before inapannelment. There is no grand jury <em>defacto </em>or <em>de'jtire, </em>until the body is sworn as such <em>[Code Grim. Pro., sec. </em>223; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Petrea, supra), </em>consequently, before that event, there is no panel <em>of </em>the grand jury, challenge to which is alone prohibited, but only the panel <em>for </em>a grand jury, and which may or may never .become such jury. This section certainly admits of such construction., .and it .should .be .adopted, or else the right of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>prisoner to be proceeded against, conformably to the constitution and laws of the state, would be made practically unavailable to, him <em>(Bishop's Cr. Pro., sec. </em>113).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">II. The court having such jurisdiction to discharge a panel <em>(1. a, sup.), </em>the prisoner established that the requisite number of ballots was not drawn from the grand jury box of the county. The grand jury box of the Bevised Statutes was a separate box, used solely for the 300 names returned by the supervisors, and the use of the petit jury box was not a compliance, but was radically different <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Petrea, supra, p. </em>237). The ballots of the Bevised Statutes should be prepared from a list certified by the clerk of the supervisors, and filed with the county clerk. This list should be made up by the supervisors, exercising their judgment from personal knowledge, .and limited to 300 names. Such a box and such ballots not being used, as is conceded, the requirements of the Bevised Statutes and Code were not complied with, and the court was called on to exercise its discretion under section 238.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-6\">III. Jurisdiction to allow objections to the array before impannelment existing <em>(I. b, supra), </em>the facts presented sufficient objections to warrant its exercise. Should the court not consider the point sustained, that the requisite number of ballots were not drawn, the fact still remains that the proceedings up to this point had all been illegal, and performed under pretended authority of an act prohibited by the constitution, and matrially denying the -rights of the prisoner, to wit, to be proceeded against according to the forms of law, and to be protected by the superior personal knowledge of the supervisors in preparing their lists (1 <em>Bish. Cr. Pr., sec. </em>89).</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-7\">IV. The <em>discretionary </em>power of the eourt to discharge the panel under section 238, was properly exercised, and should not be interfered with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-8\">V. That a <em>defacto </em>grand jury may exist, though selected and drawn under an unconstitutional enactment, does not assail the order appealed from. The <em>People </em>agt. <em>Petrea </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>did not assume to decide upon rights prior to indictment, or under section 238, but settled these propositions and no more : That the act of 1881 was unconstitutional. That the right to a jury, <em>selected and drawn </em>pursuant to the Bevised Statutes, was not a constitutional, but only a statutory right, and for its violation no appeal on objection after indictment was given. That for the violation of a statutory right an appeal to lie must be given by statute; but, for the violation of a constitutional right an appeal would lie, though no statutory provision was made. That a panel summoned pursuant to an act <em>afterwards </em>declared unconstitutional, sworn in and recognized by the court, and possessing the qualifications and exercising the powers and duties of a grand jury, become such defacto, and its acts as such valid. The recognition by the court being essential to make a jury summoned as this was a <em>defacto </em>jury <em>(see, also, People </em>agt. <em>Lambert, </em>76 <em>N. Y., </em>237-8), and this having no such recognition, it was neither <em>de facto </em>nor <em>de jure. </em>[Never having become a grand jury, there could be no indictment, as, in fact, none appears by the record, and there is no question before this court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b44-5\">Boardman, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u2014 The defendant had been held to await the action of the grand jury, to convene at Hay term, 1883, of ' the Albany oyer and terminer. Before the grand jurors were sworn in the defendant by counsel appeared and filed a paper containing certain objections to the grand jury and prayed the court to discharge them. The district attorney opposed this application. It was thereupon consented by both parties that the motion should stand over without prejudice to defendant\u2019s rights, or to the right and duty of the court, that if an indictment should be found the objections should.be considered and determined with the same force and effect as if decided prior to the organization of the grand jury. The grand jury then organized found an indictment against the defendant. About three months thereafter an order was made in said oyer and terminer that as to said defendant the body impanneled as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>grand jury be set aside and discharged as of the date of the first presentation of the objections; that the said indictment be not received and stand as quashed; that such order was to take effect as of May seventh; that nothing therein was to affect the action of said grand jurors as to persons not having made such objections. From this order the people appeal, and counsel on each side desire that the case may be considered and disposed of on the main question rather than - upon any technical ground which does not dispose of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In the first place there is an obvious inconsistency in the order. A grand jury cannot be discharged as to some of the persons indicted and remain as to the others. If discharged as to some it must be discharged as to all, otherwise there would or might be two grand juries at the same time, because the section which provides for discharging a grand jury requires the summoning of another <em>(Code of Crim. Pro., </em>238).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Again it is obvious that when a body of men have been sworn and impanneled as a grand jury, and as such have found indictments, they may be discharged as having finished their labors. But the}' cannot be discharged retroactively, as is attempted in this order, so that the order shall take effect as of a date prior to their action as a grand jury. Undoubtedly the indictments found by them may, for good cause, be quashed. But that is a very different matter. Ho order of the court taken subsequent to the finding of the indictment, can alter the fact that a body of men, summoned as a grand jury, were not discharged, but acted as such and found the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">But counsel on both sides express the wish that this appeal should be considered as if the order had, in fact, been made on the seventh of May. And therefore we pass over the inconsistencies above mentioned. Still they seem to have occurred to the learned justice, because the order, not only discharges the grand jury <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>which could not have been done, but it also quashes or sets aside the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">And thus we have the further difficulty that an order which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>is to take effect May seventh, quashes or sets aside an indictment which had not then been found ; that is, it quashes it in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The learned justice well expresses in his opinion, the doubt as to what the order should be. Let us next inquire whether the order was proper so far as it quashed the indictment. The objections raised are precisely those ui-ged in the <em>Petrea case </em>(64 How., 139; 65 <em>How., </em>59). It was in that case held by the court of appeals affirming the decision of this court and of the court of <em>sessions-, </em>that where an indictment had been found by a grand jury drawn under this very law and in the very manner now in question, it should not be quashed on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">It cannot be necessary or proper to argue that question again. Whatever else may have been said in the opinion of the court of appeals, that principle was absolutely decided, and such decision should govern. The oyer and terminer then should not in this case have quashed the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We think the learned justice must have seen that his decision in this respect was contrary to the law of the Petrea case, for a large part of his opinion is made up of citations of authorities, principally from other states, tending to show that the decision of the court of appeals is wrong, and that an indictment found by a grand jury selected under an unconstitutional law should be quashed on the defendant\u2019s motion. It is suggested, however, that although' an indictment after it is found ought not to be quashed upon the grounds urged in the Petrea case, yet if these grounds were presented to the court before the indictment was found, as a reason for quashing it after it should be found, then the decision in the Petrea case would not apply and the indictment should be quashed. But this cannot be. That decision held that no constitutional right of the defendant was invaded by holding him to answer under the indictment, although the same facts appear there as here. An indictment cannot be quashed before it is found.; After it is found the facts now alleged present no reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>quashing it, as was decided in the Petrea case. Hence the same facts can never he a ground for quashing an indictment, because until an indictment shall be found a motion to quash cannot be made. But again, this order discharges the grand jury or the body so called, and by agreement of counsel we are to consider the order as ir it had been made May seventh.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The first objection to this part of the order which is obvious is that just stated, viz., that on a motion by a person held to trial the court assumed to discharge the grand jury as to him, and allow it to stand as to others. How could such an order be properly made at the opening of the court, or at any other time? Would the court, on the seventh of May, have summoned another especially for this defendant? Would the court have charged the one grand jury to inquire as to all crimes except those of Thomas Fitzpatrick, and the other to inquire as to his only ? It is plain that even when we treat this order as one made at the opening of the court it is inconsistent with itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Again, there are more serious objections. This paper filed by the defendant, call it by any name he may please, is really in effect a challenge to the array. This is a well known term which calls for no definition. Similar objections were defined to be a challenge in the <em>Petrea case </em>(64 <em>How., </em>139; 65 <em>How., </em>59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">How, the Code of Criminal Procedure <em>(sec. </em>238) forbids any challenge to the panel or to the array of a grand jury. The counsel for the defendant urges that this section does not prevent objections made before the grand jury is impanneled. But a challenge is an objection made to the swearing in and impanneling of the grand jury, not an objection made after they are sworn in and impanneled. Such had been the ordinary meaning of the word, and in that sense the legislature must have used it when it forbade challenges to the panel or array. It would be trifling to enact a section which meant that challenges to the panel or array could not be made after a grand jury Avas sworn in and impanneled but might be made before.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The learned justice, however, takes another view and thinks that the challenges to the panel or array, which are forbidden by this section, are challenges to a legal panel or array of grand jurors and not challenges to an illegal panel. One would suppose there was pot much necessity to prohibit challenges to the panel or array of a legal grand jury. The section means just what it says, that is, that challenges or objections to the panel or array of the grand jury can no longer be taken. It was evidently thought that as the grand jury was only an accusing body, it was unnecessary to give an accused person the right to make objections to the details of its selection. If the Code had not forbidden challenges of this kind, still under the decision of the Petrea case, we do not see how this could be allowed. If the law in question was unconstitutional this could not be asserted by a party whose rights it did not effect <em>(Cooley Const. Lim., </em>163; <em>People </em>agt. <em>B. F. and C. I. R. R. Co., per </em>Finch, J., <em>MS.; Pierpoint </em>agt. <em>Loveless, </em>72 <em>N. Y., </em>211). And the decision in the Petrea case was that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not invaded by holding him to answer the indictment, and, therefore, not invaded by the mode' of selecting the grand jury <em>(Fierey </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>2 <em>Keyes, </em>425).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">.The learned judge, however, places this order on another ground. Section 238 above cited, after forbidding, provides that the court may, in its discretion, discharge the grand jury and order a new one to be summoned for any of several causes, among them, \u2022\u201c that the requisite number of ballots was not drawn from the grand jury box of the county.\u201d We can hardly understand how the order appealed from could have , been made in the exercise of that discretion, because the learned justice says in his opinion, that \u201c whenever it plainly appears that every safeguard of law in the selection of grand jurors has been disregarded,\u201d etc. blow then, \u2019\u2019that it is by the enactment of the very excellent chapter 532, Laws of 1881,\u201d then it was a wise exercise of discretion to set aside the supposed panel and to order a new panel to be summoned, blow if this were so, the same wise discretion would seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>require that other indicted persons should be protected as well as this defendant. And it would seem an unwise exercise of discretion to grant as a special favor to this defendant the safeguard to which others were equally entitled. Yet the order in the discretion, withholds from those who have not made the objections \u201c the guaranties which the constitution gives to every citizen for his protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">It may be remarked in passing that while in the opinion of the court of appeals in the Petrea case the act in question was spoken of as unconstitutional, yet it was distinctly held that the question of constitutionality could not be raised by the defendant in that case. As it could not be raised by him it \u25a0 could not in that case be decided by the court. As is said by judge Finch, in <em>People </em>agt. Brooklyn, <em>Flushing and Coney Island Railroad (MS. opinion): </em>\u201c It is our duty to decide a constitutional question only when it is directly and necessarily involved in the issue to be determined.\u201d Whatever was said as to the unconstitutionality of the law ivas obiter, that it is, was not involved in the decisions, and only served to encourage further efforts to thwart the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Was then the discretion proper which was thus exercised by the court of oyer and terminer in favor of Fitzpatrick and refused as to other accused persons ?</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The court of appeals had held that such a grand jury was competent to find valid indictments. Why then should the court of oyer and terminer set aside this competent jury ? The requisite number of ballots had been drawn. These ballots had been drawn from the only box and list of jurors made up in the county from which to draw grand jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">This box and list were, in fact, the grand jury box and list. It was plainly immaterial what the box was called. It held in fact the names selected under color of law as grand jurors.- And there was no other box or list from which grand jurors could be drawn. This box and list were to such extent the box and list from which to draw grand jurors- and it had been held by the court of appeals that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>a grand jury drawn therefrom was a valid grand jury. For what possible reason or under what discretion then should a grand jury so drawn be set aside ? Not the least objection was made to the competency or qualifications of any or all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">If the learned justice had refused to set the jury aside, the indictments found by them would have been valid and the adminstration of the criminal law would not have been obstructed by an objection without any real merit. We think it was not a wise exercise of discretion to set aside a body of unexceptionable men, whose competency to find indictments had been established by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">It seems to us the error which underlies nearly all of the reasoning of the learned justice in his opinion is that he assumes that any man may set up the unconstitutionality of a law although it dees not affect his rights or subject him to any wrong. This is carried a step farther in assuming that it is a wise discretion to set aside a body of competent officers against the mode of selection, of whom even, if it be illegal, no one has the right to set aside any objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">No objection is made by the defendant to the right of the people to appeal from the order and so that subject is not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The order appealed from should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Learned, P. J., and Bocees, J., concur.</p>\n<author id=\"b50-10\">Bockes, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Afm\">\u2014I think the order should be reversed. It was, afe I think, improper to quash or set aside the panel as to Fitzpatrick, yet in effect to hold it good as to all other persons charged with crime who omitted to interpose objections, inasmuch as the objections raised a question of jurisdiction. If the panel was without jurisdiction as to Fitzpatrick\u2019s case, it was equally without jurisdiction as to all others similarly charged. But we are asked to consider the case on the merits, just as it was examined in the court of oyer and terminer, to raise the. validity of the objection urged against- the panel by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Fitzpatrick as regards the mode of drawing, summoning and impanneliug the grand jury. This question, I think, is settled against Fitzpatrick by this court, and by the court of appeals in the Petrea case. It was held in that case that the objections here urged in Fitzpatrick\u2019s behalf could not be maintained by one charged with a criminal offense, further than to see that the action or proceeding challenged as irregular and void was taken <em>under the color of lawful authority </em>/ and, as was said in the case cited, it would not alter the case even if such action involved some proceeding of an officer or of officers taken under an unconstitutional law. The <em>court </em>would still retain this jurisdiction over the matter and the proceedings. The authorities upholding this conclusion are cited in Petrea\u2019s case as well in this court as in the court of appeals. It was said in the latter court, in answer to the objections here urged, that an indictment found by a body drawn, summoned and sworn as a grand jury <em>before a competent </em>court, and composed of good and lawful men, fulfil the constitutional guaranty; that a jury so formed was a <em>defacto </em>jury, because selected and organized under the forms of law. That a defect in its constitution owing to the invalidity of a law under which a panel was drawn, affected no substantial right of one charged with crime, hence an objection based thereon was not available to him. So it was held \u201c that an indictment found by a grand jury of good and lawful men, selected and drawn under <em>color of law, </em>was a good indictment by a grand jury within the sense of the constitution, although the law under which the selection was made was void, it would seem to follow that if an indictment when found would be good and valid, it could hardly be maintained that the grand jury which found it acted without jurisdiction or authority in. the premises. I am of the opinion that the decision in the Petrea case determines all questions presented on this appeal against the objections urged in the oyer in Fitzpatrick\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
