Defendant interposed as a defense and by way of set-off two notes, which with interest were of the aggregate value of $7,996. Upon the trial judgment was rendered for plaintiff upon all the issues involved, and for the full amount claimed by her with interest. The court granted an allowance of five per cent. Plaintiff, upon the taxation of costs by the clerk, claimed that the per centage allowed should be calculated upon the plaintiff\u2019s recovery and upon the amounts pleaded as set off by defendant, as these constituted \u201c the value of the subject-matter involved.\u201d The clerk refused to tax an allowance on the set-offs, and taxed it only on plaintiff\u2019s claim. From such taxation this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-11\"><em>William King Hall (Hall &amp; Blandy), </em>for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_8\">cited <em>Woonsocket Rubber Company </em>agt. <em>Rubber Clothing Company </em>(1 <em>N.
