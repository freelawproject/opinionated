In May of 1973, Shaw was engaged in lowering a telephone conduit which entailed, among other things, the construction of a trench nine feet deep, five feet wide, and twenty feet long.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-20\">The Secretary of Labor cited Shaw for a number of alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 <em>et seq., </em>in connection with this trench. The citations were contested, and the Commission administrative law judge who heard the case determined that two serious violations had occurred. The first involved Shaw\u2019s failure to store excavated materials more than two feet from the edge of the trench, in violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.651(i)(l);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the second concerned improper shoring or sloping of the trench under 29 C.F.R: \u00a7 1926.652(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the issuance of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, Shaw petitioned for discretionary review by the full Commission pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>to dispose of the case, but due to the fact that one of its members had resigned and had not been replaced at the time Shaw\u2019s petition was considered, only two commissioners participated in the review of the initial decision and order. Acting without a third member, the Commission affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s determinations as to each of the violations. Both commissioners concurred in affirming the first violation; the second was affirmed by a divided, one-to-one vote. A subsequent petition for rehearing after a third member had been appointed to the Commission was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\">With regard to the first violation, Shaw conceded that excavated materials were stored within two feet of the edge of its trench, and argues only that the Commission erred in holding this to be a \u201cserious\u201d violation. Section 17(k) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(j), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-5\">[A] serious violation shall be deemed to exist in a place of employment if there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm <em>could </em>result from a condition which exists ... in such place of employment unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">(Emphasis added.) This provision has been construed as holding violations to be serious if they make possible an accident involving a substantial probability of death or serious physical harm. <em>California Stevedore and Ballast Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>9 Cir., 1975, 517 F.2d 986, 987-88.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">The administrative law judge found that Shaw had three-foot-high soil banks and large asphalt chunks adjacent to its trench, and that vibrations caused by nearby traffic and equipment in the trench might cause debris to fall into the trench. If this occurred, there would be a substantial probability that someone working in the trench would suffer serious injuries or death. There was thus substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s 2-0 determination that a serious violation of section 1926.-651(i)(l) had occurred. We find no abuse of discretion in the Commission\u2019s assessment of a $300 penalty against Shaw for this violation. <em>See REA Express, Inc. v. Brennan, </em>2 Cir., 1974, 495 F.2d 822, 827; <em>Brennan v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>8 Cir., 1973, 487 F.2d 438, 442-43; <em>cf. Nadiak v. CAB, </em>5 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 588, 593, <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 913, 83 S.Ct. 729, 9 L.Ed.2d 722 (1963). We therefore affirm the Commission\u2019s order with regard to Shaw\u2019s first violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">The Commission erred, however, 'in disposing of the second violation with a one-to-one vote. Under the statutory provisions governing the Commission\u2019s discretionary review of determinations made by Commission administrative law judges, no official action can be taken by the Commission without the affirmative vote of at least two of its members.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An affirmance sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>ported by only one vote does not comply with this statutory requirement and cannot stand. We accordingly remand the case to the Commission so that it may take appropriate official action in reviewing Shaw\u2019s alleged sloping and shoring violation under section 1926.652(c). We intimate no view on the merits of Shaw\u2019s petition in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1252-12\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.651(i)(l) (1975) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-13\">In excavations which employees may be required to enter, excavated or other material shall be effectively stored and retained at least 2 feet or more from the edge of the excavation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1252-14\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.652(c) (1975) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-15\">Sides of trenches in hard or compact soil, including embankments, shall be shored or otherwise supported when the trench is more than 5 feet in depth and 8 feet or more in length.

Shaw\u2019s Petition for Discretionary Review was mailed to the Chairman of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission on February 6, 1974. Chairman Moran exercised his authority under section 661(i) to direct review on February 19, 1974.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">. In <em>Accu-Namics, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 515 F.2d 828, 831, we indicated that \u201c[a] violation is deemded [sic] \u2018serious\u2019 under the Act if there is a substantial probability of death or serious injury resulting from it.\u201d <em>Accu-Namics </em>involved violations of trenching safety regulations which caused the accidental death of four workers. In that case, there was a substantial probability both that the accident itself would occur, and that the resulting injury would be serious if it did. We do not read the above-quoted language, however, as precluding a determination that a violation may also be deemed \u201cserious\u201d under the Act where, although the accident itself is merely possible (i. e., in statutory terms, \u201ccould result from a condition\u201d), there is a substantial probability of serious injury if it does occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">.
