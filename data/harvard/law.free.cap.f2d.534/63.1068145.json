Ball III. The petition alleged that Janet and Mark Robertson, the natural mother and adoptive father of the child, had refused to permit the Balls to visit young Jack. Section 14.03(d) of the Texas Family Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-17\">The court may grant reasonable access rights to either the maternal or paternal grandparents of the child and issue any necessary orders to enforce the decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-18\">On July 15, 1975, the Robertsons filed a petition for removal in the United States District Court, alleging that the Texas statute quoted above was unconstitutional and that removal was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b) and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. The Robertsons then filed in the federal court, in response to the Balls\u2019 state court petition, a \u201cmotion to dismiss, answer, and request for an injunction,\u201d praying for a permanent injunction against the enforcement of Section 14.03 and requesting a three-judge court to hear the application for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-19\">The Balls next step was a motion asking the federal court to remand the cause to the state court. Both parties filed short briefs in regard to this motion. On February 13, 1976, the court below granted the motion and remanded the cause to the Texas Domestic Relations Court. The Robertsons noticed an appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-20\">The first question we must face is whether we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. With respect to the removal based on \u00a7 1441(b), our starting point is \u00a7 1447(d) which appears expressly to negate the possibility of appellate review of the remand in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-21\">An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-22\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). The United States Supreme Court has recently held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u00a7 1447(d) does not mean exactly what it seems to say, see <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>1976, 423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542, but the exception noted in that case, by which certain remands of \u00a7 1441(b) removal can be reviewed through mandamus, has no application to the case before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Thermtron </em>held that \u201conly remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the grounds specified therein \u2014 that removal was improvident and without jurisdiction \u2014 are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d 423 U.S. at 346, 96 S.Ct. at 590, 46 L.Ed.2d at 551.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The court below expressly stated that \u201cthis action was improperly removed under Section 1441(b) . . \u201d because the action was not \u201cone of which this court would have had original jurisdiction. . . \u201d We have no occasion to determine whether or not this conclusion of the district court was well-founded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we read <em>Thermtron, </em>the express invocation by the district court of the \u00a7 1447(c) grounds for remand of a removal under \u00a7 1441(b) robs this court of any power \u201cthrough appeal or otherwise,\u201d to review the merits of the remand order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to the part of the remand order dealing with \u00a7 1441(b) removal, then, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">The removal effected under \u00a71443 stands in a different posture, however. The portion of \u00a7 1447(d) elided from the above quotation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>. except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">Any of the following civil actions or criminal prosecutions, commenced in a State court may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">(1) Against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The court below apparently held that \u00a7 1443 removal was not proper in this case because \u201cthe requisite element of state action\u201d was absent from the state statute being challenged by the Robertsons. Without passing on the validity of that innovative rationale, we find we are able to affirm the remand order on another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>1975, 421 U.S. 213, 95 S.Ct. 1591, 44 L.Ed.2d 121, the Supreme Court relied on <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>1966, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925, and <em>City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>1966, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944, for the following statement of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">. [A] removal petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1) must satisfy a two-pronged test. First, it must appear that the right allegedly denied the removal petitioner arises under a federal law \u201cproviding for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u201d <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S., at 792, 86 S.Ct., at 1790. Claims that prosecution, and conviction will violate rights under constitutional or statutory provisions of general applicability or under statutes not protecting against racial discrimination, will not suffice .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">421 U.S. at 219, 95 S.Ct. at 1595, 44 L.Ed.2d at 128. <em>See also State of Mississippi v. McCollum, </em>5 Cir. 1975, 513 F.2d 285; <em>Gittman v. Gittman, </em>3 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">We need not advance to the second prong, since the removal petition filed by the Robertsons clearly failed to satisfy the first prong \u2014 the federal rights claimed by the Robertsons do not arise under federal law \u201cproviding for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">The part of the order remanding the cause removed under \u00a7 1443 is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED in part, and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\">. In <em>Thermtron, </em>a state court defendant had removed to federal court a diversity action over which federal jurisdiction was clear and conceded. The federal district court remanded the. case, however, expressly citing the crowded condition of its docket as the sole reason. The state court defendant petitioned for a writ of mandamus, which the Sixth Circuit found was made unavailable by the express language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, indicating that \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s prohibition of appellate review applied only when the district court remanded for the reasons cited in 1447(c), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">If at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, the district court shall remand the case .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The Supreme Court specifically held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">Because the District Court remanded a properly removed case on grounds that he had no authority to consider, he exceeded his statutorily defined power and issuance of the writ of mandamus was not barred by \u00a7 1447(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">423 U.S. at 351, 96 S.Ct. at 593, 46 L.Ed.2d at 554.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-12\">. Although the standard set out in \u00a7 1447(c) and tracked in the quoted language from <em>Thermtron </em>is in the conjunctive \u2014 i. e., is stated as if the district court must find <em>both </em>improvident removal and lack of jurisdiction \u2014 it is clear that the district court may remand a case improvidently removed even if the defect, e. <em>g., </em>untimeliness under \u00a7 1446(b), is not \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d <em>See London v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>5 Cir. 1976, 531 F.2d 257, 260:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">Thus, even when, as here, jurisdiction exists, the failure to comply with the statutory time requirements is the sort of defect which the District Court was entitled to consider and which caused this case to be improvidently removed within the meaning of \u00a7 1447(c), and accordingly \u00a7 1447(d) divests this Court of jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-18\">. <em>Cf. Gittman v. Gittman, </em>3 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 155, in which the appellant had removed a child support action from state court, in which he was the defendant, alleging that the state procedures denied him various constitutional rights. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-19\">Gittman has . . . failed to make out a case under Section 1441, for on the face of the complaint in this matrimonial controversy there is not a substantial federal question. <em>Gully v. First National Bank of Meridian, </em>299 U.S. 109, 112, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936). In any case, a decision on removal under \u00a7 1441 is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-21\">. The <em>Thermtron </em>majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-22\">It is unquestioned in this case . . . that [\u00a7 1447(d)] prohibits review of all remand orders issued pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c) whether erroneous or not and whether review is sought by appeal or extraordinary writ. . . . If a trial judge purports to remand a case on the ground that it was removed \u201cimprovidently and without jurisdiction,\u201d his order is not subject to challenge in the Court of Appeals by appeal, by mandamus or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-25\">. Congress immunized from all forms of appellate review any remand order issued on the grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c), whether or not that order might be deemed erroneous by an appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-26\">423 U.S. at 343, 351, 96 S.Ct. at 589, 593, 46 L.Ed.2d at 549, 554. <em>Cf. London v. United States Fire Ins. Co., supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\">. The exception in \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s prohibition of appellate review for remands of removals effected under \u00a7 1443, taken with the power vested in the state court defendant to effect removal solely on his own motion, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(e), might seem to provide a significant loophole which could undermine the general policy of \u00a7 1447(d). That policy might be stated thusly: once the federal district court considers the proper factors and decides to remand, the action should go forward in state court without the further delay of appeal, and without regard to whether the federal district court was correct or incorrect. This general policy is discussed in Justice Rehnquist\u2019s dissent in <em>Thermtron, </em>423 U.S. 336, 353, 96 S.Ct. 584, 594, 46 L.Ed.2d 542, 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">The \u00a7 1447(d) exception, of course, represents another strong policy: removed actions in which federal rights that are based on laws relating to racial equality cannot be adequately protected in state courts should not be remanded to those state courts, and district court orders effecting such remands should be subject to appellate review on the merits. To insure that the \u00a7 1443 exception to \u00a7 1447(d) not be used as a dilatory tactic by recalcitrant state court defendants, we can only suggest that this Court will look with favor upon a summary motion to dismiss, as frivolous, an appeal from a remand when the removal purportedly based on \u00a7 1443 does not even colorably fall within the strict tests set out in <em>Johnson, Georgia, </em>and <em>Greenwood, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
