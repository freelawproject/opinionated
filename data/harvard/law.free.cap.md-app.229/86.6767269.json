EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Heidi Bernadzikowski was murdered on April 20, 2000. In 2012, Alexander Charles Bennett was charged with the murder. The State identified Grant Agbara Lewis, appellant, a resident of Colorado, as a material witness. Pursuant to the Uniform Act to Secure Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-301-307 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (the \u201cUniform Act\u201d), the State obtained an order and summons from a Colorado court requiring appellant to appear and testify at Mr. Bennett\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">When appellant appeared in court on the day set for trial, Mr. Bennett pleaded guilty. In his proffer of facts, Mr. Bennett implicated appellant as an accomplice. Appellant was arrested. In the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, he was charged with murder and conspiracy. A jury convicted him, and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment plus five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The Uniform Act, discussed more fully below, provides immunity from arrest and service of process for witnesses who come into the State in obedience to a summons. On appeal, appellant argues that the State violated the Uniform Act. Recognizing that he did not raise the issue in circuit court, he contends that, based on the violation, the circuit court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction and that jurisdictional issues can be raised at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">We hold that the circuit court had both subject matter and personal jurisdiction. Conceptually, therefore, the question becomes whether the court erred in exercising its jurisdiction. The alleged error is one of law and subject to waiver. Thus, we need not reach the merits, <em>ie., </em>whether the State violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the Uniform Act and, if so, the effect of the violation and appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">On May 7, 2012, an indictment was filed in circuit court against Mr. Bennett, charging him with the murder of Ms. Bernadzikowski. <em>See State v. Bennett, </em>No. 03K12002639, Baltimore County Circuit Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As detailed below, initially the State identified appellant, a resident of Denver, Colorado, as a material witness in Mr. Bennett\u2019s case. The prosecutor took steps to compel appellant to appear and testify at Mr. Bennett\u2019s trial. Pertinent to the issue raised on appeal, we have reviewed, and the State accepts, the following from appellant\u2019s recitation of facts:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">The steps that the State took to secure Appellant\u2019s presence are consistent with the typical steps taken to secure the presence of an out-of-state witness. First, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office obtained from Baltimore County Circuit Court Judge Kathleen Gallogly Cox a Certificate for Attendance of Witness From Colorado State (\u201cCertificate\u201d), certifying that Appellant was a material and necessary witness in Bennett\u2019s prosecution, and the trial dates when Appellant\u2019s presence would be required.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] App. A. The Certificate was then provided to the District Attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Office for the Second Judicial District of Colorado. <em>Id. </em>As a result of the Certificate, <em>In Re: Request for Summons Under Uniform Act to Secure Witness From Outside the State pursuant to \u00a7 16-9-202, Regarding Witness, </em>Case No. 2014CV30367 (Colo.Dist.Ct.2014), was docketed in the Colorado court. App. A. On January 28, 2014, the District Attorney\u2019s Office filed the required motion for a hearing, which gave Appellant the opportunity to be heard as to whether he was a material and necessary witness in Bennett\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>On January 29, 2014, Chief Judge Michael A. Martinez of the Colorado court, citing the Certificate issued by Judge Cox, issued a summons ordering Appellant to appear as a State\u2019s witness in Bennett\u2019s trial. App. B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Colorado order and summons included the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">4) That the laws of the state in which the prosecution is pending, and of any other state through which the witness may be required to pass by ordinary course of travel, will give to the witness protection from arrest and service of civil and criminal process in connection with matters which arose before entering into that state under this summons; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Appellant\u2019s recitation of facts included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">Judge Martinez\u2019s summons and accompanying order was to become effective upon either the signing and filing of an Acceptance of Service and Waiver of Hearing or the issuance of a summons after a hearing. <em>Id. </em>The summons and order in Appellant\u2019s case became effective on February 7, 2014, after Appellant signed the Acceptance of Service and Waiver of Hearing and it was filed with the court. App. D.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Appellant arrived in Maryland some time prior to March 18, 2014, the first day of Mr. Bennett\u2019s trial. As noted, Mr. Bennett pleaded guilty to first degree murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with all but thirty years suspended. As part of the plea agreement, Mr. Bennett agreed to proffer the details of Ms. Bernadzikowski\u2019s murder and to testify in any further proceedings. After Mr. Bennett impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>cated appellant as an accomplice, the State filed an indictment in circuit court, charging appellant with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Although not necessary for resolution of this appeal, as general background information, we shall summarize the evidence at appellant\u2019s trial. On the evening of April 20, 2000, Baltimore County police responded to a 911 call from 2008 Codd Avenue in Dundalk, Maryland. They found Steven Cooke holding the dead body of his girlfriend, Ms. Bernadzi-kowski. Police learned that Mr. Cooke had obtained a $700,000 insurance policy on Ms. Bernadzikowski\u2019s life approximately two months before her death. Mr. Cooke was the primary beneficiary on the policy. Several witnesses testified that Ms. Bernadzikowski had planned to leave Mr. Cooke.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Much of the State\u2019s evidence at trial came from Mr. Bennett. Mr. Bennett set up an online advertisement for \u201cprofessional and discreet cleaning services.\u201d Mr. Cooke contacted him via email. Mr. Bennett, appellant, and Mr. Cooke planned a murder-for-hire whereby Mr. Bennett and appellant agreed to murder Ms. Bernadzikowski, in exchange for $60,000 from the proceeds of the life insurance policy. Appellant and Mr. Bennett discussed ways to kill Ms. Bernadzikow-ski without it being detected, including breaking her neck to make her death look like an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">After reaching agreement with Mr. Cooke, appellant bought Mr. Bennett a plane ticket from Colorado to Baltimore, and Natalie Ott, a friend, drove both of them to the airport the day Mr. Bennett left. Appellant gave Mr. Bennett a map to the home where Mr. Cooke and Ms. Bernadzikowski were living. After he arrived in the Baltimore area in March 2000, Mr. Bennett began watching the victim, communicating his observations to appellant who was in Colorado.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Eventually, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lant put Mr. Bennett in contact with Mr. Cooke. Messrs. Bennett and Cooke met twice: once at the residence of Mr. Cooke and Ms. Bernadzikowski, and another time at a bus stop. At the residence, Mr. Cooke showed Mr. Bennett around the house and made clear that he wanted the murder to look like an accident for purposes of the potential insurance claim. Mr. Bennett told Mr. Cooke that he was going to contact appellant to coordinate completion of the crime. Later, at the bus stop, Mr. Bennett told Mr. Cooke that his \u201cboss,\u201d referring to appellant, was getting \u201cangry\u201d and wanted to move forward with the crime so that they could get paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">On the day planned for the murder, Mr. Bennett called appellant. Appellant told Mr. Bennett that Mr. Cooke was going to drop Ms. Bernadzikowski off at their residence in twenty minutes. Mr. Bennett was to go to the residence, where a key to the door would be waiting, and then call appellant and inform him whether the crime had occurred as planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Mr. Bennett went to the residence, found the key, gained entry, and waited by the front door. He watched through a window as Mr. Cooke and Ms. Bernadzikowski arrived. While Mr. Cooke remained behind, Ms. Bernadzikowski exited the vehicle and entered the residence. At that point, Mr. Bennett grabbed her from behind, put his hand over her mouth, and attempted to break her neck. When that did not work, he wrapped his hands around her throat and choked her until she was unconscious. He put her down and went to find a knife. Returning with a knife, and being unsure whether she was dead, Mr. Bennett cut her throat. During the struggle, Ms. Bernadzikowski scratched Mr. Bennett\u2019s face and lip.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">After the murder, Mr. Bennett went through the house, trying to create a scene \u201cjust to confuse the police.\u201d This included writing the number \u201c1\u201d on the wall in lipstick. Mr. Bennett stayed in the house for about thirty minutes after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>murder. When asked why, he replied that appellant suggested that, if he did not hear the police after thirty minutes, he would be okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">After he left the residence, Mr. Bennett disposed of the knife and the key, and then called appellant. Mr. Bennett told appellant the crime did not go entirely as planned, but that it was done. Appellant informed Mr. Bennett that he was monitoring police activity in the area and that \u201cthe coasts were clear.\u201d Appellant tried, unsuccessfully, to arrange accommodations for Mr. Bennett in Baltimore using a fake credit card. After sleeping in an alley, Mr. Bennett again called appellant and asked him to call Mr. Bennett\u2019s sister to help Mr. Bennett return to Colorado. Appellant later contacted Mr. Bennett again and told him it was okay to speak to his sister. Mr. Bennett returned to Colorado. Mr. Bennett and appellant were never paid any of the insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Other witnesses corroborated portions of Mr. Bennett\u2019s testimony. Ms. Ott knew both the appellant and Mr. Bennett. In the spring of 2000, she drove both men to the airport, and was told that Mr. Bennett was going to Baltimore to \u201cmake a lot of money.\u201d Rebecca Love, the mother of two of appellant\u2019s children, testified that appellant told her that he sent Mr. Bennett to kill a woman who lived out-of-state because she owed him money. Ms. Love knew that Mr. Bennett and appellant were \u201cextremely close friends,\u201d and that they \u201c[d]id everything together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In 2000, DNA testing of samples taken from under the victim\u2019s fingernails did not result in an identification of the murderer. In 2011, DNA testing of additional samples, with improved technology, resulted in the identification of Mr. Bennett. Detective Gary Childs testified that, in approximately January 2012, after Mr. Bennett\u2019s DNA was found under the victim\u2019s fingernails, he conducted a search with the Maryland State Police and discovered the record of Mr. Bennett\u2019s stop by the MTA Police in March 2000. The investigators then decided to interview Mr. Bennett in Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>In January 2012, during the course of their interview with Mr. Bennett, appellant\u2019s name surfaced as a possible alibi witness. The police then interviewed appellant, also in Colorado, solely as a witness in connection with Mr. Bennett\u2019s case. Following these interviews, the State\u2019s Attorney charged Mr. Bennett with the murder and took steps to compel appellant to come to Baltimore County to testify as a material witness in the case against Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">As part of his plea agreement with the State, Mr. Bennett agreed to plead guilty and to testify truthfully about his role in the murder of Ms. Bernadzikowski. Mr. Bennett provided details of appellant\u2019s role in the murder. Based on this new information, police determined that appellant was not simply a witness, but a suspect. Detective Childs then reinterviewed appellant, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">On all the previous interviews Mr. Lewis was viewed as a potential alibi witness for the Defendant and he was giving us pieces of the information regarding Mr. Bennett. After the 18th proffer with his attorney present, there were some questions I needed to ask Mr. Lewis that tentatively would put him as a defendant in this case. So I felt that even though he flew here voluntarily, possibility of him not leaving voluntarily and being arrested was pretty good. So because it would be viewed that he may be in custody, in my custody and not allowed to leave, in a custodial interrogation you have to advise the person that you are talking to of their Miranda rights against self-incrimination and his right to an attorney. So knowing the facts that I knew and the previous statements that had been made, it was my belief that Mr. Lewis was involved and that I needed to Mirandize him before I questioned him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">After the State rested, appellant testified on his own behalf as follows. After he and Mr. Bennett watched a movie about assassins-for-hire, Mr. Bennett set up an online advertisement for \u201cprofessional and discreet cleaning services.\u201d The idea was to gain employment from the ad, get paid, and then leave before actually committing any further crime. Appellant testified that the scheme \u201cwas basically a con.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>After the ad was posted, Mr. Cooke contacted appellant via email. The initial agreement with Mr. Cooke called for a complete payment of $40,000 with $20,000 to be paid as a deposit. Pursuant to the plan between appellant and Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bennett was to travel to Baltimore, collect the deposit, return to Colorado, and then inform the authorities about Mr. Cooke. Appellant maintained there was never any intent to actually commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Appellant agreed that he purchased a ticket for Mr. Bennett to go to Baltimore. He also confirmed that Mr. Cooke sent him documentation and information about the victim, Ms. Bernadzikowski. Mr. Bennett then traveled to Baltimore and made contact with Mr. Cooke. Appellant testified that, at some point before the murder, he told Mr. Bennett to come home because the plan was not working. He also stated that Mr. Cooke contacted him before the murder to try and cancel the contract. Nevertheless, Mr. Bennett went ahead with the murder, informing appellant only after he, Mr. Bennett, returned to Colorado. Appellant testified that he did not believe Mr. Bennett would actually complete the crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court lacked both subject matter and personal jurisdiction. Recognizing that he did not raise these arguments prior to appeal, he contends they are not subject to waiver. On the merits, appellant contends the State violated the Uniform Act, that his convictions are void and must be vacated, and that he must be permitted to return to Colorado. The State responds that appellant\u2019s claim concerns a defect in the institution of prosecution, not jurisdiction, and that, by failing to raise the issue before trial, it is waived. The State also argues that appellant\u2019s position fails on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>merits, and even if it had merit, he should not be released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The Court of Appeals has noted the history of the Uniform Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">... [The] Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from without a State in Criminal Proceedings ... was promulgated over half a century ago and has been adopted in substance in each state, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. <em>See </em>Uniform Act to Secure Attendance of Witnesses, 11 U.L.A. 1 (1974, 1993 pocket part). Jurisdictions have adopted variations to the Uniform Act, but the gist and goals of the model law remain intact. \u201cThe essence of the Uniform Act is to create a community of jurisdictions which will honor the request of fellow members for the appearance of witnesses at criminal proceedings under the conditions specified in the Act.\u201d <em>People v. Superior Court, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 1405, 274 Cal.Rptr. 586, 589 (1990). \u201cThe purpose of the Uniform Act ... is to secure at trial the attendance ... of a material witness residing in another state.\u201d <em>State v. Duncan, </em>648 S.W.2d 892, 893 (Mo.App.1983). <em>See also State v. Lesco, </em>194 Kan. 555, 400 P.2d 695, 699 (1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 1015, 86 S.Ct. 628, 15 L.Ed.2d 529 (1966) (\u201cThe Uniform Act was intended as a matter of comity between states to enable states to obtain material witnesses for criminal prosecutions.\u201d). Long ago, shortly after the Uniform Act was promulgated, it was recognized that \u201c[o]bviously the object of [a uniform statute for the attendance of witnesses enacted by New Jersey] is to promote the enforcement of the criminal laws and the administration of justice in criminal proceedings in the several states.\u201d <em>People of State of New York v. Parker, </em>16 N.J.Misc. 471, 1 A.2d 54, 55 (Cir.Ct.1936).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">Maryland\u2019s version of the Uniform Act was originally adopted in 1937 and is now codified as \u00a7 9-301 through \u00a7 9-306 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1973, 1989 Repl. Vol.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 222-23, 634 A.2d 464 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"As\">As further explained by this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The Uniform Act provides what is essentially a two-stage process for obtaining the compulsory attendance of an out-of-State witness in criminal prosecutions and grand jury investigations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">The first stage originates in the requesting State (Maryland). A person desiring the attendance of an out-of-State witness may approach the appropriate court in his State and, if he is able to convince that court that such be the case, obtain from it a formal certificate under seal that the individual whose presence is sought \u201cis a material witness in a prosecution pending in [the court] or in a grand jury investigation which has commenced or is about to commence .... \u201d The certificate, if it is issued, must also specify \u201cthe number of days the witness will be required.\u201d Md. Code, Courts art. \u00a7 9-303(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">The second stage is to present the certificate \u201cto a judge of a court of record in the county in which the witness is found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That judge, upon such presentation, schedules a hearing on the matter. At that hearing, which the witness is directed to attend, the judge considers and determines whether the certificate presented to him has merit \u2014 whether the witness is material and necessary to a prosecution or grand jury investigation, whether it would cause any undue hardship on the witness to attend as requested, and whether the witness will be afforded the immunity from arrest and civil process required by the Act. If the judge finds that these statutory prerequisites are satisfied, he \u201cshall issue a summons, with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify ... at a time and place specified in the summons.\u201d Md. Code, Courts art., \u00a7 9-302(b); Va.Code, \u00a7 19.2-274.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">If, after being tendered the appropriate traveling expenses and witness fee, the witness \u201cfails without good cause to attend and testify as directed in the summons, he shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this [i.e., the sending] State.\u201d Md. Code, Courts art., \u00a7 9-302(d); Va.Code, \u00a7 19.2-276.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>In re Special Investigation No. 219, </em>52 Md.App. 17, 22-23, 445 A.2d 1081, <em>cert. denied, </em>294 Md. 243 (1982); <em>see also Muhammad v.

As commonly stated and applied, it proceeds upon the ground that the due administration of justice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a cause pending before it, by the service of process in other suits, which would prevent, or the fear of which might tend to discourage, the voluntary attendance of those whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the pending litigation. In <em>Stewart v. Ramsay, </em>the court said at page 130, of 242 U.S. [128], 37 S.Ct. 44, 46 [61 L.Ed. 192 (1916) ], quoting from <em>Parker v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Hotchkiss, </em>Fed. Cas. No. 10,739: \u2018The privilege which is asserted here is the privilege of the court, rather than of the defendant. It is founded in the necessities of the judicial administration, which would be often embarrassed, and sometimes interrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process while attending upon the court for the protection of his rights, or the witness while attending to testify.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>Lamb v.

Butler, </em>353 Md. 67, 78, 724 A.2d 657 (1999) (recognizing that, for there to be territorial jurisdiction, \u201cthe crime, or essential elements of it, must have occurred within the geographic territory of Maryland\u201d); <em>see also State v. Cain, </em>360 Md. 205, 214, 757 A.2d 142 (2000) (\u201cIt is sometimes stated that each offense has, for jurisdictional purposes, one key act or omission and that this element must have taken place in the state where the prosecution is instituted\u201d). Maryland has a strong interest in prosecuting those responsible for Ms. Bernadzikowski\u2019s murder. Appellant has not rebutted the presumption that there was proper subject matter jurisdiction in this case. <em>See In re John F., </em>169 Md.App. 171, 181, 899 A.2d 976 (2006) (\u201c[T]he burden is on the party challenging subject matter jurisdiction to rebut that presumption\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Appellant cites <em>Evans v. Evans, </em>75 Md.App. 364, 372-75, 541 A.2d 648 (1988), but that case supports our conclusion. In <em>Evans, </em>we distinguished between the fundamental jurisdiction of a court to render a judgment and an error of law. The latter is subject to waiver. As the Court of Appeals recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">In a much later case where one of the parties asserted that a tribunal\u2019s decision, allegedly in violation of a statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>meant that the tribunal lacked subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Board of License Comm. v. Corridor, </em>361 Md. 403, 417-418, 761 A.2d 916, 923 (2000), the Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u201cSimply because a statutory provision directs a court ... to decide a case in a particular way, if certain circumstances are shown, does not create an issue going to the court\u2019s ... subject matter jurisdiction. There have been numerous cases in this Court involving the situation where a trial court ... has jurisdiction over the subject matter, but where a statute directs the court ..., under certain circumstances, to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular way, ... and the tribunal erroneously refuses to do so because an error of statutory interpretation or an error of fact. In these situations, this Court has regularly held that the matter did not concern the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\"><em>Tshiwala v. State, </em>424 Md. 612, 622, 37 A.3d 308 (2012).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Thus, assuming a violation of the Uniform Act, the question is whether the court should exercise its jurisdiction. If it erred in doing so, it was an error of law and is subject to waiver. The distinction between lack of jurisdiction and the propriety of exercising it has long been recognized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">In explaining the rationale for the mandate we issue in this case, it may be well to recall for the reader that \u201c \u2018juridically, jurisdiction refers to two quite distinct concepts: (i) the power of a court to render a valid [final judgment], and (ii) the propriety of granting the relief sought. 1 Pomeroy, <em>Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5th ed. 1941), Secs. 129-31.\u2019 \u201d <em>First Federated Com. Tr. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>272 Md. 329, 334, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974) (quoting <em>Moore v. McAllister, </em>216 Md. 497, 507, 141 A.2d 176, 182 (1958)). Thus, it is only when a court lacked fundamental jurisdiction to render the judgment it did that there is an absence of authority in the court so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>render its judgment a nullity. <em>First Federated Com. Tr. v. Comm\u2019r, supra, </em>272 Md. at 334, 322 A.2d at 543. <em>Accord, Pulley v. State, </em>287 Md. 406, 412 A.2d 1244, 1248-51 (1980); <em>Parks v. State, </em>287 Md. 11, 17-19, 410 A.2d 597, 601-02 (1980); <em>Block v. State, </em>286 Md. 266, 270-73, 407 A.2d 320, 322-24 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Stewart v. State, </em>287 Md. 524, 526-527, 413 A.2d 1337 (1980). Because appellant failed to raise the issue, the circuit court never addressed the question of whether the statute was violated and, if so, whether it should decline to exercise jurisdiction or invoke some other remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">With respect to appellant\u2019s arguments relating to personal jurisdiction, appellant was served in the State, and thus, the State acquired personal jurisdiction over him. Again, it is a question of whether it should have been exercised. Regardless, it is settled that \u201c[t]he defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, is waived unless raised in a mandatory preliminary motion ...\u201d <em>Burnside v. Wong, </em>412 Md. 180, 195, 986 A.2d 427 (2010) (citations omitted); <em>see also Casey v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Rockville, </em>400 Md. 259, 322-23, 929 A.2d 74 (2007) (recognizing that personal jurisdiction may be waived). This is because personal jurisdiction flows from the Due Process Clause, and \u201crecognizes and protects an individual liberty interest. It represents a restriction on judicial power not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty.\u201d <em>Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 702, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982). Further, \u201c[bjecause the requirement of personal jurisdiction represents first of all an individual right, it can, like other such rights, be waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703, 102 S.Ct. 2099.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Appellant argues that, although authorities such as those in the preceding paragraph establish that personal jurisdiction can be waived in civil cases, it cannot be waived in criminal cases. Appellant relies on Md. Rule 8-131 which states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>2-322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court.\u201d Appellant argues that the rule refers only to Rule 2-322, a civil rule of procedure, and does not refer to any criminal rules of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Despite the absence of an express reference to criminal procedure in Rule 8-131, personal jurisdiction may be waived in criminal cases. For example, in <em>United States v. Rosenberg, </em>195 F.2d 583 (2d Cir.1952), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 U.S. 838, 73 S.Ct. 21, 97 L.Ed. 652 (1952), the prosecution of various individuals for espionage against the United States, Morton Sobell, one of the co-defendants, argued that he was illegally abducted by Mexican police and brought across the border to be tried along with the Rosenbergs on the underlying charges. <em>Rosenberg, </em>195 F.2d at 602. Sobell argued this amounted to kidnapping and deprived the court of personal jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>The Second Circuit declined to consider the question, concluding that the issue, one challenging a defect in the institution of the prosecution, had been waived. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03. The Court held that \u201c[personal jurisdiction can be waived in a criminal as well as a civil case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603. <em>See Ford v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 593, 606, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793 (1927) (\u201cA plea to the jurisdiction must precede that plea of not guilty. Such a plea was not filed. The effect of the failure to file it was to waive the question of the jurisdiction of the persons of defendants\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Hill, </em>210 F.3d 881, 884 (8th Cir.2000) (observing that personal jurisdiction in a criminal case may be waived by appearing without objection); <em>Glynn v. EDO Corp., </em>641 F.Supp.2d 476, 487-88 (D.Md.2009) (recognizing that the Fourth Circuit has held that personal jurisdiction may be waived) (citing <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Devers, </em>389 F.2d 44, 46 (4th Cir.1968)). As explained by another appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Jurisdiction over the subject matter, of course, could not be conferred by consent or waiver, but no reason appears why an accused could not subject himself to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. The procedural safeguards spelling out the method whereby a court obtains jurisdiction over the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>of an accused are all designed for his protection. If he elects not to avail himself of the established procedural rights there appears to be none who should be heard to complain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><em>People v.

Anderson, </em>472 F.3d 662, 666 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]he means used to bring a criminal defendant before a court do not deprive that court of personal jurisdiction over the defendant\u201d) (citing <em>United States v.

Rickelman, </em>99 Ill.App.2d 136, 240 N.E.2d 708, 709 (1968) (stating, in a case where an attorney claimed a privilege from a charge of speeding while on his way to court, pursuant to a relevant statute, that \u201c[t]he claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>privilege from arrest is waived by the failure of the defendant to insist upon it at the first opportunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The Supreme Court has addressed waiver under the federal counterpart to our state rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">The waiver provisions of Rule 12(b)(2) are operative only with respect to claims of defects in the institution of criminal proceedings. If its time limits are followed, inquiry into an alleged defect may be concluded and, if necessary, cured before the court, the witnesses, and the parties have gone to the burden and expense of a trial. If defendants were allowed to flout its time limitations, on the other hand, there would be little incentive to comply with its terms when a successful attack might simply result in a new indictment prior to trial. Strong tactical considerations would militate in favor of delaying the raising of the claim in hopes of an acquittal, with the thought that if those hopes did not materialize, the claim could be used to upset an otherwise valid conviction at a time when reprosecution might well be difficult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\"><em>Davis v.

Md. Rule 4-252 requires challenges to a defect in the institution of prosecution to be raised in a timely fashion, prior to trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">(a) Mandatory Motions. In the circuit court, the following matters shall be raised by motion in conformity with this Rule and if not so raised are waived unless the court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">(1) A defect in the institution of the prosecution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">(2) A defect in the charging document other than its failure to show jurisdiction in the court or its failure to charge an offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">(3) An unlawful search, seizure, interception of wire or oral communication, or pretrial identification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">(4) An unlawfully obtained admission, statement, or confession; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">(5) A request for joint or separate trial of defendants or offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">(b) Time for Filing Mandatory Motions.

The alleged violation is an error of law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>subject to Md. Rule 4-252. An alleged lack of personal jurisdiction is also subject to the Rule.
