Where the mother had another child in her custody, did the court err by terminating parental rights, where the court failed to make and articulate a finding about parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances prior to determining what was in the subject children\u2019s best interests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">2. Did the court err by failing to place the children in the care of relatives rather than granting guardianship to the Department of Social Services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">3.

That allegation of neglect ultimately was ruled \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d by DSS, but due to concerns about Ms. H.\u2019s mental health and substance abuse, a DSS caseworker instituted a \u201cSafety Plan,\u201d which required that Ms. H. not be left alone with her children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DSS subsequently transferred the case to the Continuing Services department so further services could be provided to the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In March 2011, Bethany Fisher, a DSS Child Protective Services caseworker assigned to L.B.\u2019s case, had L.B.\u2019s parents sign a new Safety Plan. Ms. Fisher was concerned about Ms. H.\u2019s mental health because Ms. H. was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but she was not receiving treatment or taking her medication. Ms. Fisher also was concerned about Ms. H.\u2019s \u201ccontinuing use of drugs.\u201d Accordingly, the terms of the March 24, 2011, Safety Plan required that Ms. H. continue her mental health treatment and submit to substance abuse evaluation and urinalysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Ms. H. partially complied with the March 2011 Safety Plan. She \u201cdid get back into mental health treatment,\u201d but \u201cshe was not consistenttly] going to her counseling sessions.\u201d Ms. H. completed substance abuse evaluation, and she submitted to random urinalysis. Ms. Fisher referred Ms. H. to various providers of mental health services, substance abuse services, infant and toddler resources, housing resources, and food assistance, but Ms. H. only \u201ccomplied with some of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>In April 2011, Ms. Fisher implemented a \u201cService Plan,\u201d which \u201cidentifie[d] the tasks [DSS was] asking the family to do long term.\u201d The terms of the April 2011 Service Plan were similar to those of the March 2011 Safety Plan. As before, Ms. H. only partially complied with the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">By June 9, 2011, Ms. H. was \u201cmaking progress,\u201d so she and Ms. Fisher executed a new Safety Plan that permitted Ms. H. to be alone with her children. In June 2011, DSS received a new report indicating that Ms. H. was not properly supervising her older child, S.M.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Ms. Fisher updated the Safety Plan to require that Ms. H. \u201cappropriately supervise the children at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">At some point between August and September 2011, Ms. H. and her children were evicted from their home. Ms. H. stayed with friends and family until she could find permanent housing. During that period of time, there were some \u201cdomestic violence issues going on,\u201d and in August 2011, Ms. H. filed for a protective order against L.B.\u2019s father, Mr. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>DSS Places L.B. in Foster Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">On October 3, 2011, Ms. Fisher contacted Ms. H.\u2019s mother, J.H., who informed her that, on the previous evening, Ms. H. and Mr. B. had come to her apartment in an intoxicated state. Ms. Fisher subsequently had difficulty contacting Ms. H. When she called on October 6, 2011, Mr. B. answered Ms. H.\u2019s phone, even though there was an active protective order prohibiting him from being in contact with Ms. H. Ms. Fisher went to Mr. B.\u2019s mother\u2019s house and found L.B., who was \u201cvery dirty\u201d and had \u201cred bumps or a rash on his forehead.\u201d Ms. H.\u2019s family told Ms. Fisher that Ms. H. had \u201cshown up\u201d the night before with a bottle of alcohol in her purse, and she appeared to be intoxicated. Ms. Fisher then \u201cissued shelter care papers,\u201d removed L.B. from Ms. H.\u2019s care, and placed him in foster care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She later testified that L.B. was removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>because Ms. H. \u201cwas not being compliant with her mental health treatment. There were numerous concerns being reported to the department about her alcohol abuse. The family did not have stable housing. [And L.B.] had not been taken to the pediatrician in several months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">L.B.\u2019s foster parent later testified that, when L.B. was first placed with her, he was behind on his immunizations, was experiencing difficulty sleeping, and had a red rash on his face and a staph infection \u201caround his diaper area.\u201d She testified that her experience with Ms. H. had been unpleasant and confrontational. At one point, she filed for a Peace Order after Ms. H. posted \u201cthreatening remarks\u201d on Facebook.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">On October 7, 2011, Ms. Fisher petitioned the circuit court to designate L.B. a Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 26, 2011, the court found that DSS\u2019s allegations were substantiated and designated L.B. a CINA.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">At some point after L.B. was placed in foster care, Ms. H.\u2019s mother, J.H., offered to be \u201ca resource\u201d for him. Ms. Fisher conducted a \u201chome study,\u201d but she did not approve her request to care for L.B. because J.H. was already caring for Ms. H.\u2019s other child, and Ms. Fisher was concerned about J.H.\u2019s ability to care for both at the same time. Another DSS worker who participated in the evaluation testified that they had further concerns that J.H. had mental health issues of her own, that she tried to cover up Ms. H.\u2019s mental health issues, and she was not \u201cgoing to be able to work with the department and be honest about the relationship that she had with [Ms. H].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Ms. Fisher continued working with Ms. H. after L.B. was removed from her care. Although Ms. H. attended weekly visits with L.B., Ms. Fisher noted that Ms. H. \u201cwas not making very much progress regarding her housing situation\u201d or \u201cdoing very much regarding trying to get things together for [L.B,] to be able to come back home to her.\u201d Ms. H. submitted to random urinalysis and tested negative each time, but she failed to attend her mental health sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">On October 7, 2011, Ms. Fisher transferred L.B.\u2019s case to Renee Little in the DSS foster care in-take unit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ms. Little supervised biweekly visits, noting that, \u201cfor the most part,\u201d Ms. H. was attentive and appropriate around L.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In November 2011, Ms. H. obtained Section 8 housing with the assistance of DSS. DSS conducted a home inspection and deemed the home appropriate for L.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">On November 15, 2011, a psychologist conducted a psychological evaluation of Ms. H. The psychologist testified that Ms. H. was a particularly difficult client to interview, and he had concerns about her credibility. He diagnosed Ms. H. \u201cas having Bipolar One Disorder,\u201d although he noted this diagnosis was \u201ctentative\u201d because she denied \u201cany history of symptoms that would be consistent.\u201d He also diagnosed Ms. H. as having \u201cpoly substance abuse\u201d and \u201ca personality disorder with histrionic and anti-social features.\u201d The psychologist testified that he was concerned that, \u201cwithout treatment, her prognosis was very poor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">On December 6, 2011, Ms. H. signed a Service Agreement requiring that she maintain stable and safe housing, secure employment, submit to random urinalysis, and submit to psychological evaluation and mental health counseling. Ms. H.\u2019s compliance was tenuous at first, but it subsequently improved. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>At the time Ms. Little received L.B.\u2019s case, Ms. H. was receiving mental health treatment from \u201cAlliance,\u201d but in December 2011, Ms. H. was \u201cdischarged\u201d from the facility \u201cdue to non compliance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ms. H. then unsuccessfully sought treatment from \u201cUpper Bay,\u201d who she claimed did not return her phone calls. On January 4, 2012, Ms. H. began receiving treatment from \u201cCommunity Behavioral Services,\u201d and she was \u201cactively participating in counseling\u201d during the time Ms. Little had the case. Both Ms. H. and L.B.\u2019s father completed a seven-week parenting skills course. Ms. H. \u201cparticipated sporadically with Alpha\u2019s Glory to get some additional support.\u201d She also submitted to random urinalysis as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">By February 2012, Ms. H.\u2019s compliance had improved to the extent that DSS held a Family Involvement Meeting \u201cto talk about reunification.\u201d At that point, DSS increased Ms. H.\u2019s visitation with L.B., the visits became extended and unsupervised, and DSS moved the visit location to J.H.\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In February 2012, L.B.\u2019s case was transferred to Caitlin Salmon who, at the time, was a foster care continuing worker. During her time with L.B.\u2019s case, Ms. Salmon facilitated visits with L.B. Beginning on March 20, 2012, Ms. H. began to have overnight visits with L.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Ms, Salmon testified that, for the most part, \u201cthings were going pretty well,\u201d Ms. H. was \u201cpretty consistent\u201d and always tested negative when asked to do urinalysis. There were, however, some incidents that concerned Ms. Salmon. L.B.\u2019s foster parents reported that L.B. was \u201cextremely lethargic\u201d when he returned from his first overnight visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">On April 28, 2012, Mr. B. told Ms. Salmon that he had gotten into a physical altercation with Ms. H., which prompted Ms. H. to file for a Peace Order against him. At the Peace Order hearing, J.H. told Ms. Salmon about \u201clots of allegations against\u201d Mr. B., including allegations of sexual abuse, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>led Ms. Salmon to question whether it was appropriate for L.B. to be around Mr. B.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For a short period of time following each of these incidents, Ms. Salmon limited visitation with L.B. to unsupervised day visits before eventually reinstating overnight visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\n<em>L.B.\u2019s Brief Reuni\u00f1cation with Ms. H.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">At some point between the end of April and the beginning of May 2012, Ms. Salmon transferred L.B.\u2019s case to the \u201cFamilies Now\u201d unit, a nine-month \u201cintensive program for children placed out of home either in foster care or kinship care,\u201d which was supervised by Maureen McKinley at DSS.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On or about June 1, 2012, L.B. was returned to Ms. H.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The Families Now unit \u201ccontinued to monitor the placement,\u201d and it provided numerous services to Ms. H., including financial assistance with cable, electricity, phone, groceries, daycare, and transportation expenses, as well as paying for out-patient drug and alcohol treatment. During the first two months of L.B.\u2019s reunification with his mother, Ms. McKinley experienced difficulty monitoring his well-being because Ms. H. frequently was unavailable for visits, and she refused to provide documentation with respect to the services she was supposed to be receiving, particularly mental health and substance abuse treatment. On June 27, 2012, DSS held another Family Involvement Meeting, during which it was decided that L.B. would remain with Ms. H.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">On August 27, 2012, L.B. again was removed from Ms. H.\u2019s care and put back into foster care. The decision to remove L.B. from Ms. H. was based on a combination of issues, including a police report indicating that Ms. H. and her mother got into a physical altercation, as well as Ms. H.\u2019s continuing failure to make herself available to DSS workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>and provide documentation that she was receiving mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">On October 22, 2012, Ms. McKinley created a new Service Agreement, but Ms. H. would not sign it. At some point in the fall of 2012, Ms. H. began receiving substance abuse treatment from the Turning Corners program. She subsequently was discharged for failure to comply with the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\n<em>L.B. \u2019s Brief Placement with Family</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On September 14, 2012, L.B. was placed in the care of Ms. H.\u2019s brother, S.H.(H), and his wife, S.H.(W).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> S.H.(W) set up a weekly visitation schedule for Ms. H. to visit L.B. For the first three weeks, Ms. H. \u201cshowed up on a regular basis.\u201d After that initial period, however, Ms. H. frequently would schedule a visit but then fail to show, without explanation. During the visits that Ms. H. did attend, she often would spend a disproportionate amount of the time questioning S.H.(W) regarding why she could not have unsupervised visits with L.B. and trying to convince S.H.(W) that she could be left alone with L.B., leaving little time actually spent with her son. Ms. H. grew \u201cincreasingly irritable over the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In January 2013, S.H.(W) received a phone call from J.H. informing her that Ms. H. had been hospitalized after \u201cwalking down the street and [saying] there were demons coming after her.\u201d Ms. H. later told S.H.(W) that her hospitalization was precipitated by a drug overdose and \u201ccotton fever.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While Ms. H. was in the hospital, she became aware that she was pregnant with I.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">After approximately five months of caring for L.B., the S.H.\u2019s decided that they could no longer care for him, in part because of the \u201cfriction\u201d and \u201cfamily conflict\u201d involving Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>H.\u2019s mother. S.H.(W) testified that they received \u201cconstant phone calls[,] harassment and ... threats\u201d from Ms. H. and J.H. Ms, H. remained at odds with S.H.(W) because \u201cshe was not willing to bend the rules.\u201d Ms. H. would curse at S.H.(W), call her names, and threaten to beat her up. S.H.(W) also testified that Ms. H. and her mother would \u201crandomly show up at [their] house and start[ ] arguments ... in front of [their] children,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Recognizing that their current situation was unsustainable, both financially and with respect to the continual harassment, S.H.(H) reached out to L.B,\u2019s maternal grandfather, D.H., for help. D.H. responded: \u201cThat\u2019s your sister and that\u2019s your nephew, it\u2019s not my problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">S.H.(H) testified that S.H.(W) \u201cfreaked out\u201d when a DSS worker suggested, around the time of Ms. H.\u2019s January hospitalization, that they may need to adopt L.B. if he was to remain with them. On February 26, 2013, another Family Involvement Meeting was held, and L.B. was transitioned back to his foster family.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">At the February 2013 meeting, D.H., indicated that he and his wife were interested in caring for L.B. DSS subsequently conducted a home study, but D.H. and his wife were not approved because Ms. McKinley had several concerns about their suitability. First, they failed to provide certain information to DSS in a timely manner, including three referral references. Second, Ms. McKinley was concerned that they would simply give L.B. back to Ms. H. after receiving custody of him or, due to D.H.\u2019s \u201ccontentious relationship\u201d with his daughter, fail to follow DSS instructions with respect to permitting or denying visitation with L.B. Finally, Ms. McKinley took into account that L.B. was spending a significant amount of time with his foster parents, whereas D.H. had not requested to visit L.B. at all during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>On April 10, 2013, the circuit court changed L.B.\u2019s permanency plan to adoption. In July 2013, L.B.\u2019s case was transferred to Melissa Wetters in the DSS Home Services unit. Ms. Wetters testified that L.B. remained in foster care because Ms. H. continued to have unaddressed substance abuse and mental health issues, and she \u201chad not progressed in her previous service agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Prom July to October 2013, Ms. H. regularly attended visits with L.B., which were facilitated by Ms. Wetters, but she \u201cspent most of the visits venting\u201d to Ms. Wetters. On July 25, 2013, Ms. Wetters presented a new Service Agreement to Ms. H. Ms. H. refused to sign the agreement, and instead, she directed Ms. Wetters to her attorney. Ms. Wetters testified that, although she \u201ctalked with [Ms. H.] extensively about mental health treatment,\u201d Ms. H. \u201crefused to engage with that.\u201d Ms. Wetters also talked with Ms. H. \u201cabout anger management evaluation and classes, which was a previous term on her Service Agreement, and [Ms. H.] indicated that she had previously completed that, and she was going to [provide] documentation, but she did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\n<em>Initiation of the Department of Social Services\u2019 Interest in I.L.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The Harford County Department of Social Services initially took interest in I.L. on September 18, 2013, when the department received a referral that both Ms. H. and I.L. tested positive for cocaine and opiates at the time of I.L.\u2019s birth, and Ms. H. admitted to using heroin on the day of delivery. On September 20, 2013, Pamela Abramson, a DSS Child Protective Services Investigator, visited the hospital where I.L. was delivered and was informed by hospital staff that I.L. was exhibiting signs of withdrawal and needed medication, but Ms. H. was withholding consent. Ms. Abramson issued \u201cshelter papers,\u201d and I.L. subsequently was placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Shortly after I.L. was born, Ms. H. began to use heroin and cocaine regularly. She failed to attend an intake for a substance abuse evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>On October 10, 2013, a Family Involvement Meeting was held to discuss I.L.\u2019s situation. Ms. Abramson testified that, during the meeting, Ms. H. and I.L.\u2019s father became angry and \u201cstormed out of the meeting.\u201d Around that time, DSS evaluated family members as potential resources for I.L. Ms. Abramson testified that Ms. H.\u2019s father, D.H., approached her, but he \u201cstated he did not want to be a resource at that time.\u201d DSS also investigated Ms. H.\u2019s mother, J.H, but it concluded that she would not be a suitable resource. DSS was concerned about her mental health issues, she already was caring for a severely disabled child, and she \u201cenable[d]\u201d Ms. H. and had a \u201cstrained relationship\u201d with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">On October 23, 2013, the court designated I.L. a CI\u00d1A. The court ordered that I.L. be placed into foster care and that the \u201cprimary Permanency Plan\u201d be \u201creunification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\n<em>DSS Attempts to Reunify I.L. with Ms. H.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">From October 2013 to May 2014, the department\u2019s goal was to get I.L.\u2019s parents stable by addressing their substance abuse, mental health, and housing issues. During those months Ms. H. received some substance abuse treatment, but her mental health issues remained unaddressed and her housing situation unstable.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In March 2014, Ms. Little created a new Service Agreement, which Ms. H. signed. Ms. H. was \u201cminimally\u201d compliant with the terms of the Agreement. Although Ms. H. began to address her substance abuse problem, she did not complete psychological evaluation, seek mental health treatment, obtain steady housing and employment, or complete programs for anger management and parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In May 2014, I.L.\u2019s case was transferred to Noel Francis, a DSS adoption worker. Ms. Francis referred Ms. H. for substance abuse treatment and arranged for her to receive an updated psychological evaluation. Ms. H. refused to see DSS\u2019s psychologist, however, stating that she and her attorney would have an evaluation done by another evaluator. Ms. H. never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>provided any documentation to Ms. Francis indicating that she completed a psychological evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">On October 6, 2014, Ms. H. gave birth to her daughter I.H.L.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Like her two brothers before her, I.H.L. was born with drugs in her system and suffered from withdrawal symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">From August to November 2014, Ms. H. was permitted to have regular unsupervised visits with I.L. Ms. Francis testified that DSS switched Ms. H.\u2019s visits to unsupervised because Ms. H.\u2019s behavior with I.L. had \u201calways been very appropriate\u201d up to that point, and she was reassured by the fact that Ms. H. was, at that time, in the Dayspring program, \u201cwhich was a supervised facility,\u201d and Ms. Francis \u201chad a lot of contact with the staff\u2019 there.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>I.L. \u2019s Permanency Plan Changes to Adoption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Around the end of November 2014, Ms. H. began to \u201cexpress[] a lot of frustration with the Dayspring program,\u201d culminating in her going \u201cAWOL from the program.\u201d Ms. H. was absent from the Dayspring program during the \u201cwhole week of Thanksgiving.\u201d In December 2014, Ms. H. returned to Dayspring, whereupon she was terminated from the program for noncompliance, although she was permitted to reside at their facility until the end of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Ms. H.\u2019s behavior subsequently became very erratic. On December 10, 2014, a Dayspring employee told Ms. Francis that Ms. H. had broken an oven door, thrown things out of a window, and barricaded herself inside her apartment. The employee also told Ms. Francis that Ms. H. was \u201cnot being compliant with mental health treatment,\u201d was \u201cnot taking any psychiatric medication,\u201d and they suspected she was not taking her substance abuse medication appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In December 2014, S.H.(H), Ms. H.\u2019s brother, approached Ms. Francis and conveyed his interest in becoming a placement resource for I.L. Ms. Francis testified that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>S.H.(H) completed the required training, he was \u201cvery clearly aware that [a] home study needed to be completed by Harford County, and a letter was sent to him to that effect,\u201d but he never followed through with the home study and never contacted Ms. Francis about it despite having her personal cell phone number.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In January 2015, Ms. Francis suspended Ms. H.\u2019s visitation with I.L. She testified that Ms. H. had cancelled \u201cpretty much the whole month of January.\u201d Ms. H.\u2019s cancellations gave Ms. Francis cause for concern, particularly one occasion where Ms. H. called to cancel a visit, claiming that she had no transportation. When Ms. Francis offered to send a cab, Ms. H. responded: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a babysitter, and I\u2019m moving out of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In January 2015, the court changed I.L.\u2019s permanency plan to adoption. In April 2015, Ms. Francis referred Ms. H. to the Recovery Court Program, but Ms. H. did not follow through with the referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In the months leading up to the TPR proceedings, Ms. H. became hostile toward Ms. Francis, sending her threatening text messages, including one claiming that she was going to have Ms. Francis charged with kidnapping and another stating: \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay the price one day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">On July 16, 2013, DSS filed a Petition for Guardianship over L.B. On May 29, 2014, Ms. H. consented to the termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>her parental rights to L.B., and the juvenile court entered a guardianship order on the same date. Ms. H. then appealed, arguing that Ms. H.\u2019s consent to terminate her parental rights was defective. On December 18, 2014, this Court remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">On January 9, 2015, DSS filed a Petition for Guardianship over I.L. Between August 2015 and February 2016, the circuit court held consolidated hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\n<em>TPR Proceedings Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">At the consolidated TPR hearings, in addition to the testimony discussed <em>supra, </em>Ms. Francis testified about her lingering concerns regarding Ms. H.\u2019s fitness to parent. She noted that Ms. H. \u201cnever had any stable housing\u201d or employment, had \u201cnot complied with any of the service agreements,\u201d had not been in substance abuse treatment since December 2014, refused to undergo psychological evaluation or obtain mental health treatment, and minimalized I.L.\u2019s developmental problems. Ms. Francis did state, however, that all of Ms. H.\u2019s urinalysis screenings had been negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In support of her case, Ms. H. called addictions specialist Dr. Toyin Opesanmi, who was treating her drug addiction at the time. Dr. Opesanmi testified that she provided post-detox Suboxone maintenance treatment as part of her family medical practice. She began treating Ms. H. in October 2014, after Ms. H. successfully graduated from the Powell substance abuse program.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Dr. Opesanmi provided verbal counseling during every visit, and Ms. H. was \u201cvery teachable\u201d and \u201c[v]ery easily redirected.\u201d Dr. Opesanmi acknowledged that she was not a licensed counselor, but rather, she provided counseling as part of a holistic practice, and if a mental health issue was \u201cover [her] head,\u201d she would refer them to a psychiatrist. She testified that Ms. H. needed counseling from an independent counselor as part of her treatment, but she had not referred Ms. H. to one because Ms. H. had \u201cher own counselor coming to [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Ms. H. testified that, after graduating from the Powell program, she moved to a motel in Delaware to prevent DSS from becoming involved with her daughter, I.H.L. She did some \u201cside jobs\u201d and was relying on public assistance and family members for income. In reference to questioning about various service agreements, she stated that, in the past, she had to \u201cdo whatever [Child Protective Services] CPS tells me in order to have my kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\n<em>The Circuit Court\u2019s Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On February 3, 2016, the circuit court granted DSS\u2019 petitions for guardianship. It found DSS\u2019 witnesses to be credible, and the testimony of Ms. H.\u2019s witnesses generally to be lacking in detail and credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The court then addressed the statutory factors set forth in Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 5-323(d) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d), which a court must consider in a TPR case. With respect to the services offered to the parent before placement, the court found that DSS provided \u201ca full panoply\u201d of timely services, including \u201crental housing assistance, drug treatment, mental health treatment, the Infants and Toddlers Program ..., Food Stamps, Medical Assistance, transportation money, employment referrals, parenting classes, anger management, ... [and] cell phones.\u201d With respect to whether DSS and Ms. H. had fulfilled their obligations, it found that DSS \u201cfollowed through with everything it said it would do,\u201d but Ms. H. failed to comply with her obligations with respect to drug treatment, mental health evaluation and treatment, stable and verifiable housing, and stable and verifiable employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">With respect to Ms. H.\u2019s efforts to adjust to her \u201ccircumstances, condition, or conduct\u201d to make it in her children\u2019s best interest to return home, the court first considered Ms. H.\u2019s contact with her children. The court found that Ms. H. did not maintain consistent contact with either L.B. or I.L., noting that she attended only 36 of 63 visits with L.B., and that her consistency with respect to I.L. was sporadic. It then found that Ms. H. was \u201cnot able to adjust to her circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>because she hasn\u2019t sought treatment that is required,\u201d and instead of working with the Department, she \u201cthreatened and verbally accosted a DSS worker, which led to a Final Peace Order being entered against her on September 1, 2015.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">With respect to whether Ms. H. had a parental disability that affected her ability to consistently care for her children, the court found that Ms. H. was diagnosed with PTSD, polysubstance abuse, and \u201ca mood disorder or bipolar disorder,\u201d and she would \u201cneed at least six months of clean and sober living and mental health treatment before she is even able to parent with assistance.\u201d The court found that additional services would not \u201cbring about a lasting parental adjustment so that the children could be returned home within an ascertainable period of time not to exceed 18 months from the date of placement.\u201d It explained that \u201c[b]oth parents ... testified that they have a deep mistrust of DSS or any of the agencies or other organizations to which referrals have been made,\u201d and \u201cneither parent has ever availed themselves of any of the services\u201d that were offered to them by DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Although the court found that the factor with respect to abuse and neglect was \u201cnot a relevant consideration in this case,\u201d the court was required to consider a related factor: Whether, upon birth, the child tested positive for drugs and the parent refused drug treatment. The court found that Ms. H. tested positive for opiates when she gave birth to both L.B. and I.L., and in LL.\u2019s case, Ms. H. refused to consent to treatment. The court also noted that, although Ms. H.\u2019s daughter I.H.L., was not a party to the proceedings, it was a concern that she also was born addicted to drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">With respect to treatment for her addictions, the court found that Ms. H. \u201chas had five different substance abuse providers and only successfully completed one.\u201d It recognized that Dr. Opesanmi\u2019s testimony generally was supportive of Ms. H.\u2019s case in some aspects, but it stated that her testimony \u201cdid nothing to refute the overwhelming quantum of evidence put on by the department.\u201d In particular, the court stated that, although \u201ccounseling is a necessary component of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>certified drug treatment program, [Dr. Opesanmi was] only a certified provider to dispense ... medication ..., not to provide counseling, which she clearly stated would be ... outside of her qualifications.\u201d The court stated that it gave \u201clow\u201d weight to Dr. Opesanmi\u2019s testimony because she did not testify to \u201ca reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d and she only dispensed medication, which was \u201cnot the same as proving certified addictions counseling,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Finally, with respect to the children\u2019s emotional ties to Ms. H. and others, the court found that neither child had an emotional connection with their mother or siblings. On the other hand, it found that both L.B. and I.L. had become well-adjusted to their loving foster families.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">So having considered all these factors, this Court does find by clear and convincing evidence that it is in [L.B.\u2019s] and [I.L.\u2019s] best interest to grant the department\u2019s petition, and accordingly, the Court issues an Order to the local department with the right to consent to adoption and long-term care short of adoption, thereby terminating the natural parental rights of [Ms. H.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">On February 9, 2016, the court issued written orders in both cases terminating Ms. H.\u2019s parental rights and granting guardianship to DSS. In each order, the court included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">WHEREAS, as a result of a trial on the merits being held before this Court and the Court having considered all the factors outlined in [FL \u00a7 5-323], and the Court having found by clear and convincing evidence that the natural mother is an unfit parent and that extraordinary circumstances exist and that it is in the child\u2019s best interest that the natural mother\u2019s parental rights be terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">We review orders terminating parental rights using three interrelated standards. The Court of Appeals recently set forth the standard of review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6C2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u201c[W]hen the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Rule 8-131 (c) ] applies. [Second,] [i]f it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXG\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. 90, 100, 8 A.3d 745 (2010) (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Victor A., </em>386 Md. 288, 297, 872 A.2d 662 (2005)). <em>Accord In re Adoption/Guardianship of Jasmine D., </em>217 Md.App. 718, 733, 94 A.3d 837 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"AS9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AiD\">h-(</p>\n<p id=\"A5OH\">Termination of Ms. H.\u2019s Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"A9U\">Ms. H. argues that the court erred in terminating her parental rights. In support, she contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aze\">[Ms. H.\u2019s] past failures in drug treatment, mental health counseling, housing, and employment did not necessarily make her unfit to remain in a legal relationship with her children, in light of her current success in recovering from her addiction and her demonstrated ability to parent an infant without [S]tate intervention. There was no evidence presented that [Ms. H.\u2019s] infant child, [I.H.L.], was not receiving proper care and attention, so it follows that [Ms. H.] was sufficiently fit to maintain a relationship with L. and I. with the goal of eventually having custody of them returned to her. The court failed to explain how, if at all, [Ms. H.\u2019s] failures rendered her unfit to remain L. and I.\u2019s legal parent, or created exceptional circumstances that made it contrary to L. and I.\u2019s best interests to remain in the Constitutionally-protected relationship with their natural parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The Department contends that the circuit court \u201cproperly terminated Ms. H.\u2019s parental rights to [L.B.] and [I.L.] after finding exceptional circumstances and that Ms. H. was unfit to parent them due to her failure to remedy her chronic substance abuse and stabilize her living situation.\u201d It disagrees with Ms. H.\u2019s contention that the juvenile court \u201c \u2018failed to articulate how its findings on the factors in [FL] \u00a7 5 \u2014 323(d) lead to a conclusion that [Ms. H.] ... is unfit or that exceptional circumstances exist,\u2019 \u201d stating that the extensive factual findings issued from the bench, \u201ccombined with the written TPR orders, more than adequately show how the court concluded that Ms. H. is an unfit parent and that exceptional circumstances warrant termination of her parental rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The Department also disagrees with Ms. H.\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s decision should be reversed because \u201c[t]he uncon-troverted evidence was that [Ms. H.] had an infant, [I.H.L.], in her care, and she was providing proper and ordinary care for her without the need for [S]tate intervention.\u201d It contends that Ms. H.\u2019s \u201cfrequent moves and failure to keep the Department apprised of her residence,\u201d along with her intentional move to Delaware \u201cto prevent the Department from having any involvement with her infant\u2019s care,\u201d could \u201cexplain why [I.H.L.] was not in the Department\u2019s care.\u201d In any event, DSS argues that the circuit court \u201cexpressly discredited the testimony of Ms. H. and the witnesses she called about her ability to parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Appellee children make similar arguments. They contend that the circuit court \u201ccorrectly granted the guardianship petitions ... after properly considering the clear and convincing evidence that the parents were substance abusers and not compliant with recommended treatment, demonstrating that the parents were unfit and that termination was in the best interests of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The Law on TPR Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Before we address Ms. H.\u2019s specific claims, we first review the law applicable to TPR cases. This Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>recognized the \u201cfundamental right of parents generally to direct and control the upbringing of their children.\u201d <em>Brandenburg v. LaBarre, </em>193 Md.App. 178, 186, 996 A.2d 939 (2010) (quoting <em>Koshko v. </em>Haining, 398 Md. 404, 422, 921 A.2d 171 (2007)). We have noted, however, that a parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise his or her child, however, is not absolute. That right \u201cmust be balanced against the fundamental right and responsibility of the State to protect children, who cannot protect themselves, from abuse and neglect.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. 477, 497, 937 A.2d 177 (2007). Parental rights may be terminated, but it \u201cis a \u2018drastic\u2019 measure, and should only be taken with great caution.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Harold H., </em>171 Md.App. 564, 576, 911 A.2d 464 (2006) (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. J9610436 &amp; J9711031, </em>368 Md. 666, 699, 796 A.2d 778 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In determining whether to terminate parental rights, \u201cit is unassailable that the paramount consideration is the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T00032005, </em>141 Md.App. 570, 581, 786 A.2d 64 (2001). <em>Accord Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. at 112, 8 A.3d 745 (\u201c[T]he child\u2019s best interest has always been the transcendent standard in adoption, third-party custody cases, and TPR proceedings.\u201d); <em>Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 496, 937 A.2d 177 (\u201c[T]he best interest of the child remains the ultimate governing standard.\u201d). It is generally presumed \u201cthat it is in the best interest of children to remain in the care and custody of their parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 937 A.2d 177. That presumption, however, \u201cmay be rebutted upon a showing either that the parent is \u2018unfit\u2019 or that \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 exist which would make continued custody with the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">FL \u00a7 5-323(b) gives juvenile courts the authority to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\"><em>Authority. </em>\u2014 If, after consideration of factors as required in this section, a juvenile court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a parent is unfit to remain in a parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>relationship with the child or that exceptional circumstances exist that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interests of the child such that terminating the rights of the parent is in a child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court may grant guardianship of the child without consent otherwise required under this subtitle and over the child\u2019s objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Court\u2019s Explanation for Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We address first Ms. H.\u2019s contention that the circuit court did not properly articulate <em>how </em>its factual findings lead to its conclusions regarding parental unfitness, the existence of exceptional circumstances, and the best interest of the child. For the reasons set forth below, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In <em>Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. at 110, 8 A.3d 745, the Court of Appeals approved the following framework for courts to apply in TPR cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201cThe court\u2019s role in TPR cases is to give the most careful consideration to the relevant statutory factors, to make specific findings based on the evidence with respect to each of them, and, mindful of the presumption favoring a continuation of the parental relationship, determine expressly whether those findings suffice either to show an unfitness on the part of the parent to remain in a parental relationship with the child or to constitute an exceptional circumstance that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child, and, if so, how. If the court does that \u2014 articulates its conclusion as to the best interest of the child in that manner \u2014 the parental rights we have recognized and the statutory basis for terminating those rights are in proper and harmonious balance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">(emphasis added) (quoting <em>Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 501, 937 A.2d 177).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Here, although the circuit court could have stated more expressly how its factual findings led to its conclusion of parental unfitness and exceptional circumstances, we agree with appellees that a review of the court\u2019s oral statements and written order makes clear that the court found unfitness and exceptional circumstances based on its careful evaluation of the statutory factors and its conclusion that Ms. H. failed to stabilize her living situation so that she could be a responsible parent to her children. The circuit court explicitly credited the Department\u2019s witnesses and found that Ms. H. failed to address and remedy the conditions that precipitated the initial removal of her children. It found that Ms. H. was offered a \u201cfull panoply of services,\u201d starting in 2009, to help her become a responsible parent, but she failed to take advantage of many of those opportunities. Ms. H.\u2019s continuing failure to become sober and stable within a reasonable amount of time, her inconsistent presence in the lives of L.B. and I.L., and her inability to work with the Department to achieve reunification, convinced the court that she was unfit to remain in a parental relationship with L.B. and I.L. and that there were exceptional circumstances that made a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interests of the children. We conclude that the record adequately reflects the rationale of the circuit court in determining that Ms. H. was an unfit parent and that exceptional circumstances justified termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Ms. H.\u2019s second contention is that the circuit court erred in terminating her parental rights because there was insufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that she was unfit to have a continued parental relationship with her children or that there existed exceptional circumstances that made a continued parental relationship detrimental to the children\u2019s best interest. In support, she asserts that there was \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d that she was \u201cproviding proper and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ordinary care for [I.H.L.] without the need for [S]tate intervention,\u201d and therefore, \u201cit follows\u201d that she was \u201csufficiently fit to maintain a relationship with\u201d L.B. and I.L. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"AJo\">As appellees note, there was no evidence to support the assertion that Ms. H. was properly caring for her infant child. Indeed, Ms. H. admitted that she moved to Delaware for the express purpose of preventing DSS from becoming involved with her infant daughter. Ms. H. cannot prevent the State from evaluating her fitness as a parent with respect to I.H.L. and then insist that the court simply accept her self-serving evidence that she is properly caring for her daughter. This contention is devoid of merit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVqJ\">The circuit court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous, and it was proper for the court to credit the Department\u2019s overwhelming evidence that Ms. H. had not sufficiently addressed her problems to remain in a parental relationship with L.B. and I.L. Accordingly, the court\u2019s ultimate determination to terminate Ms. H.\u2019s parental rights was supported by the record, and it did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AVr\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">Guardianship Decision</p>\n<p id=\"ABV\">Ms. H. next argues that the circuit court erred by granting guardianship to the Department,' as opposed to placing the children in the care of relatives, such as \u201ctheir grandparents or uncle, all of whom testified to their ability to provide care for their relatives.\u201d She asserts that, \u201c[w]here it is possible for a child, who cannot be returned to a parent, to be placed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>a relative, the relevant statutes require that the Department facilitate a relative placement.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The Department argues that Ms. H. \u201clacks standing on the issue,\u201d and therefore, \u201cthis Court need not address\u201d her arguments. It contends that, \u201c[g]iven that the juvenile court properly terminated Ms. H.\u2019s parental rights over [L.B. and I.L.] after affording her a full and fair opportunity to litigate those rights, Ms. H. is now a legal stranger to the children who has no duties, no obligations, and no rights toward the children,\u201d and therefore, she lacks standing to attack the \u201ccourt\u2019s separate order awarding guardianship of the children to the Department.\u201d The Department argues that, \u201calthough Ms. H. has an interest in the circuit court\u2019s guardianship order, she holds no standing to challenge an aspect of that order that pertains to third parties, i.e., the court\u2019s choice of guardian for the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In any event, DSS argues, even if Ms. H. had standing on the issue of the children\u2019s placement, her claim is without merit. DSS asserts that \u201cit was within the juvenile court\u2019s discretion to award guardianship to the Department,\u201d and the evidence \u201cmilitate[d] against\u201d placing the children with Ms. H.\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Appellee children argue that the circuit court \u201cis charged, first and foremost, with making decisions that are in the best interest of the child.\u201d They contend that \u201cthe Department considered placement with various relatives and determined that placement with those relatives was contrary to the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>interests of L.B. and I.L., who have each spent several years, and the better part of their lives, \"with their foster families,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In her reply brief, and in a supplemental brief filed after oral argument, Ms. H. argues that she does have standing to challenge the court\u2019s decision to grant guardianship of her children to the Department rather than to a relative. She asserts that \u201cdenial of a request to place the children with relatives is not an issue that is separate from the other issues that arise at a termination hearing,\u201d and \u201cwhen a trial court denies a request by a parent to grant guardianship to a relative rather than the Department, the parent has standing to challenge that decision on appeal as an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Ms. H. further asserts \u201cthat a parent retains the post-guardianship right to notice of the post-guardianship review hearings and the right to be heard and participate supports the proposition that parents have standing <em>vis a vis </em>the subject child even after their legal relationship has been extinguished.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Before reaching the merits <em>vel non </em>of Ms. H.\u2019s claims, we first must address the threshold question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>she has standing to challenge the placement of L.B. and I.L. \u201cOne requirement of justiciability is that the plaintiff have standing in the sense that the person is entitled to invoke the judicial process in a particular instance.\u201d <em>Adams v. Manown, </em>328 Md. 463, 480, 615 A.2d 611 (1992). As this Court recently explained in <em>State v. Phillips, </em>210 Md.App. 239, 257, 63 A.3d 51 (2013):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201c[Standing is a threshold issue; a party may proceed only if [he or she] demonstrates that he has a real and justiciable interest that is capable of being resolved through litigation.\u201d <em>Norman v. Borison, </em>192 Md.App. 405, 420, 994 A.2d 1019 (2010), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>418 Md. 630, 17 A.3d 697 (2011). \u201cIn order to have standing, a party must demonstrate an \u2018injury-in-fact,\u2019 or \u2018an actual legal stake in the matter being adjudicated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hand v. Mfrs. &amp; Traders Trust Co., </em>405 Md. 375, 399, 952 A.2d 240 (2008)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">(parallel citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The question presented here is whether, after the circuit court terminated Ms. H.\u2019s parental rights, she had standing to challenge the court\u2019s order granting guardianship to the Department. The Maryland appellate courts have held that, once there has been a final termination of parental rights, the parents of the child are no longer interested parties with standing to challenge subsequent legal proceedings regarding the children. <em>See Hale v. Cramer, </em>254 Md. 592, 597, 255 A.2d 37 (1969) (where the unwed, natural mother of a child consented to a guardianship with the right to consent to adoption, she had no standing to challenge the guardian\u2019s decision to consent to the child\u2019s adoption or to intervene in the subsequent adoption proceedings); <em>Qureshi v. Dir., Prince George\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>11 Md.App. 615, 622-23, 276 A.2d 675 (1971) (mother\u2019s consent to petition for guardianship with consent for adoption of her newborn baby terminated her parental rights, and mother lacked standing subsequent to the issuance of the final guardianship decree to challenge DSS procedures). <em>See also </em>FL \u00a7 5-325(a) (an order granting guardianship of an individual \u201cterminates a parent\u2019s duties, obligations, and rights toward the individual\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The above cases, however, dealt with situations where the termination of parental rights was deemed to be final in a situation where: (1) there was no challenge on appeal to the guardianship order; or (2) the appellate court affirmed the initial order. It was in that context that the courts held that the parents had no standing to challenge subsequent legal proceedings regarding the children. <em>Hale, </em>254 Md. at 597, 255 A.2d 37; <em>Qureshi, </em>11 Md.App. at 622-23, 276 A.2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Other courts have reached similar conclusions and held that, when a party fails to challenge the termination of his or her parental rights, the party loses any interest in the guardianship of the party\u2019s child. For example, in <em>In Interest of D.B., </em>483 N.W.2d 344, 345 (Iowa Ct.App.1992), the juvenile court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights, denied the aunt\u2019s request for guardianship, and granted custody to the State. The Court of Appeals of Iowa held that the mother, in failing to challenge the termination of her parental rights, allowed that portion of the order to become final, and because the termination of her parental rights concerning her child divested her \u201cof all privileges, duties and powers with respect to the child,\u201d she relinquished any legally recognizable interest she would have concerning the guardianship or custody of her child. <em>Id. </em>at 346. Because the mother was not, therefore, aggrieved by the court\u2019s order giving guardianship of the child to the State, as opposed to the child\u2019s aunt, she did not have standing to challenge the court\u2019s placement of the child following the termination. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Accord Ryder v. State, </em>917 S.W.2d 503, 505 (Tex.App.-Waco 1996) (parent lacked standing to challenge child\u2019s placement where the termination of her parental rights became final after she failed to perfect an appeal from the termination decree); <em>State, in interest of J.S., </em>272 P.3d 169, 170 (Utah Ct.App.2012) (parents had no standing to appeal placement of children with foster parents instead of relatives because, once parental rights were terminated, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>finding not challenged, parents had no protected interest in the children\u2019s custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Here, however, Ms. H. has appealed the propriety of the court\u2019s order terminating her parental rights. The parties have not cited, and we have not found, any Maryland case addressing the issue whether, in an appeal challenging an order terminating parental rights, the parent retains standing to challenge the court\u2019s decision, made during the same proceedings, regarding guardianship of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Other courts, however, have addressed the issue, with differing results. Some courts have found that parents do not have standing to challenge the placement of their children once an appellate court affirms the termination of their parental rights. For example, in <em>Matter of Adoption of J.S.P.L., </em>532 N.W.2d 653 (N.D.1995), father appealed from a judgment terminating his parental rights and granting a petition to adopt the children. On appeal the Supreme Court of North Dakota upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling terminating father\u2019s parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 665. With respect to father\u2019s claims regarding the adoption of the children, the court stated that once it concluded that the trial court properly terminated father\u2019s parental rights, father \u201csimply no longer has standing to object to anything concerning the children or their adoptive placement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">\u201c[Ajfter a parent\u2019s parental rights have been terminated under the Act, that parent has no remaining residual rights of any kind, nor does that parent have any standing to raise any concerns or state any preferences regarding the ultimate placement of his or her child for adoption. When viewed from the perspective of the child, the parent whose parental rights have been terminated no longer exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHy\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In the Interest of C.B., </em>221 Ill.App.3d 686, 164 Ill.Dec. 553, 583 N.E.2d 107, 108 (1991)). The court concluded that, because father did not have standing with respect to the issues raised regarding the adoption, it would not address them. <em>Id. Accord In re E.A.T., </em>296 Mont. 535, 989 P.2d 860, 862, 863-64 (1999) (because appellate court upheld termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of a mother\u2019s parental rights, mother was divested of all legal rights with respect to the child and did not have standing to object to court\u2019s placement of the child with the State as opposed to the child\u2019s grandmother).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Other courts, however, have held that parents whose parental rights have been terminated may challenge on appeal a trial court\u2019s orders with respect to matters other than the termination of their parental rights, such as placement and visitation, as long as those decisions occurred in the process of terminating the parental rights. For example, in <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 409 S.E.2d 460, 461 (1991), a mother appealed an order terminating her parental rights and granting custody of her child to the Department of Human Development, as opposed to the child\u2019s maternal grandmother. The court upheld the decision to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights, but it rejected the Department\u2019s argument that the mother \u201clack[ed] standing to raise this issue since her residual parental rights [had] been terminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464. Noting that, by statute, the court was required to accompany an order terminating parental rights with an order granting custody, the Court of Appeals of Virginia stated that the child\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnG\">placement was a part of the process terminating [the mother\u2019s] parental rights, not a separate proceeding. While [the mother] may lose standing to contest future matters relating to [the child] after her residual parental rights have been terminated, she has standing to contest any portion of the process terminating her rights, including [the child\u2019s] placement with the Department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><em>Id. Accord In re Adoption of Rico, </em>453 Mass. 749, 905 N.E.2d 552, 560 n. 16 (2009) (where \u201cvisitation order, however, was part of the adjudication of a termination proceeding to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the father was a party,\u201d father had standing to challenge visitation order on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Pursuant to these authorities, it is clear that, once an order terminating parental rights becomes final, the parent has no standing to challenge future matters regarding the child. In the situation where a parent challenges the termination of parental rights on appeal, however, we hold that the parent retains standing to raise on appeal an issue relating to \u201cany portion of the process terminating her rights,\u201d including the child\u2019s placement with the Department. Once the termination of parental rights is affirmed on appeal, however, the order becomes final, and the parent no longer has standing to challenge decisions relating to the child, including the circuit court\u2019s order regarding placement of the child. Accordingly, because we have affirmed the order terminating Ms. H.\u2019s parental rights, she no longer has standing to contest the court\u2019s decision regarding guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Even if Ms. H. had standing to contest the placement of the children, we would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting guardianship to DSS. Ms. H. identifies three potential family members that she argues would be preferable to placing the children with the State, her mother, J.H., her brother, S.H.(H), or her father, D.H. The record reflects, however, as the Department asserts, that the circuit court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion when it awarded guardianship to the Department rather than to relatives who were not viable placement options.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">With respect to J.H., the Department\u2019s witnesses testified that she already was caring for Ms. H.\u2019s older child, and she had mental health problems of her own, harassed S.H.(H) and S.H.(W) when L.B. was in their care, and was not honest with and able to work with DSS. With respect to S.H.(H), the court found that L.B.\u2019s prior placement with him and his wife was \u201cthwarted by [Ms. H.\u2019s] constant harassment, repeated requests for unsupervised [visits], name calling, and unfounded accusations.\u201d Moreover, DSS witnesses asserted, and S.H.(H) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>conceded, that he never completed the process to become certified as a placement resource for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">With respect to D.H., he and his wife were not approved as placements due to concern about their suitability, including their failure to provide information to the Department in a timely manner, their \u201ccontentious relationship\u201d with Ms. H., which raised concern about whether they would follow the Department\u2019s instructions regarding visitation, and their lack of contact with the children. Indeed, when S.H.(H) asked for help with L.B., D.H. stated that it was \u201cnot [his] problem,\u201d and he refused to assist S.H.(H) with L.B.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Moreover, the court, as it was required to do, took into consideration the children\u2019s emotional attachments. The court found that L.B. and I.L. had become well-adjusted to their respective foster families, but they did not have any significant relationships with their uncle or grandparents. Under these circumstances, even if Ms. H. had standing to contest the decision, we would conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting guardianship to DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HAR-FORD COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We note that the record reflects that the Department explored potential relative placement, but it determined that was not a viable option. Ms. H. did not argue below that this assessment was erroneous, and our review of the record does not reflect any request by Ms. H. that the court place her children with relatives. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for Ms. H. to persuasively argue that the court erred or abused its discretion in granting guardianship to the Department, as opposed to relatives. <em>See Weatherly v. Great Coastal Express Co., </em>164 Md.App. 354, 386, 883 A.2d 924 (2005) (appellant may not be heard to complain on appeal about a ruling the court was never asked to make). The Department does not argue, however, that Ms. H. has failed to preserve this issue for this Court\u2019s review, and therefore, we will proceed to address the arguments presented by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. As noted, Ms. H. has not asserted that she made, and we could not find in the record, any request that the court grant guardianship of a child to a relative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">. In this regard, Ms. H. relies on: (1) Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 5-326 of the Family Law Article (\"FL\u201d), which addresses guardianship review hearings; and (2) <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. 11387, 11388, </em>354 Md. 574, 731 A.2d 972 (1999), which held, in addressing a prior statute regarding post-guardianship review hearings, that a natural parent whose parental rights had been terminated had a statutory right to participate in the hearing. As the Department points out, the cited case is of limited value because \u00a7 5-326 replaced the prior statute, and the new statute reflects the General Assembly\u2019s view that a parent who has had his or her parental rights terminated does not have party status in guardianship review hearings. FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 326(a)(3)(iii) (\"[A] parent is not a party [to a guardianship review proceeding] solely on the basis of the right to notice or opportunity to be heard or participate at a guardianship review hearing.\u201d). This statute, which was not referenced prior to argument, is not instructive to the issue on appeal, i.e., whether a parent who has had his or her parental rights terminated has standing, on appeal from that order, to challenge the court\u2019s additional order awarding guardianship of the child to the Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\">.
