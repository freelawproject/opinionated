Code Ann. (2014). The MPIA also allows an agency to waive fees upon the request of an applicant if, \u201cafter considering the applicant\u2019s ability to pay and other relevant factors, the official custodian determines that the waiver would be in the public interest.\u201d GP \u00a7 4-206(e)(2). The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether an official custodian may take a community organization\u2019s past criticisms of the agency into account in deciding whether granting the organization\u2019s fee waiver request is in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The Action Committee for Transit (\u201cACT\u201d) and Benjamin Ross appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in favor of the Town of Chevy Chase.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ACT and Ross assert that the Town violated the MPIA when it denied their requests for waivers of fees that the Town proposed to charge them for responding to requests for copies of certain Town records. The circuit court concluded that the Town did not violate the Act and entered judgment accordingly. ACT and Ross present two issues, which, for purposes of analysis, are best expressed in terms of whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the Town as to the claims of ACT on the one hand, and Ross on the other.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>We will vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201cIn cases interpreting an MPIA request, facts necessary to the determination of a motion for summary judgment may be placed before the court by pleadings, affidavit, deposition, answers to interrogatories, admission of facts, stipulations and concessions.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. The Washington Post Co., </em>149 Md.App. 289, 304, 815 A.2d 859 (2003) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Our summary of the facts is drawn from those sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">ACT is a non-stock, non-profit organization that advocates for public transportation in Montgomery County, Maryland. Ross is a published author who has -written extensively in print and electronic media about issues regarding the Purple Line. He lives in Bethesda. The Town is a Maryland municipal corporation and, as such, is subject to the MPIA. Todd Hoffman, the Town Manager, is the official custodian of the Town\u2019s public records. <em>See </em>GP \u00a7 4-101(f).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The controversy between the parties concerns the Purple Line, a proposed light rail public transit system that, if constructed, will extend from Bethesda to New Carrollton. The Purple Line is a multi-billion dollar project that is proposed to be funded through a combination of federal, State, local, and private sources.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Current plans call for a portion of the Purple Line to be located within in a former railroad right-of-way which is currently used as a linear park known as the Georgetown Branch Trail or the Capital Crescent Trail. Part of this trail is located within the Town. Town residents and property owners will be directly affected by the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and operation of the Purple Line. The Town opposes the project.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">ACT and Ross allege that, in 2008, and as part of its effort to oppose construction of the Purple Line, the Town retained the law firm of Sidley Austin and a civil engineer to review the Maryland Transit Administration\u2019s Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Purple Line. ACT and Ross allege that the Town spent approximately $434,000 in that effort. ACT and Ross further allege that in 2014, the Town retained the law firm, of Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney (the \u201cBuchanan Firm\u201d), which in turn subcontracted with two lobbying firms, Chambers, Conlon &amp; Harwell, LLC (the \u201cChambers Firm\u201d) and Alexander &amp; Cleaver, P.A. (the \u201cAlexander Firm\u201d). The Town also retained the public relations firm Xenophon Strategies. All four firms were retained to represent the Town\u2019s interests in lobbying both the federal and state governments to deny funding for the Purple Line, The Town paid the Buchanan Firm $20,000 monthly for its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Early in 2014, the Washington Post and other news sources published several articles detailing the Town\u2019s relationship with the four firms, including some details on the monthly fees the Town paid for the firms\u2019 services. Additionally, an article in the Washington Post reported that one of the partners in the Buchanan Firm was Robert L. Shuster, whose brother, Bill Shuster, is the chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee of the United States House of Representatives.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Spurred by the information contained in these articles, ACT and Ross sought access to the Town\u2019s records pertaining to the Town\u2019s relationship with these firms. To that end, both ACT and Ross filed a series of MPIA requests with the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ACT\u2019s first request was submitted in February, 2014. ACT sought documents regarding the Town\u2019s relationship with the Buchanan Firm; it did not request a fee waiver. The Town provided copies of all non-privileged documents that were responsive to the request without charge because the time spent by Town staff in responding was less than two hours. <em>See </em>GP \u00a7 4-206(c) (\u201cThe official custodian may not charge a fee for the first 2 hours that are needed\u201d to respond to a request to inspect public records.).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">ACT filed two additional requests in April. The first sought documents pertaining to the Town\u2019s relationship with the Chambers and Alexander Firms, as well as any additional documents pertaining to the Buchanan Firm. The second request sought access to privileged documents relating to the Buchanan Firm and documents concerning the Town\u2019s relationship with Xenophon Strategies.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In response to the first April request, Hoffman, the Town Manager, stated that the Town staff would begin searching for documents responsive to the request upon ACT\u2019s deposit of $700, noting that it would not provide the two hours of free research because ACT\u2019s request was on the same general topic as its February request. As to the second April request, Mr. Hoffman stated that it would provide two hours of free research, but still required a deposit of $250 before it would begin research on the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">ACT then requested a fee waiver for both April requests. The Town denied the waiver request on April 23, 2014. By way of explanation, Mr. Hoffman stated that \u201c[i]t is anticipated that the Town will expend a significant amount of time researching and processing [t]he requests.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">On May 21, 2014, ACT submitted another request for documents, asking for substantially the same information sought in the April requests. Meriam Schoenbaum, a part-time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>news blogger, submitted the request on ACT\u2019s behalf, requesting a fee waiver based upon ACT\u2019s status as a non-profit and its intent to disseminate the information, and her own status as a journalist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Town denied Ms. Schoenbaum\u2019s request for a fee waiver on June 20, 2014 on both grounds. By way of explanation, the Town\u2019s letter stated that: \u201cIn your request, you outline your arguments in support of a waiver of all fees .... Please be advised your request for a waiver has been considered and denied.\u201d The Town further stated that it would not provide the two hours of free research because the previous request filed by ACT related to the same general topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">This brings us to the two MPIA requests that are at issue in this appeal: ACT\u2019s request dated October 15, 2014 (the \u201cACT Request\u201d), and Ross\u2019s request, which was one of two filed by him on November 10, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The ACT Request sought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">copies of public records relating to contracts, agreements, and communications between [the Town] and the four firms the Town retained to provide services in relation to the Purple Line public transit project. ACT also seeks full minutes of closed sessions held by the Town Council .... ACT makes this request in order to promote the public\u2019s understanding of the Town and the conduct of its public officials in conducting public business relating a major public infrastructure project. ACT intends to contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding by making public the requested records and the information the records contain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">As part of its request, ACT sought a waiver of fees on three grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">(1) it was entitled to a fee waiver because \u201cthe information requested will serve the public interest and contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the business, activities, and public-money expenditures of a government body related to a major public infrastructure project\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(2) it was not seeking the information for any commercial purpose; and</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">(3) ACT did not have the financial resources to pay any fee associated with its request because it was a grassroots, public interest organization run by volunteers, and because its charter requires that any assets to be donated to a 501(c)(3) charitable organization upon dissolution. However, ACT did not attach any documentary support for these assertions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On October 27, 2014, counsel for the Town responded to ACT. First, the Town denied ACT\u2019s request for a fee waiver. By way of explanation for the denial, counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">As you know, the [MPIA] authorizes the Town to charge a reasonable fee for making copies and a reasonable fee for researching its records. In your request, you outline your arguments in support of a waiver of all fees associated with the request. Please be advised the request for a waiver has been considered and is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Additionally, counsel explained that the Town would not provide two hours of free research because the request related \u201cto the same general topic\u201d as ACT\u2019s previous request. Finally, counsel provided ACT with an estimate of $879 for the fee the Town would charge to respond to the request and requested that amount as a deposit before the Town processed ACT\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">On November 10, 2014, Ross submitted two MPIA requests to the Town. The first was titled: \u201cRe: Maryland Public Information Act Request on behalf of Action Committee for Transit[.]\u201d Ross almost immediately withdrew this request and submitted a second request titled \u201cRe: Maryland Public Information Act Request[.]\u201d Titles aside, the two requests were largely identical, although Ross\u2019s second request contained more detail on his status as a member of the media. In both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>letters, he specified that he was submitting the request as a member of the media:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">I am submitting the following request as a member of the media. I am a published author who writes on issues of public interest, such as chemical pollution and urban development. I have written extensively on issues regarding the Purple Line in both print and electronic media. For the last 14 years, I have regularly contributed articles and (in more recent years) blog posts to <em>Dissent </em>magazine and I have written there on issues regarding the Purple Line. I also write at Greater Greater [sic] Washington blog. The purpose of this blog is to provide information about elected officials, development, traffic, and other matters impacting the Greater Washington area, including Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Included in his letter were requests for fee waivers. He listed all of the same grounds included in the ACT Request, but additionally listed several other grounds related to his status as a member of the media, including that: (1) he frequently writes books and articles concerning issues impacting the public, (2) that he has written before on developments concerning the Purple Line, and (3) that providing him more information on the Purple Line would be in the public interest because it, and the Town\u2019s expenditures, have garnered coverage in mainstream news outlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On November 21, Hoffman denied Ross\u2019s request for a fee waiver. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">In your request, you identify yourself as a member of the media as a basis for a waiver of all fees associated with the request. Please be advised that the request for a waiver has been considered and is denied. We do not believe this request is being made in your capacity as a member of the media. This belief is based on the first request you submitted and then immediately withdrew on November 10, 2014, which clearly indicated it was being submitted on behalf of [ACT], along with your known affiliation with ACT. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ingly, the Town will expect payment in full for all fees associated with the request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u2014The Circuit Court Proceedings\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In January, 2015, ACT and Ross filed a joint complaint in the circuit court challenging the Town\u2019s denial of their fee waiver requests. The complaint alleged that the Town violated the MPIA when it: (1) denied their requests for access to the minutes of the closed meetings between the Town and the lobbying and public relation firms; (2) denied their requests for waivers of the fees associated with the requests; (3) denied providing them with two hours of free research for the requests;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (4) denied ACT\u2019s and Ross\u2019s requests to review the minutes of closed meetings in which the Town\u2019s relationship with the Buchanan Firm and the other lobbyists were discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In their prayer for relief, ACT and Ross requested that the Town provide access to all of the requested documents, and that the fees associated with the requests be waived. Additionally, ACT and Ross requested that the Town provide them with copies of minutes of the closed meetings of the Town Council that pertained to the lobbyists. Finally, they asked that the court award them attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to \u00a7 4-362(f) of the MPIA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">In response, the Town filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. In its motion, the Town took a two-fold approach:</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\"><em>First, </em>it argued that it denied ACT\u2019s and Ross\u2019s fee waiver requests based on the grounds contained in ACT\u2019s and Ross\u2019s requests themselves; as the Town explains this logic: \u201c[T]he Town reviewed ACT\u2019s arguments and all of the \u2018relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>factors\u2019 stated by ACT in support of its fee waiver request, considered those factors, and nevertheless decided that the request was denied.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Notably, the Town did not attach any affidavit from Hoffman, or from anyone else, describing the Town\u2019s actual decision-making process or explaining what specific considerations entered into the Town\u2019s decision to deny the waiver request.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only evidence in the record concerning the Town\u2019s motives are the Town\u2019s denial letters themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><em>Second, </em>the Town provided an explanation of its reasoning in its memorandum in support of its motion. Among other reasons advanced by the Town was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">The Town also did not agree that ACT or Ross\u2019s fee waiver requests were made in the \u2018public interest,\u2019 or even that the documents requested were sought for a public purpose. Rather, <em>the history of attacks on the Town by ACT/its members, </em>and previous requests made by ACT and its Officers demonstrated that Plaintiffs sought the fee waiver for their own personal interests in retaliating against the Town for its opposition to the proposed Purple Line project. <em>ACT had posted false accusations against the Town on ACT\u2019s website and had repeatedly attacked the Town </em>because of the Town\u2019s opposition to the proposed Purple Line project, <em>accusing the Town of acting illegally. </em>The Town, like any private citizen, is entitled to take a position on the public issue. <em>ACT and its members engaged in a smear campaign and utilized the Open Meetings Act Compliance Boardi</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>and, now this Court, <em>to retaliate against the Town </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>for its position on the proposed Purple Line project. Thus, the <em>Town rightfully disbelieved ACT and Ross\u2019s claims that the request for the fee waiver was in the \u2018public interest. \u2019 </em>If anything, <em>ACT and Ross appeared to desire the documents without paying the fee for the \u2018commercial\u2019 or proprietary purpose of attacking the Town for its opposition to a project supported by ACT. </em>Thus, the Plaintiffs\u2019 fee waiver requests were carefully considered and all factors militated against a finding by the Town that a fee waiver was in the \u2018public interest\u2019 or was warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">(Emphasis added; citation deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">To buttress these assertions, the Town attached copies of press releases issued by ACT in March of 2014 as exhibits to the memorandum. One release criticized the Town Council for \u201cmisinforming\u201d the public about the nature of the services that the Buchanan Firm would provide to the Town. Another stated that the Town \u201cbroke the law when its council met in secret to hire an anti-Purple Line lobbyist.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Additionally, in its memorandum, the Town asserted that it was entitled to deny Ross\u2019s request because: a) it was justified in not credit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ing Ross\u2019s claim that he filed his request in his capacity as a member of the media; b) in any event, Ross was not a member of the media because contributing to a news blog did not qualify one as a member of the media; and c) the records that ACT had sought did not pertain to a matter of public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">After a hearing, the circuit court issued a bench opinion granting the Town\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court denied ACT\u2019s and Ross\u2019s requests for access to minutes of the closed sessions of Town Council meetings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court concluded that, since the MPIA does not state that an agency or government must name the factors it relied on in deciding to deny the fee waiver, the Town\u2019s statement that it considered relevant factors was sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">The letters that the plaintiffs have cited cite reasons to grant the waiver in them, and the town has responded by saying that it\u2019s considered those requests [sic] in the letters that were sent, and it has denied them. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">So, the town considered the information that was presented to it, said in its response have [sic] considered that request, and, based on one of their factors being past negative comments and other relevant factors they were denying the request. There\u2019s nowhere that it says that they have to report what those factors are. ... Defendant maintains they were considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">I. The Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The MPIA was enacted in 1970, four years after Congress enacted the federal Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> often referred to as the \u201carchetype of public information acts.\u201d <em>Blythe v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 492, 513, 870 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>A.2d 1246 (2005). The public policies advanced by the FOIA and the MPIA are virtually identical. <em>Id.; see also Fioretti v. Maryland State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 76, 716 A.2d 258 (1998). The principal purpose of the MPIA is to \u201cprovide the public the right to inspect the records of the State government or of a political subdivision.\u201d <em>Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 76, 716 A.2d 258. The provisions of the MPIA \u201cshall be construed in favor of allowing inspection of a public record, with the least cost and least delay to the person ... that requests the inspection.\u201d GP \u00a7 4403(b). This right is a cornerstone of democratic government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">The Maryland Public Information Act is based on the enduring principle that public knowledge of government activities is critical to the functioning of a democratic society; that a government of the people, by the people and for the people must be <em>open </em>to the people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Office of the Attorney General, Maryland Public INFORMATION Act Manual (the \u201cMPIA Manual\u201d) Preface (14th ed., October 2015) (emphasis in original); <em>see also ACLU v. Leopold, </em>223 Md.App. 97, 109, 115 A.3d 649 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The MPIA provides that the official custodian of requested public records is ordinarily entitled to charge an applicant a reasonable fee<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for: (1) \u201cthe search for, preparation of, and reproduction of a public record prepared, on request of the applicant, in a customized format;\u201d and (2) \u201cthe actual costs of the search for, preparation of, and reproduction of a public record in standard format, including media and mechanical processing costs.\u201d GP \u00a7 4-206(b). However, the custodian\u2019s ability to charge a reasonable fee is subject to certain limitations. For instance, the ability to collect a fee for the search and preparation of the materials is limited by GP \u00a7 4-206(c), which states that: \u201cThe official custodian may not charge a fee for the first 2 hours that are needed to search for a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>record and prepare it for inspection.\u201d Furthermore, \u00a7 4-206(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">(e) The official custodian may waive a fee under this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">(1) the applicant asks for a waiver; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">(2) (i) the applicant is indigent and files an affidavit of indigency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">(ii) after consideration of the ability of the applicant to pay the fee and other relevant factors, the official custodian determines that the waiver would be in the public interest.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Maryland\u2019s appellate case law on MPIA fee waiver requests is limited to a single decision, <em>Mayor and City of Baltimore v. Burke, </em>67 Md.App. 147, 506 A.2d 683 (1986), which we will discuss later. In addition to <em>Burke, </em>the parties cite to the MPIA Manual and a 1996 opinion of the Attorney General, 81 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 154 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The MPIA Manual is a document written and updated by the Office of the Maryland Attorney General. In its preface, it states that it is \u201cdesigned to be a resource for a range of users, from members of the public and the media who request information, to the government officials who have the responsibility to implement the Act\u2019s requirements.\u201d Chapter 7 of the Manual pertains to fees under the Act. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">To determine whether a waiver is in the public interest, the official custodian must consider not only the ability of the applicant to pay, but also other relevant factors. A waiver may be appropriate, for example, when a requestor seeks information for a public purpose, rather than a narrow personal or commercial interest, because a public purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>justifies the expenditure of public funds to comply with the request. ... In deciding whether to waive a fee, an official custodian may find it helpful to look at case law interpreting the comparable FOIA provision[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">MPIA Manual at 7-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Manual goes on to identify several relevant factors identified in federal FOIA decisions. These factors include \u201cthe potential that the requested disclosure would contribute to public understanding and the significance of that understanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-4 (citing <em>Project on Military Procurement v. Dept. of Navy, </em>710 F.Supp. 362 (D.D.C.1989); and <em>Larson v. CIA, </em>843 F.2d 1481 (D.C.Cir.1988). Another factor identified in the Manual is whether the material sought pertains to \u201ca matter of genuine public concern[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, </em>882 F.Supp. 1158 (D.Mass.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The Attorney General issued an opinion discussing fee waivers in the context of the MPIA. 81 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 154 (1996).

However, the Opinion lists several examples of factors that may contribute to the public interest determination, such as whether disclosure of records will shed light on \u201ca public controversy about official actions,\u201d or on \u201can agency\u2019s performance of its public duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157-58, 506 A.2d 683.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>II. The Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision on MPIA requests is authorized by GP \u00a7 4-362, which permits a person who is denied inspection of a public record to challenge the denial by filing a complaint in the circuit court. In their complaint, ACT and Ross alleged, in effect, that the Town denied them access to public records by arbitrarily denying their meritorious requests for fee waivers. The standard of review for a circuit court\u2019s decision on a government\u2019s response to an MPIA request is \u201cwhether that court had an adequate factual basis for the decision it rendered and whether the decision the court reached was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Immanuel, </em>216 Md.App. 259, 266, 85 A.3d 878 (2014), <em>aff'd Immanuel v. Comptroller, </em>449 Md. 76, 141 A.3d 181 (2016) (citing <em>Haigley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>128 Md.App. 194, 210, 736 A.2d 1185 (1999)). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>any purported errors in interpreting the Act itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the circuit court ruled on the issues on a motion for summary judgment, we will review the circuit court\u2019s decision \u201conly [upon] the grounds which the lower court relied in granting summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The parties do not dispute that our review of the circuit court\u2019s decision is <em>de novo. </em>However, they part compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ny as to how we should review the agency\u2019s decision to deny the request for fee waivers. The Town, citing <em>Burke, </em>67 Md.App. at 157, 506 A.2d 683, argues that its denial may be overturned only if its decision was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">ACT and Ross argue for a different standard. They note that under FOIA, courts review an agency\u2019s decision to deny a fee waiver <em>de novo. See, e.g.,Cause of Action v. F.T.C., </em>799 F.3d 1108, 1113 (D.C.Cir.2015) (\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>both the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the agency\u2019s denial of the fee-waiver applications.\u201d). We don\u2019t find this argument to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The <em>de novo </em>review standard for FOIA fee waiver disputes is statutory. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(vii) (\u201cIn any action by a requester regarding the waiver of fees[,] ... the court shall determine the matter de novo.\u201d). The same statute prescribes that \u201cthe court\u2019s review of the matter shall be limited to the record before the agency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In contrast, generally when a Maryland court addresses an MPIA dispute, the court considers not only the agency record, but also facts generated \u201cby pleadings, affidavit, deposition, answers to interrogatories, admission of facts, stipulations and concessions.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. The Washington Post Co., </em>149 Md.App. at 304, 815 A.2d 859. Were we to limit our review solely to the record before the agency, we would burden government units with the obligation of generating a record against the possibility that a dispute will end up in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">III. The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">ACT and Ross argue that the circuit court erred in granting the Town summary judgment on two bases. First, they contend that the Town\u2019s letters of denial themselves were legally deficient under the MPIA because neither letter cited any relevant factor that justified denying the requests for fee waivers. Second, they note that the circuit court cited as one of the factors considered by the Town in denying their requests was the \u201cpast negative comments\u201d made by ACT and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Ross about the Town in the past. They assert that this is not a permissible basis to deny a fee waiver request. In response, the Town raises a variety of contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The Town\u2019s primary contention is that its responses to ACT\u2019s and Ross\u2019s waiver requests were adequate as a matter of law and constitute conclusive evidence that its decisions to deny the requests were based upon valid reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">From these premises, the Town further asserts that:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">(1) ACT\u2019s and Ross\u2019s claims to the contrary notwithstanding, the Town did not base its decision in whole or in part upon past negative comments made by Ross and/or ACT regarding the Town.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">(2) GP \u00a7 4-206(e) permits it to \u201cconsider the identity and purpose of the requester\u201d as one element of the \u201cother relevant factors\u201d in deciding whether to grant a fee waiver. The Town cites the MPIA Manual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">To determine whether a waiver is in the public interest, the official custodian must consider not only the ability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>applicant to pay, but also other relevant factors. A waiver may be appropriate, for example, when a requester seeks information for a public purpose, rather than a narrow personal or commercial interest, because <em>a public purpose justifies the expenditure of public funds to comply with the request.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">MPIA Manual, Chapter 7-3 (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Town concludes by asserting that \u201cthe Town reasonably concluded that waiver of the fee was not in the public interest\u201d because of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">Mr. Ross\u2019s known affiliation with ACT. Because of the history and Mr. Ross\u2019s apparent duplicity, the Town obviously questioned the purpose of the fee waiver request, and whether it was for a public purpose and would be in the \u2018public interest.\u2019 Upon consideration of ACT/Ross\u2019s ability to pay and the \u2018other relevant factors,\u2019 the Town ultimately determined that the fee waiver would not be in the public interest and denied the request. As discussed, the Town was entitled to consider these circumstances in denying the fee waiver request and the decision was not \u2018viewpoint discrimination.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">IV. ACT\u2019s Waiver Request</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 contentions, we conclude that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the Town. The circuit court was correct that GP \u00a7 4-206 does not set out any requirement for a custodian\u2019s response to a waiver request. However, by stopping at that point, the court overlooked its own role in the process. When presented with a waiver request, a custodian must consider the ability of the applicant to pay the fee and other relevant factors to decide whether the waiver would be in the public interest. <em>See </em>GP \u00a7 4-206(e)(2). When a custodian\u2019s decision to deny a waiver request is appealed, the court must have sufficient information before it to satisfy itself that the custodian\u2019s decision was not arbitrary or capricious. This point is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>illustrated by our analysis in <em>City of Baltimore v. Burke, </em>67 Md.App. 147, 506 A.2d 683 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Burke was a reporter for the <em>Baltimore News American </em>who sought records from the City of Baltimore pertaining to a malfunctioning sewer treatment plant owned by the City. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 506 A.2d 683. The City responded that approximately 160,000 pages of documents were responsive to Burke\u2019s request \u201cand that these documents would be released providing the appellee paid approximately $50,000 to cover copying at 25 cents per page and the cost of the \u2018City employee\u2019s time based upon their [sic] salary to retrieve the documents and the portion of an Assistant City Solicitor\u2019s time to review each document to delete material which is not subject to disclosure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Burke challenged the City\u2019s refusal to grant a fee waiver. In affirming the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the City\u2019s refusal to grant the fee waiver was arbitrary and capricious, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">It is apparent from the record that [the relevant City officials] considered no more than the expense to the City of locating and duplicating the documents ... and the perceived ability of the appellee, as an employee of a Baltimore newspaper, to pay the City\u2019s projected fee. The appellants did not abide by 10-621(d)(2)[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] which mandates consideration of \u2018other relevant factors\u2019 and making a determination of whether the waiver would be in the public interest. Certainly those relevant considerations would include the health hazard created by the discharge of inadequately treated sewage into the Patapsco River, the importance of public exposure of the delayed and extremely costly improvements to the Patapsco Waste Water Treatment Plant, and the danger that imposing a fee for information upon a newspaper publisher might have a chilling effect on free exercise of freedom of the press.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Returning to the present case, the Town\u2019s response to ACT\u2019s waiver request was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>In your request, you outline your arguments in support of a waiver of all fees associated with the request. Please be advised the request for a waiver has been considered and is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">This bald and conclusory statement provides no insight whatsoever as to the actual considerations that motivated the Town to deny the request. As <em>Burke </em>makes clear, a court must necessarily consider the actual decision-making process by the custodian in order to decide whether the custodian gave appropriate consideration to \u201cother relevant factors.\u201d This necessarily calls for custodian to identify what relevant factors he or she considered. The Town\u2019s response to ACT fails comprehensively in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Town\u2019s failure to explain the reasons for its decisions in its letter to ACT isn\u2019t necessarily fatal because the factual record can be further developed in the circuit court \u201cby pleadings, affidavit, deposition, answers to interrogatories, admission of facts, stipulations and concessions.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. The Washington Post Co., </em>149 Md.App. at 304, 815 A.2d 859. The Town did this by setting out its reasoning in its memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment. We have set out a portion of that narrative earlier in this opinion. Our reading of that memorandum leaves us satisfied that a significant factor, if not the primary factor, in the Town\u2019s decision to deny ACT\u2019s request for a waiver was that the organization had previously criticized the Town officials for their opposition to the Purple Line.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Without belaboring the issue, we agree with appellants that the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free expression of speech protects persons from the imposition of financial burdens based upon the content of their speech. <em>See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the U. Va., </em>515 U.S. 819, 828, 115 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995) (\u201c[T]he government offends the First Amendment when it imposes financial burdens on certain speakers based on the content of their expression.\u201d); <em>see also Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 192 L.Ed.2d 236 (2015) (\u201cGovernment discrimination among viewpoints is a \u2018more blatant\u2019 and \u2018egregious form of content discrimination_\u201d) (citing <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S. at 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510.); <em>Ridley v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>390 F.3d 65, 82 (1st Cir.2004) (\u201cThe bedrock principle of viewpoint neutrality demands that the state not suppress speech where the real rationale for the restriction is disagreement with the underlying ideology or perspective that the speech expresses.\u201d). A decision based upon such unconstitutional considerations is clearly arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">V. Ross\u2019s Request</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">We turn to the Town\u2019s denial of Ross\u2019s fee waiver request. The letter from the Town\u2019s counsel to Ross stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">In your request, you identify yourself as a member of the media[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>] as a basis for a waiver of all fees associated with the request. Please be advised that the request for a waiver has been considered and is denied. We do not believe this request is being made in your capacity as a member of the media. This belief is based on the first request you submitted and then immediately withdrew on November 10, 2014, which clearly indicated it was being submitted on behalf of [ACT], along with your known affiliation with ACT. Accordingly, the Town will expect payment in full for all fees associated with the request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Under different circumstances, we believe that Ross\u2019s request on his own behalf, coming within hours of Ross\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>on ACT\u2019s behalf, might provide a basis for the Town to conclude that Ross was acting as ACT\u2019s proxy. Had the Town\u2019s decision to deny ACT\u2019s request been based on legitimate concerns, the Town might have been justified in denying Ross\u2019s request as well. But, as we have just explained, the Town\u2019s denial of ACT\u2019s request was arbitrary and capricious. Because the Town did not identify any reason for denying Ross\u2019s request other than his affiliation with ACT, we hold that the Town\u2019s decision to deny his waiver request was also arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We hold that the circuit court erred when it granted the Town\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the fee waiver issue. What happens on remand is complicated by the fact that the circuit court\u2019s judgment addressed another issue, namely, the court concluded that the Town was not required to disclose minutes of closed meetings. Neither ACT nor Ross has asserted that the court erred in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We will vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for it to enter a judgment that the Town is not required to disclose minutes of its closed meetings in response to the MPIA requests from ACT and Ross that are the subject of this appeal. The judgment will further provide the Town is obligated to respond to Ross\u2019s and ACT\u2019s requests without charge to the appellants. Finally, the court must consider ACT\u2019s and Ross\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to GP \u00a7 4-362(f). <em>See Caffrey v. Dep\u2019t of Liquor Control for Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 272, 289, 805 A.2d 268 (2002) (\u201cGenerally, the decision whether to award counsel fees to an eligible party under the MPIA rests within the sound exercise of discretion by the trial judge.\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY IS VACATED AND THIS CASE REMANDED TO IT FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
