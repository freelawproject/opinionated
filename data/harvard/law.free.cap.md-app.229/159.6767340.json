Johnson on charges of first-degree murder and related crimes. Johnson then moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting that another trial would subject him to double jeopardy. The circuit court denied his motion. He filed an interlocutory appeal and presents one issue, which we have reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">Did the court abuse its discretion by granting the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the ground of manifest necessity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">We will affirm. During opening statement, appellant\u2019s trial counsel presented the jury with an extremely detailed exculpatory narrative, but failed to present any evidence whatsoever to support it. The State moved for a mistrial, asserting that its case was irreparably prejudiced. After hearing argument from counsel and reviewing the opening statement, the trial court carefully considered the possible remedies \u2014 i.e., an instruction to the jury or allowing latitude to the State in closing argument \u2014 and concluded that neither would be effective. The court then granted the State\u2019s motion on the basis that doing so was manifestly necessary. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in doing so. Therefore, principles of double jeopardy do not bar a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">On November 5, 2012, Gerald Cox became alarmed because his daughter, Deborah Simon, had not returned his recent telephone calls. Mr. Cox went to her residence on Washington Boulevard in Baltimore and found his daughter lying dead in a pool of her own blood on her kitchen floor. The police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>investigation established that Ms. Simon had been murdered and that the murder took place on the evening of November 3. Appellant was charged with first-degree murder, robbery, and concealing a dangerous weapon in connection with Ms. Simon\u2019s death. Appellant was tried before a jury of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the Hon. Kendra Y. Ausby, presiding, in June 2015.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial, appellant filed a motion to dismiss his indictment, asserting that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy barred a new trial. The circuit court, the Hon. Evelyn Omega Cannon, presiding, denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Defense Counsel\u2019s Opening Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The parties\u2019 contentions revolve around defense counsel\u2019s opening statement. We will set it out in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">Ladies and gentlemen, Antonio Johnson is innocent. Mr. Johnson did not kill Deborah Simon. Antonio Johnson had nothing to do with Ms. Simon\u2019s death. Somebody else killed Deborah Simon, and Mr. Johnson was later duped into holding the bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">Now, ladies and gentlemen, the State wants you to believe that its case is open and shut. After all, the police found Antonio Johnson with Ms. Simon\u2019s luggage. Forensic testing revealed spots of Ms. Simon\u2019s blood on Mr. [Johnson\u2019s] right shoe, pant leg, and sleeve. Therefore, the State says Mr. Johnson must have killed Ms. Simon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">But, ladies and gentlemen, if you carefully examine the evidence in this case, you will see that something does not add up. The pieces of the puzzle do not fit together. The evidence you would expect to find, if Mr. Johnson had killed Ms. Simon, is not there. You\u2019ll see that Mr. Johnson only came into possession of Ms. Simon\u2019s luggage after the homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">Ladies and gentlemen, you will see that this is a case where the police rushed to judgment. If you follow the trail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of forensic evidence in this case, you will see that that trail leads away from Antonio Johnson and towards somebody else. Ladies and gentlemen, Antonio Johnson had nothing to do with Deborah Simon\u2019s murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">Now, back in November 2012, both Antonio Johnson and Ms. Simon lived on the 1200 block of Washington Boulevard. They only lived about nine houses apart. They were not close friends, but they had the polite, cordial relationship one would expect neighbors to have who live on the same block. There was no history of hostility between them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">Mr. Johnson washed cars for neighbors on the block. He made friends easily. He was somebody who never met a stranger. Now, back in November 2012, Mr. Johnson was also struggling with an addiction to drugs, and Mr. Johnson would perform odd jobs, such as selling cigarettes, to make extra money to support his habit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">Now, on November 3rd, 2012, a Saturday, Mr. Johnson got into the argument with his girlfriend about his drug use. Later in the day, he washed cars. In the late afternoon hours, afterwards, he made his way out to East Baltimore where his mom lived. He saw his mom. He asked his mom for money. His mom gave him some money. He left the house, went to the projects, bought drugs, used the drugs, got high. You\u2019ll see that he went back to his mother\u2019s house and then eventually made his way back to a bus stop and took both the Orange Line and the Green Line back to the area where he lived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">He got off of the bus around the B &amp; O Railroad Museum on Pratt Street. Now, by this point in time, it was already dark. It was nighttime. On his way back to his house, he walked through the grounds of Baltimore Behavioral Health off of Pratt Street. Mr. Johnson saw a man with the piece of luggage. Now, Mr. Johnson didn\u2019t know this man by name, but he recognized him as somebody who he had done drug activity with in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">Mr. Johnson and the man greeted each other with a hug. Mr. Johnson noticed that the man had a stem in his hand, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>stem used for smoking drugs. Mr. Johnson and the man, in the dark of night, then proceeded to get high again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Now, Mr. Johnson asked the man about what was in the luggage. The man showed him the contents of the luggage, and in the luggage there was a carton of Marlboro cigarettes. And there was also some gray object, which later turned out to be a printer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">But what caught Mr. Johnson\u2019s attention was that carton of Marlboro cigarettes. Mr. Johnson saw this as an opportunity to make some money by selling the cigarettes so he could make some additional cash. So Mr. Johnson and the man walked around trying to sell cigarettes out of this piece of luggage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">You will see that, later on that evening, a police officer stopped Antonio Johnson on Washington Boulevard, and this police officer stopped him and arrested him for misdemeanor warrant that was out for Mr. Johnson. When the officer stopped Mr. Johnson, the officer saw him with this piece of luggage, which contained this carton of Marlboro cigarettes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">Now, you will see that when the officer approached Mr. Johnson and spoke with him, the officer did not notice anything unusual or out of the ordinary about Mr. Johnson\u2019s behavior. Antonio Johnson did not appear to be anxious to the police officer. He did not appear to be upset. There was nothing erratic about his behavior. Mr. Johnson did not try to run or flee as the officer approached him. Antonio Johnson made no effort to try to distance himself from the piece of luggage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">Antonio Johnson did not try to run or flee as the officer approached because Antonio Johnson had nothing to hide. He was only trying to sell cigarettes out of this piece of luggage. In fact, Antonio Johnson actually asked the officer at the time he was arrested if the officer could take the piece of luggage to where he lived, to where Mr. Johnson lived with his girlfriend Peggy Cash at 1246 Washington Boulevard. The officer did this and left the luggage at Mr. Johnson\u2019s house at Mr. Johnson\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Now, the police later determined that piece of luggage to belong to Deborah Simon, who was found deceased in her home on November 5th, 2012. The police arrested and charged Mr. Johnson, already at Central Booking, with the murder of Ms. Simon. But you will see, ladies and gentlemen, the case against him does not add up. The evidence will show that Ms. Simon was cut and stabbed a total of 29 times, in the front, in the back, on the neck. She was cut in the jugular vein and in the aorta. You will see that there was a large volume of blood at the scene. And yet, ladies and gentlemen, on Mr. Johnson\u2019s clothing, the blood detected to be Ms. Simon\u2019s is barely visible to the naked eye. If you look at the clothing, you can hardly see anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">Now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Johnson did not kill Ms. Simon. He had nothing to do with her death. Mr. Johnson unwittingly made contact with somebody involved in her homicide after the murder. When Mr. Johnson made physical contact with the man and the luggage in the dark of night, Mr. Johnson did not know that that man had blood on his clothing. Mr. Johnson did not know that blood was transferred from that man to Mr. Johnson\u2019s clothing. Mr. Johnson had no idea that that piece of luggage was connected in any way to a homicide. That\u2019s why he did not try to run or flee when the officer approached. He had nothing to hide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">Ladies, gentlemen, somebody else killed Deborah Simon, and Mr. Johnson was duped into holding the bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will see that other property \u2014 a television, a laptop computer, and a cell phone\u2014 were taken from Ms. Simon\u2019s residence at the time of the homicide. Yet you will see that none of that property \u2014 a cell phone, a television, and a laptop computer \u2014 -were found on Mr. Johnson at the time of his arrest. None of that property was found inside of Mr. Johnson\u2019s house. None of that property was found on Mr. Johnson or in his house because somebody else killed Deborah Simon and stole that property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>You will see that, in this case, the police collected two knives into evidence that they suspected were used in the homicide. Yet you will see that there is not one iota of forensic evidence connecting Mr. Johnson to those knives. No fingerprints. No DNA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, you will also see that there\u2019s not one shred of forensic evidence implicating Antonio Johnson that was found in Ms. Simon\u2019s house, the scene of the homicide. Mr. Johnson\u2019s DNA was found nowhere in Ms. Simon\u2019s house, the scene of the murder. Mr. Johnson\u2019s fingerprints were found nowhere in Ms. Simon\u2019s house, the scene of the homicide. Ladies and gentlemen, you will see that if you follow the trail of forensic evidence in this case, that trail leads you away from Antonio Johnson and toward somebody else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">You will see that Ms. Simon\u2019s house appeared to be ransacked following the homicide, particularly the living room area. Her wallet was found upside down on the floor with the money missing. The evidence will show that the DNA of an unknown male was found on the outside of that wallet. The evidence will show that the fingerprints of an unknown person were found at two critical locations inside of Ms. Simon\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Ladies and gentlemen, you will see that the police in this case failed to follow through on important investigative leads, which could have helped resolve what really happened. Because of the police failure to follow those important investigative leads, at the end of this case, you\u2019ll be left to guess and to speculate as to what really happened. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a case where the police rushed to judgment. As a result of the police rush to judgment, Mr. Johnson sits here accused of a crime he did not commit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">I ask you to remember throughout these proceedings that the burden is on the State to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This high standard of proof exists to protect the innocent from wrongful conviction. This high standard exists to protect the innocent from false accusations. Antonio Johnson has been wrongly accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>I ask you to withhold judgment in this case until the end of the trial, until after you\u2019ve heard all the evidence. I\u2019m confident that if you do so, you will find Mr. Johnson not guilty on all counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The State\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The evidence presented by the State was that Ms. Simon returned to her row home on Washington Boulevard just before 8 p.m. on November 3, 2012. Two days later \u2014 November 5, 2012 \u2014 Ms. Simon was found, dead, lying in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor, wearing the same clothes she had worn two days earlier. Ms. Simon had been stabbed and beaten to death. There were no signs of forced entry, but the front room of her house appeared to have been ransacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The State also presented evidence that, just after midnight on November 4, 2012 \u2014 that is, several hours after Ms. Simon returned home \u2014 appellant was stopped on Washington Boulevard by Baltimore City Police Officer Dien Pham,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and arrested after Officer Pham discovered that there was a warrant for his arrest. At the time, appellant was in possession of a rolling suitcase. Officer Pham searched the suitcase and found a printer, a pack of cigarettes, and a lighter. Because the contents were not dangerous, Officer Pham inquired as to how he should dispose of the suitcase. At appellant\u2019s request, Officer Pham asked Peggy Graves,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s girlfriend with whom he had resided on Washington Boulevard, whether she would be willing to keep the suitcase until he could retrieve it. She agreed and Officer Pham left the suitcase at her residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>On November 6, 2012, Ms. Graves found a knife in her backyard and called the police. Ms. Graves knew that a woman down the street had been murdered, and suspected that the knife might be related. One of the officers assigned to the Simon investigation was Baltimore City Police Detective Chris Brockdorff. He responded to Ms. Graves\u2019s call and learned from her that a suitcase had been left at her residence two days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The significance of the suitcase became apparent to Detective Brockdorff a few hours later, when he spoke to Ms. Simon\u2019s parents. Ms. Simon\u2019s parents inquired as to whether Detective Brockdorff had seen a Samsonite rolling-suitcase that they had recently given to Ms. Simon, and they reported that certain electronics, including a printer, a laptop, a television, and a cell phone, were missing from Ms, Simon\u2019s home. Detective Brockdorff executed a search and seizure warrant at Ms. Graves\u2019s home, and recovered the suitcase. The suitcase contained a printer, pack of cigarettes, and lighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">At this point, police identified appellant as a suspect, and executed a search and seizure warrant at the Central Booking and Intake Facility. The police recovered the clothes that appellant was wearing at the time they executed the warrant, a blue jersey, black sneakers, and black jeans, as well as the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested, a black hooded sweatshirt and a black hat. The police also swabbed appellant for DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The police recovered a fingerprint on the pack of cigarettes, which was ultimately identified as belonging to Ms. Simon. Laboratory test results revealed that stains on appellant\u2019s sweatshirt, jeans, and right shoe tested positive for the presence of blood. Ms. Simon was determined to be the major female DNA contributor to stains on all three items.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Aside from the fact that Ms. Simon and appellant resided on Washington Boulevard in November 2012, the only evidence that they knew each other came from Ms. Graves. She testified that appellant washed cars to earn money, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>appellant had said that Ms. Simon owed him five dollars for washing her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The State\u2019s Motion for Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">It took the State the better part of four days to present its case-in-chief. After the State rested its case, defense counsel moved for judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion, and defense counsel proceeded to advise appellant of his right to testify. Appellant elected not to testify and the defense rested without calling any witnesses. Immediately thereafter the State moved for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The State argued that, in light of the defense\u2019s opening statement, appellant\u2019s decision not to testify necessitated the grant of its motion for a mistrial. According to the State, the defense presented its case through its opening statement, communicating what appellant would have testified to and his explanation for events, without providing any evidence to support the assertions. The State raised two arguments in support of its contention that the opening statement was \u201cseverely prejudicial.\u201d First, the State asserted that it would be prohibited from arguing to the jury that the defense failed to present evidence to support the narrative of events that it provided in its opening statement. Second, the State argued that, because \u201c[n]one of the testimony that is in evidence would support that theory which the defense raised in its opening,\u201d the defense \u201cbackdoor[ed] testimony without the State having an opportunity to cross-examine him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Defense counsel opposed the motion, arguing that \u201ca mistrial is not warranted just because the defense did not put on evidence to establish everything that was said during opening statements.\u201d Rather, defense counsel asserted that any prejudice to the State could be remedied. In support of this contention, defense counsel observed that: (1) the State\u2019s concerns could be addressed through a jury instruction providing that opening statements and closing arguments are not evidence; (2) it would be impermissible for the defense to argue facts not in evidence in closing argument; and (3) the State could point out, in closing, that the defense had made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>certain representations during its opening statement, and that there was not any evidence to support those representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">After hearing argument from both parties, and reviewing the opening statement, Judge Ausby granted the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The relevant portion of the transcript reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">THE COURT: The Court, having [reviewed] the opening statement of defense counsel, [and] based upon the limited case law that we have looked at, I think what we rely on most is that the Court exercise its discretion in determining whether or not to grant motions for mistrial, in this particular case the Court is faced with two \u2014 what I can only see as two options.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">Let me first make a finding that the defense\u2019s opening statement ... was a very detailed and quite convoluted story about the activities of the Defendant on the night of the homicide. It involved several other people, not just the Defendant or the mystery perhaps assailant, or at least the mystery man with the blood, it involved the Defendant\u2019s mother, the Defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house, another part of town, the bus number that he took, the name of the \u2014 what is it, the Baltimore Behavioral Health. It was quite detailed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">And so the Court is left ... to make a decision as to what to do with the fact that the defense has placed that information into the minds of the jury and has elected, as they\u2019re allowed, to not present any evidence in this case. And this Court finds that there\u2019s two ways to do it \u2014 well, three, I guess. The first way would be for the Court to essentially allow the State to argue however it wishes to argue in closing argument about that which the defense counsel presented in the opening statement and how the evidence that the Defendant \u2014 how the evidence was not presented, put it that way. Even if we take it the way the defense counsel has said, they can argue all of what he said, every piece of detail, and how the evidence, quote-unquote, \u201cdidn\u2019t show that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>With that level of detail, even if I limited the State to saying the defense counsel stated the following and they recite everything verbatim, which they would be allowed to do, that defense counsel said, there\u2019s absolutely no way with that level of detail that the statement \u201cthe evidence doesn\u2019t show any of all of that\u201d is not a burden-shifting statement, there\u2019s absolutely no way. And the Defendant is not required to waive any rights \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a waiveable right \u2014 under that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">And then the second option obviously would be to have the Court to instruct the jury, in addition to the regular jury instruction that opening statements are not \u2014 opening statements and closing arguments are not evidence, to then specifically instruct the jury to ignore, I guess, the information presented in the story told by the defense and the version of the facts, quite frankly, told by the defense in opening statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">And then, obviously, the third option is to grant the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">As to the first option, the Court finds that the right, if you will, against burden-shifting language and the Defendant\u2019s right to \u2014 the State\u2019s burden to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt and that burden being ensured by the Defendant, the Defendant\u2019s right to not present any evidence and not even have to refute or rebut the State\u2019s evidence, and not have the fact that he chose not to present any evidence, whether it was his testimony or any other testimony, be held against him is \u2014 I think it\u2019s irrevocable, I don\u2019t even think he could waive it, even though we tossed that around earlier, at least I did. And I think of all of the things that we have discussed today and all of the options it is the highest of rights and it is the one that should be least tampered with even in a situation like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">So the Court finds that that would be the least appropriate option and mostly because I don\u2019t \u2014 like I said, even if I limited the State to say, defense counsel said this and the evidence didn\u2019t show this, because the defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>said so much, I don\u2019t know how that doesn\u2019t translate into he said it and didn\u2019t prove it. And that \u2014 so I think that\u2019s the right that should least be tampered with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">The next [option] then would be the instruction. [I]n a different case, I think that perhaps the instruction would be appropriate and the additional instruction would be appropriate, but in this particular case, as we have just heard, there is an entire fact pattern that was given to the jury. It\u2019s not just \u2014 it\u2019s not even \u2014 I don\u2019t even know, you know, that he got the bag from someone else, it\u2019s not even that someone else killed her \u2014 and some of the statements were \u2014 some of the evidence I guess came out through the State\u2019s case and I assume defense counsel knew that would come out through the State\u2019s case, but there\u2019s an entire convoluted fact pattern and I \u2014 the Court is not satisfied that a special instruction can cure all of that. I just think, in this particular case, it\u2019s just entirely, entirely too much. It\u2019s not a statement that it happened a different way in general or that someone else did it or they got the wrong person, it is an entire convoluted fact pattern for which the Court believes that it could not be\u2014 I don\u2019t think it could be cured by just giving the jury instruction and/or reminding them that the statement itself is not evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">And so with that being said, I guess the third option is what it was, is that the Court exercise its discretion in granting a mistrial in this case. The motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u2756 # # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, the defense objects, most respectfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">* \u00fc: \u00a1C *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">PROSECUTOR: [J]ust to clarify for the record, is the Court finding that there is manifest necessity given the circumstances of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-13\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And again, Your Honor, the defense objects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>THE COURT: Yes. I\u2019m sorry, the record should reflect that the \u2014 as I went through the three options, the manifest necessity comes out of the fact that what \u2014 what I said, why that was the only option left \u2014 _\u2014which equals manifest necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The Appellant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">After the State\u2019s motion for mistrial was granted, appellant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against him. Appellant asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d required declaration of a mistrial, and thus, pursuant to the prohibitions against double jeopardy contained in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the common law of Maryland, he could not be retried. Appellant argued that alternatives to a mistrial were available, specifically, that the trial court could have instructed the jury that opening statements are not evidence and that the jury should disregard the unsupported portions of defense counsel\u2019s narrative, and/or permitted the State to comment on the unsubstantiated representations made in the opening statement in its closing. Appellant also argued that the court erred in concluding that it was impermissible for the State to comment on the unsubstantiated representations.

State, </em>395 Md. 73, 92, 909 A.2d 270 (2006) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court, have found that a high degree of necessity exists where there is \u201cno reasonable alternative to the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 909 A.2d 270. \u201c \u2018[T]o determine whether manifest necessity to declare a mistrial ... exists, the trial judge must engage in the process of exploring reasonable alternatives and determine that there is no reasonable alternative to the mistrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simmons, </em>436 Md. at 215, 81 A.3d 383 (quoting <em>Hubbard, </em>395 Md. at 92, 909 A.2d 270).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Appellant, as he did at trial and before the motions court, asserts that the trial court had two reasonable alternatives to declaring a mistrial: (1) providing the jury with a corrective instruction; and (2) permitting the State to comment, in closing argument, on defense counsel\u2019s failure to introduce evidence to support the narrative he presented in his opening statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We will discuss these contentions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u2014 A Corrective Instruction \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In elaborating on his first contention, appellant argues that the trial court could have cured any prejudice by instructing the jury that opening statements are not evidence and that the jury \u201cshould disregard defense counsel\u2019s opening statement in its entirety.\u201d Appellant argues that \u201cin light of the strength of the State\u2019s case against [appellant], it was extremely unlikely that the instruction would not cure any prejudice that may have flowed from defense counsel\u2019s opening statement\u201d because \u201c[j]urors are presumed to follow a court\u2019s instructions, and there was no suggestion that this jury would not be able to do so[.]\u201d In response, the State argues that a corrective instruction would not have cured the unfair prejudice of defense counsel\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">First, appellant\u2019s appellate contentions notwithstanding, the trial court could not have instructed the jury to \u201cdisregard defense counsel\u2019s opening statement in its entirety.\u201d This is because there were parts of the opening statement that were unrelated to defense counsel\u2019s unsupported exculpatory factual narrative. For example, counsel stated that the evidence would show that Ms. Simon\u2019s cell phone, laptop computer, and television were missing from her home, but were not found in appellant\u2019s possession. This is completely proper opening statement and the trial court would have erred had it instructed the jury to disregard it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Another problem with a corrective instruction is that such instructions \u201cmust be <em>timely, </em>accurate, and effective.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>436 Md. at 219, 81 A.3d 383 (citation omitted; emphasis added). Any corrective instruction in this case would not have been timely because four days of trial had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>elapsed between defense counsel\u2019s opening statement and his client\u2019s decision not to testify. <em>See Simpson v. State, </em>442 Md. 446, 463, 112 A.3d 941 (2015) (A trial court\u2019s corrective instruction given to the jury three days after an improper opening statement does not \u201c \u2018cure\u2019 the error created by the State\u2019s opening.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Moreover, it is clear that the trial court considered carefully whether a corrective instruction would be effective. The court acknowledged that, \u201cin a different case, I think that perhaps the instruction would be appropriate[.]\u201d The court continued (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">but in this particular case, as we have just heard, there is an entire fact pattern that was given to the jury.... [Tjhere\u2019s an entire convoluted fact pattern and I \u2014 the Court is not satisfied that a special instruction can cure all of that. I just think, in this particular case, it\u2019s just entirely, entirely too much. It\u2019s not a statement that it happened a different way in general or that someone else did it or they got the wrong person, <em>it is an entire convoluted fact pattern </em>for which the Court believes that it could not be \u2014 I <em>don\u2019t think it could be cured by just giving the jury instruction and/or reminding them that the statement itself is not evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\"><em>Simmons </em>provides a useful, although not an exact, analogy. In <em>Simmons, </em>defense counsel, in his opening statement, informed the jury that his client had offered to take a lie detector test while being questioned by police. 436 Md. at 207, 81 A.3d 383. The prosecutor objected and the trial court gave a corrective instruction to the jury. The prosecutor did not move for a mistrial until the next day. In deciding that a mistrial was necessary, the trial court stated that defense counsel\u2019s opening statement \u201cin effect, constituted a substitute for the defendant\u2019s testimony!,]\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s no way to erase the potential infection of the jurors\u2019 minds [that he offered] to take a lie detector test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 81 A.3d 383 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>[I]n making his finding of manifest necessity, the trial judge noted that \u201can opening statement is a powerful setting,\u201d and that \u201cin this particular instance, we\u2019re dealing with a statement not ... unexpectedly presented by a witness, but a statement carefully made as part of a preview of the evidence to the jury.\u201d The trial judge further stated, \u201cthe statement, in effect, constituted a substitute for the defendant\u2019s testimony ... [and] credibility is central to the prosecution of this case.\u201d Therefore, according to the judge, \u201cthere is no way to erase the potential infection of the jurors\u2019 minds as to [Petitioner\u2019s] offer[ ] to take a lie detector test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">Moreover, in considering the motion for mistrial, the trial judge essentially reviewed the efficacy of his own prior curative instruction. Although ... it is generally presumed that the jury can and will follow them.... the trial judge is in the best position to determine whether his instructions achieved the desired curative effect on the jury. In the present case, when the State requested a mistrial, the trial judge considered whether the prejudice caused by the improper statement transcended the curative effect of the instruction_In concluding that \u201cthere is no way to erase the potential infection of the jurors\u2019 minds,\u201d the trial judge determined that the curative instruction was not enough to overcome the prejudice caused by the reference to Simmons\u2019s offer to take a lie detector test. Based on these findings by the trial court, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that manifest necessity existed to warrant a mistrial and that the curative instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice caused by the reference to Petitioner\u2019s willingness to take a lie detector test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 221-23, 81 A.3d 383 (citations and some quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Returning to the ease before us, defense counsel\u2019s opening statement set out a coherent and detailed narrative, in the trial court\u2019s words, an \u201centire convoluted fact pattern,\u201d that certainly constituted a substitute for appellant\u2019s testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>When appellant declined to testify, the State was effectively, if not intentionally, sandbagged. As the <em>Simmons </em>Court noted, \u201c\u2018the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u2019 \u201d 436 Md. at 219, 81 A.3d 383 (quoting <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968)). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a corrective instruction would not adequately cure the prejudice caused to the State by counsel\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u2014 Latitude In Closing Argument \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred when it concluded that the State could not effectively address any prejudice even if it were permitted to comment upon defense counsel\u2019s opening statement in its own closing argument. According to appellant, \u201cthe court rejected that alternative because it believed that such a closing argument would amount to impermissible burden-shifting or to an impermissible comment on [appellant\u2019s] constitutionally protected right not to testify.\u201d Citing to <em>Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 148, 751 A.2d 24 (2000), appellant contends that the opening statement \u201c \u2018open[ed] the door to ... fair comment\u2019 \u201d about \u201cthe lack of evidence produced,\u201d regardless of whether it would draw attention to appellant\u2019s decision not to testify. Appellant thus contends that, because the court failed to properly consider this alternative, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In response, the State asserts that \u201cthe trial court did not misapprehend its authority to afford leeway in closing,\u201d rather, in light of the extensive narrative defense counsel provided, the trial court determined that addressing it would result in impermissible burden shifting. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">We will first set out the legal background.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Prosecutors are entitled to comment in closing argument on matters raised by defense counsel, under the \u201copened door\u201d doctrine. <em>See Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 387-88, 969 A.2d 989 (2009). The opened door doctrine can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>apply to matters raised by defense counsel in opening statement. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 969 A.2d 989 (citing <em>Terry v. State, </em>332 Md. 329, 337, 631 A.2d 424 (1993)). The opened door doctrine is limited, however, by the constitutionally-based prohibition against \u201cburden shifting,\u201d which derives from the landmark Supreme Court decision in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). In <em>Griffin, </em>the Court held that a prosecutor may not comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify because to do so would violate the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. There are two instructive Maryland cases that address this tension: <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 969 A.2d 989 (2009), and <em>Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 751 A.2d 24 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">As we explained in <em>Wise, </em>while a prosecutor may address assertions made by defense counsel in closing argument, \u201c[s]uch comments are impermissible whether they be intended to call attention to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify or be of such character that the jury would naturally conclude that it was a comment about the failure to testify. <em>Calling attention to the fact that a defendant failed to present evidence sails dangerously close to the wind.\u201d </em>132 Md.App. at 142-43, 751 A.2d 24 (citations omitted; emphasis added). In <em>Wise, </em>we recognized that decisions since <em>Griffin </em>\u201chave distinguished between those comments about a defendant\u2019s failure to explain by testifying and those comments about the failure of the defendant to explain through other witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 751 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In <em>Wise, </em>defense counsel, in opening statement, made a number of assertions about what the evidence would show, and then failed to introduce support for certain assertions. <em>Id. </em>at 143-45, 751 A.2d 24. In closing, the prosecutor \u201cdr[ew] the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that defense counsel had failed to fulfill his prediction in opening statement as to what he would develop at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 751 A.2d 24. On appeal, Wise argued that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument \u201cimproperly shifted the burden of proof to Wise by asking the jurors to consider Wise\u2019s failure to call witnesses in his defense or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>testify in his own defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 751 A.2d 24. This Court then addressed whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted impermissible burden shifting. We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">Maryland prosecutors, in closing argument, may not <em>routinely </em>draw the jury\u2019s attention to the failure of the defendant to call witnesses, because the argument shifts the burden of proof. On the other hand, <em>a defense attorney\u2019s promising in opening statement that the defendant will produce evidence </em>and thereafter failing to do so does open the door to the fair comment upon that failure, even to the extent of incidentally drawing attention to the defendant\u2019s exercising a constitutional right not to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 148, 751 A.2d 24 (emphasis added). We concluded that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s comments were a reasoned and justified response to the excesses of the defendant\u2019s opening statement and as such did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In <em>Mitchell, </em>during closing argument, defense counsel called the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that the State had not called six individuals who were present at the scene of the crime, Henderson, Corprew, Cochran, Carter, Chase, and Maurice Turner, as witnesses, even though the State had listed them as potential witnesses in its voir dire. 408 Md. at 375, 969 A.2d 989. Expanding on this theme to the jury, defense counsel stated: \u201cLet\u2019s bring Wal[i] Henderson here so we can see if he\u2019s a heavyset, dark-skinned man. Let\u2019s bring Antonio Cor-prew here so we can gauge his stature. Let\u2019s look at Man\u2014 Man [Cochran], what does he look like?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 969 A.2d 989. In rebuttal, and over objection, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">If [defense counsel] thought that [their] being here would have shown that something we presented was so contradictory to something about them, he could have brought them in as well. <em>The defense has subpoena power just like the State does. </em>You can\u2019t say why didn\u2019t the State present a witness, when they had an equal opportunity to present it to you, and then try to say, well, it wasn\u2019t presented. <em>They </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>had an equal right to present it if they thought it would contradict something we presented.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 379, 969 A.2d 989 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">On appeal, Mitchell argued that the prosecutor\u2019s response was improper and constituted impermissible burden-shifting. The Court of Appeals disagreed as to both contentions. As to the first, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">[D]efense counsel, in closing argument, permissibly drew the jury\u2019s attention to the absences of Wali Henderson, Antonio Corprew, Lewis \u201cMan \u2014 Man\u201d Cochran, and others. By saying \u201cLet\u2019s bring Wal[i] Henderson,\u201d Corprew, and \u201cMan \u2014 Man\u201d into the courthouse, however, defense counsel argued the relevancy of their absences and the weakness in the State\u2019s case. This maneuver \u201copened the door\u201d for the prosecutor to offer an explanation as to why those witnesses were not present. Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s choice of language in stating \u201cLet\u2019s bring Wal[i] Henderson,\u201d Cor-prew, and \u201cMan \u2014 Man\u201d into the courthouse for inspection associated the jurors with the defense, as if the jurors were entitled to see these witnesses and somehow were prevented from doing so by the State. In light of such language, a response by the prosecutor calling attention to Mitchell\u2019s subpoena power was fair comment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">Accordingly, our holding in regard to the State\u2019s rebuttal argument is a narrow one. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s remarks calling attention to the defendant\u2019s subpoena power were a tailored response to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that all the potential ivitnesses should have been brought into the courtroom </em>given what defense counsel identified as a weakness in the State\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 388-89, 969 A.2d 989 (citation omitted). The Court then addressed Mitchell\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted burden shifting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">In holding that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks calling attention to Mitchell\u2019s subpoena power were a narrow and isolated, justified response to defense counsel\u2019s \u201copening the door,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>we conclude that such remarks did not shift the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 392, 969 A.2d 989. With this as background, we return to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Appellant\u2019s suggestion that the trial court failed to properly apply the holding of <em>Wise </em>is misplaced. The holding of <em>Wise </em>is limited to cases in which defense counsel \u201cpromis[es] in opening statement that the defendant will produce evidence.\u201d 132 Md.App. at 148, 751 A.2d 24. In the present case, in contrast, defense counsel did not explicitly represent to the jury that his client would present evidence. Instead, counsel presented an artfully-worded narrative, which if believed, would exculpate his client. Moreover, as <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 392, 969 A.2d 989, indicates, the prosecutor\u2019s comments would have to be \u201cnarrow and isolated\u201d to avoid being \u201cof such character that the jury would naturally conclude that it was a comment about the failure to testify.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>132 Md.App. at 142, 751 A.2d 24. In the present case, any hypothetical closing argument would have been neither narrow nor isolated. As the State points out in its brief, the prosecutor would have been required to address no less than 26 separate factual assertions made by defense counsel in his opening statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>In explaining why it was granting the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial, the trial court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">With that level of detail, even if I limited the State to saying the defense counsel stated the following and they recite everything verbatim, which they would be allowed to do, that defense counsel said, there\u2019s absolutely no way with that level of detail that the statement \u201cthe evidence doesn\u2019t show any of all of that\u201d is not a burden-shifting statement, there\u2019s absolutely no way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">It is apparent that the trial court understood that the State is permitted, in its closing argument, to address unsubstantiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ed remarks by the defense in opening statement. It is equally clear that the court concluded that permitting the State to do so in the present case would not have been helpful to the jury in light of the level of detail provided in defense counsel\u2019s narrative. Moreover, the court recognized, appropriately in our view, that a point-by-point rebuttal to defense counsel\u2019s narrative would have the adverse, and impermissible, effect of creating confusion among jury members as to which party bore the burden of proof. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to require the prosecutor to make such an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In <em>Simmons, </em>the Court of Appeals observed that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s ruling [in] the particular situation leading to [a] mistrial ... \u2018falls in an area where the trial judge\u2019s determination is entitled to special respect.\u2019 \u201d 436 Md. at 217, 81 A.3d 383 (quoting <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 510, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978)). The <em>Simmons </em>Court also noted that in such situations, \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the likelihood of prejudice was given \u2018the highest degree of respect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 81 A.3d 383 (quoting <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 511, 98 S.Ct. 824).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We conclude that Judge Ausby did not abuse her discretion in deciding that there was a manifest necessity for granting the State\u2019s request for a mistrial.
