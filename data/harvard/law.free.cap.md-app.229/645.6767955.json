At trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Mr. Shiflett conceded that he killed her, and the contested issue was whether Mr. Shiflett, who has been diagnosed with multiple psychiatric disorders, was guilty of first- or second-degree murder. Ultimately, evidence of Mr. Shif-flet\u2019s disorders was not permitted, and Mr. Shifflet was deemed competent after a mid-trial competency hearing. But because of Mr. Shiflett\u2019s disruptive behavior in and around the courtroom, the court ordered him restrained with a stun cuff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>during the proceedings, and when he refused, excluded him from the courtroom unless he agreed to wear it. As a result, much of the trial was conducted in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">On appeal, Mr. Shiflett claims the circuit court abused its discretion by ordering him to wear a stun cuff as a condition of being present in the courtroom. In addition, he argues that the court erred by failing to strike the State\u2019s notice of intent to seek a sentence of life without parole; by excluding evidence of Mr. Shiflett\u2019s psychological profile; by concluding that Mr. Shiflett was competent to stand trial; and by denying his motion to dismiss the burglary count. We affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Mr. Shiflett and Ms. Hadel were childhood friends who became romantically involved in 2007. At that time, both Mr. Shiflett and Ms. Hadel used heroin and, as we will explain in more detail below, Mr. Shiflett suffered from several untreated mental illnesses. After Mr. Shiflett and Ms. Hadel participated in a robbery and Ms. Hadel was caught on a security camera using a stolen credit card, both were placed on probation. Mr. Shiflett later violated probation and was imprisoned for the full five-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">While in prison, and until his release in 2012, Mr. Shiflett frequently wrote threatening letters to Ms. Hadel, Ms. Hadel\u2019s mother, and Ms. Hadel\u2019s husband, Craig Gordon. In one letter, dated May 25, 2009 and addressed to Ms. Hadel, Mr. Shiflett threatened her with a graphically violent death if she didn\u2019t comply with his wishes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">I\u2019m in prison and not a day goes buy [sic] to where I don\u2019t think about you putting me hear [sic] in this place. It[\u2019]s all good why because they can\u2019t keep me forever one day I will leave this place. When I do I will come looking for you and I will find you. Where ever you might be I won\u2019t give up until I find you ... You better hope you are telling me things I want to hear. If not I will loose [sic] my mind and cut your fucking head off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Another letter, dated March 10, 2010, addressed Ms. Hadel as \u201cDear Whore\u201d and stated, \u201cNobody sends me to prison and gets away with it. It\u2019s not going to be hard to find you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">When he was released in December 2012, Mr. Shiflett moved in with his father in Annapolis. Mr. Shiflett\u2019s father testified that he believed his son\u2019s mental condition had worsened in prison, where he\u2019d spent a year-and-a-half in solitary confinement. He described his son\u2019s demeanor at the time as highly anxious, that he was unable to sleep or eat and was obsessed with Ms. Hadel. Mr. Shiflett continued to place phone calls to Ms. Hadel and her mother, as well as to write about Ms. Hadel on his Facebook page.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Mr. Shiflett disappeared from his father\u2019s house around February 1, 2013. And he followed through with his threat to find Ms. Hadel: he walked from Annapolis to Reisterstown and, by February 3, 2013, was camped out in the woods behind her apartment, waiting for her husband, Mr. Gordon, to leave. On the night of February 5, Mr. Shiflett broke into Ms. Hadel\u2019s apartment and he encountered Mr. Gordon\u2019s twelve-year old daughter, D,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> lying in bed with her laptop. He screamed \u201cWhere the F is Katie?\u201d at D, then dragged her down the hall toward Ms. Hadel\u2019s bedroom. He let go once he spotted Ms. Hadel near the bathroom, and he pulled out a knife. D escaped to a neighbor\u2019s house to get help, but by the time police arrived, Ms. Hadel had been stabbed sixteen times and was lying face down, \u201clifeless,\u201d in the bathtub. Two other children, a one-year-old and a three-year-old, were found in the apartment when police arrived; both were unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Mr. Shiflett was charged with first-degree murder, first-degree assault, first-degree burglary, third-degree burglary, carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure, and two counts of second-degree assault. He conceded that he was responsible for Ms. Hadel\u2019s murder, but disputed that the murder was premeditated. To that end, the defense attempted to introduce evidence of Mr. Shiflett\u2019s untreated mental illnesses to rebut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the State\u2019s contention that he premeditated Ms. Hadel\u2019s murder, and when that failed, to demonstrate that Mr. Shiflett was not competent to stand trial. After a mid-trial hearing, the circuit court found him competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Before and throughout trial, Mr. Shiflett behaved in a disruptive and threatening manner. He directed his displeasure primarily, although not exclusively, toward the judge and the prosecutor; he addressed both using profane adaptations of their names. He was permitted to sit in the courtroom unrestrained during jury selection, but after Mr. Shiflett tried to force his way into the judge\u2019s chambers, the court ordered him to wear a stun cuff,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a device worn around the ankle that administers an electric shock, if he wanted to remain in the courtroom for the trial. He refused to wear it, and the trial continued while he remained in the courthouse lock-up, with a video and audio hook-up that allowed him to see and hear the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The jury convicted Mr. Shiflett of first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree felony murder, and the remaining counts, except for one count of second-degree assault. At the sentencing hearing, he moved for jury sentencing, but the court denied his motion and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This timely appeal followed. We will provide more facts as appropriate to the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Mr. Shiflett presents five questions on appeal, which we address in a slightly different order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>he argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>circuit court abused its discretion by ordering him to wear a stun cuff, then by proceeding with trial in his absence when he refused to wear it. <em>Second, </em>he argues that he was entitled to have a jury determine whether he should be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, and that his life sentence, administered by the court rather than by the jury, is unconstitutional. <em>Third, </em>Mr, Shiflett argues that the trial court erred by refusing to admit testimony regarding his psychological profile, and <em>fourth, </em>in its decision that he was competent to stand trial. <em>Finally, </em>Mr. Shiflett argues that the court erred by refusing to dismiss the first-degree burglary count.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">A. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Requiring Mr. Shiflett To Wear A Stun Cuff To Remain In The Courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Mr. Shiflett argues <em>first </em>that the circuit court erred by ordering him to wear a stun cuff as a condition of remaining in the courtroom, then by allowing the trial to proceed in his absence when he refused to wear it. In-court physical restraints are inherently prejudicial to criminal defendants in that they can diminish the accused\u2019s ability to mount a meaningful defense as well as his ability to communicate with his lawyer, <em>Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 631, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005), and no reported Maryland decision has considered whether and under what circumstances a stun cuff can serve as a courtroom restraint during a jury trial. We begin, then, with a closer look at Mr. Shiflett\u2019s behavior, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>range of options available to the trial court, and the court\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Mr. Shiflett\u2019s statements and conduct had raised serious security concerns for the court long before trial. In the weeks leading up to jury selection, he\u2019d taken to writing the presiding judge letters that he sent to her home. We decline to memorialize the text of those letters in the Maryland Appellate Reports \u2014 trust us when we say that their contents were thoroughly inappropriate and venomously vulgar.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It was the Sheriff who first recommended placing Mr. Shiflett in a stun cuff after listening to a phone call Mr. Shiflett placed to his father from prison. In that particular call, Mr. Shiflett reacted to the court\u2019s ruling that he would not be permitted to introduce psychiatric testimony; the call contained \u201ca tremendous amount of profanity and some rather horrific statements\u201d about Ms. Hadel. Defense counsel objected to the Sheriffs recommendation, and after learning that Mr. Shiflett had not made any direct threats against the court or the prosecutor, the court declined to order Mr. Shiflett to wear the stun cuff in the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">As counsel knows in this case, Mr. Shiflett has written to me on many occasions. Even though I keep writing back to him telling him not to write to me, he continues to write to me. And in many of his letters, there was never a direct threat against me or the Prosecutor \u2014 or either Prosecutor, but certainly language that this Court would consider to be highly inappropriate, vulgar and heated in terms [you would] describe a letter as heated. And this Court never felt in any way that there was a threat against her cause if I did, I would have brought that to the attention frankly \u2014 of the Sheriffs office and of the State and decisions would have been made based on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">So considering the factors, being aware of the security necessary for this trial ... I\u2019m not going to order that the ankle cuff be put in. I appreciate why the Sheriffs office wanted to put it in. I think in this particular case, I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>believe it will [be] necessary. If at any time I feel that it becomes necessary, then I will modify my order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Jury selection then went forward as scheduled, and Mr. Shiflett was disruptive throughout that process. He made \u201cconstant remarks, often time inappropriate remarks, often vulgar remarks, often obscene remarks, for which the Court either tolerated ... or admonished him to stop speaking.\u201d Still, jury selection continued, and at that point the court elected not to revise its ruling on the stun cuff. But the next morning, before the courtroom day got under way, Mr. Shi-flett attempted to break free from the guards and enter the judge\u2019s chambers. A scuffle ensued as sheriffs tried to restrain him; they were eventually able to move him away from the judge, but not before he spit in a sheriffs face:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">This morning at ten to ten as Mr. Shiflett ... was being brought to begin the trial, he attempted to \u2014 I was in chambers and I heard him call out my name, my first name, several times, and saying [the Judge\u2019s name], which is my first name, and then he attempted to enter my chambers. At that point, the sheriffs \u2014 and there was three or four of them I believe that were with him at that time \u2014 moved him away from my chambers, put him up against the wall and attempted to calm him down and deter him from trying to enter my chambers in what appeared to be his effort to want to talk to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">They then moved him over into the courtroom and tried to get him to sit down. A scuffle occurred, and they were unable to really secure him, continued to become more agitated and resistive in his behavior. After that the sheriffs then took him back into the lockup, and I believe [defense counsel] came around as well in an effort to calm down Mr. Shiflett.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">I subsequently had a chambers conference with counsel, indicated my concern for courtroom security. I also had an opportunity to talk to the sheriffs since I did not witness all of the behavior of Mr. Shiflett. I only heard him screaming out and calling my first name. In further talking to the sheriffs, they indicated to me not only were they hav[ing] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>difficulty securing him, but that he also spit at one of the sheriffs. And then they attempted again to push him down the hallway to try and secure his attendance into the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">I told counsel in chambers based on his behavior this morning, that it was this Court\u2019s intent and concern for courtroom security and his highly agitated state that I was going to order the sheriffs to place a cuff on him that would administer a shock if he acted up. And that was this Court\u2019s decision. It was decided at that time to put all this on the record, and then go back to talk to Mr. Shiflett.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The court went on to explain that she wanted to place Mr. Shiflett in a stun cuff because she thought \u201chis rights are more secure and the appearance to the jury would be less intrusive with the cuff than with six sheriffs standing around him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The judge and counsel then proceeded to Mr. Shiflett\u2019s holding cell, where the court (with a court reporter present) gave Mr. Shiflett the opportunity to return to the courtroom if he agreed to wear the stun cuff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">THE COURT: The purpose of this hearing, Mr. Shiflett ... \u2014 we are in lockup, this hearing is being held in lockup\u2014 is based on your behavior this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">\u00a1\u00a1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">So based on your behavior, I have determined that the only way to maintain courtroom security, which is my job, is to have the cuff on you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">Now, you can choose not to use the cuff, not to wear the cuff. And if you choose to do that, then you will be waiving your right to be in the courtroom. You have an absolute right to be in the courtroom and participate in the proceedings. I have the absolute right as the Judge to determine courtroom security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">It is my decision, based on your conduct this morning, that you wear the cuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">[MR. SHIFLETT]: All rights-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>THE COURT: By not complying with my order, you are waiving your right under [Md. Rule] 4-281. So I wanted to advise you of your right to be present[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Amidst the confusion that followed, Mr. Shiflett responded that \u201cI\u2019m not going to wear that fucking cuff,\u201d and the court explained the implications of his decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">THE COURT: So as a result of your refusal to comply with my order, and I\u2019m doing this based on your behavior this morning and this Court\u2019s concern about courtroom security, then you will be waiving your right to be present at trial, and the trial will continue\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">[MR. SHIFLETT]: And I am not waiving my right to be present at trial. Put the microphone right here. I am not waiving my right to be present at the trial today. I want to be in the courtroom, but I\u2019m not going to be treated like I\u2019m some fucking kind of animal. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">[MR. SHIFLETT]: Now, let me say something about this bracelet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">THE COURT: So the trial \u2014 you understand the trial will continue without your presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">[MR. SHIFLETT]: I don\u2019t really care about that. That\u2019s f\u00edne.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">!|! * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">THE COURT: Okay. All right. So I\u2019m going to leave you in your cell, and every time we have a break, I\u2019m going to revisit this issue with you. So you will continue to have the right to consult with a lawyer. I am not going to have you sent back to the jail. We will continue to explore the option for you to come back into court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">From there, the trial continued in Mr. Shiflett\u2019s absence. During the luncheon recess that same day, the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel returned to Mr. Shiflett\u2019s cell, and Mr. Shiflett maintained his refusal to wear the stun cuff in the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-15\">[MR. SHIFLETT]: I ain\u2019t seeing that nasty bitch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We\u2019re about to go on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayae\">[MR.

And when I don\u2019t get any sleep, I get very moody and I get very agitated very easily, especially when asshole police officers try to put their hands on me for no unapparent reason, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-13\">Just so everybody knows that stuff.

The court reviewed the sheriffs stun cuff protocol with Mr. Shi-flett, and also gave him another opportunity to return to the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Shiflett, we are on record. I\u2019ve called your case and your attorneys are present. I wanted to put a couple of things on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">I have provided your attorney with the protocol for the use of the stun cuff that is dated September the 1st, 2011, and \u2014 and I wanted a court exhibit that will now become part of the record. Have you had an opportunity to review that with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">[MR. SHIFLETT]: (Inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">THE COURT: Okay, did he talk to you about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">[MR.

So this is an order that is \u2014 was developed by the sheriffs office that gives the protocol for when the stun cuff can be used. Specifically it says under Paragraph 3-B, that it can be used to control violent or potentially violent prisoners when a member, which is a sheriff, reasonably believes that the following conditions exist: Number one, lethal force does not appear to be justifiable and/or necessary, attempts to subdue the individual by conventional tactics will likely cause injury to the individual members, c[o]urt personnel or citizens, and then there will be a reasonable expectation that will be unsafe for members to be approaching the individual within contact range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Those are the \u2014 the criteria for use of a stun cuff, which also includes persons that are trained to use it, where they affix it which is in your \u2014 at your ankle level, and the \u2014 the proper use of it, and the \u2014 the only criteria, which are the ones I just described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">[MR.

You can change your mind at anytime, and I will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>continue to offer you[ ] that option during the day. If at any time you change your mind, you can let the sheriff know ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On at least one occasion every day through the conclusion of trial, the court met with Mr. Shiflett, on the record and with counsel present, and offered him the opportunity to return to the courtroom with the stun cuff on. Each time, he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">1. The court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that restraints were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Mr. Shiflett argues that, as a preliminary matter, the court\u2019s decision to order restraints of any kind was an abuse of discretion. Visible physical restraints during trial are inherently prejudicial to criminal defendants because they \u201chighlight the need to separate the defendant from the community at large,\u201d and undermine the presumption of innocence and the fairness of the fact-finding process. <em>Wagner v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 419, 476-77, 74 A.3d 765 (2013) (quoting <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 409, 583 A.2d 218 (1990)); <em>see also Deck, </em>544 U.S. at 630, 125 S.Ct. 2007, <em>People v. Allen, </em>222 Ill.2d 340, 305 Ill.Dec. 544, 856 N.E.2d 349, 352 (2006) (\u201cThe presumption of innocence is central to our administration of justice. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, an accused has the right to stand trial with the appearance, dignity, and self-respect of a free and innocent man.\u201d) (citations omitted). For that reason, the Due Process Clause \u201cprohibits the use of physical restraints visible to a jury absent a trial court determination, in the exercise of its discretion, that they are justified by a state interest specific to a particular trial.\u201d <em>Deck, </em>544 U.S. at 629, 125 S.Ct. 2007. This applies to both the guilt and sentencing phases of trial. <em>Id. </em>at 633, 125 S.Ct. 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Even so, three essential state interests \u201cmay justify physically restraining a defendant: Preventing the defendant\u2019s escape, protecting those in the courtroom, and maintaining order in the courtroom.\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>213 Md.App. at 477, 74 A.3d 765 (quoting <em>Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 569, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986)). \u201cWhere a defendant is \u2018disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant\u2019 in a manner that inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>feres with the dignity, order, and decorum of the courtroom, the trial court has the discretion to order \u2018constitutionally permissible\u2019 accommodations.\u201d <em>In re D.M., </em>228 Md.App. 451, 455, 139 A.3d 1073 (2016) (citing <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 343-44, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970)). So restraints aren\u2019t <em>per se </em>unconstitutional \u2014 the issue in each case is whether the restraint \u201cwas so inherently prejudicial that [Mr. Shi-flett] was thereby denied his constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>Holbrook, </em>475 U.S. at 567, 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340. \u201cThe prejudice posed by security measures, and whether a compelling state interest outweighs that prejudice, must be measured on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>321 Md. at 410, 583 A.2d 218. And ultimately, restraints are appropriate if, after making an individual evaluation, the court decides that the need for the restraint outweighs the potential prejudice, and ensures that the record reflects the need for extraordinary security measures. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Mr. Shiflett acknowledges, as he must, that physical restraints may be appropriate when the court makes a particularized finding on the record that a compelling interest outweighs the prejudice to the defendant. Instead, he argues that his behavior at trial did not justify restraining him in the manner the court ordered here. By Mr. Shiflett\u2019s account, he simply tried to enter the presiding judge\u2019s chambers in an attempt to talk to her. Although his actions undoubtedly were inappropriate, he argues, they failed to demonstrate any concrete threat, and did not support a finding that restraints were necessary. This argument isn\u2019t borne out by the transcript though, which reveals that Mr. Shiflett screamed the judge\u2019s name from outside her chambers until he was forcibly restrained, which resulted in a fracas during which Mr. Shiflett spit in a sheriffs face. By the time this incident occurred, Mr. Shiflett had already sent the presiding judge inappropriate, vulgar letters at her home address, and the sheriff had already recommended that the court order Mr. Shiflett to wear the stun cuff in light of his phone calls from prison. The incident formed the basis for the court\u2019s on-record, particularized finding that Mr. Shiflett posed a threat to courtroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>security, and we discern no abuse of discretion in that finding, and Mr. Shiflett\u2019s subsequent demeanor and behavior only confirmed the correctness of the court\u2019s assessment. And as such, the court did not err when it ordered Mr. Shiflett restrained, so long as the need to protect courtroom order and security outweighed any prejudice to Mr. Shiflett that might result from the restraint imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">2. The court\u2019s compelling interest in maintaining security and order outweighed any prejudice to Mr. Shiflett.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Assuming that we would disagree with his contention that no restraints were required, Mr. Shiflett argues <em>next </em>that the security measures imposed by the court \u2014 an ultimatum to wear the stun cuff or be excluded from the court room \u2014 was unreasonable. He contends that the cuff would have put him at risk of injury, and would have unfairly prejudiced him by interfering with his ability to participate in his own defense and to consult with counsel. He asks us to hold that the court abused its discretion in ordering him to wear the cuff when other (in his view, less prejudicial) options were available, such as leg irons or ordering additional sheriffs to guard him in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">His argument flows, however, from the faulty premise that judges are required to employ the least restrictive alternative, as judged by twenty-twenty hindsight. The standard is in fact more realistic. \u201cTrial judges confronted with disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. at 344, 90 S.Ct. 1057. And therefore, judges have \u201cbroad discretion in maintaining courtroom security,\u201d and we review a trial judge\u2019s decision regarding the manner of restraint for abuse of discretion. <em>Hunt, </em>321 Md. at 408, 583 A.2d 218. We need not determine \u201cwhether less stringent security measures were available to the trial court, but whether the measures applied were reasonable, and whether they posed an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, we assess the methods the court actually used \u2014 the requirement that Mr. Shiflett wear the stun cuff as a condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>of remaining in the courtroom \u2014 in the context of the security and behavioral threats he posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><em>First, </em>we hold that the court's decision to exclude Mr. Shiflett from the courtroom was reasonable under the circumstances. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be present at every stage of his trial, but a defendant \u201cwho engages in conduct that justifies exclusion from the courtroom\u201d waives that right, Md. Rule 4-231(c)(l)~ (2). The Supreme Court held in <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>that a trial judge confronted with a disruptive defendant can \u201c(1) bind and gag the defendant, thereby [keeping the defendant in the courtroom]; (2) cite [the defendant] for contempt; or (3) take him out of the courtroom until he promises to conduct himself properly.\u201d 397 U.S. at 344, 90 S.Ct. 1057. Those possible alternatives aren\u2019t exhaustive, though; courts faced with similarly recalcitrant defendants have employed these security methods, and others, to varying degrees of success, and the \u201cappropriateness and lawfulness of any action taken in a given case will depend naturally on the facts of each case.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>382 Md. 329, 343-45, 855 A.2d 339 (2004) (approving the trial court\u2019s decision to cite a disruptive defendant for contempt three times throughout his trial); <em>see also Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 720, 569 A.2d 1254 (1990) (upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to post four plainclothes marshals in addition to two bailiffs as a security measure); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>306 Md. 120, 138, 507 A.2d 1072 (1986) (finding no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision, at the recommendation of the sheriffs office, to order the defendant to wear leg irons during trial); <em>Wagner, </em>213 Md.App. at 481, 74 A.3d 765 (observing that no prejudice resulted from placing the defendant in shackles for the jury\u2019s verdict announcement, because the shackles were hidden by the defendant\u2019s suit coat, while his leg irons were obscured because he was standing up). However, \u201ctrial in absentia should be the extraordinary case, \u2018undertaken only after the exercise of a careful discretion by the trial court.\u201d <em>Biglari v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 657, 674, 847 A.2d 1239 (2004) (quoting <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>350 Md. 201, 221, 711 A.2d 205 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Mr. Shiflett did not simply speak out of turn or make the occasional outburst. He consistently used angry, vulgar, and violent language with the court. He repeatedly threatened the judge and the prosecutor. And he defecated on the floor of his cell in a temporarily successful effort to prevent the trial from proceeding. Faced with this magnitude of disruption to the proceedings and to the safety and security of everyone involved, the court chose <em>Allen\u2019s </em>third option, <em>ie., </em>to remove Mr. Shiflett from the courtroom until he agreed to conduct himself appropriately. <em>See </em>397 U.S. at 344, 90 S.Ct. 1057. The court offered Mr. Shiflett numerous opportunities to return and behave, and he refused all of them. Mr. Shiflett\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights did not entitle him to thwart his trial, and the court was well within its discretion to exclude him rather than binding and gagging him (which might have created even more prejudice than excluding him altogether), citing him for contempt (which would have been pointless in this case), or trying other methods of restraining him, such as adding further shackles or other physical restraints or increasing the number of security personnel in the room. <em>Smith, </em>382 Md. at 343, 855 A.2d 339; <em>Wagner, </em>213 Md.App. at 481, 74 A.3d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><em>Second, </em>we discern no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to condition Mr. Shiflett\u2019s reentry to the courtroom upon agreement to wear the stun cuff. The constitutional right to be tried without physical restraint, once lost, \u201ccan, of course, be reclaimed as soon as the defendant is willing to conduct himself consistently with the decorum and respect inherent in the concept of courts and judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. at 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057. To that end, a court \u201cthat removes the defendant from the courtroom must advise him of the opportunity to return if he promises to behave.\u201d <em>Biglari, </em>156 Md.App. at 671, 847 A.2d 1239. But at each of the court\u2019s post-removal meetings with him, and we count at least four, Mr. Shiflett emphatically declined this opportunity. Each time the court consulted with Mr. Shiflett in lockup, he refused unequivocally to promise that he would behave, choosing instead to continue flinging profanity and sexually explicit insults at the judge and prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Because his erratic behavior continued and escalated as the trial progressed, even after his removal, the court was entirely justified in removing Mr. Shiflett from the court room and in setting conditions for his return. We agree as well that requiring him to wear the stun cuff was a reasonable condition. Mr. Shiflett complains that the cuff would have put him at risk of injury in the event he became immobilized and fell when a shock was delivered,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that its chilling effect might have impaired his ability to participate in his own defense. Those risks are real, and we do not seek to diminish them, although Mr. Shiflett\u2019s categorical refusal even to try it on<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> leaves us no record on which to evaluate the likelihood or extent of the risk he faced. Even so, and assuming that the risks were as Mr. Shiflett contends, they were outweighed by court\u2019s compelling interests in order, safety, and security. And we also see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s assessment that alternatives, such as binding or gagging or shackling or surrounding Mr. Shiflett with an entourage of law enforcement personnel, would have risked causing at least as much prejudice before the jury as the stun cuff.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">By his own reckoning, Mr. Shiflett behaved as he did in order to prevent his trial from proceeding. His conduct, and no one else\u2019s, created the problems the court was forced to solve. He complains now that the court abused its discretion in restraining him, but \u201cour courts, palladiums of liberty as they are, cannot be treated disrespectfully with impunity.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. at 346, 90 S.Ct. 1067. Mr. Shiflett put the court to a delicate balancing challenge. He faced serious charges, and obviously has important constitutional rights that the court was obliged to recognize and protect. At the same time, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Shiflett was not in control of the process, and the court was equally not obliged to let him disrupt the trial and threaten court personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Because Mr. Shiflett never wore the stun cuff or attempted to discover its impacts or limits, this case affords us no opportunity to rule broadly on its uses or limitations as a restraint. We recognize that stun cuffs are a potentially severe form of restraint, one that could be calibrated or applied improperly, and there is something viscerally disturbing about a device that administers electric shocks to another human being. That all said, Mr. Shiflett left the court with no choice\u2014 he was determined to thwart his trial, and his aggressive refusal even to attempt to conduct himself appropriately waived his right to be present in the courtroom for trial. We see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s patient efforts to find a way for Mr. Shiflett to return and participate in his trial, or in its decision to condition his return on an agreement to wear the stun cuff.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">B. The Trial Court Correctly Denied the Motion For Jury Sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\"><em>Second, </em>Mr. Shiflett argues that because the State filed a notice of intention to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, he was entitled to elect sentencing by jury, and the circuit court erred in denying his motion for sentencing by jury. His argument is primarily a statutory one \u2014 that the language the General Assembly left behind in Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.), \u00a7 2-304(b) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCR\u201d), after removing the parts relating to the death penalty,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> extended to defendants facing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>life without parole the sentencing by jury procedures previously reserved for capital defendants. He argues as well that once Maryland repealed its death penalty, a sentence of life without the possibility of parole is more than an enhanced sentence \u2014 it is \u201cthe harshest sentence that can be imposed on a defendant in this State,\u201d to which the constitutional protections accorded previously to defendants facing life sentences now attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In the time since the briefs were filed in this case, however, we had occasion to address and reject the same arguments in <em>Bellard v. State, </em>229 Md.App. 312, 145 A.3d 61, 2016 WL 4540423 (2016). As the Supreme Court\u2019s death penalty jurisprudence has long recognized, the death penalty is different, and the unique permanence of capital punishment compels procedural safeguards that other punishments do not \u2014 even punishments, such as life imprisonment without parole, that are meant to be permanent. <em>Bellard, </em>at 330-32, 145 A.3d 61. Although the legislation repealing Maryland\u2019s death penalty did, through apparent clerical inadvertence, create some ambiguity in the statute governing sentencing procedures in life without parole cases, <em>see id. </em>at 332-36, 145 A.3d 61, the structure and legislative history left no doubt that the purpose of that legislation was to repeal the death penalty, not to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the sentencing procedures or create new rights for defendants where the State seeks life without parole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">But we need not dig deeply into Senate Bill 276 to find its purpose. The bill\u2019s Preamble says in so many words that its purpose was \u201crepealing the death penalty,\u201d and the Fiscal and Policy Note states that the bill \u201crepeals the death penalty and all provisions relating to it.\u201d Fiscal and Policy Note Revised, S.B. 276 Md. at 1. Neither mentions other alterations to the sentencing authority or procedures for first-degree murder, and the provisions of the bill itself simply removed portions of the Maryland Code relating to the death penalty and replaced references to repealed language. This obviously was a complicated task, and details can \u2014 and apparently did \u2014 get overlooked. But our two alternatives are to acknowledge that subsection (b) of CR \u00a7 2-304 has become purely vestigial, or to interpolate an intention on the part of the General Assembly to create jury sentencing rights that previously didn\u2019t exist in non-capital first-degree murder cases. We see nothing in the purpose or language of the legislation itself that suggests any intent to expand jury sentencing to defendants facing life without parole. And although we could have stopped there, we reviewed the legislative history as well, and it too supports a conclusion that the purpose of the legislation was to repeal the death penalty, rather than alter sentencing procedures in non-capital murder eases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 336-37, 145 A.3d 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">In rejecting Mr. Shiflett\u2019s contention that Section 2-304 unambiguously requires that a life without parole sentence be imposed by a jury, we must also reject his request that we apply the rule of lenity. The rule, which would require that we construe in favor of the defendant any ambiguity in a criminal penal statute, applies only when a \u201cstatute is open to more than one interpretation <em>and the court is otherwise unable to determine which interpretation is intended by the Legislature.\u201d Oglesby v. State, </em>441 Md. 673, 676, 109 A.3d 1147 (2015) (emphasis added). But the tools of statutory construction have not failed us here: the legislature intended to repeal the death penalty, <em>not </em>to create a right to jury sentencing in life without parole cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Our opinion in <em>Bellard </em>also rejected the other arguments that Mr. Shiflett raises here: that the absence of jury sentencing guidelines or restrictions on prosecutorial discretion rendered the life without parole sentencing process unconstitutionally vague, 337-38, 145 A.3d 61 (citing <em>Woods v. State, </em>315 Md. 591, 602-08, 556 A.2d 236 (1989)), and that the elimination of the death penalty elevated life without parole to the status of an \u201cenhanced sentence\u201d that requires proof of additional facts beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 338-39, 145 A.3d 61 (citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)). And again, to reach any of these conclusions we would need to hold, in the in the face of longstanding (and controlling) precedent to the contrary, that death was not, in fact, different, or that life without parole became \u201cdifferent\u201d once the death penalty was repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">C. The Court Did Not Err In Excluding Evidence Of Mr. Shiflett\u2019s Psychological Profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Mr. Shiflett argues <em>third </em>that the circuit court erred by refusing to let the defense introduce expert testimony describing his \u201cpsychological profile,\u201d a term he uses to describe the constellation of mental illnesses from which he claims he suffers. In its case-in-chief, the State introduced threatening letters Mr. Shiflett had written to Ms. Hadel as evidence of his premeditation and intent to kill her. Mr. Shiflett argues that he should have been allowed to rebut these with evidence of his psychological profile because, he believes, this evidence would have demonstrated that the letters were the product of his mental illness. And he contends that the testimony would have proven that he was unable to form the <em>mens rea </em>defined in CR \u00a7 2-201 for the charge of first-degree murder, that is, a deliberate, premeditated, and willful killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The State disputes the factual bases of Mr. Shiflett\u2019s proposed psychological profile testimony, but argues in any event that his obsession with Ms. Hadel had no bearing on whether he acted with premeditation and deliberation or his ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>form the specific intent to kill. The State characterizes the testimony as an effort by Mr. Shiflett to offer a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense, <em>ie., </em>that he was less capable than a normal person of forming the required <em>mens rea, </em>that is unavailable under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">At a motions hearing on August 6, 2014, Mr. Shiflett offered testimony from Dr. Joanna Brandt, who diagnosed Mr. Shi-flett with specified bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and borderline personality disorder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">[T]he combination of illnesses is particularly malignant for him and is \u2014 are very impairing and have significant impact on his thinking and behavior. The first illness that I diagnosed was other specified bipolar disorder ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">These symptoms that he has of elevated mood and expansive and irritable mood when \u2014 when he has a manic episode, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, agitation and im-pulsivity, and he describes that he has felt like his head is exploding on numerous occasion. He also clearly has episodes of depressed mood where he has hypersomnia and sleeps a lot, low energy, poor concentration, feelings of worthlessness and suicidal ideation. The records and his father corroborate that he has had these symptoms since childhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">The second illness I diagnosed him with was obsessive compulsive disorder. This was diagnosed in him at age 7 or 8. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges or images that are experienced as intrusive or unwanted and caused marked anxiety or distress. Individuals with obsessions attempt to ignore, suppress them or they attempt to neutralize them with a thought or action[,] that is by performing a compulsion which is a behavior. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Compulsions are repetitive behaviors such as hand washing, ordering or counting or other mental acts or physical acts that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\u00a1\u00a1s # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">And to complicate matters further, he \u2014 he really has a severe permanent disorder which is characterized by borderline paranoid and antisocial traits. ... He becomes extremely angry very quick. He \u2014 he had unstable interpersonal relationships. He\u2019s severely sensitive to being abandoned by others. He becomes very, very angry, and he acts in a very impulsive way. He has paranoid thoughts that are part of his personality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Later, Dr. Brandt explained Mr. Shiflett\u2019s thought processes and the limitations on his ability to control himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">So in \u2014 in anger and with increasing frustration, he threatened the victim for years. But at the same time, he was constantly thinking about trying to avoid acting on his impulse, and he was repeatedly failing at this. He tried to think of ways that he could get her to talk to him by threatening to bring civil action on her or have various agencies come in and stop her food stamps or get her husband in trouble. He wrote her letters saying, Please talk to me. He tried to contact her through Facebook, he had a friend call, and he \u2014 he recognized how out of control he was. He has for many years recognized this, but he <em>has that inability to stop himself and not act over and over again.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Z\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The court excluded Dr. Brandt\u2019s testimony after concluding that there was no nexus between Mr. Shiflett\u2019s psychological profile and the specific intent required to prove first-degree murder. The court compared this situation to those in <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 611 A.2d 581 (1992) and <em>Bryant v. State, </em>163 Md.App. 451, 881 A.2d 669 (2005), and found that the testimony lacked an adequate factual basis, and had no relevance to any material issue or defense in the case. The testimony, the court ruled, fell short of what Md. Rule 5-702 required for the admission of expert testimony and would only confuse the jury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">The State must prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, including intent. Generally, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>fore, defense evidence that could prove that the intent element of the crime did not exist, whether due to mental impairment or some other reason, is admissible. <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 494, 536 A.2d 622 (1988). Mr. Shiflett sought here to demonstrate the absence of intent through expert testimony from a psychiatrist, and \u201c[ejxpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Md. Rule 5-702. But expert testimony is admissible only if it is relevant, <em>ie., </em>\u201cif the jury will find the testimony helpful in resolving the issues in the case.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>163 Md.App. at 473, 881 A.2d 669. And for expert testimony about Mr. Shiflett\u2019s psychological profile to be helpful to the jury in determining whether he formed the <em>mens rea </em>for first-degree murder, the testimony must bear a \u201crational nexus to the issues of premeditation and intent.\u201d <em>Hartless, </em>327 Md. at 577, 611 A.2d 581. Whether that rational nexus exists, and whether there is a sufficient factual basis to support the expert\u2019s testimony, is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and a \u201ccourt\u2019s action in admitting or excluding such testimony seldom constitutes grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>163 Md.App. at 472, 881 A.2d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Because psychiatrists are no more clairvoyant than any other witness, and lack the ability to reconstruct the emotions of a person at a specific time, they ordinarily are not competent to express an opinion as to the belief or intent a person harbored at a particular time. <em>Hartless, </em>327 Md. at 573, 611 A.2d 581. A trial court <em>may </em>allow an expert to testify (as long as the testimony meets the requirements of Md. Rule 5-702) about a defendant\u2019s psychological profile if that testimony allows the jury to infer that the defendant was suffering from the symptoms of that psychiatric disorder on the date in question. <em>See Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 48, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988), <em>Bryant v. State, </em>163 Md.App. at 476, 881 A.2d 669. But as we see from the cases in which defendants have tried this approach before, there must be a direct connection between the fact and symptoms of the asserted mental illness and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>specific mental state at issue \u2014 experts cannot simply identify an illness or symptom and opine generally on what the defendant might or might not have been able to do at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On one hand, in <em>Simmons, </em>the defendant was accused of murder and, to support his defense of imperfect self-defense, sought to introduce testimony from a psychiatrist to confirm his subjective belief that he was in danger. 313 Md. at 48, 542 A.2d 1258. The Court of Appeals concluded that the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony was \u201crelevan[t] in that consistency between the specific subjective belief testified to by Simmons and Simmons\u2019s psychological profile tend[ed] to make it more likely that Simmons in fact held that subjective belief ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 39, 542 A.2d 1258, because it went directly to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. In <em>Hartless, </em>on the other hand, the Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision not to admit psychological profile testimony for a defendant who had stabbed and killed a clerk during the course of robbing a store because the testimony, which would have explained that the defendant \u201cwas under a tremendous amount of stress from his father,\u201d bore no rational nexus to the relevant issues of premeditation and intent. 327 Md. at 575, 611 A.2d 581. The Court noted that a psychological profile is admissible only if it carries significance beyond \u201ca simple recitation of the defendant\u2019s background,\u201d that the profile had to explain how the defendant did not intend to commit murder, or how the murder was not deliberate and premediated, or else it would not be helpful to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 575-77, 611 A.2d 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Finally, in <em>Bryant, </em>a defendant charged with the first-degree murder of his ex-wife sought to rebut the State\u2019s claim that the murder was premeditated with psychiatric testimony that he suffered from an impulse control disorder. 163 Md.App. at 463, 881 A.2d 669. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision not to admit that testimony,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> noting the objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>evidence that the defendant acted with premeditation by pacing near the victim\u2019s residence for hours, asking neighbors about who lived in the victim\u2019s residence, and cutting the phone cords in the victim\u2019s house, and that even with the disorder, the defendant was sometimes able to control his impulses. <em>Id. </em>Nothing connected his disorder to the criminal act itself: \u201cThe doctor\u2019s testimony would merely have presented evidence that appellant suffered from an impulse control disorder, which sometimes prevented him from controlling his aggressive impulses. There was simply no evidence that Ms. Martin\u2019s murder was the result of an impulsive act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 881 A.2d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">This case and the testimony Mr. Shiflett sought to introduce are much more like <em>Hartless </em>and <em>Bryant </em>than <em>Simmons. </em>Dr. Brandt\u2019s testimony that Mr. Shiflett obsessed over Ms. Hadel, threatened her, acted with an intent to evoke a response from her, and had difficulty controlling his impulses would have borne no rational nexus to his ability to plan and carry out Ms. Hadel\u2019s murder. To the contrary, Dr. Brandt conceded that Mr. Shiflett had thought about killing Ms. Hadel for years, but had managed to avoid acting on that impulse in the past. She also would have offered no evidentiary basis to support Mr. Shiflett\u2019s claim that his mental illnesses prevented him from premeditating Ms. Hadel\u2019s murder. And as in <em>Bryant, </em>the evidence demonstrates that the murder was deliberate and premeditated: Mr. Shiflett <em>walked </em>from Annapolis to Reisters-town, staked out Ms. Hadel\u2019s apartment for two full days, then waited until her husband was gone before he killed her. Without some direct connection between Mr. Shiflett\u2019s disorders and his ability to plan and carry out this murder, Dr. Brandt\u2019s testimony would have invited the jury to speculate about what was or wasn\u2019t in his mind at the time, and was therefore properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">D. Mr. Shiflett Was Competent To Stand Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\"><em>Fourth, </em>Mr. Shiflett argues that the circuit court erred in finding him competent to stand trial. At the conclusion of the third day of trial, the court ordered a competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>evaluation in response to Mr. Shiflett\u2019s request to discharge his counsel. Over the next two days, the court heard testimony from Doctors Stephen Siebert, Christiane Tellefsen, and Joanna Brandt; Dr. Siebert<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Dr. Tellefsen ultimately concluded that Mr. Shiflett was competent, and Dr. Brandt testified that he was not. After hearing all the testimony, the court ruled Mr. Shiflett competent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">I find that not only does he understand the nature and object of the proceeding, but that he is absolutely able to assist in his defense, has assisted in his defense, shows a high level of insight into the nature of the case, the witnesses presented. And although he has shown a \u2014 a dissatisfaction with counsel ... that is not the standard. And this Court feels that h[e] is able to control his actions when it suits him, and understands how this case is proceeding and can assist in his defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">A criminal defendant has a Fourteenth Amendment Due Process right not to be tried while incompetent, and this prohibition \u201cis fundamental to an adversary system of justice.\u201d <em>Sibug v. </em>State, 445 Md. 265, 301, 126 A.3d 86 (2015) (quoting <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 172, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975)). A defendant is incompetent if he or she is unable to understand the nature or object of the proceeding, or to assist in [his or her] defense. Md. Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol,), \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(f) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d); <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 84-85, 622 A.2d 727 (1993). If the defendant\u2019s competency is in doubt, whether the question is raised by counsel or the court decides to pursue the matter <em>sua sponte, </em>the court must conduct a hearing to determine \u201cwhether [the accused] has sufficient present ability to consult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Sibug, </em>445 Md. at 300-01, 126 A.3d 86 (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">A court may consider competency at any time before or during trial, and <em>must </em>undertake a competency review if the defendant appears to be incompetent or alleges incompetence. <em>Peaks v. State, </em>419 Md. 239, 252, 18 A.3d 917 (2011). The court starts with a presumption of competence and must determine, based on the record, that the defendant is competent to stand trial beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52, 18 A.3d 917; CP \u00a7 3-104(a). The inquiry is highly fact-specific, and we review competency decisions for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 18 A.3d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Mr. Shiflett contends that the court\u2019s conclusion that he was competent, which rested on Mr. Shiflett\u2019s alleged ability to control his actions, was not supported by the doctors\u2019 testimony. We disagree, and find that the doctors\u2019 testimony provided ample evidence to support the court\u2019s conclusion. For example, Dr. Tellefsen testified that Mr. Shiflett not only was competent, but had a fairly sophisticated level of knowledge about the trial and the defenses available to him. In her opinion, Mr. Shiflett could control his behavior, particularly when he believed it was to his advantage to do so, and his disruptive behavior in the court room flowed from his desire to \u201cimpress everyone that he\u2019s mentally ill.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Siebert concluded that Mr. Shiflett was competent to stand trial, notwithstanding his erratic behavior, after listening to a recorded phone call between Mr. Shiflett and his father after the first day of trial in which Mr. Shiflett made specific statements about his capacity to regulate his own behavior:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">For example, he said that he \u2014 if anybody tried to put a shock bracelet on him, that he was going to swing on them. He even said that he told the \u2014 the sheriffs that ... I have been giving none of you problems up at this \u2014 up to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>point, but if they try to put that shock bracelet on \u2014 on me, I will swing at them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">At the very end of the phone call he said to the father, he said the following: I have been giving them a raft of hell and they know it. And I believe he was referring to the \u2014 this trial. In other words, I \u2014 I believe that he was referring in that telephone call to the fact that ... his disruptive behavior has been disruptive to the flow of this criminal trial up to the present time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Mr. Shiflett responds by pointing to Dr. Brandt\u2019s findings that he was unable to control his behavior when agitated, and would be unable to testify in his own defense in a relevant manner. He attacks Dr. Tellefsen\u2019s conclusions, saying that she conceded he was out of control at times and unable to communicate with his attorney, and argues that Dr. Siebert was wrong to rely on a phone call he made the first day of trial because his mental state deteriorated as the trial went on. But although the experts reached conflicting conclusions, the standard doesn\u2019t require unanimity, and the trial court\u2019s finding that Mr. Shiflett was competent was supported by ample evidence. Both Dr. Tellefsen and Dr. Siebert concluded that Mr. Shiflett was, for the most part, able to control his behavior, and demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the proceedings against him and his defenses, and both doctors found that Mr. Shiflett was aware that emphasizing his mental illness would work to his advantage. \u201cWeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder,\u201d <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 311, 326, 827 A.2d 124 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998)), and we see no error in the court\u2019s decision to credit Dr. Tellefsen\u2019s and Dr. Siebert\u2019s conclusions over Dr. Brandt\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">E. The Burglaiy Charge Is Not Duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\"><em>Finally, </em>Mr. Shiflett argues that the circuit court erred by refusing to dismiss his first-degree burglary charge. Count Three of Mr. Shiflett\u2019s indictment alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>on or about 2/5/2013, in Baltimore County, did unlawfully break and enter the dwelling of Katie Ann Hadel-Gordon, located at [victim\u2019s address], in violation of Criminal Law Article 6-202 of the Annotated Code of Maryland; against the peace government and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A person commits first degree burglary under CR \u00a7 6-202 by \u201cbreaking] and entering] the dwelling of another with the intent to commit theft <em>or </em>a crime of violence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Mr. Shiflett appears to argue that the indictment, by simply referencing CR \u00a7 6-202 rather than specifying whether the alleged burglary was committed with the intent to commit theft or the intent to commit a crime of violence, in effect charges him with more than one substantive offense in a single count. The State counters that the language in the indictment tracks precisely the language of CR \u00a7 6-210, which provides that a charging document for burglary is sufficient \u201cif it substantially states: \u2018(name of defendant) on (date) in (county) did break and enter (describe property) or (describe other crime) in violation of (section violated) against the peace, government, and dignity of the State,\u201d\u2019 We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The charging document is meant to fulfill the constitutional requirement of Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights that each person charged with a crime have notice of the accusations. <em>Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 336, 493 A.2d 1062 (1985). Thus, the charging document must allege the essential elements of the offense charged, and only one offense may be charged in a single count. <em>Ayre v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 61, 64, 318 A.2d 828 (1974). Mr. Shiflett points to <em>Thanos v. State, </em>in which the Court of Appeals held that when a statute forbids several separate actions and states those actions disjunctively \u2014 with an \u201cor\u201d \u2014 simply referring to the statute in a single count of the indictment to allege that the defendant committed one of those actions \u201cwill be defective as indefinite, since the disjunctive renders it uncertain which alternative is intended.\u201d 282 Md. 709, 716-17, 387 A.2d 286 (1978). In <em>Thanos, </em>the State prosecuted a shoplifter, and the charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>document stated that she had removed the tag from a garment for sale in a Towson department store. <em>Id. </em>at 710, 387 A.2d 286. The court explained that had the charging document duplicated the language of the shoplifting statute exactly, and charged the defendant with \u201caltering], remov[ing], <em>or </em>otherwise disfiguring] a price tag,\u201d rather than removal, it would have been defective for uncertainty. <em>Id. </em>at 717, 387 A.2d 286 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Since <em>Thcmos, </em>however, both this Court and the Court of Appeals have confirmed that the charging document need not set forth all essential elements of the crime, and that some elements may be implied. <em>Jones, </em>303 Md. at 337, 493 A.2d 1062. For example, in <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>this Court found that the simply citing the statute number was essentially \u201cincorporation by reference,\u201d having the same effect as if the text of the statute had been set forth in full. 54 Md.App. 428, 445, 458 A.2d 905 (1983). Thus, we held that the language of an indictment was not duplicitous when it charged the defendant with theft \u201cin violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 342 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 458 A.2d 905. Although the statute listed, in the disjunctive, five different ways in which the crime of theft can be perpetrated, we found that the reference to theft by using the short form \u00a7 342 in effect charged the defendant <em>conjunctively </em>with any or all of the five methods. <em>Id. </em>at 442, 458 A.2d 905; <em>see also Jones, </em>303 Md. at 338, 493 A.2d 1062 (confirming that the Court of Appeals \u201cshare[s] the views so well expressed in <em>Whitehead\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">By citing to CR \u00a7 6-202, the indictment charged Mr. Shi-flett with committing burglary by \u201cany or all\u201d of the requisite intents listed. The State volunteered, at a hearing five months prior to trial, that it would proceed on the theory that Mr. Shiflett broke into the victim\u2019s home with the intent to commit a crime of violence. If Mr. Shiflett required more notice of what he was being charged with, he could have requested a bill of particulars, but he didn\u2019t, nor does he dispute that the indictment complied with the language required by CR \u00a7 6-210.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The Baltimore County Sheriff\u2019s Office maintains a protocol for the use of a stun cuff, which defines it as \"[a] conducted energy device that is secured to a subject\u2019s ankle and deployed remotely.\u201d The Sheriff goes on to describe the stun cuff as an electronic control device, that is, a \"non-lethal device that emits an electronic energy charge, which causes electro-muscular disruption, which affects the sensory and motor functions of the central nervous system.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-10\">. Mr. Shiflett phrased the questions as follows in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">1. Must Mr. Shiflett\u2019s life without parole sentence be vacated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2A\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it refused to permit defense counsel to introduce expert testimony about Mr. Shiflett\u2019s psychological profile, when such testimony was relevant to his ability to premeditate and form the requisite intent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">3. Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it ordered Mr. Shiflett to wear a stun cuff and when it thereafter permitted trial to proceed in his absence after he refused to wear the cuff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">4. Did the trial court err when it determined after a mid-trial competency hearing that Mr. Shiflett was competent to stand trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">5. Did the trial court err when it denied defense counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss the burglary count?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b642-24\">. We refer in the block quotes to the identity of the person being addressed rather than reproducing Mr. Shiflett\u2019s names for them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">. The sheriff\u2019s protocol for using the stun cuff describes it as \u201cdesigned for temporary immobilization of a subject [that] should not cause any significant injury.\u201d However, the protocol warns that \"a subject may receive secondary injuries as a result of falling when the subject is immobilized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\">, We note as well that at no point, in the circuit court or here, did Mr. Shiflett or counsel propose, let alone agree to, any alternative form of restraint,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\">. CR \u00a7 2-304, as amended, provides in subsection (a) that a court should conduct the sentencing proceeding in life without parole cases, but in subsection (b) provides for jury sentencing. We reproduce the applicable sections below, providing emphasis to indicate the references to the jury upon which Mr. Shiflett relies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If the State gave notice under \u00a7 2-203(1) of this title, <em>the court </em>shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding as soon as practicable after the defendant is found guilty of murder in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>degree to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">(b) Findings. \u2014 (1) A determination by <em>a jury </em>to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole must be unanimous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">(2) If <em>the jury </em>finds that a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole shall be imposed, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment of life without the possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">(3) If, within a reasonable time, <em>the jury </em>is unable to agree to imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for life,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">. We also held in <em>Bryant </em>that there could be no rational nexus between the proffered testimony and the particular facts of this case because the defendant denied ever committing the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 480-81, 881 A.2d 669.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">. In his initial testimony, offered September 18, 2014, Dr. Siebert concluded that Mr. Shiflett was not competent and would be unable to follow the proceedings or meaningfully answer questions, citing his concern that Mr. Shiflett was unable to explain what he was charged with during his competency evaluation. However, after reviewing video recordings of Mr. Shiflett at the detention center and listening to recorded telephone conversations between Mr. Shiflett and his father, Dr. Siebert changed his opinion and testified that he believed Mr. Shiflett was competent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
