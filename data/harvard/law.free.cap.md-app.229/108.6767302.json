FutureCare contended that Ms. Peeler should be required to arbitrate her wrongful death claim, because the decedent, Ms. Peeler\u2019s mother, had signed an arbitration agreement upon being admitted to a FutureCare nursing facility. The circuit court denied FutureCare\u2019s petition to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">FutureCare appealed. It presents an issue that both parties characterize as a matter of first impression in Maryland: \u201cWhether wrongful death beneficiaries are bound by a valid and enforceable agreement signed by their decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">On its own motion, this Court raised the issue of whether a party has the right to appeal from an order denying a petition to compel arbitration when, as in this case, it is brought as an independent action, and not as a motion in the existing action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>commenced by the person whom the party seeks to compel to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">On the threshold issue, we hold that an order denying an independent, freestanding petition to compel arbitration is a final judgment from which the aggrieved party has the right to appeal. On the merits, we hold that a decedent\u2019s arbitration agreement ordinarily does not bind the decedent\u2019s family members to arbitrate a claim under the Maryland wrongful death statute. Because the circuit court correctly refused to compel arbitration, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">A. <em>The Arbitration Agreement Between FutureCare and Peeler\u2019s Mother</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In February 2012, Phyllis Butz was admitted as a resident at the FutureCare NorthPoint skilled nursing facility in Baltimore County. At the time of her admission, Mrs. Butz executed a written agreement to resolve a broad range of potential controversies by binding arbitration pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (MUAA). The scope of the agreement extended to \u201cany action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind ... now existing or hereafter arising between the parties in any way arising out of, pertaining to or in connection with or relating to\u201d the provision of services by FutureCare, acts or omissions of FutureCare\u2019s agents, as well as \u201cany survival action or wrongful death claim[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Another section of the agreement stated it would \u201cinure to the direct benefit of and bind the parties and their respective personal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns, including ... all persons whose claims derive through, or on behalf of, the Resident, including those of any parent, spouse, child, guardian, executor, administrator, legal representative, or heir of the Resident, as well as any survivor or wrongful death claim [sic ]....\u201d The agreement further stated that the parties were \u201ceach relinquishing and waiving their right under applicable law to have any claim decided in a court of law before a judge and/or a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>While she was a resident at the facility, Mrs. Butz received medical care from FutureCare employees. Mrs. Butz died on March 24, 2012. She was survived by her daughter, Ms. Peeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">In pre-litigation discussions, FutureCare informed Ms. Peeler of the arbitration agreement that Mrs. Butz had signed. Ms. Peeler declined FutureCare\u2019s request to resolve claims arising from her mother\u2019s death through arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">B. <em>Peeler\u2019s Wrongful Death Action Against FutureCare</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">On August 1, 2014, Ms. Peeler filed a complaint against FutureCare in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The action was designated as <em>Valerie Peeler v. 1046 North Point, LLC, </em>Case No. 03-C-14-8301.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Ms. Peeler\u2019s complaint contained a single count for wrongful death as a result of medical malpractice. Ms. Peeler sought to recover damages under Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute for the mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, and loss of society, comfort, advice, and guidance that she claimed to have experienced as a result of her mother\u2019s death. She requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">As an affirmative defense, FutureCare asserted that Ms. Peeler\u2019s wrongful death claim was \u201csubject to an enforceable binding arbitration agreement.]\u201d FutureCare moved to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of a separate petition to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">C. <em>FutureCare\u2019s Separate Petition to Compel Arbitration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">On August 25, 2014, FutureCare commenced a separate and independent action in the circuit court by filing a petition for an order to arbitrate pursuant to Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-207 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). This action, <em>FutureCare North Point, LLC v. Valerie Peeler, </em>was assigned case number 03-C-14-9157.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">In its petition, FutureCare asserted that it had entered into a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement with the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>dent, Mrs. Butz. FutureCare asked the court to \u201cenforce the parties\u2019 Arbitration Agreement and [o]rder [Ms. Peeler] to arbitrate the medical negligence claim against [FutureCare].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Ms. Peeler opposed the petition. She denied the existence of an agreement between herself and FutureCare. She asserted that she had never signed the agreement, had never intended to be bound by the agreement, had never given her mother authority to enter an agreement on her behalf, was not a third-party beneficiary of the agreement, and had never attempted to enforce any of its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">On its own motion, the court consolidated the wrongful death action with the action to compel arbitration. Nonetheless, the court maintained separate files for the two actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">D. <em>Denial of the Petition to Compel Arbitration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">On January 13, 2015, the circuit court held a hearing in the two, consolidated cases to determine whether Ms. Peeler should be compelled to arbitrate. At the hearing, the court rejected the argument that Ms. Peeler was bound by Mrs. Butz\u2019s agreement to arbitrate. On that basis, the court announced that the \u201cPetition for Order of Arbitration [wa]s denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">FutureCare requested clarification about whether the court intended to issue a final order in its freestanding action to compel arbitration. The hearing judge concluded that the two actions had been consolidated for a \u201climited purpose,\u201d but that the cases were \u201cnot joined for the merits\u201d and ultimately would \u201cbe treated separately[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">After the hearing, the judge signed an order stating that FutureCare\u2019s petition to compel arbitration was denied and that that action was no longer consolidated with the tort litigation in Case No. 03-C-14-8301. The order included language, which had been drafted by FutureCare, stating that the order would \u201cconstitute a final, appealable order as to the issue of arbitration pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b) in case No. 03-C-14-9157.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>On January 27, 2015, the clerk docketed the order in FutureCare\u2019s freestanding action to compel arbitration. A week later, FutureCare filed a notice of appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Separately, FutureCare moved to stay proceedings in Ms. Peeler\u2019s wrongful death case pending the outcome of its appeal in the other case. The court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\n<em>Appellate Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Except in a case involving one of the narrow exceptions under CJP \u00a7 12-303, the collateral order doctrine, or Rule 2-602(b), a party may appeal only from a final judgment on the merits. <em>See, e.g., Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 273, 983 A.2d 138 (2009); CJP \u00a7 12-301. An appellate court has the power to dismiss an appeal on its own motion if the appeal is not allowed by rule or by other law. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-602(a)(l). This Court must resolve any serious question as to its jurisdiction even if the parties have overlooked the issue or would prefer an immediate appellate determination. <em>See, e.g., Baltimore Cnty. v. Baltimore Cnty. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 4, </em>439 Md. 547, 561-62, 96 A.3d 742 (2014); <em>Zilichikhis v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>223 Md.App. 158, 172, 115 A.3d 685, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 Md. 641, 120 A.3d 768 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">After the parties submitted their appellate briefs, this Court ordered them to show cause in writing why the appeal \u201cshould not be dismissed as an impermissible interlocutory appeal\u201d and to address \u201cwhether the circuit court\u2019s January 27, 2015 order complied with both the procedure and the substance of Rule 2-602(b)[.]\u201d In pertinent part, that Rule provides: \u201cIf the court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay, it may direct in the order the entry of a final judgment ... as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties[.]\u201d Md. Rule 2-602(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">FutureCare responded that the appeal should not be dismissed because the order denying the petition to compel was not an interlocutory order in Ms. Peeler\u2019s wrongful death case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>but rather the final judgment in FutureCare\u2019s separate, freestanding action under the MUAA. According to FutureCare, the order had mentioned Rule 2-602(b) only \u201cto avoid any shadow of doubt\u201d about whether the court intended to render a final decision. Ms. Peeler did not dispute the contention that FutureCare had the right to appeal from the order denying the MUAA petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">We conclude that, although Rule 2-602(b) does not apply in this case, the order was nevertheless appealable under CJP \u00a7 12-301 as the final judgment entered in a civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u201c[A] party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d CJP \u00a7 12-301. An order of the circuit court is a final judgment if it has three attributes: \u201c(1) it must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy, (2) unless the court acts pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b) to direct the entry of a final judgment as to less than all of the claims or all of the parties, it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties; (3) it must be set forth and recorded in accordance with Rule 2-601.\u201d <em>Metro Maint. Sys. South, Inc. v. Milburn, </em>442 Md. 289, 298, 112 A.3d 429 (2015) (citing <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989)). In addition, each judgment must be set forth on a separate document signed by the judge or clerk. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-601(a); <em>Hiob v. Progressive American Ins. Co., </em>440 Md. 466, 478-79, 103 A.3d 596 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The order that denied FutureCare\u2019s freestanding petition to compel arbitration easily satisfies most of the elements of a final judgment. The judge signed a document that denied all relief in unqualified terms, and the clerk memorialized the denial of relief in a proper docket entry. The document, consistent with the oral comments at the hearing, expressed the judge\u2019s subjective intention that the order would \u201cconstitute a final, appealable order as to the issue of arbitration!.]\u201d The remaining question is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>court\u2019s ruling was sufficiently final in its nature so that it could have been entered as a final judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">By way of dicta, the Court of Appeals has commented that \u201c[a]n order denying a claim that arbitration should be compelled in an action in which that is the sole claim asserted is an appealable judgment.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>346 Md. 122, 126 n. 5, 695 A.2d 153 (1997) (citing <em>Litton Bionetics, Inc. v. Glen Constr. Co., </em>292 Md. 34, 41-42, 437 A.2d 208 (1981)). This Court, also in dicta, has similarly observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">[B]y statute, a petition to compel arbitration may properly be filed as a freestanding action against the party refusing to submit the dispute to arbitration. In that situation, a court\u2019s order deciding such an action disposes of the action in its entirety, regardless of whether the order grants or denies the petition. Once the court orders arbitration, or denies it, there is nothing left for it to do. Accordingly, the court\u2019s order is a final judgment under [CJP \u00a7] 12-301.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4G\"><em>NRT Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Innovative Props., Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 263, 277, 797 A.2d 824 (2002) (citation omitted); <em>see All State Home Mortg., Inc. v. Daniel, </em>187 Md.App. 166, 178, 977 A.2d 438, <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 560, 979 A.2d 707 (2009); <em>Essex Corp. v.

In a series of decisions between 2009 and 2013, the Court of Appeals held that when a court denies a motion to compel in an existing action commenced by the person who is allegedly required to arbitrate, the denial is neither a final judgment, nor is it appealable under any exception to the final judgment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 983 A.2d 138 (2009), and <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Services, LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 989 A.2d 210 (2010), the Court of Appeals held that none of the exceptions to the final judgment rule authorized an immediate appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration in an action brought by the person who is allegedly required to arbitrate. The Court specifically held that the denial of such a motion is not appealable under CJP \u00a7 12-303(3)(ix), which authorizes an interlocutory appeal from a (functionally identical) order <em>granting </em>a petition to <em>stay </em>arbitration. <em>See Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 566-67, 989 A.2d 210; <em>Addison, </em>411 Md. at 273-84, 983 A.2d 138. Nor can a court certify the denial of such a motion as a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>under Rule 2 \u2014 602(b), because such an order \u201cdoes not put the parties out of court\u201d and into arbitration, but instead \u201ckeeps the parties in court to litigate the claims remaining between them.\u201d <em>See Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 572, 989 A.2d 210 (citing <em>Addison, </em>411 Md. at 273, 983 A.2d 138). Finally, the denial of a motion to compel arbitration cannot satisfy the requirements of the collateral order doctrine, because, the Court said, the question of whether the case should have gone to arbitration in the first instance would be effectively reviewable on appeal from the entry of a final judgment on the merits after the parties had fully litigated the case in court. <em>See Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 572-77, 989 A.2d 210; <em>Addison, </em>411 Md. at 284-86, 983 A.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In <em>American Bank Holdings, Inc. v. Kavanagh, </em>436 Md. 457, 82 A.3d 867 (2013), the Court resolved the remaining question of whether the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, filed in an existing action, is itself a final judgment under CJP \u00a7 12-301. In an action brought by Kavanagh, American Bank attempted to appeal from an order denying a motion that it styled as a petition to compel arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 460-61, 82 A.3d 867. American Bank argued \u201cthat an order denying [a] petition to compel arbitration is an appealable final judgment regardless of whether it was filed as an independent action or filed in existing action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 82 A.3d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">To address that argument, the Court began by acknowledging its prior dicta to the effect that \u201can order denying a petition to compel arbitration filed as an independent action ... is appealable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 82 A.3d 867 (citing <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem., </em>346 Md. at 126 n. 5, 695 A.2d 153). According to the Court, those statements were not dispositive where \u201cthe appealability of an order denying a petition to compel arbitration filed in a case that is extant is at issue,\u201d <em>Kavanagh, </em>436 Md. at 468, 82 A.3d 867. The Court then analyzed the holdings of <em>Addison </em>and <em>Schuele, </em>taking great care to clarify that those cases involved \u201c[t]he denial of petitions to compel arbitration filed in existing actions[.]\u201d <em>Kavanagh, </em>436 Md. at 468, 82 A.3d 867; <em>see id. </em>at 470, 82 A.3d 867 (stating that <em>Schuele </em>concerned \u201can order denying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>motion to compel arbitration filed in an existing action\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 471, 82 A.3d 867 (same). The Court narrowed its focus to \u201cwhether a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion or petition to compel arbitration filed in an existing action is a final judgment[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 82 A.3d 867; <em>see also id. </em>at 474, 82 A.3d 867 (characterizing American\u2019s position as the argument that \u201cthe order denying its petition to compel arbitration filed in an existing action is immediately appealable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Ultimately, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he denial of American\u2019s petition to compel arbitration filed in an existing action ... [wa]s not immediately appealable as a final judgment, because that denial did not put the parties out of court by terminating the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475, 82 A.3d 867. The Court reiterated that \u201c[a]n order denying a request to compel arbitration, styled as a motion or petition, filed in an existing action\u201d neither \u201cdecides and concludes the rights of the parties\u201d nor \u201cdenies a party the means of further prosecuting or defending rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 82 A.3d 867. Such an order, the Court held, \u201ccannot be viewed as a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the next clause, however, the Court took care to point out that \u201c[a]n order denying a request to compel arbitration, styled as a motion or petition, filed in an existing action,\u201d is <em>\u201cunlike that situation when a Petition to Compel Arbitration filed on its own is denied, which terminates the action.\u201d Id. </em>at 478-79, 82 A.3d 867 (emphasis added). In so doing, the Court unmistakably signaled that the denial of a petition to compel arbitration may be an appealable final judgment if the petition is brought as a separate action in which the sole claim is the arbitrability of a dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Although it appears that no reported Maryland case has squarely decided the question that we face here, our answer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>essentially a foregone conclusion after <em>Kavanagh. </em>Future-Care did not move to compel arbitration in an existing action; it initiated a separate, freestanding action to compel Ms. Peeler to arbitrate. The circuit court\u2019s order fully adjudicated the only claim in the separate action, denied all of the relief sought by FutureCare in that action, and completely terminated that case. Consequently, under CJP \u00a7 12-801, Future-Care has the right to appeal from the final judgment in the separate action to compel Peeler to arbitrate. <em>See Kavanagh, </em>436 Md. at 468, 82 A.3d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Because FutureCare appealed from a final judgment, it was unnecessary to attempt to rely on any of the exceptions for appeals from certain interlocutory orders. Nevertheless, the order purported to grant a final judgment \u201cpursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b).\u201d This invocation of Rule 2-602 was misguided, but inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Rule 2-602 relates to actions that involve multiple claims or more than two parties. It expressly governs orders <em>not </em>disposing of an entire action. \u201cBy its very terms, Rule 2-602 is inapplicable to separate actions even though they are tried together.\u201d <em>Unnamed Att\u2019y v. Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 484, 494 A.2d 940 (1985) (citing <em>Coppage v. Resolute Ins. Co., </em>264 Md. 261, 285 A.2d 626 (1972)). A different rule governs the consolidation of separate actions: \u201cWhen <em>actions </em>involve a common question of law or fact or a common subject matter, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order a joint hearing or trial or consolidation of any or all of the claims, issues, or actions.\u201d Md. Rule 2-503(a)(1) (emphasis added). \u201cIn the trial of a consolidated action, the court may direct that joint or separate verdicts or judgments be entered.\u201d Md. Rule 2-503(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201cwhen the circuit court enters a judgment disposing of one case, that judgment is appealable despite the pendency of unresolved claims in another case consolidated with it.\u201d <em>Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 236, 503 A.2d 239 (1986); <em>see Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Carroll Cnty. v. Carroll Craft Retail, Inc., </em>384 Md. 23, 33 n. 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>862 A.2d 404 (2004). \u201c[U]nless the trial court clearly intends that a joint judgment be entered disposing of all cases simultaneously, consolidated cases are not to be treated as a single action for purposes of Rule 2-602; instead, each one of the cases is to be treated as a separate action.\u201d <em>Yarema, </em>305 Md. at 236, 503 A.2d 239.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The circuit court used Rule 2-503 to consolidate Future-Care\u2019s freestanding petition to compel arbitration with the separate wrongful death action.

The wrongful death action is, both in form and substance, a controversy between Ms. Peeler and FutureCare; it is not a continuation of any controversy between Mrs. Butz and Fu-tureCare. Furthermore, Mrs. Butz never owned the right to recover damages under CJP \u00a7 3-904 for her own wrongful death, and hence she had no power to bind the person who has that right \u2014 Peeler\u2014to an agreement to arbitrate. In short, notwithstanding that the agreement purports to require Peeler to arbitrate her wrongful death claims FutureCare, basic contract principles support the conclusion that she has no such obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Lacking any conventional principle through which it could impose that obligation on Ms. Peeler, FutureCare argues that Ms. Peeler should be required to arbitrate on the theory that the wrongful death action is \u201cderivative upon the decedent\u2019s ability to maintain a claim.\u201d As explained below, we reject that argument because a wrongful death action \u201cis not derivative in the sense asserted.\u201d <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. at 81-82, 698 A.2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">B. <em>The \u201cWrongful Act\u201d Requirement of the Wrongful Death Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The wrongful death statute provides that \u201c[a]n action may be maintained against a person whose wrongful act causes the death of another.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-902(a), The term \u201c \u2018[wrongful act\u2019 \u201d means \u201can act, neglect, or default including a felonious act which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-901(e). As the foundation of its argument that Ms. Peeler\u2019s wrongful death claim is \u201cderivative\u201d of her mother\u2019s personal injury claim, FutureCare relies on the statute\u2019s definition of a \u201cwrongful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">FutureCare writes, \u201c[A]t no time before the decedent\u2019s death could she have maintained a cause of action <em>... in court </em>because ... all such claims were subject to the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>binding arbitration agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Future-Care theorizes that, because Mrs. Butz, \u201cby virtue of having signed an arbitration agreement, could not have pursued her own claim for damages <em>in the Circuit Court,\u201d </em>Ms. Peeler should also be precluded from maintaining an action in that court. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The statute, however, does not define a \u201cwrongful act\u201d as an act that would have entitled the victim to maintain an action <em>\u201cin court \u201d </em>or <em>\u201cin the circuit court </em>\u201d; it speaks only of an act that \u201cwould have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages.\u201d Under fundamental principles of statutory construction, a court \u201cmay neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d <em>Peters v. Early Healthcare Giver, Inc., </em>439 Md. 646, 667, 97 A.3d 621 (2014) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The definition of \u201cwrongful act\u201d was satisfied, therefore, as long as Mrs. Butz would have been entitled \u201cto maintain an action,\u201d which she was; it is immaterial whether she would have been entitled \u201cto maintain an action\u201d <em>in court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">FutureCare does not really argue that its alleged negligence falls outside the statute\u2019s definition of a \u201c-wrongful act.\u201d Rather, FutureCare argues that the language defining a wrongful act as one that \u201cwould have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued\u201d (CJP \u00a7 3-901 (e)) implies that wrongful death claimants take their claims subject to the same restrictions that would apply to injury claims by the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The statutory language itself does not express that intention. The statute does not require that a wrongful death claim be pursued in the same forum and manner as an action that could have been brought by the decedent, and the General Assembly presumably would have said so had it intended to attach those conditions to wrongful death actions. <em>Peters, </em>439 Md. at 667, 97 A.3d 621.

Nonetheless, the Court distinguished the running of limitations from a release on the ground that \u201ca decedent who executes a release has acted affirmatively and purposefully to extinguish the underlying claim,\u201d whereas limitations may bar a claim even if the decedent did not intend to allow the statute to run. <em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 77 A.3d 1049.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The Court proceeded to reject Dr. Alizadeh\u2019s generalizations about the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of a Maryland wrongful death action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">It is not wholly incorrect to state that a wrongful death claim is derivative of the decedent\u2019s claim in some sense.

That connection, however, does not compel the conclusion that all defenses applicable to the decedent\u2019s claim prior to her death would preclude necessarily maintenance of a wrongful death claim after the decedent\u2019s death. That the Legislature\u2019s purpose was to create a new and independent cause of action when it passed the wrongful death statute suggests that it did not intend for a statute of limitations defense against the decedent\u2019s claim to bar consequently a subsequent wrongful death claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 222, 77 A.3d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Stated otherwise, it may be correct to say that a wrongful death action is \u201cderivative\u201d of the decedent\u2019s injury claim in the sense that \u201c[t]he two actions stem from the same underlying conduct, which must have resulted in the decedent having a viable claim when she was injured.\u201d <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 222, 77 A.3d 1049.

The Court observed that \u201ccourts in those jurisdictions holding that a wrongful death action is not contingent on the decedent\u2019s filing or ability to file a timely negligence claim before death tend to interpret their wrongful death statute, as we do in Maryland, as creating a new and independent cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 77 A.3d 1049 (citing <em>Frongillo v.

In those cases, the courts examined statutes with language that closely tracks the Maryland statute. <em>See Decamacho, </em>316 P.3d at 612-13 (analyzing statute that created liability where the act that resulted in death was one that \u201cwould, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action to recover damages in respect thereof\u2019); <em>Carter, </em>364 Ill.Dec. 66, 976 N.E.2d at 354 (same); <em>Lawrence, </em>273 S.W.3d at 527 (similar); <em>Peters, </em>873 N.E.2d at 1261 (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Like Maryland, each of those states has construed its wrongful death statute as creating a new and independent cause of action that does not belong to the decedent or the decedent\u2019s estate. <em>See Decamacho, </em>316 P.3d at 613 (explaining that Arizona wrongful death statute \u201c \u2018confers an original and distinct claim for damages sustained by named statutory beneficiaries\u2019 \u201d which is \u201c \u2018not derived from nor is it a continuation of claims which formerly existed in a decedent\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Carter, </em>364 Ill.Dec. 66, 976 N.E.2d at 354 (Illinois wrongful death act \u201ccreated a new cause of action that does not accrue until death\u201d to recover for \u201c \u2018the injury suffered by the next of kin due to the loss of the deceased\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Lawrence, </em>273 S.W.3d at 527 (Missouri wrongful death act \u201c \u2018creates a <em>new cause of action </em>\u2019 \u201d that is \u201cdistinct from any underlying tort claims\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Peters, </em>873 N.E.2d at 1261 (Ohio wrongful death claim \u201cbelongs to the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries,\u201d and the Supreme Court of Ohio has \u201clong recognized the separate nature\u201d of such a claim). Of particular note, the Maryland Court of Appeals has identified Arizona and Missouri as states that \u201cinterpret their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>wrongful death statute, as we do in Maryland, as creating a new and independent cause of action.\u201d <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 225, 77 A.3d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">In each of those four cases, the appellate court concluded that the decedent\u2019s arbitration contract did not require the decedent\u2019s statutory beneficiaries to arbitrate wrongful death claims based on the decedent\u2019s death. <em>See Decamacho, </em>316 P.3d at 614-15 (reasoning that language in wrongful death statute describing the nature of the wrong \u201cdoes not specify that a wrongful death claim must be pursued in exactly the same manner, such as through arbitration, as one brought by the decedent\u201d); <em>Carter, </em>364 Ill.Dec. 66, 976 N.E.2d at 359 (\u201c[ajlthough a wrongful-death action is dependent upon the decedent\u2019s entitlement to maintain an action for his or her injury, had death not ensued, neither the Wrongful Death Act nor this court\u2019s case law suggests that this limitation on the cause of action provides a basis for dispensing -with basic principles of contract law in deciding who is bound by an arbitration agreement\u201d); <em>Lawrence, </em>273 S.W.3d at 528-29 (explaining that, even though Missouri law treated wrongful death action as derivative of the underlying torts for venue purposes, \u201c[a] claim for wrongful death is not derivative from any claims [the decedent] might have had,\u201d and therefore the decedent\u2019s arbitration agreement \u201ccannot bind parties to the wrongful death suit\u201d); <em>Peters, </em>873 N.E.2d at 1262 (\u201cthe provision in the agreement binding [the decedent\u2019s] heirs, beneficiaries, successors, and assigns ... could not restrict [the decedent\u2019s] beneficiaries to arbitration of their wrongful-death claims, because he held no right to those claims\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The Arizona and Illinois courts further reasoned that an arbitration agreement is distinguishable from a decedent\u2019s pre-death release of a personal injury claim, which effectively bars a wrongful death action by extinguishing the underlying claim. <em>See Decamacho, </em>316 P.3d at 614; <em>Carter, </em>364 Ill.Dec. 66, 976 N.E.2d at 358-59.

Instead, FutureCare suggests that this Court should look to Texas, which it describes as a state with \u201cwrongful death statutory language\u201d and with a \u201cjudicial interpretation\u201d of that language that is similar to that of Maryland. Only the first part of that comparison is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In <em>Mummert, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized that the language of the Texas wrongful death statute closely matches that of the Maryland act <em>(Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 224 n. 8, 77 A.3d 1049), but the Court went on to conclude that Texas\u2019s interpretation is not \u201ccomparable\u201d to Maryland\u2019s interpretation of its statute. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 77 A.3d 1049.

In that case, the Supreme Court of Texas held that an arbitration agreement between an employee and employer required wrongful death beneficiaries to arbitrate their wrongful death claims against the employer even though they had not signed the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 642. The Texas court explained that a Texas wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>death action is \u201centirely derivative of the decedent\u2019s rights to have sued for his own injuries immediately prior to death.\u201d <em>Labatt, </em>279 S.W.3d at 644 (citing <em>Russell, </em>841 S.W.2d at 345-47). In other words, the beneficiaries under the Texas statute \u201cstand in [the decedent\u2019s] legal shoes and are bound by his agreement.\u201d <em>Labatt, </em>279 S.W.3d at 646. We decline to follow <em>Labatt </em>because in Maryland, unlike Texas, a wrongful death claim is a \u201cnew and independent cause of action,\u201d <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 225, 77 A.3d 1049, which is not subject to \u201call defenses applicable to the decedent\u2019s claim prior to her death[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 77 A.3d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The <em>Labatt </em>court proceeded to observe that wrongful death beneficiaries typically are not bound by a decedent\u2019s promise to arbitrate \u201cin states where wrongful death actions are recognized as independent and separate causes of action[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647. We agree with that observation. We reach a different conclusion from <em>Labatt </em>in this case, because a Maryland wrongful death claim is derivative of the decedent\u2019s claims only in the limited sense that \u201c[t]he two actions stem from the same underlying conduct, which must have resulted in the decedent having a viable claim when she was injured.\u201d <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 222, 77 A.3d 1049; <em>see also Eagan, </em>347 Md. at 82, 698 A.2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">FutureCare seeks additional support from other jurisdictions that have held that wrongful death beneficiaries can be compelled to arbitrate wrongful death claims based on a decedent\u2019s arbitration agreement. Not surprisingly, those courts express rationales similar to that of the Texas court. <em>See Briarcliff Nursing Home, Inc. v.

It is unquestionably incorrect to say that in Maryland a wrongful death claimant stands in exactly the same legal position as the decedent. <em>See id. </em>at 219-20, 77 A.3d 1049 (citing <em>Stewart, </em>104 Md. at 341, 65 A. 49).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In summary, Maryland law does not possess the material features of the legal regimes that have led courts from other states to require wrongful death claimants to arbitrate based on a decedent\u2019s arbitration agreement. Consistent with <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 226, 77 A.3d 1049, we are persuaded by the reasoning from states that de-emphasize the derivative nature of a wrongful death claim and instead emphasize its independent status. <em>Accord Spangler v.

The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, however, precludes personal injury claims and wrongful death claims alike by dictating an \u201cexclusive\u201d method of recovery against an employer for certain work-related injuries.

In any event, even if her personal representative had filed a survival action, the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act would not require the wrongful death beneficiaries to pursue their claims in the same action or even the same forum as the survival claim. Finally, in instances in which the wrongful death and survival actions proceed in different forums, the statute pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>vides a mechanism for a court to \u201creduce the award in each action proportionately so that the total award for noneconomic damages for both actions conforms to the [aggregate] limitation.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-2A-09(c)(4).

The statute does not, however, require Ms. Peeler to pursue that wrongful death claim only in the forum in which her mother could have asserted her own claims had she survived.

Sys., </em>442 Md. at 300, 112 A.3d 429; <em>see Brewster v. Woodhaven Bldg. &amp; Dev., Inc., </em>360 Md. 602, 623, 759 A.2d 738 (2000). Consequently, an order compelling arbitration of an entire dispute is a final judgment because that order deprives the plaintiff \"of the means, in that case before the trial court, of enforcing the rights claimed\u201d and \"effectively terminates that particular case before the trial court.\u201d <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 402, 620 A.2d 305 (1993); <em>see also Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 420-22 &amp; n. 4, 872 A.2d 735 (2005). In other words, an order that puts the parties out of court by <em>granting </em>a freestanding petition to compel arbitration is an appealable, final judgment. <em>See U.K. Constr. &amp; Mgmt., LLC v. Gore, </em>199 Md.App. 81, 88, 20 A.3d 163 (2011). The present case, however, involves the <em>denial </em>of a freestanding petition to compel arbitration, which allows a substantive dispute to go forward in court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\">. In <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 272-73 n. 13, 983 A.2d 138 (2009), the Court of Appeals disapproved of two of the foregoing <em>cases </em>\u2014 NRT <em>Mid-Atlantic </em>and <em>Essex Corp. </em>\u2014 insofar as they held that an appellate court could employ Rule 8-602(e), the appellate analog of Rule 2-602(b), to review the denial of a motion to compel arbitration in a case commenced by the party who had refused to submit to arbitration. The Court did not disapprove of the dicta in those and other cases, that the denial of a freestanding petition to compel arbitration would dispose of that action in its entirety, leave nothing else for the court to do, and constitute a final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">. In a lone dissent, Judge McDonald described the Court\u2019s holding as follows: \u201cThe bottom line of the Majority opinion is that the [MUAA] ... allows an immediate appeal of denial of an application to compel arbitration that is filed as a separate action, but does not allow for an immediate appeal if the application is filed in a related pending proceeding[.]\u201c <em>Kavanagh, </em>436 Md. at 493, 82 A.3d 867 (McDonald, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">. <em>Compare Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v.

FutureCare points out that, under some circumstances, a party to a contract containing an arbitration clause may compel a non-signatory to arbitrate certain claims. For instance, a third-party beneficiary may be required to arbitrate if he or she attempts to take advantage of provisions of a contract containing an arbitration clause. <em>See Hartford Accident &amp; Indent. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 292-93, 674 A.2d 106 (1996), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997); <em>Dist, Moving &amp; Storage Co., Inc. v. Gardiner &amp; Gardiner, Inc., </em>63 Md.App. 96, 101-03, 492 A.2d 319 (1985), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>306 Md. 286, 508 A.2d 487 (1986). Similarly, in appropriate cases, a non-signatory may be estopped from avoiding arbitration if the non-signatory raises claims that are sufficiently connected with an agreement containing an arbitration provision. <em>See Thompson v. Witherspoon, </em>197 Md.App. at 82-91, 12 A.3d 685 (analyzing various formulations of equitable estop-pel). Although FutureCare makes vague allusions to these concepts, it does not expressly rely on either a third-party beneficiary theory or an equitable estoppel theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Stewart v.

The Court cited the following cases in which it previously held that a wrongful death claim was barred because a defense would bar the decedent's underlying injury: <em>Frazee v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>255 Md. 627, 258 A.2d 425 (1969) (contributory negligence): <em>Baltimore &amp; Potomac R.R. Co. v. State ex rel.

In fact, under Maryland law, limitations may run on a claim for medical negligence even before the plaintiff could reasonably know or suspect that he or she had such a claim. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 5-109(a) (requiring plaintiffs to assert claims for medical negligence within \"the earlier of\u201d five years after the injury or three years after the discovery of the injury).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\">. FutureCare employs this through-the-looking-glass approach at other points in its argument. In its initial brief, FutureCare quoted the following sentence: \" 'The Maryland law appears to be that if a decedent could not have brought a cause of action for injury at the time of death, the wrongful death action similarly is precluded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>152 Md.App. 657, 695-96, 834 A.2d 146 (2003) (quoting <em>Burke v.

In <em>Mummert, </em>however, the Court of Appeals characterized that statement as \"dicta\u201d that had been made \"with understandable equivocation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 228, 77 A.3d 1049) and without \"the benefit of extensive briefing and argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 77 A.3d 1049. \"[UJpon considered reflection of the case law,\u201d the Court concluded \u201cthat the statement ... was unfounded at the time of its adoption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 77 A.3d 1049. Accordingly, the Court disavowed its prior statements to the extent that they \"appear inconsistent or in conflict\u201d with <em>Mummert. Id. </em>at 230, 77 A.3d 1049.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. FutureCare writes: \"Just as an injured person\u2019s signature on a Release <em>bars </em>a future wrongful death claim, an injured person\u2019s signa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ture on an arbitration agreement <em>binds </em>the wrongful death beneficiaries to arbitrating any subsequent wrongful death claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A statutory bar to recovery is not analogous to a contractual obligation to perform a promise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\">. FutureCare points out that under the Federal Arbitration Act arbitration agreements must stand on the \u201csame footing\u201d <em>(Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 219, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985)) as other contracts. On the basis of that premise, FutureCare argues that it would violate the federal act to enforce the decedent\u2019s release against a wrongful death beneficiary, but not to enforce the decedent\u2019s arbitration agreement against a wrongful death beneficiary. FutureCare's argument misconceives the holding in <em>Melitch. Melitch </em>did not hold that the wrongful death beneficiaries were contractually bound by the decedent's pre-death release; it held that the release had the effect of extinguishing the wrongful death claims before they came into existence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. The Court refused to follow dicta from <em>Melitch </em>that suggested that a prior judgment in the decedent's personal injury action, like a release, would bar a subsequent wrongful death action based on the same injury. <em>Spangler v. McQuitty, </em>449 Md. at 56, 141 A.3d at 170, 2016 WL 3685198, at *11. The Court observed that some of <em>Melitch's </em>analysis was \"contrary to longstanding Maryland law that a subsequent wrongful death action brought by a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries is not barred by the disposition of a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court declined to overrule Melitch, but it limited Melitch's <em>holding </em>to the factual context of a release. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b123-5\">. Beyond these four cases, Peeler notes that appellate courts in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Washington have reached similar conclusions under their own wrongful death statutes. <em>See Ping v. Beverly Enters., Inc., </em>376 S.W.3d 581 (Ky.2012); <em>Boler v. Sec. Health Care, LLC, </em>336 P.3d 468 (Okla.2014); <em>Pisano v.

Way, LLC, </em>155 Wash.App. 919, 231 P.3d 1252 (2010). In those cases, however, the statutes do not match the language of Maryland's statute as closely as do the statutes in the other four cases discussed above. Moreover, the courts from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Utah decided the issue against the backdrop of state constitutional provisions that confer a special status upon wrongful death actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b126-5\">. FutureCare also asks this Court to consider <em>Ruiz v. Podolsky, </em>50 Cal.4th 838, 114 Cal.Rptr.3d 263, 237 P.3d 584 (2010), which involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>California\u2019s special statutory framework for agreements to arbitrate claims relating to medical injuries. Because that statute specifically \"contemplated the inclusion of wrongful death claims within arbitration agreements drafted pursuant to [that statute],\u201d the California court concluded that its legislature \"intended to permit patients to bind any heirs pursuing wrongful death actions to these agreements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>114 Cal.Rptr.3d 263, 237 P.3d at 592. As another appellate court later explained, Ruiz's holding has \"no bearing on third party wrongful death claims outside the context of\u201d the provisions of that medical negligence statute. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Sunrise Senior Living, Inc., </em>212 Cal.App.4th 674, 676, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 273 (Ct.App.2013). Instead, when an agreement meets certain statutory requirements, California's medical negligence law \u201ceffectively supersedes\u201d the ordinary principles \"that wrongful death claims are independent actions accruing to the decedents' heirs, and that arbitration agreements are generally not binding on third party nonsignatories.\u201d <em>Daniels, </em>212 Cal.App.4th at 683, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 273. FutureCare does not contend that Maryland has enacted a comparable statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">. The Court emphasized the limited scope of its holding by acknowledging that wrongful death claims and survivorship claims are not aggregated for the purposes of CJP \u00a7 11-108, the general cap on noneconomic tort damages. <em>Espina, </em>442 Md. at 351-53, 112 A.3d 442 (analyzing <em>Goss v.
