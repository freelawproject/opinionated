As additional security for the mortgage loan, complainant furnished a fire policy issued by the defendant Concordia Fire Insurance Company on which was endorsed the usual mortgagee clause in favor of the building and loan association. A fire occurred and the insurance company paid to the building and loan association in settlement of the loss $3,350, and took from the association an agreement subrogating the insurance company to the rights of the association under its mortgage to the extent of the payment so made. Complainant prays, among other things, that he may be credited on the mortgage with the amount of the payment by the insurance company in settlement of the loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-10\">\u201cThe insurance company moves to strike the bill on' the ground that it does not set forth an equitable cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>and that the complainant has an adequate remedy at law. On the argument, defendant\u2019s counsel assumed that complainant has presented for determination an action for breach of contract, cognizable at law. But the bill of complaint does not attempt to present such a case. The insurance by force of the mortgagee clause, was payable to the mortgagee and not to complainant, and it was paid accordingly. There is no allegation that a greater sum than $3,350 should have been paid. Complainant has no remedy at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">\u201cIt appears from the subrogation agreement, a copy of which it attached to the bill, that the insurer \u2018claims that as to the mortgagor no liability exists under the terms of the said policy,\u2019 and hence, its right of subrogation. Complainant disputes this claim. If complainant is correct, then the insurance money must be applied in reduction of the mortgage. Otherwise, not. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>McFadden, 86 N. J. Eq. 377; 87 N. J. Eq. 347; Selray Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Massimino, 110 N. J. Eq. 300. </em>Complainant may assume, contrary to the assertion of defendants, that the mortgage is reduced $3,350 and may refuse to pay interest except on the reduced sum. This would provoke a foreclosure of the mortgage, and in that suit the controversy could be litigated. If complainant should succeed, very well; if not, his mistake will have caused an acceleration of the mortgage and perhaps bring about his losing the property. In his dilemma, he has filed his bill <em>quia timet. </em>This, I take it, he is clearly entitled to do. The bill presents an equitable cause of action and the motion to strike will be denied.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-5\"><em>Messrs.
