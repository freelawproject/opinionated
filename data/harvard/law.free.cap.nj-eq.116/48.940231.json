The basis of the bill was the failure of Mandel to co-operate with complainant in the defense of the actions thus brought, and this failure is characterized as a fraud inducing the making of the contract of insurance. Obviously it was not. At most it was a failure to comply with the terms of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>after its making, and if this breach constituted a defense to the claims of the defendants, it could be pleaded in the actions at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The bill should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and upon this ground the decree of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 -The Chief-Justice, Trenci-iard, Parker, Lloyd, Case, Bodine, Donges, Heher, Perskie, Van Buskirk, Kays, Hetfield, Dear, Wells, Dill, JJ. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
