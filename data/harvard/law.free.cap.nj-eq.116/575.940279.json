Fitzsimmons, payable within two years, from the date thereof, and for the payment of all moneys hereafter expended by the Irwin Realty Company in payment of taxes and/or insurance premiums for the premises covered by the mortgage in question, it being understood by the parties hereto that the whole principal sum of the note and the interest thereon shall upon default in the payment of the semi-annual interest become immediately due and payable.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">\u201cThe assignment of the building and loan stock provides that it is made: \u201cas collateral security for the payment within two years from the date thereof of the 1930, 1931 and 1932 taxes, * * * provided, however, that the 1930 taxes shall be paid within six months from the date hereof and the 1931 tax shall be paid within one year from the date hereof.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-8\">\u201cComplainant says that on July 27th, 1933, six months\u2019 interest fell due and payable on the note in question and that the realty company refused a tender of the payment thereof and agreed that the payment should be postponed until September 15th, 1933, at which time there as to be a settlement under the building and loan assignment agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201cOn September 15th, 1933, complainant alleges that she tendered the interest to the realty company, which was refused, and that she now tenders and holds herself ready and willing to pay the full amount of the interest due under the mortgage assignment agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">\u201cComplainant admits her default under the terms of the building and loan assignment agreement and says that the defendant, on September 21st, 1933, served a notice of his intention to sell the collateral under both agreements, and that on October 2d, 1933, it did sell all the collateral under both agreements, the mortgage for $4,200 and the building and loan stock for $1,200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">\u201cComplainant charges that the alleged sale of the mortgage was in violation of the contract between complainant and defendant, in that \u2018at the time of the notice of sale and the sale no default existed under said agreement/</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">\u201cComplainant further charges that the defendant has failed to apply the $1,200 received for the building and loan stock to the payment of the taxes, as provided in the contract between complainant and defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">\u201cComplainant prays, in addition to the formal prayers:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">\u201c \u20183. That the alleged sale or sales of the interest of your complainant in the bond and mortgage referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of bill of complaint may be set aside and for nothing holden.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-9\">\u201c \u20184. That defendant Irwin Realty Company be decreed to apply the sum of $1,200 received from the sale of complainant\u2019s building and loan stock to the payment of taxes now in arrears/</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-10\">\u201cOn this motion to strike, defendant must concede the material allegations of the bill of complaint, so that there is an admission that the defendant has prematurely sold complainant\u2019s mortgage, <em>i. e., </em>sold it when there was no default, and that it has failed to apply the $1,200 received from the building and loan stock to the payment of taxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-11\">\u201cIt will be observed that the bill is not based on any allegation of fraud but, as is distinctly averred therein, \u2018that the alleged sale of your complainant\u2019s mortgage was in violation of the contract marked <em>Exhibit A, </em>in that at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of the notice of sale and the sale no default existed under said agreement/</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-4\">\u201cAs to the breach of the building and loan stock assignment contract, the only breach alleged is not with reference to the sale thereof after an admitted default, but the breach is a failure to apply the proceeds of the sale of the building and loan stock in the manner provided for by the assignment contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">\u201cComplainant has a complete and adequate remedy to recover any and all damages she may have sustained by reason of the breach of either the mortgage assignment contract or the building and loan assignment contract, and there being no special equity set up in the complainant, she must resort to the courts of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">\u201cIt is argued that the mortgage has some extrinsic value and comes within that classification where specific performance will be decreed by an award of the particular chattel, citing <em>Pom. (2d ed.) 3323 </em>\u00a7 <em>1402 </em>and <em>Pom. (2 ed.) 4877 </em>\u00a7 <em>2170. </em>There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\">\u201cComplainant says that the bill is not drawn under the theory of the redemption of the pledge. If it were so drawn it would be stricken because of the failure to disclose some special equity, as that of accounting or discovery. <em>Charles R. De Bevoise Co. </em>v. <em>The H. &amp; W.
