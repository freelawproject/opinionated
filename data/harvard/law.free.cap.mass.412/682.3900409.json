The jury returned a verdict on special questions for the defendant and the plaintiff appealed. The Appeals Court reversed the judgment reasoning that it was error for the trial judge to admit in evidence a portion of a hospital record containing information recorded from an unidentified source at another hospital. We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We summarize the factual underpinnings which are more fully set forth in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dong, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 743, 744-745 (1991). On June 21, 1983, at 4:15 a.m., the plaintiff took her son, who was feverish and had difficulty breathing, to the emergency room of Sancta Maria Hospital. The defendant examined the child but was unable to make a successful visual throat examination. The defendant then ordered a chest X-ray and a blood test. The blood test demonstrated a markedly elevated white blood count. Next, the defendant consulted the child\u2019s pediatrician, Dr. Samuel Andonian, over the telephone. Dr. Andonian agreed to examine the child later that day. The defendant concluded that the child had an early viral syndrome and discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Later that morning, the child stopped breathing and the plaintiff rushed him to the emergency department of Symmes Hospital. There Dr. James Campbell and Dr. Chai Kwon, an anesthesiologist, performed an intubation in an attempt to resuscitate the child. The Symmes Hospital record indicates a diagnosis of respiratory arrest, with a possibility of sepsis. There is no mention in the Symmes Hospital medical record of any abnormality associated with the epiglottis. Subsequently, the child was transferred to the intensive care unit at Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston. Dr. Louis Rubin, the admitting physician at Children\u2019s Hospital, made a contemporaneous note in the Children\u2019s Hospital admission record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that the child\u2019s epiglottis was \u201cnormal\u201d while at Symmes Hospital. Dr. Rubin was not part of the Children\u2019s Hospital transfer team. The child remained in a coma for three days while at Children\u2019s Hospital; he died on June 25, 1983. All the medical experts agreed the immediate cause of death was an inability to breathe precipitated by epiglottitis.</p>\n<p id=\"AmX\">The principal issue is whether the reference in the Children\u2019s Hospital record noting the child\u2019s epiglottis as \u201cnormal\u201d while he was at Symmes Hospital was properly admitted. Also at issue is whether a posttreatment letter written by the defendant and incorporated into the Sancta Maria Hospital record was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">1. <em>The \u201cnormal\" epiglottis notation. </em>The defendant contends that, under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79 (1990 ed.), the judge properly admitted the Children\u2019s Hospital record containing the notation. In response, the plaintiff argues that the record was inadmissible under the statute since it contained second-level hearsay from an unidentified source. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7. 79, provides in pertinent part: \u201cRecords kept by hospitals . . . under [G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70] shall be admissible ... as evidence ... so far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases <em>....'\" </em>The statute provides an exception to the hearsay rule so as to allow hospital records to be admitted to prove the truth of the facts in the record that relate to treatment and medical history. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>375 Mass. 438, 442 (1978). The fact that the record may contain second-level hearsay is of no consequence as long as the broad requirements of the statute are met. Those requirements make admissible \u201cthose portions of records relating to treatment and medical history which possess the characteristics justifying the presumption of reliability.\u201d <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 528 (1978). \u201c[E]ntries made in the regular course of the institution\u2019s operation from the personal knowledge of the recorder or <em>from a compilation of the personal knowledge of those who have an obligation in the course of their employment to transmit that medical information to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>the recorder are admissible under the </em>exception\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The purpose of the statute is to admit presumptively reliable hospital records in evidence without the need of calling numerous hospital personnel as witnesses. <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra </em>at 528. The presumption arises because the entries relating to treatment and medical history are routinely made by those responsible for making accurate entries and are relied on in the course of treating patients. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the case of a hospital record, the offering party must show that the evidence comports with the requirements of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 16 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In this case, 'the notation, \u201cAt Symmes Hosp. E[mergency] R[oom] . . . epiglottal c[ulture] impression n[orma]l epiglottis,\u201d is clearly a statement relating to the treatment and medical history of the child. The question then becomes, does this information possess the characteristics justifying the presumption of reliability? The notation was made contemporaneously with the child\u2019s transfer. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that it is routine for the transferring hospital to transmit such information to the receiving hospital when transferring a patient. As such, the medical staff at Children\u2019s Hospital would rely on this information in treating the child while in its care.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The entry in the record containing the disputed portion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is quite detailed. It begins: \u201cAt Symmes Hosp. E[mergency] R[oom] . . . .\u201d It then details the child\u2019s pulse rate and blood pressure, the results of specific laboratory tests, including the chest X-rays, and the kinds and dosages of medication the child received. Next, it describes the child\u2019s intubation, mentions that the child\u2019s pupils were dilated, and states \u201cepiglottal c[ulture] impression n[orma]l epiglottis.\u201d Finally, it notes: \u201cHe was still hypotensive (but ? 90/50) [and] received 10cc/lg NS x2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The \u201cfourth requirement\u201d of <em>Bouchie </em>relied on in the dissent has no application in these circumstances. There the court was discussing voluntary statements of'third persons in contrast with the third paragraph which makes admissible information from persons who are under a medical obligation to transmit such information. The nature of the information and its level of detail warrant the conclusion that Dr. Rubin received the Symmes Hospital information from someone, or from a report prepared by someone, on Symmes Hospital\u2019s medical staff who either personally treated the child or obtained the information from someone who had, and therefore had an obligation to transmit that information to Dr. Rubin, the recorder at Children\u2019s Hospital, when the child was transferred. Dr. Rubin could not have otherwise obtained such detailed information concerning the child\u2019s care while at Symmes Hospital. Thus, the circumstances in which the entries were made and their level of detail indicate that those entries in the Children\u2019s Hospital record \u201cpossess the characteristics justifying the presumption of reliability\u201d normally accorded hospital records. <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra </em>at 528. Therefore, the judge could properly conclude that notations in the Children\u2019s Hospital record regarding the child\u2019s care at Symmes Hospital were admissible under the statute as statements of treatment and medical history made by those obligated in the course of their employment to transmit medical information to the keeper of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">It should be kept in mind that, as we said in <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra </em>at 527-528, \u201cthe statute allows admission of the substantive content of hospital records because of the presumption of reliability which attaches to statements relating to treatment and medical history in these records. This presumption of reliability of the information contained in hospital records arises primarily from the fact that entries in these records are routinely made by those charged with the responsibility of making accurate entries and are relied on in the course of treating patients.\u201d Nowhere in the statute or in the decisions of this court is it suggested that this presumption of reliability disappears when the source of the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>tion is unknown or that the information relied on is second-level hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The failure to identify the source of the information from Symmes Hospital goes to the weight of the evidence afforded the Children\u2019s Hospital record and not its admissibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>359 Mass. 577, 580 (1971) (results of laboratory tests contained in hospital record are admissible even though identity of person performing the test is unknown). See also P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 334 (5th ed. 1981) (\u201cAnd the absence of personal knowledge of the maker of the record goes to the weight of the evidence \u2014 not its admissibility \u2014 since the reliability of such records is predicated on the fact that they are routine reflections of day-to-day operations\u201d). But see <em>Ricciardi </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Ctr., </em>811 F.2d 18, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1987) (failure to identify source of information renders hospital record inadmissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79). Moreover, \u201chospital records containing facts relevant to medical history or treatment are admissible without need for, and despite the absence of, testimonial corroboration.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>375 Mass. 438, 442 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In sum, this statute relies on a pragmatic test of reliability. Is the information of a nature that is relied on by medical professionals in administering health care? It is of no consequence that, under similar statutes and decisions, it is required that each level of secondary hearsay falls within some exception to the hearsay rule. A health care professional looking at a hospital record would not be concerned with levels of hearsay, but rather the nature of the information supplied. That is the test of the statute to be applied under the supervision of the trial judge who has the discretion to exclude the record in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">2. <em>The posttreatment letter. </em>We agree with the Appeals Court that the posttreatment letter of the defendant which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>was incorporated into the Sancta Maria Hospital record<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was inadmissible. We conclude, however, that the letter was merely cumulative of other evidence and, therefore, its admission was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The day after treating the child the defendant learned the child was in a coma at Children\u2019s Hospital. The defendant then wrote a letter, which was later incorporated into the Sancta Maria Hospital record, recounting his telephone conversation with the child\u2019s pediatrician, Dr. Andonian. The letter mentions the symptoms the defendant observed during his examination of the child and Dr. Andonian\u2019s response on being informed of those symptoms. Included in the letter is a statement which the plaintiff used to impeach the defendant, \u201cI did also mention the possibility of croup to him, although it was not a high clinical possibility at the time based on the absence of respiratory distress, stridor and \u2018barking\u2019 cough.\u201d It then states that Dr. Andonian responded in the negative when asked whether the child should be started on ampicillin antibiotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>At trial, both the defendant and Dr. Andonian testified regarding the substance of their telephone conversation. The defendant attempted to shift responsibility from himself to Dr. Andonian for not recognizing the possibility of the presence of epiglottitis. The defendant also testified he did not diagnose the possibility of croup and therefore did not consider the differential diagnosis of epiglottitis. Although the plaintiff objected to the admission of the letter, it was this statement of the defendant that the plaintiff sought to impeach through the use of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Except for denying that the defendant mentioned the possibility of croup, Dr. Andonian confirmed the defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the information contained in the letter. Dr. Andonian testified that the defendant telephoned him and informed him of the following: Fever; elevated white blood count; nonspecific respiratory symptoms; negative chest X-ray; no drooling; throat, ears, and pharynx normal. Accordingly, the letter was merely cumulative of the testimony of the defendant and Dr. Andonian. No prejudice arose from its admission. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Izzo, </em>359 Mass. 39, 43 (1971). We need not reach the other issues raised in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the epiglottis, a small flap of tissue that covers the trachea during swallowing to prevent the ingestion of food into the lungs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The plaintiff challenges only the \u201cepiglottal cfulture] impression n[orma]l epiglottis\u201d notation contained in the Children\u2019s Hospital record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The letter states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\u201c22 June 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">\u201cJoseph G.

After evaluating the patient, I did call his primary pediatrician, Dr. Andoni[a]n at home to discuss my findings, particularly the high fever and elevated white blood count. I did also mention the possibility of croup to him, although it was not a high clinical possibility at the time based on the absence of respiratory distress, stridor and \u2018barking\u2019 cough. Dr. Andoni[a]n felt it was reasonable to send the patient home with followup later that morning, which I then recommended to the mother, and to which the mother was agreeable. I asked Dr. Andoni[a]n concerning starting ampicillin antibiotics, but Dr. Andoni[a]n did not feel strongly that this was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">\u201cStephen Dong MD\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b705-7\">Liacos, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR8\">(dissenting). The hospital record at issue contains second-level hearsay for which no exception to the rule against hearsay exists. It therefore should not have been admitted in evidence. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79 (1990 ed.), provides an exception to the hearsay rule for certain hospital records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 531 (1978), the court established a four-part test to determine when hospital records are admissible under \u00a7 79:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">\u201cFirst, the document must be the type of record contemplated by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. Second, the information must be germane to the patient\u2019s treatment or medical history. Third, the information must be recorded from the personal knowledge of the entrant or from a compilation of the personal knowledge of those who are under a medical obligation to transmit such information. Fourth, voluntary statements of third persons appearing in the record are not admissible unless they are offered for reasons other than to prove the truth of the matter contained therein or, if offered for their truth, come within another exception to the hearsay rule or the general principles discussed [earlier in the opinion].\u201d (Citation omitted.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Parts three and four of the <em>Bouchie </em>test recognize that hospital records may raise problems of \u201ctotempole\u201d or multiple hearsay. See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 334 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1985). If the record contains the personal knowledge of the recorder, it is simply hearsay \u2014 an out-of-court statement by the recorder offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the record contains information that someone conveyed to the recorder, it contains two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>levels of hearsay: the first level is the recorder\u2019s out-of-court statement (i.e., the record), and the second level is the content of the record, that is, the out-of-court statement made to the recorder by the person who conveyed the information. Under parts three and four of the test, <em>Bouchie, supra </em>at 531, information in the record that was conveyed to the recorder by a third party is inadmissible unless: (1) the information consists of \u201cpersonal knowledge of those who are under a medical obligation to transmit such information\u201d to the recorder;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) the third party\u2019s statement falls within some other exception to the hearsay rule; or (3) the statement is not offered for its truth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Amqo\">The record in the instant case contains both first and second-level hearsay: Dr. Rubin recorded that someone told him that the child\u2019s epiglottal culture was normal at Symmes Hospital.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court holds that the record is admissible be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>cause it meets the first of the three conditions for the admissibility of second-level hearsay:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cDr. Rubin received the Symmes Hospital information from someone, or from a report prepared by someone, on Symmes Hospital\u2019s medical staff who either personally treated the child . . . , and therefore had an obligation to transmit that information to Dr. Rubin, the recorder - at Children\u2019s Hospital, when the child was transferred.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 686. The court notes that the record was made contemporaneously with the transfer of the patient, when a transferring hospital routinely transmits patient information to a receiving hospital, and that the record contains large amounts of technical medical history that would be available (and comprehensible) only to someone familiar with patient treatment. Furthermore, the court notes that Children\u2019s Hospital itself relied on the information provided. While the identity of the person who gave the information to Dr. Rubin is unknown,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court holds that this lack of identification goes to the weight, not to the admissibility, of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The court has understated the importance of ascertaining the identity of the person who supplied the information to Dr. Rubin. In this respect, the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>359 Mass. 577 (1971), is misplaced. In <em>Franks, </em>the identity of the recorder was unknown, but because there was evidence that the record in question was a routine hospital report, it was held admissible. See <em>id. </em>at 580. In the instant case, however, the identity of the recorder is known (Dr. Rubin), but the identity of the person who reported to him is not. That is, we know the identity of the declarant of first-level hearsay, but we do not know the iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>tity of the declarant of second-level hearsay. <em>Franks </em>is therefore inapplicable to the instant case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the second level of hearsay, unlike the first, some knowledge of identity is essential to determine admissibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the instant case, the court must determine whether the person who reported to Dr. Rubin had personal knowledge of the epiglottal culture and whether he or she had an obligation to report to Children\u2019s Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The defendant did not meet his burden of proving that the information recorded by Dr. Rubin came from a reliable source, namely a person under an obligation to record truthfully what was personally known to that person. It is reasonable to assume, as the court does, that the information in the record came from a Symmes Hospital employee, and that the information was transferred during the routine transportation of a patient. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the person at Symmes Hospital obtained the information.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant, as the proponent of this evidence, had the burden of proving that the individual at Symmes Hospital either had personal knowledge of the epiglottal culture or received information from those \u201cunder a medical obligation to transmit such information,\u201d <em>Bouchie, supra </em>at 531. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 16 (1985). The defendant did not have to identify each individual in the chain of communication, see <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Mass. 402, 406 (1982), but he had to show that the chain was routine and reliable. See <em>Dolan </em>v. Commonwealth, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 567 (1988) (hospital record inadmissible because source of information therein not proven reliable).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Given the mystery surrounding the origins of the epiglottal culture results, see note 9, supra, the defendant did not meet his burden.

Liacos, <em>supra </em>at 334, see <em>ante </em>at 687, refers to a passage discussing the identity of the \u201cmaker of the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\">That is, knowledge of identity is essential unless the recorder received information from hospital records meeting the <em>Bouchie </em>requirements. In such a case, as in <em>Franks, supra, </em>the second-level hearsay would fall under an established exception to the hearsay rule, namely \u00a7 79, and would be admissible. The defendant in the instant case offered no evidence that Dr. Rubin received his information from a Symmes Hospital record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 16 (1985) (proponent of evidence bears burden of proving admissibility). He therefore cannot rely on a <em>Franks </em>argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">That is, it is not established that the \u201cinformation [came] from someone . . . who . . . <em>personally </em>treated the child\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>ante </em>at 686.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b710-5\">I believe that the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has interpreted \u00a7 79 correctly. In <em>Ricciardi </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Ctr., </em>811 F.2d 18 (1st Cir. 1987), the plaintiff sought to introduce a note from his medical record suggesting the occurrence of a problem during his surgery. The information was written in medical shorthand and clearly came from someone familiar with the surgery, but the recorder did not have personal knowledge of the incident and the person who conveyed the information to the recorder was unidentified. The court held that the note contained inadmissible hearsay. See <em>id. </em>at 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The defendant has argued that, even if the record was inadmissible, its admission in evidence was harmless error. The court does not reach this issue. I would hold that the admission of the record was not harmless error, for essentially the reasons offered in the opinion of the Appeals Court. See Doyle, 30 Mass. App. Ct. at 749, and cases cited (\u201cBecause the note [in the hospital records] was the only evidence that the epiglottis was normal and not red and swollen, and because the defense employed the damaging notation often and to effect, we cannot say that its admission was harmless\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
