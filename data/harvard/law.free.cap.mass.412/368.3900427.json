The defendant also seeks a reduction of the murder verdict to manslaughter pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1990 ed.). We reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">At trial, it was undisputed that the defendant shot the victim, Christopher Flye. The principal question was whether the defendant acted justifiably in defense of a third person, the codefendant, Shawn Egela. The judge recognized the necessity for an instruction on the law relating to defense of another. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Martin, 369 Mass. 640, 644 (1976). It is his instruction on this subject that forms the principal basis for the defendant\u2019s appeal and the reason for our reversal of the conviction. See <em>id. </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, looking first to that part of his own testimony and that of his codefendant relating to the events leading up to and surrounding the homicide. \u201cIt is of course immaterial that the triers might very well, in the end, lend no credence whatever to the defendant\u2019s version of the facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On September 20, 1985, the defendant shot the victim, Christopher Flye. Nine months before the shooting they had been roommates and both were arrested for burglarizing a neighbor\u2019s house. Eventually, the defendant confessed to committing the burglary alone, clearing the victim. The victim, however, was evicted from the house in which they had been living.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>On the day of the shooting, the defendant and the codefendant, Shawn Egela, drove in an automobile to Wareham. The defendant did the driving; Egela was in the passenger seat. They encountered the victim at a convenience store. During this brief encounter Egela took a handgun out of the glove compartment and twice fired it out the passenger side window into the nearby woods. The victim walked over to the passenger side and asked Egela if he could check out the gun. Egela gave the gun to the victim. According to the defendant and Egela, the victim held the gun to the defendant\u2019s head and threatened to shoot the defendant. The victim, still in possession of the gun, then walked away with his girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Egela followed the victim and attempted to reclaim the gun. The defendant followed Egela. At some point, the victim struck Egela in the face with the handle of the gun. Egela and the victim began wrestling and fighting. Egela is five feet, six inches tall and the victim was six feet, two inches tall. The defendant did not intervene in the fight except to pry the gun out of the victim\u2019s hand. He then stepped aside and watched as the two men continued fighting. Several times the victim smashed Egela\u2019s head on the pavement. The defendant tried unsuccessfully to pull the victim off Egela. The defendant thought the victim was going to kill Egela. He then shot the victim, who continued to pound Egela\u2019s head into the pavement. A few seconds later, the defendant shot a second time, apparently without any effect. The defendant then shot the victim twice more. He shot the victim four times because he thought Egela was \u201cgetting killed,\u201d and he wanted \u201cto stop what was happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">1. <em>Instructions on defense of another. </em>The judge charged in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201c[T]he defendant Johnson in this case has raised the issue, of what we call a third person defense. . . . [T]he burden is upon the Commonwealth again to prove by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Johnson either did not have any such right to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>another under the circumstances found by you, or that if he did have any such right, under the circumstances found by you, that it was used excessively. . . . [I] f he did have a right, and if there was a legitimate exercise of that right, then the crime committed by him would be manslaughter and not murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\u201c[An] actor ... is justified in using reasonable force against another to protect a third person when, number one, a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s position would believe his intervention to be necessary for the protection to the third person; and two, in the circumstances as that a reasonable person would believe them to be, the third person would be justified in using such force to protect himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cThe reasonableness of the belief, however, may depend on the relationship among the persons involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cThe actor\u2019s justification is lost if he uses excessive force, that is, aggressive or deadly force unwarranted for the protective purpose. ct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201c[T]he right to use a deadly weapon if that right existed at all in the first place, is gone once any threat has dissipated. And the actor\u2019s justification is lost if he uses excessive force, that is, aggressive or deadly force unwarranted for protective purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The defendant argues that these instructions were erroneous because (1) the defense of another, if warranted by the circumstances and carried out properly, constitutes a complete defense and not merely a mitigating circumstance, as the judge instructed, and (2) the use of excessive force in defense of another does not cause the defendant to lose the benefit of the defense entirely, as the judge instructed, but instead may v/arrant a finding of manslaughter. We agree that there was error in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The part of the instruction quoted above concerning defense of another was erroneous because a defendant who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>justified in using deadly force for the protection of a third person is relieved of all criminal liability. Justified deadly force in defense of another does not reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter as the judge charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 649. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monico, </em>373 Mass. 298, 303 (1977) (\u201cAs is the case in the area of self-defense, there must be a threat of harm to the person being protected before its invocation as a defense in a criminal case is justified\u201d). The Commonwealth concedes that the charge on this point was erroneous but argues that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, not manslaughter, thereby, according to the Commonwealth, rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim of defense of another. Whatever merit there might be in the Commonwealth\u2019s argument in other circumstances is dissipated here by the fact that the judge made a second error concerning the use of excessive force in defense of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In analyzing a defendant\u2019s right to defend himself with a deadly weapon we have said that self-defense is not an all or nothing proposition. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>388 Mass. 789, 795 (1983). In other words \u201conce the issue of self-defense has been fairly raised, the jury should [be] instructed on \u2018the legal consequence of using manifestly disproportionate violence in the supposed exercise of the right of self-defence.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>351 Mass. 203, 211 (1966). If the jury [conclude] that [the defendant] had the right to use force to defend himself but that the force used was excessive . . . they would [be] warranted in finding [the defendant] guilty only of manslaughter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, supra. </em>The rule is no different where the defendant\u2019s justification for the use of force is defense of another. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 650 (trend has been to interweave closely the justification of defense of a third person with self-defense). J.R. Nolan &amp; B.R. Henry, Criminal Law \u00a7 680, at 592 (1988) (\u201cjustification [of defense of others] appears to be coextensive with the right of self-defense\u201d). Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.05 (1) explanatory note (Offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>cial Draft 1985) (rule of justification for use of force to protect other person same as rules that govern self-defense). See also <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 3.04, 3.09. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>apparently relied on by the judge, is not to the contrary. There the court stated that \u201c[t]he actor\u2019s justification is lost if he uses excessive force, e.g., aggressive or deadly force unwarranted for the protective purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649. One who uses excessive force in defense of another does lose the justification, i.e., the person is not relieved of criminal liability. The use of excessive force is not, therefore, justified. Instead, the <em>degree </em>of criminal liability becomes the issue, and the defendant\u2019s guilt may be mitigated if, in the circumstances, he had a right to use force in defense of another, but used excessive force. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, supra </em>at 795 (jury should be instructed they may find defendant guilty only of manslaughter, not murder, where defendant had right to use force in self-defense but used excessive force); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 450 (1980) (instruction on manslaughter warranted because of reasonable provocation or because of the use of excessive force in self-defense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 593-594 (1978) (instruction that defendant guilty only of manslaughter, not murder, where defendant privileged to use force in self-defense but used excessive force); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, supra </em>at 210 (circumstances of homicide committed in self-defense mitigate crime from murder to manslaughter).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The judge\u2019s instruction failed to make the distinction between justification and mitigation. Without the benefit of such a distinction the jury were undoubtedly left with the erroneous impression that, if excessive force was used, any killing in such circumstances would be murder and not manslaughter. As we have said, the instruction also took away the jury\u2019s option of finding the defendant not guilty because the defendant exercised reasonable force. Therefore, the jury were left with no correct understanding of the defendant\u2019s principal, if not only, defense. As a result, the defendant was deprived of a fair trial. We must therefore reverse the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>fendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree and order a new trial on that indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">2. <em>Other issues. </em>We briefly address the only other issue which may arise on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The defendant claims error arising out of the treatment of the autopsy report and the testimony of two medical examiners, neither of whom performed the autopsy. The autopsy report was not admitted in evidence, and some question exists as to the extent to which it played any role in the testimony of the two experts. It is enough for our purposes here to restate the rule that \u201can expert [may base] an opinion on facts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion.\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986). Contrast Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and remand the case for a new trial on the murder indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-13\">The defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and to concurrent terms of from six to eight years on the larceny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>conviction, from three to five years on the receiving stolen property conviction, and from three to five years on the firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The codefendant, Shawn F. Egela, was acquitted of all the same charges except that of unlawful carrying of a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
