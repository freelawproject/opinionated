A judge of the Holyoke Division of the District Court determined that an infant in a persistent vegetative coma would choose, were she competent, to have the \u201cno code\u201d order entered on her medical charts. For the reasons stated we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The child whose treatment is at issue was born on September 30, 1986. Her mother and putative father were both minors at the time. Less than one month after her birth, in response to a petition filed by the Department of Social Services (DSS), a District Court judge found the child to be in need of care and protection. By order of the District Court, DSS gained legal and physical custody of the child. On October 30, 1986, the child\u2019s mother was also found in need of care and protection and placed in DSS custody. In December of the same year, DSS returned physical custody of the child to her mother, while retaining legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Shortly thereafter, the mother and child were involved in an automobile accident. That accident, in which the straps on the child\u2019s car seat wrapped around her neck and cut off the supply of oxygen to her brain for a substantial period of time, left the child in an irreversible coma.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">As a result of the accident, the child cannot see, hear, or engage in any purposeful movement. Her ability to breathe on her own is extremely limited. A breathing tube has been inserted directly into her lungs through an incision in her trachea, and her rate of breathing is controlled by a machine. She is fed through a feeding tube permanently inserted in her stomach. The child suffered cardio-respiratory arrests as a result of aspirating food regurgitated from her stomach. She was resuscitated on these occasions by extraordinary treatment, including the administration of medication to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>restart her heart. Although the child has undergone Nissen fundoplication surgery,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which significantly decreases the likelihood that she will regurgitate food into her lungs, she nevertheless still runs the risk of such cardiorespiratory arrests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">On July 7, 1987, DSS and the child\u2019s mother jointly moved for appointment of a guardian ad litem for the child and entry of a substituted judgment decision as to what further medical care should be given to the child. Because both the child and her parents were minors, as well as under the legal custody of DSS, a guardian was appointed to represent the child.</p>\n<p id=\"AsR\">The primary witness at the hearing for entry of substituted judgment was Dr. Stephen Lieberman, the director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Baystate Medical Center, where the child was hospitalized following the accident. Dr. Lieberman, who has extensive training and experience in treating children with neurological problems, was primarily responsible for the child from the time she was admitted to Baystate. After extensive testing, Dr. Lieberman determined that \u201cthere is nothing to indicate that she has any ability to fu\u00f1etion from her cerebral cortex. But she does function from a brain stem level where things are not under [her conscious] control.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He testified that the child is irreversibly in a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of coma from which \u201cshe will never regain [consciousness or] be able to function in any way.\u201d He testified that \u201cthere is really no potential for this condition to be reversed\u201d except through the perfection of a complete brain transplant operation. Dr. Lieberman stated that, although there is medical controversy as to whether a person functioning at a brain stem level can feel pain, in his opinion, the child does not feel pain, or at least is not \u201cable to localize it.\u201d He testified that entry of a \u201cno code\u201d order was completely consistent with medical ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The District Court judge, substituting his judgment for the incompetent child, found that, if competent, the child would choose not t\u00f3 be resuscitated by extraordinary measures. He therefore ordered that \u201cfurther ventilator treatment and resuscitative measures be withheld\u201d in the event the child \u201csuffers respiratory distress or cardiac arrest in the future.\u201d In addition, he ordered that the Nissen fundoplication surgery be performed in order to reduce the likelihood of the child\u2019s aspirating regurgitated food.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.), the child\u2019s guardian ad litem sought relief from the District Court\u2019s DNR order before a single justice of this court. The single justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>reserved and reported the matter after the parties<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so requested and submitted a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The guardian argues that: (1) the judge\u2019s factual findings with respect to the effects of full code treatment are clearly erroneous; (2) the judge\u2019s determination that the child would choose to decline resuscitative medical treatment in the event of respiratory or cardiac arrest is without support in the record and the judge\u2019s findings; and (3) even if the judge\u2019s substituted judgment determination were correct, resuscitative treatment should nevertheless be administered because the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life outweigh\u2019s the child\u2019s desire to have a \u201cno code\u201d order entered on her medical charts. The guardian requests that the order placing the child on \u201cno code\u201d status be vacated, and that we enter a judgment that the child would choose to have all extraordinary medical treatment continue in the event of further cardiac or respiratory arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><em>The \u201cno code\u201d determination. </em>\u201cCardiac arrest occurs at some point in the dying process of every person, whatever the underlying cause of death. Hence the decision whether or not to attempt resuscitation is potentially relevant for all patients.\u201d Deciding to Forego Life-Sustaining Treatment: Ethical, Medical and Legal Issues in Treatment Decisions, President\u2019s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 235 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(March, 1983). It is not surprising, then, that \u201cno code\u201d orders have become fairly routine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Generally, \u201cno code\u201d orders do not require judicial oversight. See <em>Matter of Dinnerstein, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 474-475 (1978). Cf. <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417, 423 (1986) (unlike substituted judgment to discontinue artificial nutrition and hydration, DNR order entered on Brophy\u2019s chart at wife\u2019s request not reviewed by court). Courts should not be in the business of reviewing uncontroversial \u201cno-code\u201d cases simply because doctors and hospitals seek to shield themselves from liability. See Liacos, \u201cDilemmas of Dying,\u201d Legal and Ethical Aspects of Treating Critically and Terminally Ill Patients 149, 153 (Am. Soc\u2019y of Law &amp; Med., 1982) (\u201cthere is a difference between acting to preserve the interest of the patient and acting to preserve the interest of the profession\u201d). \u201cIf hospitals ensure that decisionmaking practices are reasonable and that internal review and advice are readily available, decisions concerning resuscitation will seldom need to come before courts.\u201d Deciding to Forego Life-Sustaining Treatment, <em>supra </em>at 252.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In this case, however, the minor is incompetent by virtue of both her age and irreversible coma. Further, both parents were also minors, and the mother and child were in the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>custody of DSS. The guardian opposes the DNR order. Moreover, as in <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>385 Mass. 697, 709 (1982), \u201cthe child already was within the jurisdiction of the court before the question whether a \u2018no code\u2019 order should be made . . . arose.\u201d In these circumstances, a judicial \u201cno code\u201d determination is appropriate. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 709 (where, among other factors: (1) minor patient is ward of State in DSS custody; (2) child\u2019s mental faculties have not developed to point that he is competent to make decision; (3) parents have failed to exercise parental responsibilities toward child; and (4) child already was within the jurisdiction of the court, judicial determination of [\u201cno code\u201d] is appropriate); <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 636-637 (1980) (\u201c[O]ur opinions should not be taken to establish any requirement of prior judicial approval that would not otherwise exist. . . . [A] variety of circumstances [are] to be taken into account in deciding whether there should be an application for a prior court order with respect to medical treatment of an incompetent patient.\u201d [Circumstances include whether the patient is in State custody, the patient\u2019s level of comprehension and mental ability, and whether the patient, spouse or guardian consents to the action]).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The right of incompetent individuals to refuse medical treatment is effectuated through the doctrine of substituted judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), supra </em>at 697; <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 738-739 (1977). In making a substituted judgment determination, the court \u201cdons \u2018the mental mantle of the incompetent\u2019 and substitutes itself as nearly as possible for the individual in the decision-making process . . . . [T]he court does not decide what is necessarily the best decision but rather what decision would be made by the incompetent person if he or she were competent.\u201d <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 565 (1982), citing <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 752, quoting <em>In re Carson, </em>39 Misc. 2d 544, 545 (N.Y. Sup. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Ct. 1962).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In determining what the incompetent person\u2019s choice would be, the judge should consider: (1) the patient\u2019s expressed preferences, if any; (2) the patient\u2019s religious convictions, if any; (3) the impact on the patient\u2019s family; (4) the probability of adverse side effects from the treatment; and (5) the prognosis with and without treatment. See <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 415, 444 (1981). The judge must also \u201ctak[e] into account the present and future incompetency of the individual as one of the factors which would necessarily enter into the decision-making process of the competent person.\u201d <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 752-753. The judge should also consider any countervailing State interests, which may include: (1) the preservation of life; (2) the protection of innocent third parties; (3) the prevention of suicide; and (4) the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession. See <em>Norwood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>409 Mass. 116, 125 (1991); <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 741; <em>Spring, supra </em>at 641. The judge may consider any additional factors which appear to be relevant. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 506 (1983).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">With respect to the foregoing factors, the judge found the following facts. Because of her infancy, the child had not expressed any wishes from which the judge could draw guidance. \u201c[B]ecause of the absence of natural family involvement there is no information regarding the child\u2019s ethical, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>moral or religious values that the Court could examine.\u201d There would be little, if any, impact on the child\u2019s family because the family was never intact.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he implications of a full-code effort would involve a substantial degree of bodily invasion.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the infant were to experience cardiac or respiratory arrest, in the absence of extraordinary measures, the child might die. Even with the full-code treatment, \u201cthe prognosis for the child . . . would remain terminal because of the untreatable \u2018brain-dead\u2019 condition.\u201d The child \u201chas made no gains during her long hospitalization;\u201d \u201cat best [she] will live for an indefinite period in a vegetative coma without any real hope of improvement, and as to the brain damage itself the prognosis is hopeless.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s findings, excluding the one for which there is no support, see note 15, <em>supra, </em>are sufficient to support the determination that the child would refuse resuscitative measures in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Arguing that the child has no dignity interest in being free of bodily invasions, the guardian states that the child \u201chas no cognitive ability and therefore will suffer no \u2018indignity\u2019 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the medical care might be supposed to produce in a conscious person.\u201d \u201cCognitive ability\u201d is not a prerequisite for enjoying basic liberties. In the law of this jurisdiction, incompetent people are entitled to the same respect, dignity and freedom of choice as competent people. See <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>411 Mass. 666, 672 (1992); <em>Moe, supra </em>at 566, <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>378 Mass. 732, 745 (1979); <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The guardian also argues that, in any event, \u201cthe necessity for the bodily invasions occasioned by the efforts to resuscitate have been greatly reduced by [the Nissen fundoplication] surgery.\u201d The fact that the invasions may be less frequent than before the surgery does not make any particular invasion less likely to offend the child\u2019s dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The guardian claims that \u201ctreatment would not occasion any financial disruption of the ward\u2019s family, nor involve emotional disturbance which the ward would, if competent, find compelling.\u201d Although the guardian proposes that lack of financial disruption counsels in favor of continued treatment, we hardly think the guardian would accept the converse proposition. As we recently stated in <em>Doe, supra </em>at 520 n.15, \u201c[t]he judge quite properly did not consider whether [the patient\u2019s] continued care would pose a burden of any kind on anyone. The cost of care in human or financial terms is irrelevant to the substituted judgment analysis.\u201d The guardian\u2019s second claim is controverted most strongly by the fact that both the child\u2019s mother and father have expressed their desire that extraordinary measures not be used to prolong the child\u2019s life. The mother testified: \u201cI don\u2019t like to see her going through, suffering that she\u2019s going through .... I know what she was like before this accident. She was a very healthy baby, always smiling . . . and she\u2019s just laying there doing nothing, and it\u2019s not like my daughter.\u201d Moreover, the emotional disturbance which the ward herself, if competent, would experience as a result of her condition cannot be underestimated. Last, contrary to the guardian\u2019s assertions, there is no evidence that the decision to enter the \u201cno code\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>order reflects the judge\u2019s own judgment about the quality of the child\u2019s life.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The guardian alternatively argues that, assuming that the judge was correct in deciding that the child would choose to refuse resuscitation, the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life outweighs the child\u2019s wishes. As we have stated on previous occasions, the State\u2019s general interest in the preservation of life is not absolute. Here, as in <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 742, \u201c[t]he interest of the State in prolonging a life must be reconciled with the interest of an individual to reject the traumatic cost of that prolongation. There is a substantial distinction in the State\u2019s insistence that human life be saved where the affliction is curable, as opposed to the State interest where, as here, the issue is not whether, but when, for how long, and at what cost to the individual that life may be briefly extended.\u201d The substituted judgment decision and the entry of the \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-22\"><em>A </em>\u201cno code\u201d order, also referred to as a \u201cDNR\u201d or do-not-resuscitate order, directs a hospital and staff not to employ extraordinary resuscitative measures in the event of cardiac or respiratory failure. \u201cThe terminology derives from the development in recent years, in acute care hospitals, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>specialized \u2018teams\u2019 of doctors and nurses trained in the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures. If a patient goes into cardiac or respiratory arrest, the nurse in attendance causes a notice to be broadcast on the hospital\u2019s intercommunications system giving a code word and the room number. The members of the code team converge on the room immediately from other parts of the hospital.\u201d <em>Matter of Dinnerstein, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 469 n.3 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-27\">This surgical procedure involves tying off the top part of the stomach to prevent reflux of food into the esophagus and thence to the trachea, where it might be aspirated.

The upper .brain controls thinking and awareness. The lower brain controls only vegetative functions. Currently, only patients who have lost operation of both their upper and lower brain are classified as legally dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-33\">We note, however, that the definition of \u201cdeath\u201d is not static. It evolves with advances in medical technology and changes in social attitudes. Formerly, patients were declared dead when their heart and lungs ceased to function. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 488 (4th ed. 1968). Once the capacity to mechanically maintain cardiac and respiratory functions was devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>oped, however, this definition was no longer adequate and was supplemented (either by statute or judicial decision) by the \u201ctotal brain death\u201d definition. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 360-361 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">One commentator argues that our understanding of death should undergo another revision: when the upper brain ceases to function (\u201cneocortical death\u201d), the patient ought to be considered dead. According to this commentator, the values underlying the \u201ctotal brain death\u201d and \u201cneocortical death\u201d standard are compatible: the former, like the latter, rests on the view that consciousness is the sine qua non of human existence, since a person who is permanently unconscious will currently be declared dead even though her respiration could be mechanically maintained. K.G. Gervais, Redefining Death (Yale U. Press, 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\">DSS sought clarification of the order.

L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, ordinarily is inappropriate where normal appellate review is available. See <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>406 Mass. 701, 706 (1990); <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 103, 106-107 (1989). Because a substituted judgment order is an appealable judgment, normal appellate review will usually be appropriate, see, e.g., <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417, 422 n.5 (1986); <em>Guardianship of Doe, </em>411 Mass. 512, 515 (1991); an appellant may preserve his or her rights, where necessary, by requesting a stay pending appeal.
