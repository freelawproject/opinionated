Charles Construction Co., Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Wilkins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaJ\">Because the applicable arbitration rules did not authorize them to do so, arbitrators had no authority to enter an interim order directing a party to provide security toward the payment of any award the arbitrators might eventually enter. We, therefore, affirm Superior Court judgments vacating the arbitrators\u2019 interim order for security. That award had directed James Derderian, as trustee of Parkman Realty Trust, to furnish a $1,000,000 irrevocable letter of credit, payable on demand, to the American Arbitration Association, as security for the payment of any arbitration award that might be entered against Derderian, as trustee, in the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The issue before us is one of law. There is an extensive procedural history to the proceedings that we need not recite. The course of the arbitration seems atypical because it commenced in September, 1987, and, after seventy-three hearing days, suspended early in 1990. Charles Construction Co., Inc., seeks enforcement of the interim arbitration award in one of the actions before us, and Derderian seeks an order vacating that award in the other. We transferred Charles\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In October, 1984, Derderian, as owner of property in Brookline (owner), and Charles, as construction manager (contractor), entered into an associated general contractors\u2019 standard form of agreement pursuant to which a condominium and parking garage were to be constructed. That agreement provided for the arbitration of certain claims, disputes, and other matters arising out of the agreement \u201cin accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then obtaining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Disputes did arise, and they were submitted to arbitration. The owner asserted claims for more than $2,800,000, and the contractor for more than $1,170,000. Hearings commenced in September, 1987, and continued intermittently until January, 1990, when the contractor requested the panel to issue an order for interim security. On February 16, 1990, in an interim order, the arbitrators, purporting to act under \u00a7 34 of the construction industry arbitration rules, ordered the \"owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>to provide the security that we have previously described. There is no contractual provision apart from the arbitration rules on which the contractor relies. He points to no statutory authorization for the arbitrators\u2019 award of interim relief. The owner contends first that, if Charles is to obtain relief before the arbitration proceeding is concluded, it must come from a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">We reject the owner\u2019s claim that the contractor\u2019s only avenue for obtaining interim relief is through a court order independent of the arbitration proceeding. We have indeed upheld the entry of protective court orders even though a dispute between the parties is subject to arbitration. See <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>399 Mass. 640, 648-649 (1987) (preliminary injunction upheld requiring contractual payments to continue while dispute is arbitrated pursuant to court order); <em>Salvucci </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>349 Mass. 659, 663 (1965) (bill to reach and apply fraudulently conveyed property may be maintained before arbitration proceeding is concluded). If, however, there is an express agreement that authorizes an arbitrator to grant interim relief, including any authorization set forth in arbitration rules incorporated by agreement of the parties, there is no reason why an arbitrator may not act under that authority. Indeed, in such an instance, the court might be obliged both to defer to the parties\u2019 agreement to submit the matter of interim relief to arbitration and to give any subsequent interim order the same deferential treatment that must be accorded to an arbitrator\u2019s final order. Of course, a statute could authorize an arbitrator to grant interim relief. Therefore, if the arbitrators had contractual or statutory authority to issue an interim order, the contractor properly could have sought such an order from them and was not limited to asking for interim relief from a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">There is little authority on the question whether, absent any controlling statute or agreement of the parties, an arbitrator has implicit authority to order a party to provide security, during the pendency of the arbitration, against the possibility of a decision adverse to that party. Where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>no contractual or statutory guidance, authorities that have considered the question have not agreed on the answer. In <em>Konkar Maritime Enter., S.A. </em>v. <em>Compagnie Belge d\u2019Affretement, </em>668 F. Supp. 267, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), and in <em>Compania Chilena de Navegacion Interoceanica, S.A. </em>v. <em>Norton, Lilly &amp; Co., </em>652 F. Supp. 1512, 1517 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), the District Court confirmed an arbitrator\u2019s order for predetermination security similar to the order in this case, concluding that an arbitrator\u2019s right to grant interim relief was implied in the submission of the main dispute to arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On. the other hand, in <em>Swift Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Botany Indus., Inc., </em>466 F.2d 1125, 1134 (3d Cir. 1972), the court held that an arbitrator lacked authority to order a cash surety bond.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">We agree in general that, in the absence of an agreement or statute to the contrary, an arbitrator has inherent authority to order a party to provide security while the arbitration is continuing. See <em>Pacific Reinsurance Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Ohio Reinsurance Corp., </em>935 F.2d 1019, 1022-1023 (9th Cir. 1991) (\u201cTemporary equitable relief in arbitration may be essential to preserve assets or enforce performance which, if not preserved or enforced, may render a final award meaningless\u201d); <em>Island Creek Coal Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Gainesville, </em>729 F.2d 1046, 1049 (6th Cir. 1984) (nothing in the contract or State law prevents the award of interim injunctive relief); <em>Sperry Int\u2019l Trade, Inc. </em>v. <em>Government of Israel, </em>689 F.2d 301, 306 (2d Cir. 1982) (\u201cUnder New York law arbitrators have power to fashion relief that a court might not properly grant\u201d). It is reasonable to assume that parties, in agreeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>to arbitration, implicitly intended that the arbitration not be fruitless and that interim orders to preserve the status quo or to make meaningful relief possible would be proper. In such a circumstance, the arbitrator\u2019s authority to act would reasonably be implied from the agreement to arbitrate itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">This general principle has no application in this case because we construe the construction industry arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association, which the contract incorporates by reference, to restrict the authority of an arbitrator to provide interim relief. To justify the issuance of the interim order, the contractor relies on \u00a7 34 of the arbitration rules, the same authority that the arbitrators relied on when issuing their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Section 34, as it was in effect when the interim order for security was entered in February, 1990, is entitled \u201cInterim Measures,\u201d and states: \u201cThe arbitrator may issue such orders for interim relief as may be deemed necessary to safeguard the property that is the subject matter of the arbitration without prejudice to the rights of the parties or to the final determination of the dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No property was the subject matter of the arbitration. The arbitration was not a dispute over specific property but rather concerned claims of breach of contract. The fact that the owner would be obliged to satisfy any arbitration award against him from assets of the Parkman Realty Trust does not make those assets \u201cthe subject matter of the arbitration.\u201d We do not give \u00a7 34 such an expansive reading. If the drafters of \u00a7 34 for the American Arbitration Association had intended that an arbitrator have authority to issue a preliminary order that a party provide security, the rule would not have been written as it was, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ferring only to property that is the subject matter of the arbitration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">There is another arbitration rule to which the contractor points but on which it relies only by a casual assertion. Section 43 of the construction industry arbitration rules, entitled \u201cScope of Award,\u201d permits an arbitrator to \u201cgrant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties . . . .\u201d That rule cannot authorize interim relief of the sort that the arbitrators awarded in this case. Section 43 does not explicitly refer to interim relief, and, if were to be read to do so, it would render unnecessary \u00a7 34, a rule that appears to deal explicitly and comprehensively with the subject of interim measures. Moreover, whatever just and equitable relief is granted must be \u201cwithin the scope of the agreement of the parties.\u201d That language seems to be focused on the arbitrator\u2019s final disposition (unless perhaps the parties explicitly agreed to grant the arbitrators the right to grant interim relief).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In each case, the judgment vacating the interim arbitration award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\"> For another example of the divergence of views on the issue, compare Rodman, Commercial Arbitration \u00a7 26.1 (West 1984 &amp; Supp. 1989) (\u201cGenerally, with the exception of maritime cases, provisional remedies such as attachments or compulsory bonds are not available in arbitration\u201d) with 4 Business Law Monographs 5-6 (M. Bender 1989) (\u201cOnce the parties agree to submit their dispute to arbitration, the power of the arbitrator to govern the proceedings before him includes the power to grant provisional remedies\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\"> Neither opinion discussed the terms of the agreement to arbitrate or any applicable arbitration rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\">We need not consider here what the consequence should be of a party\u2019s inability to comply with such an order. The order here did not simply provide for a security interest in the owner\u2019s assets but rather it called for the owner in effect to produce cash security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Previously \u00a7 34, in effect on January 1, 1986 (and perhaps earlier), was headed \u201cConservation of Property\u201d instead of \u201cInterim Measures,\u201d but it was substantially the same as the rule quoted above. The prior rule did not have the words \u201cfor interim relief\u2019 after the word \u201corders.\u201d The parties do not argue which rules are applicable, and we need not decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The conclusion of the court in <em>Pacific Reinsurance Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Ohio Reinsurance Corp., </em>935 F.2d. 1019, 1022-1023 &amp; n.1 (9th Cir. 1991), that the rule identical to \u00a7 34 in the AAA commercial arbitration rules \u201ccontemplates interim equitable relief in appropriate circumstances\u201d is correct, but that rule does not justify an interim order that a party provide security pending the arbitrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The statement in <em>Island Creek Coal Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Gainesville, </em>729 F.2d 1046, 1049 (6th Cir. 1984), that \u00a7 43 authorizes an arbitrator to order specific performance to preserve the status quo during arbitration may be correct (unless the contract expressly prevents such relief), especially as to the party who commenced the proceeding in order to discover whether he could depart from the status quo. That opinion does not, however, say that \u00a7 43 supports an order of the sort entered in the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
