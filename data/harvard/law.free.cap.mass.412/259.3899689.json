The Appeals Court held that the plaintiff had no right to inspect the stockholder list because he was motivated solely by a desire \u201cto obtain information that might result in acquiring additional company stock for his investment portfolio.\u201d <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 769, 773 (1991). We allowed the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review. We agree with\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the Appeals Court\u2019s analysis. We comment briefly on the procedure used to report the case. We remand the matter to the Superior Court to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The plaintiff\" commenced an action in Superior Court alleging that the company wrongfully had denied him access to its stockholder list. The complaint sought both injunctive relief and damages. The parties filed a statement of agreed facts. The agreed facts are as follows. The plaintiff has been a stockholder of the defendant since 1980. The defendant, a Massachusetts gas company within the meaning of G. L. c. 164, has only one class of stock, of which there are 296,757 shares issued and outstanding. The stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In September, 1984, the plaintiff made a formal written request that he be permitted to inspect and copy a list of all stockholders of the defendant company. According to the statement of agreed facts, \u201c[t]he purpose of Plaintiff\u2019s request . . . was to learn the identity of Company stockholders in order to determine whether there were stockholders willing to sell their Company shares to him. [The pjlaintiff was happy with current management of the Company and . . . wished to change [neither] management nor its policies.\u201d The plaintiff has stated under oath that if he is permitted the inspection he seeks, he will use the Company stockholder list solely to make inquiries of Company stockholders to see if they are willing to sell their shares of Company stock to him. <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., supra </em>at 770-771.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">2. <em>The report. </em>The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, and a joint motion to report \u201cthis case to the Appeals Court, pursuant to [Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974)], for determination of the [reported] question.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The judge did not rule on the cross motions for summary judgment; the judge did allow the parties\u2019 motion to report the case. The judge, however, reported a question of law to the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He did not report the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Rule 64 provides that a trial judge, in certain circumstances, may report a case to the Appeals Court. The provisions of rule 64 relevant to this case (found in the third sentence of the rule) require that the report be requested by both parties and that the parties agree in writing to all material facts. Mass. R. Civ. P. 64. The judge need not render any decision on the case before reporting it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Rule 64 does not provide for the report of a question of law without entry of a finding or order. Ordinarily, we would decline to decide a case that was improperly reported. Because the parties requested a report of the case and agreed in writing to all the material facts and because the Appeals Court addressed the issue at length, however, we exercise our discretion to treat this matter as if the case, rather than a question, were reported. Cf. <em>Adoption of Thomas, </em>408 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>446, 449 (1990) (\u201cWe believe the public interest would be best served by our answering the questions posed, . . . and therefore we do so\u201d [citation omitted]). Cf. also <em>Scandura </em>v. <em>Trombly Motor Coach Serv., Inc., </em>370 Mass. 612, 615 (1976). Because we treat the case as if it had been reported properly under rule 64, we do not answer the question reported to the Appeals Court but rather consider the appropriate resolution of the case. See <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>377 Mass. 804, 805 n.2 (1979). <em>Scandura </em>v. <em>Trombly Motor Coach Serv., Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">3. <em>The merits. </em>The plaintiff contends that G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32 (1990 ed.), confers on him the right to inspect and copy the stockholder list for his stated purpose of acquiring stock for his portfolio.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree. The statute does not compel such a conclusion. The question is whether the trading of stock solely for investment purposes is \u201crelative to the affairs of the corporation.\u201d G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The language of the statute is the best indication of legislative intent. The words of a statute are \u201cconstrued by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 316 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The parties agree that the crucial language in G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32, was enacted by the Legislature (in St. 1923, c. 172) in response to our holding in <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>234 Mass. 592, 595 (1920). Shabshelowitz contends that, in enacting St. 1923, c. 172, the Legislature only intended to prevent stockholders from using inspection rights in furtherance of fraudulent investment schemes. Shabshelowitz further maintains that the statute merely reimposes the common law requirements for inspection of stockholder lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Shabshelowitz\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive. The Appeals Court, Shabshelowitz asserts, erred because legislative history of the statute demonstrates that it was only intended to eliminate the use of stockholder lists in fraudulent investment schemes. In support of this argument, the plaintiff cites a petition that accompanied the statute as originally proposed. The petition \u201crepresent [ed] that public necessity and convenience require the passage of legislation prohibiting or restricting the securing of lists of stockholders of Massachusetts corporations for purposes not connected with the affairs of the corporation <em>or </em>for the purpose of ascertaining the small shareholders in order to get them to sell their sound investments and invest in speculative or worthless foreign oil and mining shares . . .\u201d (emphasis added). 1923 House Doc. No. 620. The petition cited by Shabshelowitz has little, if any, value as legislative history. The petition purports to reflect not the intent of the Legislature as a whole but, rather, the views of one legislator.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Assuming that the petition were to be considered as legislative history, however, it would not support Shabshelowitz\u2019s argument. Instead, the petition demonstrates that its author sought to deny inspection rights not only to those who urge the public to \u201cinvest in speculative or worthless foreign oil and mining shares\u201d but also to those motivated by \u201cpurposes not connected with the affairs of the corporation.\u201d The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d indicates that the \u201cpurposes not connected with the affairs of the corporation\u201d contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the Legislature comprised more than just fraudulent investment schemes. See <em>Bello </em>v. <em>South Shore Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 770, 782 (1981) (\u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 is given a disjunctive meaning unless the context and the main purpose of all the words demand otherwise,\u201d quoting <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 [1966]).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Shabshelowitz\u2019s reading of the statutory language as a response to <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, supra, </em>is similarly dubious. Prior to our holding in <em>Shea, </em>stockholders enjoyed an absolute statutory right to inspect corporate stockholder lists. See <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., supra </em>at 772. In <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, supra </em>at 594, we held that this absolute right applied to a stockbroker who intended to use the stockholder list \u201cto ascertain [when inquiries were made by prospective purchasers] if any of the shares were for sale, and [to] \u2018broaden [ ] the market for the stock.\u2019 \u201d It was in response to this holding, according to Shabshelowitz, that the Legislature enacted the requirement that inspection requests be \u201crelative to the affairs of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">There is, however, no significant difference between the stockbroker\u2019s purpose in <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, supra, </em>and Shabshelowitz\u2019s purpose here. Indeed, Shabshelowitz himself argues that one of the primary effects of his effort to inspect the shareholder list will be a \u201cbroadening of the market for the corporation\u2019s stock.\u201d Viewed from the point of view of the corporation, whose \u201caffairs\u201d are the subject of legislative concern, there is no difference between a stockbroker\u2019s efforts to find willing sellers for third-party buyers and Shabshelowitz\u2019s endeavors to find stockholders willing to sell to him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For this reason, the Appeals Court\u2019s distinction between purely personal purposes for seeking inspection and those which are \u201crelative to the affairs of the corporation\u201d is sound. See <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., supra </em>at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Shabshelowitz unsuccessfully urges us to interpret St. 1923, c. 172, as a Legislative return to the common law principle with respect to inspection of stockholder lists. Even assuming that this position were correct, however, Shabshelowitz misstates the substance of the common law. According to Shabshelowitz, the common law required that a stockholder demonstrate \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201ca proper purpose\u201d before the stockholder was allowed to inspect the corporate books. Shabshelowitz then attempts to establish that his purpose for inspecting the stockholder lists was \u201cproper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Shabshelowitz, however, cites no authority for the proposition that the \u201cproper purpose\u201d requirement ever was the governing standard in Massachusetts. In fact, as the Appeals Court explained, at common law, stockholders had the right to inspect stockholder lists if they were \u201cacting in good faith and for the purposes of advancing the corporation\u2019s interest and protecting their rights as owners.\u201d <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., supra </em>at 771, citing <em>Varney </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>194 Mass. 239, 240 (1907). A return to the common law of Massachusetts, therefore, would require that Shabshelowitz be motivated by the \u201cpurposes of advancing the corporation\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>His own stipulation confirms that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Shabshelowitz maintains that the Appeals Court\u2019s approach is inconsistent with the results reached by every other court that has considered this question. The short answer to this contention is that the statutes interpreted by those courts \u201cappear to emphasize the personal interest of the stockholder and do not contain our statutory language referring to the \u2018interest of the applicant, as a stockholder, relative to the affairs of the corporation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., supra </em>at 773 &amp; 773, citing Delaware Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 220(b) (1983) (\u201cA proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person\u2019s interest as a stockholder . . .\u201d). Cf., e.g., Florida Stat. \u00a7 607.1602(8) (1991 ed.) (\u201c \u2018proper purpose\u2019 means a purpose reasonably related to such person\u2019s interest as a shareholder\u201d). Model Business Corporation Act \u00a7 16.02(c) (Supp. 1986) (purpose of inspection must be \u201crelevant to the . . . shareholder\u2019s interest'as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>shareholder). Cf. also <em>Morris </em>v. <em>United Piece Dye Works, </em>59 A.2d 660, 661 (N.J. 1948) (stockholder\u2019s purpose for inspection must be \u201cgermane to the applicant\u2019s right as a shareholder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Shabshelowitz also contends that our cases since <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, supra, </em>support his position. The Appeals Court, however, properly disposed of this argument. In both of the cases cited by Shabshelowitz, the stockholders seeking inspection of stockholder lists sought to control corporate policy or governance. See <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., supra </em>at 774, citing <em>Hanrahan </em>v. <em>Puget Sound Power </em>&amp; <em>Light Co., </em>332 Mass. 586 (1955) (stockholders sought merger of corporation with another); <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>347 Mass. 274 (1964) (proxy contest).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Finally, Shabshelowitz advances strong policy arguments in support of his position. He notes that stockholders are the true owners of a corporation and that the right to communicate with other stockholders is fundamental to corporate democracy. See generally <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Harkness, </em>199 U.S. 148, 155 (1905). Shabshelowitz also postulates that it is always in stockholders\u2019 best interest to create as wide a market as possible for shares. The Legislature, however, and not a court, is the appropriate forum for consideration of those policy arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the Superior Court for entry of judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Rule 64 provides that a trial judge, \u201cupon request of the parties, in any case where the parties agree in writing as to all the material facts, may report <em>the case </em>to the [A]ppeals [C]ourt for determination without making any decision thereon\u201d (emphasis added). In this case, the parties jointly requested that the judge report the case to the Appeals Court. The parties also agreed to a statement of facts that resolved all material factual disputes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The judge reported the following question: \u201cDoes plaintiff\" have a right to inspect and copy the Fall River Gas Company stockholders list for the purpose of identifying current stockholders whom he can contact in order to determine whether they are willing to sell their shares of Company stock to him for his own investment portfolio?\u201d The Appeals Court answered this question \u201c[n]o.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In his order for report, the judge noted that the resolution of pending cross-motions for summary judgment \u201cdepend [s] upon resolution of the [reported] question . . . .\u201d Thus, the judge recognized that a negative answer to the reported question would determine the outcome of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Rule 64 also allows a judge to report an interlocutory finding or order if the judge believes that the finding or order \u201cso affects the merits of the controversy that the matter ought to be determined by the [A]ppeals [C]ourt before any further proceedings in the trial court.\u201d Mass.
