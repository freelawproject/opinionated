Knox (attorney), who has been convicted of felonies but who offers mitigating evidence. The Board of Bar Overseers (board) and Bar Counsel recommended that he be suspended from practice for the period of his suspended sentence and probation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">The indictments to which the attorney pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charged one count of conspiracy and four counts of structuring currency violations, so-called \u201cmoney laundering.\u201d He was sentenced to a two-year suspended term of imprisonment and placed on probation for a term of three years. He used his client trust accounts to conceal large amounts of cash, knowing that he was assisting in the concealment of illegal drug profits. He was unaware that the money was provided by government agents in a \u201csting\u201d oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ation. Knox was addicted to cocaine at the time; his cocaine use cost approximately $600-$700 every week. In mitigation, he has taken steps to end his addiction, and he had been \u201cclean and sober\u201d for almost two years at the time of the hearing before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The ultimate consideration in all bar discipline cases is the public welfare. <em>Matter of Keenan, </em>314 Mass. 544, 547 (1943). The sanction for misconduct of an attorney shall not be \u201cmarkedly disparate from those ordinarily entered by the various single justices in similar cases.\u201d <em>Matter of Alter, </em>389 Mass. 153, 156 (1983). Bar counsel has pointed out in his brief that, since our decision in <em>Matter of Alter, </em>fifty-five attorneys have appeared before single justices of this court following felony convictions. The sanctions have been as follows: Twenty-nine have been disbarred;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ten resigned from the bar<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (nine explicitly in lieu of disbarment); six have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>suspended indefinitely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The remaining ten received suspensions ranging from eighteen months to five years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the past nine years, no attorney convicted of a felony has escaped suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Therefore, it appears clear that the sanction of a suspension through the period of the attorney\u2019s probation in this case is not at all disparate. In fact, the mitigating circumstances saved him from an indefinite suspension or disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Judgment in accordance with this opinion shall be entered in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">See <em>Matter of Casson, </em>S.J.C.
