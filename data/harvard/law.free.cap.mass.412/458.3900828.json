Six days later, the petitioner, Robinson, challenged the validity of an unwritten de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>cisi\u00f3n by the department to delay implementation of that order until it issued a second, amended order on October 19, 1982, which clarified an ambiguity in the first order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time the petition for review was heard by a single justice, the amended order had taken effect. The single justice dismissed the action, and Robinson appealed to the full court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Robinson concedes that his challenge to the validity of the first order is moot, but he seeks enforcement of the rates approved in that order for the period between the two orders. He contends that the department\u2019s delay in implementing the first order was invalid and that the company should be required to send corrected bills to its 1982 metropolitan service subscribers. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In 1981, the department ordered the company to submit a proposal to restructure its \u201cmetropolitan service\u201d zones to provide a \u201cbetter correlation between the rates to be charged in each zone and the number of main stations which may be reached by subscribers in each zone.\u201d At that time, metropolitan service was an optional flat-rate, unlimited calling service offered to one-party residence -subscribers in exchanges within twenty rate miles of the Boston central exchange. See <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>371 Mass. 67, 85 (1976). In accordance with the department\u2019s order, the company filed a restructuring proposal on April 23, 1981. The department docketed this filing as \u201cD.P.U. 699,\u201d and allowed Robinson to intervene pro se. During the summer and fall of 1981, discussions concerning the company\u2019s proposal were held between the department, company representatives, and Robinson. Robinson submitted a different restructuring plan, and two other plans were also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>discussed. The company agreed to conduct a comparison of the four restructuring plans, and subsequently submitted a report to the department on November 6, 1981, indicating that it preferred its original proposal. In support of its plan, the company filed tariff revisions for its metropolitan service on January 29, 1982. This filing was docketed as \u201cD.P.U. 1041.\u201d On February 28, 1982, the department suspended the filing for the full six months allowed by statute, G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18 (1980 ed.). Subsequently, during the course of the hearings on the tariff revisions, the department allowed the company\u2019s motion to consolidate D.P.U. 699 and D.P.U. 1041, which enabled the department to take notice of the entire record of both dockets in making its decision. Public hearings on the metropolitan service restructuring plan and tariff revisions were held by the department in July and early August, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Meanwhile, on March 29, 1982, the department had issued \u201cOrder 859,\u201d allowing most of the company service rates, including metropolitan service rates, to be increased by 1.3 per cent. The increase went into effect on April 16, 1982. On August 1, 1982, the company began its annual reclassification of certain exchanges, allowed under the tariff then in effect, which also- resulted in increases in the local monthly rates for thirteen exchanges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On August 27, 1982, the department issued the first order approving the company\u2019s metropolitan service restructuring plan, D.P.U. 699, and its tariff revisions, D.P.U. 1041, which had been filed prior to the two rate increases just discussed. This first order stated that the tariff revisions, D.P.U. 1041, would \u201cbecome effective with billing cycles commencing on or after the date of this Order.\u201d It failed to mention the rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>increases already in effect pursuant to Order 859 and the exchange reclassifications. Before instituting the approved tariff revisions, the company immediately filed with the department a \u201cMotion for Clarification or Reconsideration\u201d of this first order. Robinson filed a motion in opposition to the company\u2019s motion. Without a written order, the department granted permission to delay the implementation of the first order. It then held a hearing on these two motions on September 15, 1982, and issued a second, amended order on October 19, 1982. In this amended order the department acknowledged that, through oversight, its first order had failed to require adjustments in the company\u2019s tariff revisions to reflect the increases that had taken effect since the revisions were originally filed in January, 1982. The amended order required the company to file updated tariff revisions within seven days, based on the rates in effect at that time, which included the two increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Robinson purported to file his petition for review in this court (appeal) pursuant to three statutes. The first of these, G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.), grants this court general superintendency power over all courts of inferior jurisdiction. This action does not involve a decision or order of a court of inferior jurisdiction. Therefore, c. 211, \u00a7 3, provides no ground for Robinson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Robinson also sought review under the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1990 ed.), which provides for appeals to the Superior Court from final decisions of agencies in adjudicatory proceedings, except where a statutory form of judicial review or appeal is otherwise provided. In the case of the department, G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1990 ed.), governs review of its decisions. Therefore Robinson could not bring an appeal under c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The third statute under which Robinson sought review is G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, which provides, in relevant part: \u201cAn appeal as to matters of law from any final decision, order or ruling of the commission may be taken to the supreme judicial court by an aggrieved party in interest by the filing of a written petition praying that the order of the commission be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>modified or set aside in whole or in part.\u201d Pursuant to this statute, we have said that the reviewing court \u201ccannot review or revise pure findings of fact and can deal with rulings or orders of the department only to the extent that they are shown to be erroneous in law.\u201d <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>319 Mass. 46, 47 (1946). The parties do not dispute that the department complied fully with the procedural requirements of c. 30A in fashioning the first order and the amended order, or that the amended order was lawful. The sole issue we must address is Robinson\u2019s contention that the department\u2019s oral order delaying implementation of the rates allowed in the first order was unlawful and in violation of the provisions of c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1) and (8) (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1), provides that agencies must give reasonable notice and a hearing to all parties when conducting an adjudicatory proceeding. Section 11 (8) of c. 30A provides that \u201c[ejvery agency decision shall be in writing or stated in the record,\u201d and that every decision must be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision. The department\u2019s oral order delaying implementation of the rate allowed in the first order, which was prompted by the department\u2019s realization that it had failed to take into account the rate increases already in effect pursuant to Order 859, was clearly within its discretion. See <em>Fryer </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util, </em>374 Mass. 685, 691 (1978) (department\u2019s decision not to suspend already granted rate increase during later proceedings was within its discretion). Furthermore, the order delaying implementation, a ministerial act, was not a \u201cdecision\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8). Therefore, it was not required to be in writing or to be accompanied by a statement of reasons. In addition, the order delaying implementation of the first order was followed promptly by a department hearing on the company\u2019s motion for clarification and reconsideration and Robinson\u2019s opposition. The rights of the parties were fully protected by the procedural steps taken by the department in formulating its first and second orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>We will not disturb the decision of a single justice absent clear error of law or abuse of discretion. <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 103, 106 (1989). The single justice correctly denied Robinson\u2019s petition for review of the validity of the first order on the ground of mootness because by the time it was argued, the first order had been legally superseded by the second order, and Robinson was not entitled to relief on the basis of his \u201cMotion for Enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.-</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Robinson filed a \u201cMotion for Enforcement,\u201d requesting the single justice to order the department to \u201ctake all appropriate steps to enforce its written final order in DPU 699 &amp; 1041, dated August 27, 1982, until such time as the order is legally superseded.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Robinson filed an appeal of the single justice\u2019s decision on December 21, 1982. The filing of the record by the department was not complete until December 15, 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">As D.P.U. explains, \u201c[f]or purposes of determining monthly exchange rates for basic main telephone exchange service, exchanges are classified into rate groups by class of service according to the number of main exchange lines in the primary calling area (PCA). The tariff provides for the reclassification of exchanges to the applicable higher/lower rate group when the total exchange lines in the PCA exceed or fall below the upper/ lower limits of the rate group for two consecutive annual study periods.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
