L. c. 231A (1990 ed.) that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify its insured, SCA Services, Inc. (SCA), in an action brought by the State of New York and the town of Tusten, New York, for damages caused by hazardous waste leaching out of a landfill in Tusten to which SCA brought such waste for disposal. Liberty Mutual\u2019s complaint for declaratory relief also sought a judicial determination of the rights and liabilities of SCA\u2019s other insurers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On cross-motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court ruled in favor of SCA and entered an order determining that Liberty Mutual, Transportation, and Hartford have a duty to defend SCA in the underlying New York action. The three insurers sought relief in the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. (1990 ed.), and a single justice of that court allowed them to prosecute immediate appeals from the Superior Court order. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the insurers are under no duty to defend SCA in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u201c[T]he question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend third-party actions against the insured is decided by matching the third-party complaint with the policy provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>sions: if the allegations of the complaint are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense .... Otherwise stated, the process is one of envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 146-147 (1984), quoting <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). See also <em>Jimmy\u2019s Diner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass., </em>410 Mass. 61, 62 (1991); <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins.

Co., </em>400 Mass. 767, 772 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The underlying action which SCA claims the insurers are obligated to defend was brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by the State of New York and the town of Tusten, New York, where the landfill is located. The complaint charges that SCA, whose business is described in the policies as \u201crefuse collection\u201d and \u201cprivate sanitation,\u201d transported industrial and chemical wastes to the Tusten landfill for disposal during 1973 and 1974. SCA is alleged to have acted in concert with three co-defendants: the operator of the landfill, its owner, and an individual who arranged for others to dispose of waste at the site. The complaint asserts that the site has been determined to be an \u201copen dump\u201d by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation under criteria established by Federal law. The site is proximate to private homes and property, to a public drinking water well that provides water to the inhabitants of Tusten, and to the Delaware River, which furnishes public drinking water for communities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The surrounding area receives extensive use from recreational and commercial fishermen, and is a known region of bald eagle habitat. The complaint also asserts that the \u201csite [has been] found to be in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>of Federal and State standards pertaining to the protection of endangered species (proximity to bald eagle habitat), prohibition of groundwater contamination (containing arsenic, barium, lead, iron, and various organic chemicals), and protection from disease (inadequate landfill cover).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The complaint includes the specific allegations against the involvement of SCA in paragraphs numbered therein as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201c24. In 1973, SCA, through its agents, servants and employees, contacted [the landfill operator] and arranged to dispose of industrial and chemical wastes at the . . . landfill site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201c25. Pursuant to this arrangement, several thousand barrels of industrial and chemical wastes were transported to the site by SCA during 1973 and 1974. Many of these wastes contained \u2018hazardous substances.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\u201c26. SCA delivered these wastes to the site in trucks driven by its own employees, or contracted with private parties to drive SCA trucks containing wastes to the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">\u201c27. At the time SCA arranged for disposal of these wastes, it knew or should have known that they were noxious, dangerous and hazardous substances, and could harm the land, water and air resources of the State of New York and human, animal and plant life if they were not disposed of in a manner which would prevent their release into the environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201c28. SCA knew or should have known that these wastes were deposited directly into the ground at the site in trenches'\"dug for that purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">\u201c46. Wastes accepted by [the landfill operator] were disposed of at the site in trenches dug by him for that purpose. Barrels of waste were dumped into the open trenches and flattened with a bulldozer, or the contents of the barrels were emptied into the trenches and the barrels salvaged for reuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The complaint goes on to assert that \u201c [hazardous substances disposed of at the site remain there in open trenches, in the ground and groundwater. Wastes deposited at the site have been and continue to be released into the air, soil and groundwa ter in the vicinity of the site and into the Delaware River.\u201d The complaint states three claims for relief: (1) recovery of response costs under CERCLA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601-9657 [1982]);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) public nuisance; and (3) restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In the comprehensive general liability insurance policies issued to SCA by Liberty Mutual, Transportation, and Hartford, each insurer agrees, subject to certain exclusions, to provide coverage for liability due to property damage caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The policies define \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Each policy also contains a pollution exclusion clause, which states that the insurance does not \u2022 apply to \u201cproperty damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes; acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any water course or body of water; <em>but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and </em>accidental\u201d (emphasis supplied). Under the terms of these policies, the insurers would be obligated to defend SCA in the underlying lawsuit pending in the Federal District Court in New York if the complaint in that suit was reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the release of pollutants was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d See <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Indus. Inc., </em>407 Mass. 675, 677-683 (1990); <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 692 (1990). If the underlying complaint does not allege a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d discharge, the resulting damage is eliminated from coverage by the exclusion clause, even though the discharge might qualify as an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the policy terms. A threshold question, therefore, is whether, applying the comparison test stated above, the complaint in the underlying New York action, alleges a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d release of pollutants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We construed the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion clause in <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Indus., supra </em>at 679-683. In that decision, we held that the word \u201csudden\u201d has a temporal element, and that \u201conly an abrupt discharge or release of pollutants falls within the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680-681 &amp; n.4. We rejected an alternative interpretation that the word \u201csudden\u201d may also mean merely \u201cunexpected,\u201d and should be construed in this way on the principle that ambiguities in an insurance contract are construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Claussen </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>259 Ga. 333, 338 (1989); <em>Just </em>v. <em>Land Reclamation, Ltd., </em>155 Wis. 2d 737, 746 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The pollution alleged in this case was not \u201csudden,\u201d as we defined that term in the <em>Lumbermens </em>case. The complaint details routine business activity lasting over several months in which the toxic contents of the barrels brought by SCA to the landfill were either emptied into open trenches or dumped into trenches and flattened with a bulldozer. To an ordinary intelligent person reading the complaint in the New York action, it is evident that the government asserts contamination of the site and the surrounding area and waters due to continuous waste disposal practices occurring over a protracted period of time as a concomitant part of a regular business activity. Such a situation is within the pollution exclusion because it is not \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In its effort to bring the underlying claim within the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d provision, SCA relies on our statement that \u201cthe abruptness of the commencement of the release or discharge of the pollutant is the crucial element\u201d in determining whether or not a discharge was sudden. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Indus., supra </em>at 681. SCA contends that the discharges were \u201csudden\u201d within the meaning of that description, i.e., as the barrels were crushed or emptied, the commencement of the release from each barrel was abrupt. We reject this strained interpretation. As we stated elsewhere in the <em>Lumbermens </em>case, a discharge that \u201ccontinues for an extended period . . . would likely cease to be accidental or sudden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681 n.6. See also <em>Ray Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>728 F. Supp. 1310, 1318 (E.D. Mich. 1989) (rejecting argument by insured that because \u201cdiscrete releases occurred each time a barrel was smashed,\u201d the releases were therefore sudden). The only reasonable reading of the underlying complaint is, as we have stated, that the pollution of the landfill occurred gradually over several months of repeated activity and not as the result of a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the \u201csud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>den and accidental\u201d exclusion is conjunctive, and both conditions must be met for the exception to be operative, see <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., supra </em>at 692, and because the underlying complaint in this case cannot reasonably be read to allege a \u201csudden\u201d discharge, SCA\u2019s claim for defense by its insurers must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We also reject SCA\u2019s contention that the insurers have not shown that they are entitled to a grant of summary judgment. Drawing on language from <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318-319 (1983), that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, and that \u201cthe underlying complaint need only show . . . a possibility that the liability claim falls within the insurance coverage,\u201d SCA argues that the insurers\u2019 burden for summary judgment is an affirmative showing that there is no possibility that \u201c[a]t least one claim against SCA may involve a \u2018sudden and accidental\u2019 discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Under Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered . . . [if] there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553 (1976). We examine the record in the light most favorable to SCA, see <em>Coveney </em>v. <em>Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross, </em>388 Mass. 16, 17 (1983); however, it must be made to appear that there are genuine issues of material fact precluding the award of summary judgment. \u201c [A]n adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response . . . must set forth specific facts showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). .</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The summary judgment record in this case is well-developed, and the allegations in the underlying complaint in the New York action \"go beyond mere conclusory statements of negligence to assert specific and detailed events and practices that led to the contamination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> SCA has not pointed to anything which indicates that a reasonable reading of the complaint alleges a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d discharge as we construed that term in the <em>Lumbermens </em>case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> SCA\u2019s opposition to the insurers\u2019 motion for summary judgment amounts essentially to speculation that, within the routine operations of the landfill, any single discharge may have occurred suddenly and accidentally. Such a theory, even if accepted as true, \u201ccannot contradict a reasonable reading of the allegations that the entire pattern of conduct was not a \u2018sudden and accidental\u2019 occurrence.\u201d <em>A. Johnson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>933 F.2d 66, 75 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">While an insurer may present an even stronger summary judgment record than was offered in this case by demonstrating, by way of the insured\u2019s answers to the underlying complaint, see <em>Technicon Elecs. Corp. </em>v. <em>American Home Assurance Co., </em>74 N.Y.2d 66, 72 (1989), or a consent decree into which the insured has entered, see <em>A. Johnson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., supra </em>at 68, that the sudden and accidental exception is inapplicable, supplements of this kind are not required. The crucial question is whether, when considered in the light most favorable to SCA, the summary judgment record alleges \u201ca liability arising on the face of the complaint and policy,\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>alty Co., supra </em>at 324. We conclude that the record in this case does not, and therefore, the insurers are entitled to summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Finally, we reject SCA\u2019s argument that it is entitled to recover its defense costs from Liberty Mutual for the period through June 14, 1990 (the date of our decision in <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Indus., supra), </em>on a theory that, under <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 648 (1985), the controlling law prior to our decision in <em>Lumbermens, </em>Liberty Mutual was in breach of its duty to defend. SCA has cited no relevant authority for this theory; moreover, <em>Shapiro </em>does not compel a conclusion that the pollution alleged in this case was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We conclude that Liberty Mutual, Hartford, and Transportation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are entitled to summary judgment on the basis that SCA\u2019s activities fall within the pollution exclusion of these policies. This conclusion is dispositive on the issue of the duty of the insurers to defend SCA in the pending New York action, and renders it unnecessary to consider the other arguments of the parties on issues apart from the applicability of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The order allowing SCA\u2019s motions for summary judgment is reversed. A new order is to enter granting summary judgment for Liberty Mutual, Hartford, and Transportation on the basis that these insurers do not have a duty to defend SCA in the pending action brought by the State of New York and the town of Tusten, New York, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Seven other insurers were named in Liberty Mutual\u2019s complaint. Of those other insurers, only Transportation and Hartford remain parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The complaint alleges that SCA is liable under \u00a7 107 (a) (4) of CER-CLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 (a) (4) (1982), as a \u201cperson who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities or sites selected by such person.\u201d As we noted in <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 696-697 (1990), liability under CERCLA is not based on fault and the available defenses are very limited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We also keep in mind that \u201cthe pleading test for determination of the duty to defend is based exclusively on the facts as alleged_rather than the pay or indemnify . . .
