We aErm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>In October, 1986, the defendant trust (Misha) applied to the defendant Division of Water Pollution Control (division) for a ground water discharge permit for a sewage treatment facility. The division denied the application. On Misha\u2019s appeal, an administrative law judge reversed the denial, and the division adopted that decision as its final decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs received notice of the division\u2019s final decision on September 22, 1990. On October 20, 1990, the complaint in this action was sent by certified mail to the clerk of the proper court. The clerk\u2019s office did not receive the complaint until October 23, thirty-one days after the plaintiffs\u2019 receipt of the division\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u201cProceedings for judicial review of an agency decision shall be instituted in the superior court . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1) (1990 ed.). \u201cThe action shall ... be commenced in the court within thirty days after receipt of notice of the final decision of the agency . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the complaint was mailed within thirty days of the plaintiffs\u2019 receipt of notice of the final decision, it was not filed in the clerk\u2019s office until thirty-one days after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">A Superior Court judge ruled that the complaint had to be filed within thirty days of notice and that the action was not \u201ccommenced in the court\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14 (1) by the mailing of the complaint within thirty days of notice. He rejected, as we do, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the mailing commenced the action in court. The plaintiffs contend that, under Mass. R. Civ. P. 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982), an action is commenced either by filing the complaint and an entry fee with the clerk or by \u201cmailing to the clerk ... a complaint and an entry fee.\u201d They argue that we should read the concept of rule 3 into \u00a7 14 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We are concerned with a statutory appeal period. A rule of court cannot override a contrary statutory provision concerning the manner and time for the effective taking of an appeal from an administrative agency. See <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Direc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>tor of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 417, 418-419 (1985); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>369 Mass. 665, 668 (1976); Mass. R. Civ. P. 82, 365 Mass. 843 (1974). In saying that \u201cthe action shall ... be commenced in the court,\u201d the Legislature intended that the complaint be filed within thirty days after receipt of notice of the agency decision. The Appeals Court has said that there must be a filing within the thirty-day period. See <em>Wolbach </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 308 (1985); <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 669 (1984). In those opinions, however, the issue that confronts us here was not presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The plaintiffs rely on the 1976 amendment of \u00a7 14 (1) that replaced the word \u201cfiled\u201d with the word \u201ccommenced\u201d and made no other change in the relevant sentence. Compare St. 1976, c. 411, \u00a7 1, with St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. They argue that the word change must have been intended to have some purpose and that the only possible purpose was to conform the statute to provisions concerning the commencement of an action that had been recently adopted in Mass. R. Civ. P. 3. However, the words \u201cin the court\u201d were left in \u00a7 14 (1) when it was amended. To accept the plaintiffs\u2019 argument we would have to deny significance to the continued presence in \u00a7 14 (1) of the words \u201cin the court.\u201d On the other hand, to accept the defendants\u2019 argument we would have to deny substantive significance to the 1976 amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We grant that the meaning of \u00a7 14 (1) is not crystal clear because the apparent purpose of the 1973 and 1976 acts was to conform statutory procedures to the Massachusetts Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>of Civil Procedure. We are torn, as we have said, between attributing some purpose to the 1976 amendment, on the one hand, and giving effect to the words \u201cin the court,\u201d on the other. In such a situation, the explicit words of the statute must prevail. On its face, \u00a7 14 (1) contemplates that the clerk must receive the complaint (or a document called an appeal) within thirty days of the receipt of notice of the agency decision. Our interpretation of \u00a7 14 (1) tends to reduce the uncertainty in determining the time at which an agency decision may be treated as conclusive on the matters decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We have decided this case on the issue argued in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief. We do not reach the defendant Misha\u2019s claim that, because the division sought reconsideration of the agency decision, the plaintiffs\u2019 purported appeal, which was entered before final action on the motion for reconsideration, is a premature nullity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 14 (1) provides that \u201cif a petition for rehearing has been timely filed with the agency\u201d (apparently by anyone), the action \u201cshall ... be commenced in the court\u201d within thirty days of notice of action on the petition for rehearing. Also, we do not deal with the suggestion, raised here first in the plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief, that their appeal, although premature with respect to the agency decision on reconsideration, is not a nullity. See, for rules procedure but not for statutory procedure, Mass. R. A. P. 4 (a), as amended, 395 Mass. 1110 (1985), which provides that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a timely motion for a new trial (and of certain other listed motions) \u201cshall have no effect\u201d and that \u201cthe time for appeal for all parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>shall run from the entry of the order denying a new trial\u201d (or action on those other motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The agency decision stated that \u201c[t]he complaint [on any appeal] must be filed in the Court within thirty days of receipt of this decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">There may be an explanation for replacing the word \u201cfiled\u201d with the word \u201ccommenced,\u201d while nevertheless retaining in \u00a7 14 (1) the words \u201cin the court.\u201d As initially enacted in 1954, \u00a7 14 (1) provided that an appeal was to be instituted \u201cby the filing of a petition for review in the superior court.\u201d See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1. A 1973 amendment replaced the reference to a petition for review with the current nomenclature of a civil action. See St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, inserting a new G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Petitions and complaints, tangible items, are filed in court. A civil action is not as easily treated as \u201cfiled\u201d in court as it is viewed as \u201ccommenced\u201d in court. The 1976 change may thus have been simply cosmetic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure similarly limit the time for taking appeals in civil actions and require the filing of a notice of appeal (and not the mailing of a notice) within a prescribed time. Mass. R. A. P. 4 (a), as amended, 395 Mass. 1110 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The record shows that, after the acting director of the division adopted the decision of the administrative law judge as her final decision, the division seasonably moved for reconsideration before the administrative law judge, a course that the final decision stated was authorized pursuant to 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01 (10)(p) (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
