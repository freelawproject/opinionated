We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. Sciaba argues that: (1) the defendant, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (authority), is not authorized to prequalify bidders, and therefore the rejection of its bid at' the prequalification stage was improper; (2) the prequalification process adopted by the authority leaves a prospective bidder with no avenue of appeal; and (3) the judge\u2019s denial of injunctive relief was an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The following facts were determined by the Department of Labor and Industries (department) in a written decision, and adopted by the judge. The authority solicited bids pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 39F-39M, &amp; 39R (1990 ed.), for ceiling demolition and reconstruction of the Callahan Tunnel, which lies underneath Boston Harbor. On January 31, 1991, the authority issued a notice to contractors and required prospective bidders to prequalify in accordance with stated procedures. Sciaba filed a prequalification statement. On February 22, the authority determined that Sciaba did not possess the qualifications necessary to receive prequalification status. On February 26, Sciaba requested reconsideration, which was denied. On March 15, Sciaba protested to the department the decision not to prequalify Sciaba. On March 19, Sciaba expanded the protest, questioning the authority\u2019s power to prequalify bidders. On March 20, the authority received and opened five bids; five other bidders, including Sciaba, were denied prequalification and thus did not bid. On March 25, the department heard the matter, pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>On March 26, the department decided that the authority was not authorized to prequalify bidders, but did not reach the question whether the authority improperly denied Sciaba prequalification. Sciaba then sought injunctive relief in the Superior Court. The denial of its request for a preliminary injunction forms the basis of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In ruling on a request for a preliminary injunction a judge initially \u201cevaluates in combination the moving party\u2019s claim of injury and chance of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 617 (1980). The judge determined that the plaintiff demonstrated little likelihood of success. The judge ruled that: the authority had the power to qualify prospective bidders prior to bidding; the authority\u2019s prequalification guidelines and criteria were adequate (although they could have been clearer); the decision of the authority denying the plaintiffs qualification to bid on the contract was not without rational basis, arbitrary or capricious; and the plaintiff did not demonstrate to the judge\u2019s satisfaction that if its position on prebid qualification was correct, it would be able to qualify on a postbid basis. We conclude that the judge\u2019s denial of Sciaba\u2019s request for injunctive relief was proper because Sciaba failed to demonstrate that it was likely to succeed on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Pursuant to the authority\u2019s enabling legislation, St. 1952, c. 354, as amended, it is empowered to \u201cmake and [to] enter into all contracts and agreements necessary or incidental to the performance of its duties and the execution of its powers under this act; provided, that sections twenty-six to twenty-nine, inclusive, and <em>sections forty-four A to forty-four L, inclusive, of chapter one hundred and forty-nine </em>of the General Laws and <em>sections thirty-nine F to thirty-nine M, inclusive, of chapter thirty </em>of the General Laws shall apply to contracts of the Authority to the same extent and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>same manner as they are applicable to the commonwealth\u201d (emphasis supplied). St. 1952, c. 354, \u00a7 <em>5(m), </em>as amended through St. 1980, c. 49.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Sciaba argues that the prequalification statute, G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 8B (1990 ed.), only authorizes the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) and the Department of Public Works (DPW) to adopt prequalification procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do not agree. This statute requires the MDC and DPW to utilize prequalification; it does not prohibit the authority or other public agencies from using such procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 39M, the statute governing .the awarding of the construction contracts for public works by the authority provides in part that \u201c[e]very contract for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or repair of any public work . . . shall be awarded to the <em>lowest responsible and eligible bidder </em>on the basis of competitive bids publicly opened and read by such awarding authority . . . <em>provided, however, that such awarding authority may reject any and all bids, if it is in the public interest to do </em>so\u201d (emphasis supplied). Since the authority must determine which entity is \u201cresponsible and eligible,\u201d there is no suggestion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the statute that the authority is precluded from prequalifying bidders, as opposed to determining whether such bidders are \u201cresponsible and eligible\u201d postbid, as long as other statutory requirements are followed. As we stated in <em>Modem Continental Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 840 (1984), \u201cprequalification ... is a cornerstone of the competitive bidding statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">General Laws c. 29, \u00a7 8B, provides procedural safeguards with respect to prequalification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sciaba argues that the authority\u2019s procedures contain no such safeguards, and (notwithstanding the fact that Sciaba is before this court on appeal) the authority\u2019s procedures leave a prospective bidder with no avenue of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">From the record before us, we cannot determine the extent to which the authority\u2019s procedures complied with applicable prequalification requirements of the statute. The Superior Court judge did rule, however, that the decision of the au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>thority denying Sciaba\u2019s qualification to bid on the contract \u201cwas not without rational basis, arbitrary or capricious.\u201d Furthermore he. decided that Sciaba did not demonstrate to his satisfaction that, if its position on prebid qualification was correct, it would be able to qualify on a postbid basis. We are satisfied, therefore, that on the record before us Sciaba obtained an adequate review of its claims. It should be noted, however, that an awarding authority seeking to take advantage of prequalification must provide a meaningful appellate process which provides the same or analogous procedural safeguards as are delineated in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 8B.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\n<em>Order denying preliminary injunction affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We do not reach the issue whether the authority erroneously denied prequalification, because that issue is not raised by an appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">General Laws, c. 149, \u00a7 44H (1990 ed.), provides in part: \u201c[T]he commissioner of labor and industries or his designee shall enforce . . . section thirty-nine M of chapter thirty. . .
