We transferred his appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On October 5, 1989, after hearing evidence in executive session, the school committee found that Nicholas had assaulted a fellow high school student \u201cin violation of the policies, rules and codes of\u2022 the Worcester Public Schools\u201d and then voted \u201cto expel [Nicholas] for the rest of the school year with a proviso that the case be reevaluated at the end of the school year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">There was evidence before the school committee that, on September 5, 1989, shortly after school was let out, Nicholas committed a battery on a fellow student on a public street near, but not on, school property. The battery was a product of planning by Nicholas and some friends that had occurred earlier that day on school property. The incident was also a continuation of a confrontation that had occurred on school grounds that day between Nicholas\u2019s group and a group of which the victim was a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Nicholas challenges (1) the school committee\u2019s authority to expel him from school for conduct that did not occur on school grounds or at a school event, (2) the motion judge\u2019s failure to permit a de novo determination of the facts, and (3) the motion judge\u2019s denial of his claim under the State Civil Rights Act (G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11I and 11H [1990 ed.]). We reject all these contentions for reasons that are similar to those stated by the motion judge in his memorandum of decision granting summary judgment to the school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">1. We reject Nicholas\u2019s claim that, because it imposed discipline for conduct not described in its disciplinary rules, the school committee\u2019s conduct was arbitrary or capricious. On the facts of this case, the committee was not limited by the provisions of its rules in imposing discipline. School committees have wide discretion in school discipline matters. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Attleboro, </em>349 Mass. 704, 708-709 (1965). A court will not reverse a school committee\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>sion unless the committee acted arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>Id. </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Nicholas first argues that his conduct did not fall within any prohibition of the school committee\u2019s disciplinary rules. Specifically, he contends that the assault for which the committee disciplined him did not occur on school grounds or at a school event off school grounds and that the prohibitions of the school committee\u2019s disciplinary rules apply only to conduct on school grounds or at a school event. We shall not pause to consider whether the disciplinary rules apply by their terms to a battery committed by one student on another student on a street near a school immediately after school has ended for the day, especially where the battery is the continuation of improper conduct that occurred on school grounds. We simply reject the premise of Nicholas\u2019s argument that, by artless rulemaking, the school committee has foreclosed itself from disciplining a student for violent conduct against another student in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The misconduct here was unquestionably improper, and Nicholas knew it. He needed no advisory rule to tell him that his conduct was seriously wrong and contrary to school policy. Based on facts that the school committee was warranted in finding, it had ample authority to discipline Nicholas.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Nicholas\u2019s claim that the school committee exceeded its authority under its rules by expelling him, rather than simply suspending him from school, also lacks merit. The school committee, for the reasons just given, did not tie its hands in this respect by a statement that bodily injury to a student in violation of its rules was grounds for suspension. In any event, the school committee in effect only suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Nicholas for the 1989-1990 school year. According to the parties\u2019 briefs, he was readmitted in June, 1990, to a summer session. Therefore, by the time summary judgment was entered in October, 1990, the question was moot whether the school committee could not expel Nicholas but could only suspend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">2. We reject Nicholas\u2019s claim that he is entitled to an independent judicial determination of the facts and that, therefore, by affidavit in the Superior Court, he put in contention anew material facts concerning the battery that, on the evidence before it, the school committee had been warranted in finding against him. In deciding whether the discipline imposed was lawful, no de novo judicial fact-finding is required. See <em>School Comm, of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 262-263 (1984). Judicial review is on the record before the school committee to determine whether the committee acted arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Although Nicholas disagrees with the school committee\u2019s factual conclusion that he committed a battery on another student, in his brief here he does not challenge as legally unsound the process in which the school committee established what the factual record before it was.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That process would have been greatly aided, however, if the school committee had recorded electronically (or otherwise) the testimony given in its executive session. In future disciplinary proceedings, on timely request, a school administration should maintain such a record and might be well advised to do so on its own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">3. The motion judge did not err when he allowed the school committee\u2019s motion for summary judgment with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>spect to Nicholas\u2019s claim of a violation of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. We reject any suggestion that, by enacting the State Civil Rights Act, the Legislature intended a de novo review of the factual determinations of a school committee in an action challenging school discipline. The Supreme Court of the United States reached a parallel conclusion in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 326 (1975), overruled on other grounds, <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800 (1982), in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988). Nicholas has failed, on the record before the school committee, to establish a violation of rights protected by the State Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Moreover, on the uncontroverted material facts, Nicholas has failed to put in contention the requirement of \u00a7 11I that the alleged interference with his rights must have occurred by threats, intimidation, or coercion. The school committee\u2019s allegedly unlawful action here was direct and immediate. Even if that action had been unlawful, it contained no threat, intimidation, or coercion. See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 333-334 (1989); <em>Pheasant Ridge Assoc. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>399 Mass. 771, 781 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Federal courts concerned with challenges to school discipline have not required that a school department have a specific regulation prohibiting the conduct for which discipline was imposed. See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>424 F.2d 1281, 1282 (1st Cir. 1970) (\u201cwe would not wish to see school officials unable to take appropriate action in facing a problem of discipline or distraction simply because there was no preexisting rule on the books\u201d); <em>Hasson </em>v. <em>Boothby, </em>318 F. Supp. 1183, 1187-1188 (D. Mass. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, the school committee submitted the handwritten notes of its clerk; a typed, expanded summary made from her notes; minutes of the committee\u2019s executive session and subsequent open meeting; affidavits from the victim, from the chairman of the school committee and other school officials, from a student eyewitness to the battery who also presented an admission to the battery by Nicholas, and from a school administrator who acted as interpreter for Nicholas\u2019s mother, who does not speak English.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
