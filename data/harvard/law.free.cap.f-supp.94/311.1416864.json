Failure of consideration is the defense. The 36 notes for $59,760.00 were part payment of a diesel engine and generating equipment purchased by defendant under a contract of January 8, 1948. The alleged failure of consideration results because this equipment was not the kind of equipment which plaintiff had expressly agreed to deliver to defendant. There is a claim for breach of warranty in that (Answer) : \u201cAt the time of the purchase of the equipment the plaintiff represented and expressly and impliedly warranted that the equipment was fit for the purpose for which the equipment was purchased by the defendant, that is, for the generation and supply of electric power in varying quantities as and when required by the defendant up to 1136 kilowatts. Contrary to the representations and to the express and implied warranties, the equipment, by reason of its inadequate and faulty design and construction, did not and does not now satisfactorily develop electric power in varying quantities up to 1136 kilowatts as required by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">Defendant, filing a counterclaim asserting an affirmative cause of action against plaintiff arising out of the same facts, alleges the equipment sold and delivered by plaintiff to defendant \u201cby reason of the inadequate and faulty design and construction, did not and can not now produce electric power in the amount required by defendant from time to time up to 1136 kilowatts.\u201d Because of the alleged breach of warranty, defendant claims damages in the amount that it paid on account of the purchase price and certain special damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on the first cause of action and on defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The pertinent portions of the contract between the parties are in three parts and are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant says the equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>was described briefly in the Proposal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">\u201c1 \u2014 1420 KVA \u2014 1136 KW at 80% P.F. 3 Phase 60 cycle, 2400 volt, 720 RPM</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">Direct Connected Generator\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>And in Specification No. One the Generator is described as: \u201c1 \u2014 1420 KVA\u2014 1136 KW at 80% Power Factor, 3 Phase, 60 Cycle, 2400 Volt, 3 wire, 720 RPM, 50\u00b0 Rated Fairbanks, Morse Alternator with Sole Plates, Rheostats and Field Discharge Resistor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Defendant interprets the quotes to mean plaintiff, by the terms of the agreement, had agreed to deliver equipment \u201cfor the generation and supply of electric power in varying quantities as and when required by the defendant up to 1136 kilowatts\u201d and claims that hy reason of its inadequate and faulty design and construction, the equipment did not and does not satisfactorily develop electric power in varying quantities up to 1136 kilowatts.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The contract further provides the plaintiff-seller shall not be obligated, liable or accountable upon any guaranty or warranty, express or implied, statutory or otherwise, \u201cin any manner or form beyond its express agreements relative to the determination of the capacity of each Diesel engine at the factory test, the determination of successful operation of the machinery at a specified test, and the replacement of defective guaranteed parts, all hereinbefore specifically set forth.\u201d After delivery and installation defendant accepted the equipment in accordance with the terms of the contract. This acceptance by defendant is found as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u201cConsolidated Fisheries Company Manufacturers of Fish Products Lewes, Delaware</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\u201cJune 19, 1948</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">\u201cFairbanks Morse &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">New York City</p>\n<p id=\"AEr\">\u201cGentlemen:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">\u201cThis is to advise that 1600 HP Generator and Engine have been installed and are operating in a satisfactory manner and personnell instructed in its operation</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">\u201cVery truly yours</p>\n<p id=\"Ati\">\u201cConsolidated Fisheries Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">\u201cR. C. Hayes\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">A close reading of the record in the case at bar fails to disclose that notice of any kind was ever sent by defendant to plaintiff to the effect that the equipment purchased by defendant did not meet the claimed requirements. Certain it is that no such notice is pleaded, relied on or contained in any writing before me. Defendant, however, admits giving the acceptance but says it was given in reliance upon representations made by a certain employee of plaintiff and that in any event the acceptance is not material to the issue in this case. The defense and counterclaim asserted by defendant is not based on <em>any-implied </em>warranty. On the contrary, defendant argues plaintiff\u2019s undertaking is an express warranty to deliver equipment which will produce \u201c1136 KW at 80% P.F. 3 Phase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">On the basis'of the facts, plaintiff claims, however, it is entitled to summary judgment because defendant is relying upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>warranty of fitness of the equipment to deliver up to 1136 kilowatts and such reliance is rendered unavailing by the express terms of the contract between the parties where it deals with both implied and' express warranties. Plaintiff also urges that the repre- \u2022 sentations supposedly made by Anderson <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the statements made in connection therewith according to Hayes, are irrelevant to any issue of the case for the purpose of plaintiff\u2019s motion, and even if they were relevant they, too, would be rendered unavailing under the express \u2019terms of the contract as well as the parol evidence rule. Plaintiff argues that the guaranties and warranties specifically assumed and made exclude any such warranty as urged by defendant, whether it be express or implied, not so assumed by plaintiff as shown by the other clauses of the contract \u2014 in particular, General Engine Proposal, par. 4, 6, and specifically par. 7, which provides the proposal shall become \u201cthe entire and sole agreement of the parties pertaining to the subject matter thereof\u201d * * * <em>\u201cmutually withdrawing, cancelling, or otherwise waiving, terminating and excluding any and all oral, written, express or implied representation, guaranties, warranties, agreement or understandings whatsoever not set forth in full herein or in the General Provisions or Specifications made a part hereof.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Finally, plaintiff points out that regardless of whether there was a breach by it which might be said to constitute failure of consideration, still defendant was under a duty to give notice to that effect to plaintiff within a reasonable time after installation and operation and since defendant has failed to give notice within a reasonable time its present defense is totally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Defendant\u2019s single contention, as stated before, is that it does not rely at all on any theory of implied warranty, but that there has been a failure of consideration because the equipment delivered failed to comply with the express terms of the agreement. In so claiming it says whether the equipment did comply with the agreement raises a material fact issue and that consequently the motion for summary judgment should be denied. After reviewing the entire record before me I cannot accept this view. I conclude plaintiff\u2019s motions for summary judgment should be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">1. There are, at bottom, two questions. The first is whether the plaintiff-seller did warrant the equipment to develop \u201cup to 1136 KW\u201d by implication of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the contract not only specifi-</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cally states it is \u201cthe entire and sole agreement of the parties\u201d but also expressly and positively excludes implied warranties<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in at least six instances: (a) General Engine Proposal, Paragraphs 4, 6 and 7; and (b) Standard General Provisions, Paragraphs II C (1), III and VI. In this respect, Pargaraph II C (1) which relates to \u201cTest for successful operation according to Guaranties of Duty\u201d appears vital for it states \u201cThe Company (plaintiff) makes no guaranty or warranty of operation or efficiency except such Guaranties of Duty as may be stated in the Proposal * * * \u201d, which, it is clear, relates to fuel guaranties. Moreover, the oral representations alleged to have been made by plaintiff\u2019s engineer Anderson at the time defendant accepted the installation and operation of the equipment are not relevant to the issue presented here for such allegations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> appearing in the Hayes affidavit, even if material, must be ignored as incompetent and not admissible evidence under both the express terms of the contract of sale and the parol evidence rule. The acceptance of the equipment, on the other hand, was itself a part of the written contract<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and contemplated as such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>by the parties; hence, it cannot be varied or altered by alleged parol statements made prior to the time the acceptance was given. Defendant failed to request a test then, as it could have under Paragraph 11(c) 1 of the Standard General Provisions and thus, it seems to me, it waived any guaranty of duty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That particular paragraph, by its specific terms, provided \u201cIf such a test is not requested by the Purchaser, or if, for any reason, other than the fault or neglect of the company or its Engineer, such test is not properly conducted promptly as aforesaid, <em>all Guaranties of Duty shall he -mil and void, and the Purchaser shall give to the Company\u2019s Engineer or other representative, on demand, a written acceptance of the equipment as properly fulfilling the requirements of the contract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"> Again, I am unable to adopt defendant\u2019s view that the <em>description </em>of the equipment is an express warranty that it will deliver up to 1136 KW. A warranty arising from description is not an express warranty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Any distinction between implied and express warranty has merely academic interest here for, as stated above, the contract between plaintiff and defendant by its specific terms withdraws, cancels, waives, terminates and excludes \u201cany and all * * * express, or implied * * * warranties\u201d except those actually assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">2. The second of the two questions upon which this case rests may now be stated. It is not important in answering this question to determine whether the issue raised is one of express or implied warranty because in either event I think plaintiff\u2019s position is sound even if we assume, as we must for discussion here, that plaintiff violated an express or implied condition of the contract in delivering the equipment and even if we assume that the representations made by an employee of the plaintiff were material and binding on plaintiff. This is true because on the record before me defendant gave no notice that the equipment failed to meet the standards which it claims the contract required. \u00a7 49 of the Uniform Sales Act requires a buyer under such circumstances to give notice within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant-buyer in the case at bar has given no notice that the equipment sold will not deliver up to 1136 kilowatts; on the contrary, in fact, it gave a receipt that the equipment had been installed and was op-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>rating \u201cin a satisfactory manner\u201d. A epresentative number of cases in support if the Sales Act to the effect that a buyer lust notify the seller within a reasonable ime of functional deficiency are set forth n the margin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The purpose of \u00a7 49 of he Sales Act is quite apparent; it is to irevent the buyer from raising belated :laims when he is faced with suit by the \u00a1eller for a purchase price that has not )een paid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The ratio behind the legisation and its cases is that since it would be lifficult to determine the validity of the buyer\u2019s defense against the purchase price &gt;r its counterclaim for damages at a late late, it seems reasonable to require prompt iction on the part of the buyer, especially when there is every expectation that prompt action would normally follow an irticulation of dissatisfaction by buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Of course, what constitutes a reasonable time generally depends \u2014 as it does in the law in all \u201creasonable time\u201d situations \u2014 upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Looking at the circumstances creating the particular situation here it appears thirteen months elapsed between the date of acceptance (June 19, 1948) of the installation and operation o'f the equipment and defendant\u2019s answer alleging the breach of warranty (July 20, 1949) and its affirmative counterclaim for substantial damages. There is no averment by affidavit or otherwise which shows plaintiff ever received following the written acceptance of the equipment any notice of breach of warranty as now found in the answering pleadings. A buyer who accepts goods then seeks a remedy for breach of warranty must plead and prove he gave the required notice within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I think it clear, as a matter of law, defendant did not, in the case at bar, act within a reasonable time; and consequently no useful purpose would be served by testimony on this particular question. In making this ruling I may and have assumed that defendant\u2019s acceptance letter is not relevant against defendant; and I have also assumed that plaintiff\u2019s employee did make material representations to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s motions 'for summary judgment will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Memorandum for Order</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">This suit was submitted by the parties to the court for determination on plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Extensive briefs were filed and, after consideration of the documentary record before it, the court filed its memorandum opinion on October 25, 1950, in which it held that summary judgment should be awarded plaintiff and against defendant. Before judgment was actually entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor, defendant filed its motion to amend its answer and counterclaim. The effect of the proposed amendments was to introduce a new theory of defense with a concomitant new theory of recoverable damages by defendant on its proposed amended counterclaim. While the present motion is not to amend after judgment entered (due to the fortuitous circumstance here that formal judgment was not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>in fact, entered after the filing of the court\u2019s memorandum opinion in plaintiff\u2019s favor) nevertheless, the effect of the proposed amendments is to reopen the case and relitigate the question of defendant\u2019s liability. True, Rule 15, Fed.Rules Civ. Proc. 28 U.S.C.A., provides that \u201cleave shall be freely given (to amend) when justice so requires\u201d and courts, in general, have shown a \u201cstrong liberality in allowing amendments under Rule 15(a);\u201d nevertheless, the action of a court permitting such amendments is based on the court\u2019s discretion and this cannot be an unbridled discretion. The parties in the case at bar in forming the proposed issues submitted the case for decision on the theory of a buyer-seller contract with a resultant breach of warranty on plaintiff\u2019s part and in defendant\u2019s favor in connection with the sale of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The case was taken under advisement, studied, and decided, i. e., that judgment should be for plaintiff for the payment of the purchase price of the goods by defendant. The concept, of \u201cnegligence\u201d on plaintiff\u2019s part was nowhere in the record, hinted at or suggested. Now, after losing its case defendant shifts its position and proposes amendments alleging an action sounding in tort, bottomed on a charge -of negligent conduct on the part of plaintiff. An amendment to an answer which adds a new defense is not allowed when the defense itself would be insufficient. Canister Co., Inc. v. National Can Corp., D.C.Del., 6 F.R.D. 613; and see 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (2d ed.) 834. The theory of the court\u2019s memorandum opinion awarding judgment to plaintiff and filed herein on October 25, 1950, was that plaintiff by its contract with defendant had limited and eliminated its liability in connection with the sale of the goods in suit. This limitation is broad enough to cover any negligence in performing its obligations under that contract. For a discussion of this lack of dual liability in a contract for the sale of goods where the parties have so stipulated, see Judge Kirkpatrick in Charles Lackman Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., D.C., 79 F.Supp. 206. This would appear to be sound law, otherwise in a contract for the sale of goods a defendant might successively and by way of defense repeatedly seek several bites at the legal apple; for example, first defending in a suit 'for the purchase price on an alleged breach of the contract itself, on an alleged breach of warranty, and after failure at both switch to some alleged negligence on the part of plaintiff in the performance of its obligations under the contract. In the case at bar, the contract is comprehensive enough, it seems to me, to exclude the liability which is now sought to be imposed upon plaintiff by defendant\u2019s proposed amendments to its answer and its counterclaim, after it has been already decided that plaintiff should have judgment on its motion for summary judgment for the purchase price of the goods sold to defendant. Accordingly, the proposed amendments should be denied and an appropriate order submitted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\">. The counterclaim demands repayment of $48,819.00 on account of the purchase price; freight and unloading charges of $2,178.75; $38,856.60 spent in the erection of foundations for installing the equipment; and $18,000.00 estimated expense defendant will incur in removing the equipment bought by defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-12\">.

The matter, however, is academic because each of the States mentioned has a Uniform Sales Act. Illinois, Laws 1915, p. 604, Smith-Hurd Ann.

By the same rule, where the written agreement specifically excludes and negatives implied warranties, parol evidence is not admissible to establish an implied warranty, and to vary or contradict the express terms of the written agreement. While implied warranties may be proved by parol evidence, yet if the parol evidence seeks to establish an implied warranty, specifically negatived and excluded by the express terms of the written agreement, it should be excluded under the parol evidence rule as inadmissible and incompetent to vary or contradict the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ierais of the written agreement.
