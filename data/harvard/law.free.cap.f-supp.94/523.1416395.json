Bailey, is the duly elected and qualified Governor of the State of Mississippi as provided in Chapter 8 of Title 17 of the Mississippi Code of 1942, as amended, charged with the duties therein defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">That the sole activities of the plaintiff in the State of Mississippi during the years mentioned consisted of the solicitation of orders for outright sale of all kinds of seeds to various retail merchants and dealers throughout the State of Mississippi, said seed having been sold under repurchase agreements disclosed in the record in the case. That the traveling representative of the plaintiff solicited orders in the State of Mississippi from merchants and dealers in the State, which orders were signed upon blanks shown in the record. That all such orders were taken subject to acceptance or rejection by the plaintiff and if accepted, the seed ordered would be shipped in interstate commerce into the State of Mississippi to the merchant purchasing the same. That the plaintiff did not enter into any contract in the state of Mississippi, providing for sale and delivery of seed other than in the manner above stated and that said contracts of sale and repurchases embodied the entire agreement between the plaintiff and its customers. That under and by virtue of said contracts, title to said seed with full and complete right of dominion passed to the purchasers and each of them, free from any control on the part of the plaintiff. That the purchasers thereof and each of them had the right to make any disposition of said seed which they saw fit, to sell the same at any price, place, terms, or conditions that they saw fit and that the plaintiff was only obligated to repurchase from its respective customers any of said seed remaining on hand in good condition in 'accordance with the provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">That the defendants are insisting that plaintiff comply with Chapter 245 of the Mississippi Laws of 1944, and on or about March 18, 1946, threatened to seize all seed shipped into the State by plaintiff on the sole ground that plaintiff had not complied with Chapter 245 of the Mississippi Laws of 1944 and particularly \u00a7 2 thereof; that the plaintiff has consistently refused to recognize any application of Chapter 245 of the Mississippi Laws of 1944 and particularly \u00a7 2 thereof to its interstate business conducted as aforesaid and has refused and declined to comply therewith; that the plaintiff has established a valuable good will among merchants and dealers of the State of Mississippi which will be substantially destroyed if the defendants seize all seed purchased by Mississippi merchants from plaintiff; that all shipments made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>plaintiff constitute shipments in interstate commerce, and the plaintiff is not doing \"business within the State of Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The Court being of the opinion that all shipments of seed into the State of Mississippi by plaintiff constitute shipments in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Federal Seed Act of August 9, 1939, 53 Stat. 1275, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1551-1610 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture for the enforcement thereof; Ferry-Morse Seed Company et al. v.
