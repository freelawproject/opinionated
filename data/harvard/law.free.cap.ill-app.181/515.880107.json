August 15, 1907, O. H. Yollmer gave to Richards, plaintiff in this suit, Ms promissory note for $25 and a power of attorney authorizing the persons therein named, or any one of them, when Yollmer was indebted to Richards, to make an assignment and transfer of his wages to Richards as collateral security for such indebtedness. Yollmer was employed by the defendant corporation in March, 1910. August 15, 1910, $13.50 was due on the note, Yollmer was still employed by the defendant, and Davis, one of the persons named in the power of attorney, professing to act under it, in the name of Yollmer made an assignment to Richards of his wages due or to become due from the defendant. Richards then brought suit in the Municipal Court against the defendant corporation, claiming that there was due to Yollmer from the defendant twenty-eight weeks\u2019 wages at $25 per week, and stating in his statement of claim that he was the \u201cactual bona fide owner of said wages,\u201d and in the affidavit of claim that there was due to plaintiff $200. The court found that Vollmer owed Richards $13.25 principal and $6.25 attorney\u2019s fees, as provided in the note, and gave judgment for the plaintiff for $19.50.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-4\" pgmap=\"542\">William A.

Hill, 170 Ill. App. 323, and we held that an assignment of wages, so far as it purported to assign wages to be earned in the future from employers with whom the assignor had no contract of employment at the time of making the assignment, was void and of no effect, and that as the assignor could not make a valid assignment of wages from employers with whom he had no contract of employment, he could not then authorize or empower another to do so. Under the rule announced in that case the assignment by Davis of the wages due Vollmer from the defendant was void because at the time the power of attorney was executed by Vollmer he had no contract of employment with the defendant. On further consideration we see no reason to question the propriety of the conclusion reached in the Stromberg case, supra, and it follows that, in our opinion, the judgment is erroneous and should be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b542-8\" pgmap=\"542\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
