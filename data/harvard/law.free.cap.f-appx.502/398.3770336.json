California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Reyes-Mendoza has not filed a response and has been removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">Following this court\u2019s prior opinion in <em>United States v. Reyes-Mendoza, </em>665 F.3d 165 (5th Cir.2011), and the district court\u2019s resentencing of Reyes-Mendoza on remand, the only issue properly before this court is the validity of Reyes-Mendoza\u2019s sentence. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1329 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Burroughs v. FFP Operating Partners, </em>70 F.3d 31, 33 (5th Cir.1995). However, because Reyes-Mendoza has been removed, any appeal from his sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that this court must raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the issue of mootness sua sponte when necessary because it is a threshold issue and implicates Article III jurisdiction). Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED as moot, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
