Ms. Johnson appeals that sentence, arguing that it is unreasonable and that the district court, by failing to hear her arguments in mitigation, violated her due process rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">Ms. Johnson, who at the revocation hearing chose not to contest the alleged violations, does not take issue with the revocation of supervised release itself. Instead, she contends that her sentence is unreasonable because it is above the 4-to-10-month guidelines range. She argues that the district court failed to consider both the guidelines range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not give appropriate weight to her mitigation evidence, and never identified the criminal classifications for her violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">We have explained that where \u201ca defendant [has] violated a condition of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>vised release, the district court may revoke the term of supervision and impose a term of imprisonment after considering\u201d the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007). Once the district court has made its sentencing decision, we review it \u201conly for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). We \u201cfirst ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to consider the guidelines range or the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). But because the guidelines are, and have always been, advisory \u201cfor sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, it is sufficient that there be some indication that the district court was aware of and considered\u201d the sentencing range they establish. <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Once we are satisfied that a sentence is procedurally sound, we then weigh its \u201csubstantive reasonableness,\u201d taking into account the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Ms. Johnson\u2019s sentence, despite being 14 months above the top end of the advisory guidelines, is reasonable. Although Ms. Johnson argues that the district court failed to consider the guidelines range, the record does not support such a conclusion. The district court certainly knew the suggested range, at one point even prompting Ms. Johnson\u2019s counsel to correct himself when he misstated it as 4 to 6 months. The court simply found the range inadequate, as Ms. Johnson had committed \u201cnew, serious criminal conduct\u201d that was \u201cbasically the same\u201d as the criminal conduct underlying her original conviction. As a result, the court found that \u201ca sentence of 24 months is really minimal in terms of deterring future ... misconduct.\u201d Put simply, the court decided \u201cto give a sentence that\u2019s above the advisory guideline\u201d because it most \u201cadequately reflect[ed] the seriousness of the offense\u201d and was most \u201cappropriate in light of [Ms. JohnsonJ\u2019s characteristics of continuing fraudulent conduct.\u201d There is nothing unreasonable about that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence makes clear that, in addition to knowing and considering the guidelines range, it knew and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court used language taken directly from \u00a7 3553(a) in its explanation, and, before giving that explanation, the court indicated that it would recite the \u00a7 3553(a) factors despite not knowing whether it was \u201crequired to state [them] at a revocation hearing or not.\u201d Similarly, the record shows that the district court knew the criminal classification of Ms. Johnson\u2019s violations: Ms. Johnson\u2019s counsel brought them to the court\u2019s attention several times, and those classifications formed the basis for the applicable advisory guidelines range, which the court knew and considered despite deciding to vary above it.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Ms. Johnson\u2019s final procedural concern \u2014 that the district court failed to give appropriate weight to her mitigation evidence \u2014 also fails. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). There is no question that the district court heard Ms. Johnson\u2019s potentially mitigating evidence regarding her continuing education, hard work and achievements at her legitimate job, minimal criminal history, and mostly compliant conduct during supervised release. When sentencing Ms. Johnson, the court was within its authority to give less weight to these characteristics than it gave to the new criminal conduct and \u201cbreach of trust\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>that led to her supervised release being revoked. The district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so. Nor, as Ms. Johnson suggests, did the court err in referring to only the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that supported the 24-month sentence. \u201c[NJothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Ms. Johnson\u2019s sentence is proeedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The sentence is also substantively reasonable. First, although the sentence is 14 months above the maximum suggested by the guidelines, it is 12 months below the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (authorizing a prison term of up to 3 years for class B felonies). The court could have varied upward even more but \u2014 consistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) directive to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d \u2014 decided to give Ms. Johnson the lowest sentence it found would \u201cdeter[ ] future ... misconduct.\u201d Second, Ms. Johnson did not contest that, in violation of the terms of her supervised release, she misled her probation officer about her address, her contact with a felon, and the status of her monthly restitution payments. Ms. Johnson also did not contest that she moved without informing her probation officer, failed to pay restitution, and committed new criminal conduct. At the hearing, the district court learned that Ms. Johnson\u2019s new criminal conduct included being in possession of seven fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses bearing her picture but other people\u2019s names and license numbers. It also included suspicious monetary transactions very much like those leading to her original conviction. Based on what it heard, the court found that Ms. Johnson had gotten involved with \u201ca serious type of criminal affair.\u201d Weighing that damaging evidence along with the favorable information Ms. Johnson presented, the court decided that an above-guidelines sentence was most appropriate. We conclude, given the totality of the circumstances, that the 24-month sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Ms. Johnson also argues that the district court violated her due process rights by interrupting her counsel during his mitigation arguments and by failing to consider those arguments. We disagree. It is of course true that \u201c[djefendants involved in revocation proceedings are entitled to certain minimal due process requirements,\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 114 (11th Cir.1994), among them \u201can opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation,\u201d <em>United States v. Carruth, </em>528 F.3d 845, 846 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). But the record reveals that the district court gave both Ms. Johnson and her counsel ample time to present their case. When the court addressed Ms. Johnson\u2019s counsel \u2014 who in the name of mitigation was attempting to disprove the truth of the alleged supervised release violations \u2014 it was merely trying to clarify whether Ms. Johnson had changed her mind about contesting violations that she had earlier agreed not to contest. Questioning counsel to clear up confusion is not a due-process violation. Furthermore, the court\u2019s comments demonstrate that it heard and considered the mitigation arguments. It just found them unpersuasive. This was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Ms. Johnson\u2019s 24-month sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
