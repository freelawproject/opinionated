Although Lewis essentially challenged his underlying tax debt and the resulting liens, he brought claims pursuant to general jurisdiction statutes and admiralty laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 separate motions to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, where (1) New York and Florida were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment; (2) the United States was immune under general rules of sovereign immunity; (3) Lewis\u2019s true recourse, if any, was in the United States Tax Court; and (4) his complaint was patently frivolous. Additionally, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, where any amendment to the complaint would not have cured the lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a fatal deficiency. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
