He contends that <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), gave the district court authority to resen-tence him, and that his sentence was based on the crack cocaine guidelines rather than his designation as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-21\">A defendant may file a motion to modify a term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review a decision to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, and legal interpretations <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-22\">Amendment 750 revised the crack cocaine quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which amended certain statutory minimum sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750 (effective Nov. 1, 2011). A subsequent amendment made Amendment 750 retroactive, permitting sentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 759. However, a reduction is inappropriate if an offender was originally sentenced as a career of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>fender. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). We have held that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule <em>Moore </em>because <em>Freeman </em>did not address defendants who were sentenced as career offenders. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-1321 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The PSI assigned Johnson a guidelines range based on a career offender enhancement. The district court explicitly adopted the PSI in full during Johnson\u2019s sentencing hearing. The district court adopted a guidelines range based on the career offender enhancement, and departed downward from the career offender range based on Johnson\u2019s criminal history. Accordingly, the sentence was not based on the guidelines range for crack cocaine, and Johnson was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Johnson\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
