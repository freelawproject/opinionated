The district court sentenced Brown to a total of 624 months. This court later overturned Brown\u2019s convictions on both firearms counts, upheld the remaining convictions, and remanded the case to the district court for a new trial on one of the firearms counts. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>102 F.3d 1390, 1400 (5th Cir.1996). The Government filed a motion to dismiss the firearms counts, and the district court granted it; the district court issued an amended judgment reflecting Brown\u2019s new total sentence of 324 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-22\">In 2011, Brown moved pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a sentence reduction based on an amendment to the crack cocaine guidelines (Amendment 750). The district court denied Brown\u2019s motion, and Brown now appeals that denial. He argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce a sentence after .considering the applicable factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the applicable guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Our review of the record reveals that in denying Brown\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, guideline policy statements, and Brown\u2019s self-improvement achievements. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10; \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Brown has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Brown also argues that his sentence is in excess of the statutory maximum because the district court did not find a specific quantity of drugs and was therefore limited to a statutory maximum of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not \u201cplenary resentencing proceedings\u201d but rather, are \u201ca narrow exception to the rule of finality\u201d of judgments and \u201cdo not implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Even if this court had jurisdiction to consider this claim, the claim would fail; Brown was convicted by a jury of possessing with the intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, an offense that supports the statutory maximum sentence of 40 years under the Fair Sentencing Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii) (2011). Brown\u2019s sentence of 324 months is not in excess of the statutory maximum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Brown\u2019s request for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
