He also moves this court for appointment of counsel. By moving for IFP status here, Foster is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">This case arose from an incident a few days after Foster absconded from a Mississippi restitution center to which he had been sentenced and went to the home of his former girlfriend where he was unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>to speak to her. Her house then allegedly burned down and her van stolen; a report was made regarding Foster, who had made previous threats against her home. As a result, the authorities were on the lookout for Foster. The day of the incident, they located him, and he led them on a chase, culminating in a lengthy standoff wherein Foster \u2014 who was armed with a weapon \u2014 demanded to see his former girlfriend and resisted continuous commands to throw his weapon on the ground. Foster was ultimately shot in the leg and thereafter arrested without further incident. He brought this action making various claims against certain law enforcement officials and the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). All reasonable inferences are drawn in the light most beneficial to the nonmoving party, but conclusional allegations and unsubstantiated contentions may not be relied on as evidence by the nonmoving party. <em>Duffie v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u201cAlthough we review evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we assign greater weight, even at the summary judgment stage, to the facts evident from video recordings taken at the scene.\u201d <em>Carnaby v. City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cA court of appeals need not rely on the plaintiffs description of the facts where the record discredits that description but should instead consider \u2018the facts in the light depicted by the videotape.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 381, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Turning to Foster\u2019s arguments, he challenges the grant of summary judgment on his claim that he was not read his constitutional rights, as required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). However, regardless of whether any officers were required to advise Foster of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, this claim does not amount to a cognizable constitutional violation under \u00a7 1983, because there is no allegation that Foster made a statement that implicated his constitutional right to protection against self-incrimination. <em>See Collier v. Montgomery, </em>569 F.3d 214, 219 (5th Cir.2009). Violations of the prophylactic <em>Miranda </em>procedures do not amount to violations of the Constitution itself and, as such, fail to raise a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. <em>Chavez v. Martinez, </em>538 U.S. 760, 772, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Foster next challenges the grant of summary judgment on his claim that Deputy Banks, by shooting him in the leg during the final stage of the standoff incident, used force that was clearly excessive and objectively unreasonable, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The crux of Foster\u2019s argument is that this claim should have proceeded to a jury because he did not have the pellet gun in his hands when Deputy Banks shot him in the leg; the videotape of the standoff situation is partially obstructed and does not show his hands in the moments immediately preceding and following the shooting; and there is no conceivable way that Trooper Tony Dunn could have kicked the gun across the road without the ground being in disarray. However, as the district court explained, the audio and visual portions of the videotape of the incident demonstrate that Foster\u2019s version of the events is a \u201cvisible fiction.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 381, 127 S.Ct. 1769.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The videotape demonstrates that there can be no genuine dispute that, at the time Deputy Banks shot him, Foster was armed with a firearm, was facing the officers, appeared to be emotionally unstable and suicidal, and had repeatedly refused to comply with any of the officer\u2019s demands, including the urgent requests that he throw the weapon down. Ordinarily, a district court would view disputed evidence in favor of the non-movant \u2014 here, Foster. However, the Supreme Court has identified a \u201cwrinkle\u201d in that approach \u2014 \u201cexistence in the record of a videotape capturing the events in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 127 S.Ct. 1769. Where, as here, Foster\u2019s claim contradicts the videotape, the videotape controls (in the absence of credible evidence of doctoring or the like). <em>Id. </em>at 379-81, 127 S.Ct. 1769. Viewing the videotape of Deputy Banks\u2019s actions from the perspective of a reasonable officer, <em>see Graham, v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989), the district court correctly concluded that Deputy Banks\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See id.; Ramirez v. Knoulton, </em>542 F.3d 124 (5th Cir.2008). Further, because Foster has not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact concerning the existence of a constitutional violation, we need not address the issues of Sheriff Carver\u2019s or the County\u2019s liability. <em>See, e.g., Hill v. Carroll Cnty., Miss., </em>587 F.3d 230, 238 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The remainder of Foster\u2019s arguments in his IFP motion do not alter the conclusion that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. First, Foster complains of the district court\u2019s denial, without prejudice, of an amended complaint that he attempted to file; however, he does not allege, and the record does not reflect, that he subsequently sought leave to file an amended complaint, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that such a motion was improperly denied. He next takes issue with the denial of a purported motion to compel a deputy\u2019s statement; yet, no such motion appears in the record. Moreover, as the nonmoving party, Foster cannot defeat summary judgment with speculation (here, what a deputy \u201cmight\u201d have said). <em>See TIG Ins. Co. v. Sedgwick James of Wash., </em>276 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir.2002). In addition, Foster\u2019s conclusional allegation of a conspiracy between persons not parties to this action and not present during the standoff is irrelevant to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the instant \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Foster also complains about the district court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, despite his having timely mailed his objections. Foster\u2019s contentions, at best, amount to an argument that the district court erred by not engaging in a de novo review of those portions of the magistrate judge\u2019s report to which he may have timely objected. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1). Nevertheless, considering the above discussion that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the \u00a7 1983 claims, Foster can show no prejudice from the failure to consider any objections he attempted to file because the grant of summary judgment was correct. <em>See Kreimerman v. Casa Veerkamp, S.A. de C.V., </em>22 F.3d 634, 646 (5th Cir.1994). Also without merit is Foster\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s having counted the instant \u00a7 1983 action as a strike. The district court\u2019s order expressly indicates that the action counted as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) because it was being dismissed as frivolous, not, as Foster suggests, because of any failure to satisfy an exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Foster has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that Foster\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith is incorrect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Foster\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. His motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Foster\u2019s appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, and it is DISMISSED, <em>see Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24. 5th CiR. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Foster\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Foster is WARNED that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The district court\u2019s certification decision adopted and incorporated the magistrate judge's report and recommendation on the motion for summary judgment as its reasons for its ruling.
