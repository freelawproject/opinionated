On appeal, Townsend argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion without holding an eviden-tiary hearing after she presented evidence of \u201cextrinsic contact\u201d between a juror and a witness. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the denial of Townsend\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">A federal grand jury issued a four-count superceding indictment, charging Townsend with (1) knowingly and corruptly accepting a thing of value, as an agent of a local government in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B); (2) acting as an accessory after the fact, knowing that a crime against the United States had been committed in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3; (3) obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(1); and (4) obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(2). Prior to her indictment, Townsend was a corrections officer in Miami-Dade County, and her charges arose out of her supervision of an individual who was on pretrial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">After a jury trial, on November 24, 2008, Townsend was convicted of all counts, and on May 19, 2009, the district court sentenced her to concurrent 45-month terms on each count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 24, 2008, through counsel, Townsend filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal, or alternatively, for a new trial, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support her convictions. The district court denied the motion. She appealed her convictions, again challenging, among other things, the sufficiency of the evidence to support her convictions, and on January 13, 2011, we affirmed her convictions. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number><em>United States v. Townsend, </em>630 F.3d 1003, 1009-15 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2472, 179 L.Ed.2d 1233 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">On September 7, 2011, Townsend filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for New Trial[,] Motion for Appointment of Counsel[,] Motion for Evidentiary HearingU Motion for Posh-Trial Juror Contact and Subpoena of Juror.\u201d Her motion was based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence of juror misconduct/jury tampering\u201d in violation of her right to an impartial jury. Specifically, after the guilty verdict, DeAngelus Gibson, a defense witness, admitted to \u201chaving discussed the case with a juror during deliberations.\u201d Specifically, Gibson told Townsend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">I thought for sure you would be found innocent because I talked with one of the jurors about the case \u2014 the elderly black man. We were in the bathroom at the same time and he [the juror] said, \u2018Those white folks know that lady is innocent, but just want to find a black person guilty. We are kinda bored and tired and don\u2019t feel like arguing with them. We are trying to get home to prepare for Thanksgiving.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Gibson did not indicate how this conversation was initiated or provide information regarding any statements that Gibson made during the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Townsend argued that an evidentiary hearing was required to establish \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d before the district court. Further, the extrajudicial contact between a witness and a juror, during deliberations, denied Townsend a fair and impartial verdict. Specifically, the witness and the juror had an improper discussion about the case, which shows \u201cjuror misconduct\u201d because the juror violated a court order by deliberating with a non juror. Additionally, Gibson may have tried to influence the jury verdict to Townsend\u2019s detriment. The juror\u2019s statements to Gibson also raised the issue of racial prejudice of other jurors, and showed that the other jurors were considering \u201cthe outside influence of a holiday to bring about a speedy verdict.\u201d Gibson, as Townsend\u2019s \u201cfriend,\u201d may have \u201cadvocated on [ Jbehalf of [Townsend] and caused her to be found guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">In support of her motion, Townsend submitted a signed affidavit, reasserting her claims and restating the juror\u2019s alleged statements to Gibson.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">The district court denied Townsend\u2019s motion for a new trial as well as her requests for appointment of counsel, an evidentiary hearing, and a subpoena of the juror. The district court found that Townsend\u2019s affidavit clearly indicated that she knew of the alleged juror misconduct for almost three years before seeking a new trial. Thus, Townsend was unable to establish that the information in her motion was \u201cnew or newly discovered.\u201d According to Townsend\u2019s affidavit, she learned of the alleged misconduct \u201caround November 2008,\u201d but she failed to mention the misconduct in her December 2008 motion for a new trial or in her direct appeal. Instead, Townsend waited almost three years to file a motion for a new trial based on evidence that was \u201cnot new or newly discovered.\u201d Finally, although Townsend alleged juror misconduct, she did not submit an affidavit from any witness to support her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct and the denial of an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Siegelman, </em>640 F.3d 1159, 1181 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2711, 183 L.Ed.2d 84 (2012); <em>United States v. Massey, </em>89 F.3d 1433, 1443 (11th Cir.1996). A motion for new trial based on juror misconduct is a form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>of a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1351 (11th Cir.1997). We may affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 288, 184 L.Ed.2d 169 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Rule 33 provides that \u201cthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.CrimJP. 33(a). A motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence must be filed within three years after the verdict or finding of guilt. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). However, \u201c[mjotions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence are highly disfavored in the Eleventh Circuit and should be granted only with great caution. Indeed, the defendant bears the burden of justifying a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1151 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">With respect to new-trial motions based on juror misconduct during deliberations, the Supreme Court has recognized \u201ca near-universal and firmly established common-law rule <em>flatly prohibiting </em>the use of juror testimony to impeach a verdict.\u201d <em>Siegelman, </em>640 F.3d at 1185. Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) codifies this longstanding common law rule. <em>Tanner v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 107, 121, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 2748, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987). In its codified form, the rule generally provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury\u2019s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror\u2019s or another juror\u2019s vote; or any juror\u2019s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror\u2019s affidavit or evidence of a juror\u2019s statement on these matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)(1). However, Rule 606(b)(2) provides exceptions to this rule, stating that a juror may testify about whether: (1) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention; (2) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or (3) a mistake was made on the verdict form. Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Further, the district court has the discretion to decide a motion for a new trial without a hearing. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 994 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he acumen gained by a trial judge over the course of the proceedings\u201d makes the same judge \u201cwell qualified\u201d to rule on a motion for a new trial based on new evidence without an evidentiary hearing.). In <em>United States v. Slocum, </em>708 F.2d 587 (11th Cir.1983), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-12\">[W]e find ourselves in agreement with the decision on the merits of the new trial motion and where the defendants failed to file even an affidavit by [ ] the person whose post-trial statement clearly came the closest to requiring a new trial, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion without an evidentiary hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 600. \u201cNo per se rule requires the trial court to investigate the internal workings of the jury\u201d after an allegation of juror misconduct, and the \u201cmore speculative or unsubstantiated the allegation of misconduct, the less the burden to investigate.\u201d <em>United States v. Cuthel, </em>903 F.2d 1381, 1382-83 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">As an initial matter, although Townsend requests counsel in her appeal brief, she did not file a separate motion for appointment of appellate counsel and her brief does not provide any supporting arguments to justify appointment of counsel. As such, she appears to have abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>her request for counsel. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>684 F.3d 1045, 1064 n. 28 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that an issue was abandoned where the appellant failed to develop any argument on the issue in the initial appeal brief). Regardless, because Townsend suggests that counsel is necessary to investigate an \u201cineffective assistance\u201d claim, her request for counsel does not appear to be relevant to the instant appeal of the denial of her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In light of the \u201chighly disfavored\u201d nature of new-trial motions based on newly discovered evidence, <em>see Campa, </em>459 F.3d at 1151, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Townsend\u2019s Rule 33 motion. As noted by the district court, Townsend\u2019s affidavit suggests that she discovered the allegedly new evidence \u2014 the juror\u2019s statements to Gibson \u2014 immediately after the jury verdict was issued in November 2008. However, she waited nearly three years until September 2011 to file the instant Rule 33 motion, and she provides no explanation for why she did not assert her juror misconduct claim in her December 2008 motion for a new trial or on direct appeal. Nevertheless, her instant motion was timely filed within three years of the jury verdict, and her motion was based on information that she claimed to have discovered after the conclusion of trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Regardless, we may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>see Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975, and here, the record established that Townsend\u2019s motion for a new trial was meritless. Specifically, Townsend did not substantiate her claims in the district court by submitting an affidavit from Gibson. Further, although she sought to subpoena the juror involved, the juror\u2019s testimony regarding internal jury deliberations or the potential \u201cmental processes\u201d and motivations of other jurors would have been inadmissible to impeach the verdict under Rule 606(b)(1). <em>See Siegelman, </em>640 F.3d at 1185; Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)(1). Moreover, no exception to the general rule prohibiting juror testimony applied to Townsend\u2019s accusations because she did not identify any evidence suggesting that the jury was exposed to extraneous prejudicial information or that an improper outside influence impacted the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)(2). Instead, according to Townsend, the juror\u2019s statements to Gibson related to racial bias of other jurors, and the impact of fatigue and an upcoming holiday on jury deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">On appeal, Townsend suggests that Gibson may have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict through his contact with the juror, and that Townsend had established a case of \u201cjury tampering.\u201d However, in her motion for a new trial, Townsend conceded that Gibson did not specify how the conversation between Gibson and the juror was initiated, and Gibson did not claim to have made any statements that could have influenced the juror. Notably, Gibson was a defense witness and Townsend\u2019s \u201cfriend,\u201d which suggests that Gibson would have been unlikely to make statements to a juror that prejudiced Townsend. In sum, Townsend\u2019s claim that Gibson\u2019s \u201cextrinsic contact\u201d with a juror may have improperly influenced the verdict or prejudiced Townsend was speculative and unsupported by any evidence, and as such, Townsend failed to meet her burden of justifying a new trial. <em>See Campa, </em>459 F.3d at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Townsend\u2019s Rule 33 motion without a hearing because she did not submit an affidavit from Gibson, whose post-trial statements provided the basis for her motion. <em>See Slocum, </em>708 F.2d at 600. Moreover, because the same judge presided over both Townsend\u2019s trial and her Rule 33 motion, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>was \u201cwell qualified\u201d to rule on the motion without a hearing. <em>See Schlei, </em>122 F.3d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Townsend\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-11\">.
