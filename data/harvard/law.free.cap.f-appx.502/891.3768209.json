Specifically, Miller alleged that Roche violated \u00a7 207(r)(l) because it did not give her a time and place to express breast milk and that Roche violated \u00a7 215(a)(3) when it terminated her employment after she asked for a time and place to do so. The case went to trial before a jury. After Miller\u2019s testimony, the district court granted Roche\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, concluding that there was not a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury to find that Roche violated either FLSA provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">On appeal, Miller argues that the district court erred in granting Roche\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. After careful review, we conclude that the district court properly entered its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, applying the same legal standard as the district court. <em>See Pickett v. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., </em>420 F.3d 1272, 1278 (11th Cir.2005). Under Rule 50, a court should grant a motion for judgment of law if \u201cthe court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 50; <em>see Pickett, </em>420 F.3d at 1278. A court should deny such a motion when \u201creasonable and fair-minded persons in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.\u201d <em>Christopher v. Florida, </em>449 F.3d 1360, 1364 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Walker v. NationsBank of Florida N.A., </em>53 F.3d 1548, 1555 (11th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">We review all evidence in the record and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 149-50, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2110, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). \u201cCredibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Section 207(r)(l) requires that an employer provide a reasonable break time and a private place, other than a bathroom, for an employee to express breast milk. \u00a7 207(r)(l). While working for Roche, Miller was free to take breaks as needed. Her breaks were neither counted nor timed, and she was never criticized for taking a break. Miller was also given a one-hour lunch break. Miller testified that she received the necessary breaks to express breast milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Miller also had access to a private place. Vacant, nearby offices were available to Miller as a private location to express breast milk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Miller preferred to use her office. To facilitate this use of her office, she taped folders to her office window for privacy. She did this without informing anyone at Roche that she would be expressing breast milk in her office and she did not ask for a different location. Because Miller testified that she was given the necessary breaks for this purpose and she had access to a private place to do so, the district court correctly concluded that the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Roche violated \u00a7 207(r)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Miller also argues that the district court erred in concluding that no damages were available to her for the alleged \u00a7 207(r)(l) violation. But because Roche did not violate this provision, we need not decide the issue of damages. <em>See </em>\u00a7 216(b) (stating that an \u201cemployer <em>who violates </em>the provisions of ... section 207 of this title shall be liable\u201d for damages to the employee) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">Section 215(a)(3) provides in relevant part that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person ... to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint.\u201d \u00a7 215(a)(3). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FLSA, Miller must show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered adverse action by her employer; and (3) this adverse action occurred as a consequence of her protected activity. <em>Wolf v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>200 F.3d 1337, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2000). Filing a complaint is statutorily protected activity. <em>Fasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., </em>-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1325, 1330-31, 179 L.Ed.2d 379 (2011). On appeal, Miller ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>gues that she filed a complaint within the meaning of \u00a7 215(a)(3) when she emailed her supervisor to ask for a time and place to express breast milk. Roche contests this, asserting that this email request does not constitute the filing of a complaint under \u00a7 215(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Although the filing of a complaint under \u00a7 215(a)(3) need not be in the form of an official complaint, <em>see E.E.O.C. v. White &amp; Son Enters., </em>881 F.2d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.1989), or even be in writing, some degree of formality is required in order that the employer has fair notice that an employee is lodging a grievance. <em>Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1334-36. This \u201cnotice requirement\u201d is essential because \u201can employer who does not (or should not) know an employee has made a complaint could [not] discriminate <em>because </em>of that complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335-36. In keeping with this idea, the complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed so that a reasonable employer, considering the context and content, can understand that an employee is asserting rights provided by the FLSA and calling for the protection of those rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Neither the context nor content of Miller\u2019s email put Roche on notice that she was lodging a grievance. Indeed, the circumstances surrounding the email would not have informed a reasonable employer that Miller was filing a complaint. Before sending the email, Miller had never asked for, or been denied, a time or place to express breast milk. She was given breaks at her leisure without question or criticism. Miller decided to express breast milk in her office without notifying any Roche supervisors. She did not complain or ask for a different location.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Miller argues that because Roche monitored her email communications, through which she voiced her discontent with Roche, her emails to family and friends were tantamount to filing a complaint under \u00a7 215(a)(3). Specifically, Miller sent an email to a friend entitled \u201cFederal Law,\u201d which referenced \u00a7 207(r)(l). She never showed this email to anyone at Roche and neither did she tell anyone at Roche that she believed the law was violated. We reject Miller\u2019s argument that this email effectively notified Roche of her \u00a7 207(r)(l) grievance. Because Miller did not direct the statutory reference to Roche, her email would not have met the formality requirements of \u00a7 215(a)(3) so as to put Roche on notice that a complaint had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">It is also true that the content of Miller\u2019s email would not have alerted Roche to any alleged wrong. The email provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aam\">Shannon, I\u2019m scheduled tomorrow all day at the bail office, so therefore, I need to know where I can use my breast pump at and who will cover the office while I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019ll need to be able to do it at least twice while there. Please let me know. Thanks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Far from notifying Roche that a grievance had been lodged, this email does not allege or even intimate that Roche violated the law. Miller concedes that it is \u201cnot typical\u201d for requests for future compliance, instead of complaints for past violations, to be treated as complaints under \u00a7 215(a)(3). Nonetheless, to support her proposition that a prospective request is protected activity under the FLSA, Miller points to our interpretation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in <em>Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Incorporated, </em>where we concluded that a pre-eligibility request for post-eligibility maternity leave is protected activity under the FMLA. 666 F.3d 1269, 1272 (11th Cir.2012). However, our analysis in <em>Pereda </em>was based on the FMLA\u2019s provision that it is \u201cunlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right\u201d provided under the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u00a7 2615(a)(1); <em>Pereda, </em>666 F.3d at 1275. Insofar as the FLSA contains no such provision, our holding in <em>Pereda </em>gives no support to Miller\u2019s argument. <em>See </em>\u00a7 215.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Because Miller\u2019s email would not have appraised a reasonable employer that a complaint had been filed, it does not rise to the level of a complaint under \u00a7 215(a)(3). As the district court correctly observed, Miller\u2019s request for a time and place to express breast milk does not provide a legally sufficient basis for the jury to find that a complaint was filed under \u00a7 215(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">. One evening a week, Miller operated a sole proprietorship using Roche\u2019s office space. During this time, she expressed breast milk in the bathroom. At trial, Miller testified that she was working as a sole proprietor instead of a Roche employee when this happened. Now, in her reply brief, she claims that she was employed by Roche during this time. Arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are deemed waived. <em>In re Egidi, </em>571 F.3d 1156, 1163 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-17\">. Neither does Miller\u2019s reference to our sister circuits\u2019 interpretation of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), which contains a similar provision prohibiting interference with rights protected under the ADA, help her. Again, the FLSA contains no such provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
