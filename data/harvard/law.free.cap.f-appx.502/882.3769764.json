Coler, </em>674 F.Supp. 851 (S.D.Fla.1987), in which the district court prohibited the State of Florida from counting as \u201cincome\u201d unreimbursed medical expenses awarded under the Veterans Administration Improved Pension Benefits Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">In her suit, Czajkowski seeks to be appointed as a new class representative, and she seeks the district court\u2019s assistance in enforcing the permanent injunction issued in <em>Mitson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen a case for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (immigration context). A district court \u201cabuses its discretion when its equitable decision is based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding.\u201d <em>Labor/Community Strategy v. Los Angeles County Metro. Transp. Auth., </em>564 F.3d 1115, 1119-20 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Kenney v. United States, </em>458 F.3d 1025, 1032 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that there is no abuse of discretion by the district court in failing to reopen the case and in denying Czajkowski\u2019s right to intervene and enforce the permanent injunction. As the district court correctly held, <em>\u201ceven if </em>Czajkowski could be appointed class representative, she failed to establish that defendants are not in compliance with a permanent injunction issued in <em>Mitson.\" </em>[R. Vol. 4 Doc. 194 at 2.] Moreover, the district court correctly found that Czajkowski\u2019s grievances with the Department of Children and Families fell squarely outside the scope of the permanent injunction issued in <em>Mitson. </em>Because the 1987 order in <em>Mitson </em>did not address the subject of her claim, her motion to legally reopen and for a show cause order is legally insufficient. Additionally, we conclude from the record that the district court properly denied Czajkowski\u2019s motion to intervene as a representative class plaintiff because the interest she wanted to assert fell outside the scope of the 1987 order in <em>Mitson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Accordingly, because we find no merit to any of the arguments Czajkowski makes in this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders denying Czajkowski\u2019s motion to reopen the case and denying Czajkowski\u2019s motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
