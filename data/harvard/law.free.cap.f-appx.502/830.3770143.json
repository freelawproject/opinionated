(\u201cNWI\u201d), discriminated against him based on his race when it promoted a white employee, Steve Gurski, over him for the position of warehouse manager. The district court granted NWI\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Jenkins failed to show that NWI\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for promoting Gurski was a pretext for racial discrimination. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework used in circumstantial evidence cases, a plaintiff is initially required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the plaintiff does so, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Id. </em>at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. If the employer satisfies this burden of production, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to establish that the employer\u2019s articulated reason is merely pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. at 1825.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot merely recast the reason, but must \u201cmeet that reason head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc). </em>An employer\u2019s reasons may be shown to be pretext \u201cby revealing such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in [its] proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). A reason cannot be \u201cpretext <em>for discrimination </em>unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>In the context of a promotion, the plaintiff cannot show merely that he was better qualified than the person who received the position or that the employer\u2019s promotion decision was mistaken, but rather must show that the decision was motivated by race. <em>Springer, </em>509 F.3d at 1349. When the promotion decision rested on qualifications, the plaintiff must show that the disparities in qualifications were \u201cof such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Here, NWI conceded for purposes of summary judgment that Jenkins could establish his prima facie case. Thus, the burden shifted to NWI to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for promoting Gurski rather than Jenkins to the warehouse manager position, which it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Specifically, NWI submitted the deposition testimony of Joe Antico, the branch manager who made the promotion decision. Antico testified that he chose Gurski because he believed Gurski was the best fit for the position out of all the warehouse employees. Antico explained that his decision was based on his two years\u2019 experience working with the warehouse employees and his observations and feedback from others. Contrary to Jenkins\u2019s contention, this evidence was sufficient to meet NWI\u2019s burden. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024 (explaining that the employer \u201cneed not persuade the court that its proffered reasons are legitmate\u201d because the \u201cemployer\u2019s burden is merely one of production\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Moreover, the district court did not err in concluding that Jenkins failed to present evidence from which a jury could conclude that NWI\u2019s reason \u2014 that Gurski was the best fit for the position \u2014 was a pretext for racial discrimination. At the outset, we note that the district court struck Jenkins\u2019s untimely response to NWI\u2019s summary judgment motion and limited its review to the evidence submitted by NWI in support of its motion. Jenkins does not challenge this ruling on appeal and agrees that our review is limited to NWI\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">According to NWI\u2019s undisputed evidence, Antico had worked at NWI as an account manager for two years when he was moved to the branch manager position as part of a company-wide reorganization. While working as an account manager, Antico had learned of coordination and communication problems between the customer service representatives and the warehouse personnel that affected NWI\u2019s customers. Antico believed these problems were caused by a lack of leadership in the warehouse. After becoming the branch manager, Antico decided to create a warehouse manager position to act as a bridge between the employees in the warehouse and the customer service representatives in the office. The warehouse manager would \u201chelp schedule deliveries and pickups in a way that would service the customers, be most efficient and be clearly communicated to all parties involved.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Antico considered all of the warehouse employees for the new position. During Antico\u2019s two years as an account manager, he was able to observe the warehouse employees regularly and also received feedback from customers, the customer service representatives and other warehouse workers about each employee\u2019s performance. In addition, Antico had worked with Gurski for five years at NWI\u2019s competitor and was very familiar with the quality of Gurski\u2019s work because of that long-term working relationship. However, Antico explained that, because NWI was a small, integrated company, he had sufficient opportunity to develop knowledge of both Jenkins\u2019s and Gurski\u2019s work. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>this knowledge, Antieo decided that Gur-ski, who had both customer service representative and warehouse experience, would be the best fit for the new warehouse manager position. Antieo then approached Gurski to see if he would accept the position, and Gurski indicated that he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Although Jenkins alleged that he was more qualified than Gurski, there is no evidence in the record to support this claim. In his deposition, Jenkins admitted that he did not know how his experience and qualifications compared to Gurski\u2019s. Thus, Jenkins did not show that he was more qualified than Gurski, much less that he was so much more qualified that no reasonable person would have chosen Gur-ski over him. <em>See Springer, </em>509 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In addition, Jenkins himself offered two reasons for why he was not promoted that were unrelated to his race. Jenkins testified that he believed he was not promoted because Antieo and Gurski were friends who had worked together before and had played hockey together and because Jenkins had reported an unfair practice (employees taking NWI\u2019s truck home) to corporate officials. Accordingly, nothing in the record suggests that Antico\u2019s reason for choosing Gurski over Jenkins was not the real reason or that the real reason was Jenkins\u2019s race. <em>See Springer, </em>509 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Jenkins contends that a jury could find that Antico\u2019s reason for selecting Gurski was false because Antieo did not post the position or review Jenkins\u2019s personnel file before making his selection and Antieo interviewed only Gurski and did so only after selecting him. When considered in light of the undisputed evidence as a whole, these facts do not support a finding of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">It is undisputed that, in the past, openings had been posted on a bulletin board in the lunchroom and in the company newsletter. However, it is also undisputed that Antieo was unaware of any policy for posting openings when he created the warehouse manager position. Antieo explained that, when he became the new branch manager, he was \u201clearning as [he] was going along what the company\u2019s protocol was on things like this.\u201d Instead of posting the position and waiting to see who expressed an interest, Antieo simply considered all of the warehouse employees, including Jenkins, for the promotion. There is no evidence that Jenkins was disadvantaged by Antico\u2019s failure to post the position, even assuming it violated NWI\u2019s policies. <em>See Springer, </em>509 F.3d at 1350 (\u201c[E]ven where preselection violates corporate personnel policies, it does not necessarily indicate racial discrimination.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">The fact that Antieo did not look at Jenkins\u2019s personnel file also does not show pretext. Antieo did not look at anyone\u2019s personnel file before making his decision. Instead, Antieo based his decision on his first-hand experience with the warehouse employees and feedback from others about their performance. The record does not support Jenkins\u2019s claim that because Anti-eo did not look at his personnel file, he could not have been aware of Jenkins\u2019s qualifications. Antieo testified that he was sufficiently familiar with Jenkins\u2019s work performance based on his two years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>observing Jenkins first-hand, and that this was the information he used to make his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The record also belies Jenkins\u2019s contention that Antico chose Gurski first and then interviewed him \u201cto learn of his qualifications.\u201d Antico did not interview any candidates as part of the selection process. Antico explained that, after deciding Gur-ski was the best fit, he talked with Gurski to make sure Gurski wanted the position, not to learn of his qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Jenkins failed to present evidence that NWI\u2019s reason for promoting Gurski was pretext for racial discrimination. We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of NWI on Jenkins\u2019s \u00a7 1981 discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-12\">. We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt.

Here, it is undisputed that Antieo considered Jenkins for the position without requiring him to apply and also that Jenkins made out his prima facie case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
