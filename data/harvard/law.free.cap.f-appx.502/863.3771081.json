The pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) applied the 1998 Guideline Manual and indicated that Frazier\u2019s offense involved 1,127 grams of cocaine base and 133 grams of cocaine. Based on a stipulation in the plea agreement, however, Frazier and the government agreed to a drug amount in excess of 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. This stipulation, in accordance with other adjustments, resulted in an offense level of 39 as opposed to a 38. Based on his adjusted offense level and a criminal history category of VI, Frazier\u2019s guideline range was 360 months to life. The district court sentenced Frazier to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">Frazier filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and asserted that the district court had the authority to reduce his sentence based on the Sentencing Commission\u2019s retroactive amendment lowering the base offense level for crack cocaine. Frazier argued that, under the retroactive amendment, his adjusted offense level should be 35. Based on an adjusted offense level of 35 and a criminal history category of VI, his guideline range would be 292 to 365 months. Since he was originally sentenced to the low-end of the applicable guideline range, he argued that the court should re-sentence him to the low-end of the new guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">The district court denied Frazier\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction using the two-paged AO 247 form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this form, the district court checked the box that indicated it was denying the motion after \u201chaving considered such motion, and taking into account the policy statement set forth at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d The district court record, however, only contained the first page of the AO 247 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">Frazier appealed the district court\u2019s order, arguing that the court failed to indicate whether its order was based on lack of authority to reduce his sentence or as an exercise of discretion. Frazier argued that if the denial was discretionary, the district court failed to state a reason for the denial and did not demonstrate that it properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-16\">On August 9, 2012, this court vacated and remanded the district court\u2019s order because there was no indication that the district court had conducted the required recalculation under the amended guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>lines and the record did not demonstrate that the district court took into account the \u00a7 3553 factors. The district court subsequently issued an order, indicating that its complete two page order denying Frazier\u2019s motion for sentence reduction had not been included in the record on appeal. The district court ordered that the complete order be transmitted to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The complete district court order reflected that the second page was filed under seal. The second page shows that the district court lowered Frazier\u2019s total offense level from 39 to 34, which yielded an amended guideline range of 292 to 365 months. The district court, however, denied Frazier\u2019s motion because his current sentence of 360 months was within the new guideline range and \u201cthe factors in \u00a7 3553(a) weigh[ed] strongly against any reduction in Frazier\u2019s 360 month sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In light of the district court\u2019s production of the second page of its order, the government filed the instant petition for rehearing. The government requests a rehearing in light of the supplement to the record \u2014 the sealed second page of the district court\u2019s order denying Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u2014 that contained the district court\u2019s recalculation of Frazier\u2019s amended sentencing guideline range. The government argues that the second page demonstrates that the district court properly recalculated Frazier\u2019s amended sentencing guideline range and sufficiently explained its denial of Frazier\u2019s motion. This court did not request that Frazier answer the government\u2019s petition for rehearing; Frazier\u2019s arguments were adequately laid out in his appeal and it was therefore unnecessary for him to file an answer to the government\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">This court\u2019s prior decision was based upon an incomplete copy of the district court\u2019s order; however, the complete district court order still fails to adequately address the reasons for our prior decision vacating and remanding this order. Accordingly, we once again vacate and remand the district court\u2019s order denying Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201cAs a general rule, district courts may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, except in specific circumstances delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). One exception is for a \u201c \u2018defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). \u201cIn such a case, \u2018the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), reflected in Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, reduced the statutory penalties for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 \u00a7 2(a), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, 2372 (to be codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)). Amendment 750 applies retroactively. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) app. C, amend. 713, at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">In deciding a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must first recalculate the applicable guideline range, substituting the amended guideline for the one originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>used. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d <em>778, 780 </em>(11th Cir.2000). The court must then decide, after analyzing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether to impose the amended sentence on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 781. The district court need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Here, the district court recalculated the applicable guideline range, substituting the amended guideline range for the one originally used. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. The court, however, failed to analyze the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it denied Frazier\u2019s motion, and summarily held that \u201cthe factors in \u00a7 3553(a) weigh strongly against any reduction in Frazier\u2019s 360 month sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">While it is true that the district court was not required to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors individually, <em>see Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322, it was required to provide <em>some </em>explanation as to why it denied Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See U.S. v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005) (finding the district court adequately addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it considered \u201c \u2018all the obvious things that you would normally take in consideration,\u2019 particularly, \u2018the age of the child.\u2019 \u201d); <em>U.S. v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 761 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it \u201ccited \u2018defendant\u2019s demonstrated violence and ... all the other considerations that went in to the establishment of this defendant\u2019s sentence.\u2019 \u201d); <em>U.S. v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 928 (11th Cir.2009) (finding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors considered when the district court cited to the defendant\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction, which highlighted the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and then provided arguments as to why those factors supported a more lenient sentence.); <em>U.S. v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (stating that \u201c[although the district court did not present particular findings on each individual factor listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, the court clearly considered those factors and set forth adequate reasons for its refusal to reduce Brown\u2019s sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">As demonstrated, each of these cases provided some detail, however minute, as to what was considered when the district court rejected to amend a defendant\u2019s sentence. In this case, however, the district court provided nothing more than a eonelu-sory statement that it had \u201cconsidered the \u00a7 3553 factors.\u201d This is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">We faced a similar situation in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). In <em>Williams, </em>we found that the record was unclear as to whether the district court had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it resentenced the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1257. The district court\u2019s order read: \u201c[A]fter considering the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, the Court concludes a further reduction in Defendant\u2019s sentence is not warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>4:04-cr-00046 (S.D.Ga., Sept. 2, 2009). We found this explanation to be insufficient, vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence, and remanded the case back to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Here, the district court\u2019s order reads almost identically to the order in <em>Williams. </em>The district court denied Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because \u201cthe factors in \u00a7 3553 weigh strongly against any reduction in Frazier\u2019s 360 month sentence.\u201d In light of our determination in <em>Williams, </em>it follows that this language is also insufficient to demonstrate that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it denied Frazier\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion is VACATED AND REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-11\">. AO 247 is a standardized form used by district courts in denying or granting motions for sentence reductions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
