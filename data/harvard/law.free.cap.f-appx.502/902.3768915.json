After having his initial \u00a7 2255 motion denied, Ramos filed the \u00a7 2241 petition at issue, in which he alleged that the government\u2019s prosecution of him for a drug-trafficking conspiracy had violated a treaty between the United States and the Dominican Republic, Ramos\u2019s home country. On appeal, he argues that \u00a7 2241 was the proper procedural vehicle for his claim because \u00a7 2241 provided the exclusive remedy for violations of a treaty, and that the district court should not have construed it as a \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as second or successive. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">\u201cWhen reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo.\u201d Rhode v. United States, </em>588 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive. <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002). Although we' generally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, the party abandons any issues not raised on appeal. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">A federal prisoner may file a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cupon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Section 2241 of Title 28 provides that the writ of habeas corpus extends to a prisoner who is in custody \u201cin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). This language is mirrored in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a), which provides for habeas relief for state prisoners. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Any challenge to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, should be brought under \u00a7 2241, not \u00a7 2255. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Although the language of \u00a7 2255 does not provide for challenges based on alleged treaty violations, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cthere can be no doubt that the grounds for relief under \u00a7 2255 are equivalent to those encompassed by \u00a7 2254, the general federal ha-beas corpus statute,\u201d which provides for relief when a person is in custody in violation of, <em>inter alia, </em>the treaties of the United States. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 344, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). We also have noted that the grounds for relief for non-constitutional violations under \u00a7 2254, which includes treaty violations, are equivalent to those encompassed by \u00a7 2255. <em>Adams v. Lankford, </em>788 F.2d 1493, 1495 n. 4 (11th Cir.1986) (citing <em>Davis, </em>417 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct.2298).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), requires that, before a second or successive motion is filed, the movant first must obtain an order from the court of appeals authorizing the district court to consider it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Without this authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>2003). We will generally look beyond the label of motions filed by <em>pro se </em>inmates to interpret them under whatever statute would provide relief. <em>Means v. Alabama, </em>209 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Under \u00a7 2255(e), a federal prisoner who is otherwise barred from filing a second or successive motion to vacate may challenge his custody in a \u00a7 2241 petition if it \u201cappears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Although we have not fully defined the scope of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause, we have noted that the savings clause may permit claims under \u00a7 2241 that a prisoner was convicted of a nonexistent crime based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). However, in an <em>en banc </em>decision, we noted that this statement was \u201conly dicta\u201d because all of Wofford\u2019s claims were sentencing claims that could have been presented at trial or on appeal. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1319 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). Regardless, a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition may not be used to avoid the restrictions on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions when a prisoner failed to raise the claim at an earlier stage. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Here, the district court did not err by construing Ramos\u2019s filing as a \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissing it as second or successive. Ramos filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion prior to filing the \u00a7 2241 petition at issue here. Although captioned as a \u00a7 2241 petition, Ramos seeks to challenge the validity of his convictions and sentences, not the execution of his sentences, and, therefore, the motion is properly characterized as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Antonelli, </em>542 F.3d at 1352. We recognize that the language of \u00a7 2255 does not provide expressly for challenges to convictions and sentences based on alleged treaty violations; however, the Supreme Court has concluded that the grounds for relief under \u00a7 2255 mirror those available under \u00a7 2254, which permits challenges based on treaty violations. <em>See Davis, </em>417 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. 2298. Therefore, Ramos\u2019s statutory interpretation argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Further, Ramos\u2019s reliance on <em>Darby </em>and <em>Noriega </em>is misplaced. In <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942 (11th Cir.2005), we declined to decide whether \u00a7 2241 provided the exclusive remedy for alleged treaty violations. <em>See id. </em>at 946. Therefore, <em>Darby </em>does not help Ramos\u2019s argument. Ramos also cannot rely on <em>Noriega v. Pastrana, </em>564 F.3d 1290 (11th Cir.2009), because <em>Noriega </em>was not challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence, so \u00a7 2255 would have been an inappropriate procedural vehicle to obtain the relief sought. <em>See id. </em>at 1293-94. In contrast, as discussed above, \u00a7 2255 is the appropriate procedural vehicle for Ramos\u2019s claims because Ramos is challenging his conviction and sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">. In addition, Ramos has abandoned any argument that he was entitled to file a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) and <em>Wofford </em>because he did not raise that issue on appeal. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b926-12\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8D\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the district court did not err in construing Mr. Ramos\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissing it as second or successive. I write separately only to emphasize, as the majority recognizes, that \u201cwe have not fully defined the scope\u201d of the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). I can conceive of circumstances in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>\u00a7 2241 is appropriate to address a federal prisoner\u2019s treaty violation claim. <em>See, e.g., Garza v. Lappin, </em>253 F.3d 918, 921-23 (7th Cir.2001) (recognizing that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate remedy within the meaning of the savings clause, thus ban on successive \u00a7 2255 motions did not preclude federal prisoner from filing \u00a7 2241 petition raising treaty claim that was not available until after first \u00a7 2255 motion was denied). However, Mr. Ramos\u2019s is not one of those cases. He has not demonstrated that his treaty based claim was unavailable at the time he could have raised it at trial, appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
