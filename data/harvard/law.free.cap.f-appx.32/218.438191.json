This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b264-23\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">Sisters Leidi Marilis Orozco-Ceron and Marta Lidia Orozco-Ceron, natives and citizens of Guatemala, petition for review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of their applications for asylum and withholding of deportation. Petitioners alleged that they faced persecution because their uncle was shot and killed by the military or by guerrillas, and that their father was threatened by a military commander for his investigation into their uncle\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-25\">To establish their eligibility for asylum, the Orozco-Cerons had to demonstrate that they were persecuted, or have a well founded fear of persecution, in Guatemala on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or their political opinion. <em>See </em>INA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u00a7 208, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The strength of the Orozco-Cerons\u2019 asylum petitions are largely dependent on the credibility given to their key witnesses, Julio Orozco and Sergio Cer\u00f3n, who testified on behalf of the Orozco-Cerons. The Immigration Judge determines whether witnesses are credible, and such credibility determinations are accorded substantial weight when they are supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reason[s] for the disbelief.\u201d <em>Turcios v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In this case, the decisions by the Immigration Judge and the BIA were largely based on the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that the testimonies of Julio Orozco and Sergio Cer\u00f3n were not credible. Julio Orozco\u2019s testimony contained several significant inconsistencies of which the Immigration Judge took note. Sergio Ceron\u2019s testimony also contained several significant inconsistencies. The Immigration Judge\u2019s non-credibility determinations were supported by these specific, cogent reasons. The Immigration Judge also noted that there were numerous members of the petitioners\u2019 family who had remained in Guatemala and had not been harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Moreover, even assuming that the evidence presented had been credible, it still would not have been enough to establish persecution, or a well founded fear of persecution, based on one of the five statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-26\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\">. For the Orozco-Cerons to establish eligibility for withholding of deportation, they must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on the grounds set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481, 112 S.Ct. 812. Because this is a higher standard than the asylum standard, and because the Orozco-Cerons are not able to meet even the lower asylum standard, this analysis will only focus on the asylum standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
