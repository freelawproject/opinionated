Gyani appeals the eighteen-month prison sentence the district court imposed after revoking his supervised release. Gyani asserts that the sentence was plainly unreasonable because it exceeded the three-to-nine-month sentence suggested under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. (2000), and that the district court failed to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000) before imposing sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record on appeal, including the nature and extent of Gyani\u2019s supervised release violations, the probation officer\u2019s petition for violation of supervised release that notified the district court of the revocation range recommended in Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines, the excerpts from the transcript of the revocation hearing, and the transcript of the sentencing hearing. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Gyani to an eighteen-month term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard of review). We also find that the district court properly considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA court need not engage in ritualistic incantation in order to establish its consideration of a legal issue. It is sufficient if ... the district court rules on issues that have been fully presented for determination. Consideration is implicit in the court\u2019s ultimate ruling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
