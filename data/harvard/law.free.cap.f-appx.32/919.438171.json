We defer to the Board\u2019s credibility determination because the Board and the Immigration Judge had a \u201clegitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility\u201d and \u201cofferfed] specific, cogent reasonfs] for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001). Zheng did not know the whereabouts of her husband and children, despite her testimony that she had received numerous letters from relatives in China, and could not recall significant details of her encounters with Chinese family planning officials. Thus, the determination of the Board that Zheng failed to make out a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>case for asylum is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record\u201d and must be upheld. <em>Al-Harbi </em>242 F.3d at 888 (internal quotation marks omitted). It follows that Zheng cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 888-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b965-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
