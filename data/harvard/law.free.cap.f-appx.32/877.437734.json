Schneider also requests fees for these appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-19\">After over a year of fee litigation, the district court awarded Schneider $305,617.30 out of his requested $707,375.74 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>in a case where the total amount of the underlying judgment was $67,795.50. In cases brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). The district court followed the well-established procedure for determining reasonableness by analyzing the lodestar for those fees. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). We review the award for an abuse of discretion, noting that the district court may \u201cin rare cases ... make upward or downward adjustments to the presumptively reasonable lodestar\u201d on the basis of a series of factors, including the delay in payment and the plaintiffs overall success in pursuing the litigation. <em>Gates v. Deukmejian, </em>987 F.2d 1392, 1396,1402 (9th Cir.1993). Moreover, the district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in determining what attorney\u2019s fee is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the circumstances of [the] case.\u201d <em>Schwarz v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Sews., </em>73 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Schneider contends that the district court legally erred in five ways, each of which undermines the award: (1) deciding the fee motion based on its own <em>sua sponte </em>objections; (2) adopting a \u201cfair\u201d hourly rate for various timekeepers\u2019 services, rather than using Schneider\u2019s proposed market rates; (3) failing to award Schneider a full ten percent upward adjustment to account for delay in payment; (4) improperly adjusting the lodestar downward to reflect Schneider\u2019s limited success; and (5) failing to award fees incurred for the litigation of the fee petition (\u201cfees-on-fees\u201d). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that, under the totality of the circumstances and utilizing the factors set forth in <em>Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a fair and reasonable award of fees and costs is $305,617.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Schneider\u2019s first argument, that the district court <em>sua sponte </em>made and ruled upon its own objections to law student rates, contemporaneous billing records, the rates at which Schneider paid contract lawyers and paralegals, and correspondence between himself and his lawyer regarding billing, is factually incorrect. In fact, the County repeatedly made oral and written objections to these aspects of the claimed attorney\u2019s fees. His second argument, that rates customarily billed by Schneider\u2019s counsel should be determinative of the court\u2019s finding with respect to hourly rates, is wrong as a matter of law. <em>See Barjon v. Dalton, </em>132 F.3d 496, 502 (9th Cir.1997) (consideration of attorney\u2019s expertise and experience in application of the prevailing rate for similarly qualified local counsel is well-established approach in the Ninth Circuit); <em>Chalmers v. City of Los Angeles, </em>796 F.2d 1205, 1210 (9th Cir. 1986) (\u201cDetermination of a reasonable hourly rate is not made by reference to rates actually charged the prevailing party.\u201d). Because the district court did not clearly err in finding that local counsel was available, willing, and able to handle this case, it did not abuse its discretion in applying rates comparable to the rates charged for similar services in the San Diego legal community.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Schneider\u2019s third argument, that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to adjust the lodestar upward to account for delay in payment of fees by a ten percent rate of interest, is both factually and legally erroneous. The district court in fact awarded a 4.545% rate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>interest for work performed in the early stages of litigation and awarded current rates of interest for work performed at later stages. It is not an abuse of discretion to utilize different methods in compensating for delay at different stages of the litigation. <em>See Chem. Bank v. City of Seattle (In Re Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec.), </em>19 F.3d 1291, 1305 (9th Cir.1994) (a district court is \u201cfree to use <em>either </em>current rates for attorneys of comparable ability or experience or historical rates coupled with a prime rate enhancement\u201d for different stages of the litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in adjusting the lodestar downward based on Schneider\u2019s limited success on the merits of the litigation. <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434. Schneider failed on several of his original claims, did not prevail against ten of the twelve original defendants, and did not recover a large portion of his originally claimed damages, including punitive damages, damages for emotional distress, and lost income and profits. These claims involved a common core of facts and were based on legal theories related to the claims upon which Schneider succeeded. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435. Moreover, the district court reduced the lodestar for the first phase of the litigation only, which was the phase in which Schneider pursued his unsuccessful claims. This was not an abuse of its discretion. <em>See McGinnis v. Kentucky Fried Chicken, </em>51 F.3d 805, 810 (9th Cir.1994) (ordering the district court to \u201creduce the attorney\u2019s fees award so that it is commensurate with the extent of the plaintiffs success\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Finally, the district court was well within its discretion to decline to award additional \u201cfees-on-fees.\u201d The district court compensated Schneider for fees for the preparation of the initial fee request in the amount of $8,400, declining only to award fees for Schneider\u2019s motion to reconsider and subsequent fee litigation. The district court did not err in finding that Schneider\u2019s counsel failed to minimize the hours spent in preparing the fee petition, delegate tasks that could have been performed by associates at a lower rate, and present all documents relevant to the fee petition with the initial motion. It correctly concluded that the request was therefore unreasonable under the standards set by law, reasoning, \u201cto permit an award of additional fees-on-fees in these circumstances gives parties an incentive to draw out the fee litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cno award of fees is \u2018automatic\u2019.... Exorbitant, unfounded, or procedurally defective fee applications \u2014 like any other improper position that may unreasonably protract proceedings \u2014 are matters that the district court can recognize and discount.\u201d <em>Commissioner, INS v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 163, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990). The district court had previously determined what constituted a reasonable award; it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that any additional amounts would be excessive. <em>See id. </em>at 161-62 (fee shifting statutes favor treating a case as an \u201cinclusive whole\u201d). We share the sentiment expressed by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Muscare v. Quinn, </em>680 F.2d 42, 44 (7th Cir.1982), that \u201c[f]or rather obvious practical reasons we are loath to disturb a ruling by a district judge on a request for second-round attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Finally, Schneider claims entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal. Because Schneider did not prevail on the merits of these appeals, we decline to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See Trevino v. Gates, </em>99 F.3d 911, 926 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-6\">. Although we have noted that the <em>Kerr </em>approach is \"disfavored,\u201d the district court's reliance upon it is harmless error in view of its correct application of subsequent cases. <em>Corder v.
