R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny An-nan-Yartey\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b393-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-24\">Napoleon Tette Annan-Yartey appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment following a jury trial in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">Upon our review of the trial transcript, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Three Boys Music Corp. v. Bolton, </em>212 F.3d 477, 482 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1126, 121 S.Ct. 881, 148 L.Ed.2d 790 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-26\">Because Annan-Yartey\u2019s trial counsel failed to present a challenge that the form of the jury instructions was clearly erroneous and approved the final form of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>instructions, we reject Annan-Yartey\u2019s contention that the district court gave these instructions in error. <em>See Shaw v. City of Sacramento, </em>250 F.3d 1289, 1293 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Upon our review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Annan-Yartey\u2019s eye-witness called in rebuttal. <em>See Tennison v. Circus Circus Enters., Inc., </em>244 F.3d 684, 688 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Pershing Park Villas Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. United Pac. Ins. Co., </em>219 F.3d 895, 900 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Because Annan-Yartey was proceeding in a civil-rights action, we reject his contention regarding his trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance. <em>See Nicholson v. Rushen, </em>767 F.2d 1426, 1427 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We have considered Annan-Yartey\u2019s contentions regarding calling a physician as a witness, introducing a university trespass memo, jury bias, defendants\u2019 motion for directed verdict and qualified immunity for defendants. We reject these contentions as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b393-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
