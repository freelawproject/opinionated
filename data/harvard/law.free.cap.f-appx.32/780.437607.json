Danekas pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Over Ms. Danekas\u2019s objections, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied a career-offender enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because she had a prior state conviction for possession of LSD with intent to deliver and a prior federal conviction for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine; the court then sentenced her to 151 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Ms. Danekas challenges the court\u2019s career-offender determination, arguing that her two prior drug convictions were related. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Although Ms. Danekas committed the LSD offense within the prior methamphetamine conspiracy\u2019s time frame, and both offenses may have involved some of the same persons, the district court did not clearly err in finding the two offenses were not part of a single common scheme or plan. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) &amp; comment. (n.3) (prior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately, while those imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of calculating criminal history; related sentences include those resulting from offenses that were part of \u201csingle common scheme or plan\u201d); <em>United States v. Maza, </em>93 F.3d 1390, 1400 (8th Cir.1996) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1138, 117 S.Ct. 1008, 136 L.Ed.2d 886 and 520 U.S. 1160, 117 S.Ct. 1345, 137 L.Ed.2d 503 (1997); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>962 F.2d 560, 564 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201ca relatedness finding requires more than mere similarity of crimes\u201d). The two prior offenses involved different drugs and occurred in different cities; and the LSD offense was not even considered relevant conduct in the conspiracy case. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>212 F.3d 391, 394-95 (8th Cir.) (\u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A) (relevant conduct) is defined more broadly than <em>\u201csingle </em>common scheme or plan\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) (emphasis added)), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 907, 121 S.Ct. 253, 148 L.Ed.2d 183 (2000); <em>Maza, </em>93 F.3d at 1399-1400 <em>(prior </em>convictions for selling cocaine were unrelated, in part because sales took place in different states); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>962 F.2d 479, 482 (5th Cir.) (two distinct, separate drug deliveries were not part of common scheme even though crimes were temporally alike), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 902, 113 S.Ct. 293,121 L.Ed.2d 217 (1992), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). Ms. Danekas\u2019s argument \u2014 that her LSD transaction furthered the conspiracy offense by providing money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>to get methamphetamine \u2014 lacks evidentiary support, and even if money-making was a motive, \u201c[m]otive may be one factor ... to consider in a single common plan or scheme determination, but it is not conclusive in every case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lowe, </em>930 F.2d 645, 647 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-13\">. The Honorable Richard G.
