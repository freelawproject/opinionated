We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-20\">Lott contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney\u2019s loyalties to another client prevented Lott from accepting a 120-month plea offer, which would have required him to implicate the other client. Lott argues that the district court erred in denying his motion without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-21\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel, while we review the denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v.
