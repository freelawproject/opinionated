Brown, Sr., seeks review of the July 2, 2001, decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, No. CH3443010506-I-1, dismissing his appeal after Brown voluntarily withdrew it. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">A board decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">The record contains a letter from Brown submitted to the board explicitly withdrawing his appeal. Because the board properly dismissed Brown\u2019s appeal, we may not consider his arguments on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
