Boone appeals her conviction and sentence imposed after a jury trial for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine, and two counts of possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and aiding and abetting, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), (b)(l)(B)(ii), 846 (West 1999); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a72 (West 2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Boone contends on appeal that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine under count two. of her indictment. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find a reasonable trier of fact could have found Boone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Boone next contends her indictment lacked specificity and was thus fatally deficient. Boone\u2019s objection to the specificity of the indictment is waived by her failure to properly raise it in the trial court. Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Boone\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
