We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-24\">Vasquez-Cortez contends that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) by not advising him of the specific elements and not ensuring that he understood the nature of the charge to which he was pleading guilty. Reviewing de novo, <em>United States v. Littlejohn, </em>224 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2000), we conclude that the Vasquez-Cortez\u2019s contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Review of the plea colloquy demonstrates that Vasquez-Cortez was informed of and understood the nature of the charge against him. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1); see <em>United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976-77 (9th Cir.1998). Therefore, the asserted error was harmless. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(h); see <em>United States v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting advisory committee notes to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(h) (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Vasquez-Cortez also contends that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the existence and nature of a prior felony conviction used to enhance his sentence must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Vasquez-Cortez further contends that <em>Apprendi </em>limited <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) to its unique facts. His <em>Apprendi </em>contentions are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.) (applying plain error review), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001) and <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001) (applying de novo review).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b309-25\"> This disposition is <em>not </em>appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
