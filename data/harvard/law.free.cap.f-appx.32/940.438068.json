Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) deprives us of review of the order of removal, we retain jurisdiction \u201cto determine whether jurisdiction exists.\u201d <em>See Flores-Miramontes v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1133, 1135-36 (9th Cir.2000) (we have jurisdiction to determine whether a petitioner is an alien removable by reason of having been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-22\">Cortez argues that false imprisonment in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 236-37 is not a crime of violence, because \u201cby its nature,\u201d it does not involve a \u201csubstantial risk that physical force\u201d may be used in the course of committing the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Under section 237, a person can be convicted of false imprisonment by fraud or deceit, as well as by violence or menace. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 237(b); <em>People v. Rios, </em>177 Cal.App.3d 445, 222 Cal.Rptr. 913, 916 (1986). We agree that a conviction under these statutes, standing alone, is insufficient to constitute a crime of violence. \u201cHowever, when the statute reaches both conduct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>would constitute a crime of violence and conduct that would not ... we follow a modified categorical approach, in which we look to the charging paper and judgment of conviction to determine if the actual offense the defendant was convicted of qualifies as a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000). Here, the judgment of conviction and the charging papers reveal that Cortez was convicted of false imprisonment <em>by violence, </em>and that this crime was perpetrated with a gun. We therefore find that his conviction is a crime of violence that qualifies as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b986-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
