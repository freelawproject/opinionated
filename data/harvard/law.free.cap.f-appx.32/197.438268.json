The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> departed downward and sentenced him to 120 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. West\u2019s counsel was granted leave to withdraw after West indicated he wished to proceed pro se, and West raises several claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-23\">We conclude that West\u2019s appeal is merit-less. His involuntary-plea claims are not properly before us because he did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court. <em>See United States v. Murphy, 899 </em>F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir.1990). Also, West waived his claim that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender when he conceded the issue in the district court, <em>see United States v. Gutierrez, </em>130 F.3d 330, 332 (8th Cir.1997), and in any event, because of the downward departure he was sentenced below the range that would have applied without the career-offender enhancement, <em>see United States v. Wyatt, </em>26 F.3d 863, 864 (8th Cir.1994) (per curiam). West also waived his constitutional challenge to section 841 by faffing to raise it in the district court, <em>see United States v. Baker, </em>98 F.3d 330, 337-38 (8th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1179, 117 S.Ct. 1456, 137 L.Ed.2d 561 (1997), and his ineffective-assistance claim is not properly presented in this proceeding, <em>see United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998). Further, the district court did not have the authority to run his sentence concurrent with any revocation sentence the Parole Commission may impose on a prior federal conviction for which he had been paroled at the time he committed the instant offense, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n.6); <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>69 F.3d 237, 245 (8th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1153, 116 S.Ct. 1032,134 L.Ed.2d 109 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">As to West\u2019s remaining arguments, he did not raise the issues in the district court, and thus may not raise them on appeal absent plain error. <em>See United States v. Eads, </em>144 F.3d 1151, 1154 (8th Cir.1998). We find no error, plain or otherwise: the government did not breach the plea agreement, and the district court quite clearly ruled on the motion for a downward departure after listening to the parties\u2019 arguments for departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We deny the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-18\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
