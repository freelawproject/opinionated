The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found Miller ineligible for safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and sentenced him to 60 months in prison, the statutory minimum, and 4 years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief raising the issue whether the district court erred in denying safety-valve relief. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The district court did not err because Miller\u2019s Category II criminal history made him ineligible for safety-valve relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. Even if the district court had granted Miller a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 to a Category I criminal history, as Miller had requested, he still would not have qualified for the safety-valve reduction. <em>See United States v. Langmade, </em>236 F.3d 931, 931-32 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam); <em>Webb, </em>218 F.3d at 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\">.
