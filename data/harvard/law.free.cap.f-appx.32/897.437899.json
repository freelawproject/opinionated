R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal of their complaint against the Orange County Department of Education, the Orange County Board of Education, and the Superintendent of Schools, in his individual and official capacities (collectively, the \u201cCounty\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-22\">Teachers argues that the district court improperly concluded that the individual teachers did not have property interests in their continued employment under Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Educ.Code \u00a7 8366, and thus were not entitled to constitutional due process hearings. Whether a state statute creates an expectation of entitlement sufficient to create a property interest recognized by federal constitutional law \u201cwill depend largely upon the extent to which the statute contains mandatory language that restricts the discretion of the [decisionmaker].\u201d <em>Allen v. City of Beverly Hills, </em>911 F.2d 367, 370 (9th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538, 543 n. 8, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). If there are no \u201cparticularized standards or criteria that significantly constrain\u201d the discretion of the decision-maker to confer a benefit, no property entitlement exists. <em>Fid. Fin. Corp. v. Fed. Home Loan Bank, </em>792 F.2d 1432,1436 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The authorization of layoffs for \u201clack of work or lack of funds\u201d in Cal. Educ.Code \u00a7 8366 does not provide \u201cparticularized standards or criteria that <em>significantly </em>constrain\u201d the County\u2019s discretion to order layoffs of child-development teachers for financial reasons. <em>See Allen, </em>911 F.2d at 371. In contrast to the specific triggers set forth in Cal. Educ.Code. \u00a7\u00a7 44955(b) and 44955.5, which govern layoffs of other certificated employees, the \u201clack of work or lack of funds\u201d language in Cal. Educ. Code \u00a7 8366 is broad. Moreover, the California courts have held that a school district has significant discretion to lay off classified state school employees for \u201clack of funds\u201d as long as that discretion is \u201cconfined to truly \u2018budgetary\u2019 issues.\u201d <em>Short v. Nevada Joint Union High Sch. Dist., </em>163 Cal.App.3d 1087, 1097-98, 210 Cal.Rptr. 297 (Cal.Ct.App.1985); <em>see also Cal. Sch. Employees Assn. v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist., </em>71 Cal.App.3d 318, 321-22, 139 Cal.Rptr. 633 (Cal.Ct.App.1977) (rejecting the argument that \u201clack of funds\u201d should mean \u201can actual and existing financial inability to pay salaries ...,\u201d and holding that a school district was permitted to lay off classified school employees for \u201clack of funds\u201d even while the district maintained funds in reserve accounts sufficient to pay salaries). Where the only substantive restriction imposed on a decision-maker\u2019s exercise of authority is that the basis of its decision be reasonable, any claim to a protected property interest created by the state is negated. <em>Allen, </em>911 F.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">This is not a case where the plaintiffs alleged that budgetary constraints were a sham or pretext for terminations based other grounds, and so does not involve personalized fact determinations that would necessitate a hearing. <em>Cf. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 542-43 (requiring due process hearings for \u201ccause\u201d terminations based on the employee\u2019s interest in telling \u201chis side\u201d of the story). Rather, the child-development teachers lacked a legitimate entitlement to continued employment once the County determined in its discretion that it lacked funds to retain them. <em>See Duffy v. Sarault, </em>892 F.2d 139, 147 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b944-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
