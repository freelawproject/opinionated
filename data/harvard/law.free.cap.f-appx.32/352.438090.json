Mizzell (\u201cMizzell\u201d) in his ERISA action for recovery of long-term disability insurance benefits. The District Court concluded that Paul Revere had abused its discretion and remanded the case to the plan administrator for a new determination of Mizzell\u2019s claim. In addition, the District Court awarded Mizzell $181,251.22 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses with the exception of $3,900 improperly awarded for the retention and use of a bad faith expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to award or deny attorney\u2019s fees in an ERISA action, as well as a district court\u2019s determination of the amount of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mut. Life Co., </em>214 F.3d 1041, 1045 (9th Cir.2000). Under that standard, \u201cthis court cannot reverse unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Tucor Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>238 F.3d 1171, 1175 (9th Cir.2001). We, however, review <em>de novo </em>any elements of legal analysis and statutory interpretation involved in an attorney fees decision. <em>Associated Gen. Contractors v. Smith, </em>74 F.3d 926, 931 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">ERISA provides that \u201c[i]n any action under this subchapter ... by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>party.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). We have held that \u201c[a]s a general rule, ERISA employee plaintiffs should be entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee \u2018if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. CMTA-IAM Pension Trust, </em>746 F.2d 587, 589 (9th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). In <em>Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 453 (9th Cir.1980), we laid out five factors and stated that courts should consider those factors among others to determine whether to award fees under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Paul Revere argues that the award of attorneys fees was \u201cpremature\u201d because the District Court did not award any benefits to Mizzell but merely remanded the case to the plan administrator for a new determination of Mizzell\u2019s claim. But Mizzell \u201csucceeded] on [a] significant issue in litigation,\u201d i.e., whether Paul Revere abused its discretion in denying Mizzell\u2019s claim, which \u201caehieve[d] some of the benefit [Mizzell] sought in bringing suit,\u201d i.e., to obtain a full and fair review of his claim. <em>Smith, </em>746 F.2d at 589. Therefore, unless the analysis of the <em>Hummell </em>factors reveals that the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d we announced in <em>Smith </em>is inapplicable in the present case, Mizzell is \u201centitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>746 F.2d at 589.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Paul Revere further argues that the District Court abused its discretion in applying the <em>Hummell </em>factors. The District Court considered each of the five <em>Hummell </em>factors and determined that each of them weighed in favor of awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Mizzell. \u201cThis court need only look for an abuse-of-discretion and neither the record nor the briefs reveal such an abuse.\u201d <em>Cline v. Indus. Maint. Eng\u2019g &amp; Contracting Co., </em>200 F.3d 1223, 1235-36 (9th Cir.2000). Because there are no grounds for \u201ca definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment,\u201d there are no grounds to reverse. <em>Tucor Int\u2019l, </em>238 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Paul Revere finally argues that the District Court erred in awarding Mizzell $3,900 incurred through the retention and use of a bad faith expert. We observed in <em>Downey Cmty. Hosp. v. Wilson, </em>977 F.2d 470 (9th Cir.1992), that \u201cexpert witness fees are not recoverable in a federal civil rights action except as provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\u201d and held that the same rule applies in the ERISA context. <em>Downey, </em>977 F.2d at 474. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the ... [compensation of court appointed experts ...,\u201d but does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>provide for the taxation of costs of the compensation of non-court-appointed experts. Mizzell conceded at oral argument that the bad faith expert at issue here was not court appointed. We therefore reduce the award of $181,251.22 by $8,900 to $177,351.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses is AFFIRMED with the exception of $3,900 improperly awarded for the retention and use of a bad faith expert. To the extent that a revised judgment must be entered, we VACATE and REMAND for the limited purpose of entering judgment in favor of Mizzell in the amount of $177,351.22.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. We have recognized in the past that an award of attorney\u2019s fees may be appropriate under the circumstances of this case. In <em>Kayes v. Pacific Lumber Co., </em>51 F.3d 1449 (9th Cir.1995), we held that \u201cinterim attorney's fees are available under ERISA to the extent that they are available under civil rights statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1469. In <em>Flanagan v. Inland Empire Elec. Workers Pension Plan &amp; Trust, </em>3 F.3d 1246 (9th Cir.1993), we implied that an attorney\u2019s fee award may be appropriate where a plaintiff has <em>either </em>\"established a right to benefits, [ <em>]or </em>[as in the present case] shown that the Plan or its fiduciaries have violated ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253 (emphasis added). And in <em>White v. Jacobs Engineering Group Long Term Disability Benefit Plan, </em>896 F.2d 344 (9th Cir.1989), we awarded attorney\u2019s fees after remanding to the plan administrator for adjudication on the merits of plaintiff\u2019s long-term disability benefits claim. <em>Id. </em>at 352 (noting that \u201d[s]ince no special circumstances which would warrant deviation from th[e] rule [announced in <em>Smith, </em>746 F.2d at 589] exist in this case, appellant is entitled to attorney fees\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
