The district court dismissed Wallace\u2019s petition as time-barred under AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a habeas petition, <em>Wade v. Terhune, </em>202 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.2000), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The basis of the district court\u2019s decision, which was made without the benefit of our recent decision in <em>Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>is erroneous. <em>See Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>262 F.3d 973, 974 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (concluding that under California Rule of Court 24, the supreme court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition becomes final 30 days after entry of the order). The record is not sufficiently developed for us to determine whether Wallace is otherwise entitled to statutory tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) such that his federal petition is timely. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand. The district court is directed to reevaluate the timeliness of Wallace\u2019s petition and to order the production of such evidence concerning the filing dates and final decisions of all of Wallace\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"ACf\">state petitions as is appropriate for the resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
