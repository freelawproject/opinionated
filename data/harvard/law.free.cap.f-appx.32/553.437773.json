The ITC and Proxim also respond.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-30\">In our February 1 order, we noted that after the filing of Symbol\u2019s mandamus petition, the ITC disqualified Burns Doan as counsel for Proxim based upon another party\u2019s motion to disqualify. Symbol now argues that, nonetheless, its mandamus petition is not moot because it fears that \u201cthe substantial work product generated during the past twelve months by Burns Doane will be used in the ITC investigation, and subsequently against Symbol \u2014 Burns Doane\u2019s current client \u2014 in the Delaware action in which Symbol is a defendant.\u201d This requested relief is different from that previously requested from the ITC and is, in part, presently before the ITC. Symbol states that Proxim has a motion pending requesting that Burns Doane be permitted to transfer its files to Proxim\u2019s remaining counsel. Thus, any determination by this court regarding that issue in this mandamus petition would not be appropriate. To the extent that Symbol seeks to bar the use of material in the district court proceeding, that issue seems to be outside of the ITC\u2019s purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-32\">In sum, the relief that Symbol requested in its mandamus petition has been granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>To the extent that Symbol is concerned that additional relief will not be granted, those matters fall outside of the scope of Symbol\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Symbol\u2019s mandamus petition is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-25\"> The motion for leave to file the papers are granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
