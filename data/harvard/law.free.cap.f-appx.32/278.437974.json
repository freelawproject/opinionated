They also appeal the tax court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to hear their claim that the IRS should use its new interest-netting rule when calculating the penalties and increased interest. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">I. <em>Negligence Penalties and Increased Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The tax court did not clearly err when it held that the Lincirs were liable for the negligence penalties and increased interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Lincirs were negligent in relying on the advice of their accountant, Schenkman. For reliance to be reasonable, the advisor must have knowledge of the pertinent facts and expertise in the subject matter of the underlying transaction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Schenkman admitted that he was not an expert in securities or gold trading. He solely relied on the material provided by the promoters when giving advice about the tax consequences of the gold trading program. The Lincirs\u2019 contention that they thought Schenkman was an expert is to no avail because they bear the burden of showing that their advisor had the requisite expertise and knowledge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They failed to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">The Lincirs were also negligent in relying on an advisor who had an economic interest in promoting the investment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Lincirs should have suspected that Schenkman was not just a disinterested independent advisor because Schenkman introduced the program to them and spoke at the investment seminar.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lincir also admitted that he assumed Schenkman was being compensated by the investment program for doing accounting work associated with the venture. The combination of these facts should have put Lincir on notice that Schenkman had an interest in the program and that Lincir needed to investigate the program independently. The tax court did not clearly err in finding the Lincirs negligent for relying on Schenkman\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>II. <em>Jurisdiction Regarding Interest-Netting Rule Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We review de novo the tax court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The tax court does not have jurisdiction to review interest determinations before the taxpayer has paid that interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the tax court was correct in holding that it did not have jurisdiction to decide whether the IRS must apply the interest-netting rule when calculating the increased interest penalty before such a penalty has been assessed and paid. The Lincirs argue that they do not want the court to determine the amount of interest but, rather, want the court to decide whether the increased interest penalty provision applies to them. The Lincirs misstate the issue. The tax court has already determined that the Lincirs engaged in a tax motivated transaction that led to a substantial underpayment of taxes, thereby triggering the increased interest penalty. The only question remaining is the amount of the penalty, which is akin to an interest determination. The tax court does not have jurisdiction to decide that issue until the IRS has assessed the penalty and the Lincirs have paid it, which has not yet occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">The tax court\u2019s determination that an issue is not ripe for review is also reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Lincirs\u2019 claim that the IRS should use the interest-netting rule to calculate the negligence penalty is not ripe for review because it is not fit for judicial decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An agency decision is fit for review if it is a final agency action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is no final agency action in this case. The IRS has yet to compute the negligence penalty and hence has yet to apply or not to apply the interest-netting rule. While the IRS has indicated to the court that it will not apply the rule, such an indication within a legal brief is not a \u201cdefinitive statement of an agency\u2019s position\u201d such as would be a final rule or regulation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There must be some evidence that the agency has concluded its consideration of the issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is no such evidence in this case. Therefore, there was no final agency action, and thus, the issue was not ripe for review. We affirm the decisions of the tax court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">.
