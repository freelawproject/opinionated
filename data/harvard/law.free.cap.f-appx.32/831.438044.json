(collectively, \u201cOutdoor\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying preliminary injunctive relief. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural background, we need not detail it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The district court denied Outdoor\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction because it concluded that Outdoor lacked standing. The court reasoned that because none of the compliance orders issued by the City of Los Angeles (\u201cthe City\u201d) pursuant to its outdoor sign ordinance (\u201cthe Sign Ordinance\u201d) were for mural violations, Outdoor had suffered no injury. To have standing, Outdoor must satisfy three elements: (1) injury in fact, (2) the injury was reasonably caused by the challenged conduct, and (3) likelihood that the relief requested, if granted, will redress the injury. <em>See Desert Outdoor Advertising v. City of Moreno Valley, </em>103 F.3d 814, 818 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Based on the alleged impact of the Sign Ordinance on Outdoor, the citation that recited the mural requirements, the response of Outdoor\u2019s lessees, plus other alleged injury, Outdoor has alleged injury that is directly related to the City\u2019s enforcement of the Sign Ordinance, thus satisfying the first two prongs of the standing test. Outdoor also meets the third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">Outdoor asks that the entire Sign Ordinance be struck down as unconstitutional. If such relief were granted, it would redress Outdoor\u2019s injury. Accordingly, Outdoor has standing to bring its First Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Although we disagree with the district court with respect to standing, we affirm on alternate grounds. Outdoor does not meet the merits requirement for preliminary injunctive relief. <em>See Mayweathers v. Newland, </em>258 F.3d 930, 938 (9th Cir.2001) (listing criteria for preliminary injunctive relief). At this juncture, Outdoor has failed to produce evidence indicating that the Sign Ordinance\u2019s provision for \u201cmural signs\u201d is content-based. <em>See Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, </em>453 U.S. 490, 521, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (holding that content-based exception to city sign ordinance rendered entire ordinance unconstitutional). And, to the extent that mural signs must be approved by the Cultural Affairs Commission, Outdoor has failed to demonstrate that the Commission enjoys unfettered discretion to accept or reject signs. <em>See City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., </em>486 U.S. 750, 755, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988) (\u201clicensing statute placing unbridled discretion in the hands of a government official or agency constitutes a prior restraint....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-15\">.
