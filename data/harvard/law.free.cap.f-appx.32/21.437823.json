Williams appeals from his conviction, following a negotiated plea agreement, to one count of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The gravamen of his appeal is that the statute is unconstitutional because the conduct it proscribes the intrastate possession of a firearm does not have a substantial effect upon interstate commerce and thus does not constitute a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause. While acknowledging that we upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) in <em>United States v. Gateward, </em>84 F.3d 670 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 907, 117 S.Ct. 268, 136 L.Ed.2d 192 (1996), Williams argues that at the time of Gateward, it was still unclear in this Circuit whether Lopez was a \u201climited holding,\u201d or if it was instead a \u201cwatershed\u201d opinion signaling a fundamental shift in the Supreme Court\u2019s Commerce Clause jurisprudence. He further argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s two recent opinions in <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), make clear that Lopez was no aberration and that Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power is significantly more limited than had previously been thought, and in light of these two new decisions, \u201cit becomes even more clear that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as it exceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Congress\u2019 authority under the Commerce Clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Unfortunately for Mr. Williams this issue has now been conclusively resolved by our opinion in <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001). In Singletary, we considered the precise constitutional challenge to that statute raised by Williams here, and concluded that Congress did not exceed its power to regulate interstate commerce when it enacted \u00a7 922(g)(1). Singletary thus reaffirmed our prior decision in <em>United States v. Gateward, </em>84 F.3d 670 (3d Cir.1996), and held that post-Gateward decisions of the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), did not overrule Gateward sub silentio. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
