Walker appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Western District of Missouri upon his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The district court sentenced Walker to 120 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. For reversal, Walker argues the district court erred in calculating his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), because his prior Missouri conviction for unlawful use of a weapon did not constitute \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-20\">In a felon-in-possession case, the base offense level is 24 \u201cif the defendant had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1 incorporates by reference U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2\u2019s crime-of-violenee definition. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.5). Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l) and (2), respectively, define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person,\u201d or \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-21\">Assuming without deciding that the Missouri statute Walker violated could have been committed without violence, we conclude the district court properly considered the offense\u2019s underlying facts. <em>See </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 571.030.1(1) (2000) (prohibiting knowingly carrying concealed \u201ca knife, a firearm, a blackjack or any other weapon readily capable of lethal use\u201d); <em>United States v. Kind, </em>194 F.3d 900, 907 (8th Cir.1999) (\u201cAssuming this offense can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>sometimes be committed without violence, we look to the <em>facts </em>or charging instruments underlying Kind\u2019s offense to determine whether it was a crime of violence.\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1180, 120 S.Ct. 1217, 145 L.Ed.2d 1117 (2000); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>957 F.2d 520, 522 (8th Cir.) (when deciding whether offense involves conduct that presents serious potential risk of physical injury to another, courts may examine <em>facts </em>underlying defendant\u2019s conviction to determine whether offense is \u201ccrime of violence\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 856, 113 S.Ct. 167, 121 L.Ed.2d 114 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In view of the unobjected-to facts in the presentence report (PSR) describing Walker\u2019s prior conviction, the district court correctly determined that the conviction constituted a predicate felony, because his offense \u2014 which involved a car chase with two weapons readily accessible, a subsequent flight on foot, and an ultimate arrest yielding brass knuckles \u2014 presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to the officers who pursued and arrested him. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4331.2(a)(2); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>242 F.3d 1080, 1081 (8th Cir. 2001) (reviewing district court\u2019s application of Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error); <em>United States v. Wajda, </em>1 F.3d 731, 732 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (district court is not required to make factual findings on matters in PSR unless defendant objects with specificity and clarity).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-22\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
