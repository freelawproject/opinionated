The Board\u2019s determination that Dodaj is not eligible for asylum must be upheld unless that determination is \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C) (West 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-19\">We have reviewed the administrative record and find no error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that Dodaj failed to establish eligibility as a refugee in order to qualify for relief from removal. 8 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (West 1999); <em>M.A. v. U.S. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). In addition, Dodaj\u2019s claim that gaps in the transcript require remand was not raised before the Board and has thus been waived. <em>Gandarillas-Zambrana v. BIA, </em>44 F.3d 1251, 1255 (4th Cir.1995); <em>Farrokhi v. U.S. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700-01 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-20\">We accordingly affirm the Board\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
