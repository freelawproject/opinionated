Best appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994). To the extent that Best claimed that officers used excessive force during an arrest, the district court correctly dismissed that claim without prejudice to Best\u2019s right to raise the claim in a 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2001) action. We affirm that part of the district court\u2019s order. The district court also properly dismissed Best\u2019s challenge to his conviction without prejudice to his right to raise that challenge in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001) petition once state remedies are exhausted. We therefore dismiss Best\u2019s appeal from that part of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-25\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal in part and affirm in part on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Best v. Hayden, </em>No. CA-01-813-5-HC-BO (E.D.N.C. Oct. 25, 2001). We deny the motion to stay the case until Best can file an additional brief and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. The motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-26\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
