The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) responds and moves to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-26\">Both parties state that this court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal of a decision of the Department of Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals that was not rendered pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 607(g)(1). Rain and Hall state that it has filed the appeal in \u201can abundance of caution and that it has filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>trict of Texas.\u201d This court agrees that it lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">This court has jurisdiction over appeals of decisions of boards of contract appeals rendered pursuant to the CDA. <em>Zinger Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>753 F.2d 1053,1054 (Fed.Cir.1985). When the CDA does not apply to the contract at issue, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the appeal. <em>G.E. Boggs &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Roskens, </em>969 F.2d 1023, 1026 (Fed.Cir.1992); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(10). The CDA applies to executive agency procurement contracts wherein the agency acquires \u201cproperty or services for the direct benefit or use of the federal government.\u201d <em>Bonneville Associates v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 649, 653 (Fed.Cir.1994); <em>New Era Constr. v. United States, </em>890 F.2d 1152, 1157 (Fed.Cir. 1990); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Rain and Hall entered into the contract at issue, a Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA), with the FCIC. The SRA is a financial assistance agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the FCIC will provide premium subsidy, expense reimbursement, and reinsurance on multiple peril crop insurance sold or reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (FCIA), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 <em>et seq., </em>and its implementing regulations. The SRA\u2019s purpose is to provide insurance to agricultural product producers in accordance with the FCIA, rather than to procure goods or services for the FCIC. Accordingly the SRA is not a procurement contract subject to the CDA. <em>Cf New Era Constr., </em>890 F.2d at 1157 (determining that contract obligating government to finance construction project for nonfederal agency not subject to the CDA because construction was not for the government\u2019s direct benefit or use). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">(1) Rain and Hail\u2019s motion for a determination of jurisdiction is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">(2) The FCIC\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
