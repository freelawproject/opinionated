During the pendency of this action before the District Court, Officer Hoagland filed a petition for bankruptcy and received a discharge of all dis-chargeable debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727. Hoagland filed a motion in District Court to dismiss or alternatively for summary judgment, and PATCO filed a motion for summary judgment. The court dismissed all claims against Hoagland and granted PATCO\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Johnsons appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-20\">The District Court had jurisdiction over the Johnsons\u2019 federal law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343, and exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the Johnsons\u2019 state common law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We subject the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to plenary review. <em>Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 130 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001). Plenary review is also warranted in reviewing the District Courts dismissal of a complaint. <em>Silverman v. Eastrich Multiple Investor Fund, L.P., </em>51 F.3d 28, 30 (3d Cir.1995). However, we review the denial of declaratory relief for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The Johnsons concede that Officer Hoagland cannot be liable for monetary damages because of the discharge of his debts, but argue instead for a declaratory judgment against him. We agree with the District Court that declaratory relief is not appropriate in this case because the John-sons \u201chave failed to allege a genuine controversy the resolution of which would be aided by a declaration by this Court that Officer Hoagland violated plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights.\u201d App. at A-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The District Court considered next whether PATCO violated the Johnsons civil rights by not properly training its police officers. Even if, as the Johnsons argue, the allegation was more properly characterized as whether \u201cPATCO developed and maintained policies or customs exhibiting a deliberate indifference to the Constitutional rights of persons which cause the violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 rights,\u201d App. Br. at 21 (citing Amended Complaint U 34), summary judgment was properly granted. The District Court carefully considered the allegations, and properly determined that the Johnsons had not made a showing that Hoagland\u2019s training was deficient or that PATCO was deliberately indifferent to an alleged need for additional training.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We also agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusions that the Johnsons\u2019 loss of consortium claim against PATCO fails for lack of a predicate claim, and that PATCO was not given timely notice to defend in regard to the Johnsons\u2019 common law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order on all counts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
