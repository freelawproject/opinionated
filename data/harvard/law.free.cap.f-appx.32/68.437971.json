This court affirmed Reeves\u2019 convictions on direct appeal but vacated and remanded Reeves\u2019 151-month sentence for Count 1 in light of <em>United States v. Rhynes, </em>196 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>207 (4th Cir.1999), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>218 F.3d 310 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc). On remand, the district court lowered Reeves\u2019 sentence to 121 months of imprisonment. In the instant appeal, Reeves\u2019 attorney has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raises the following issue: whether Reeves\u2019 121-month sentence is invalid in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Because Reeves\u2019 sentence for the conspiracy count is below the statutory maximum under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001), he has not been prejudiced under <em>Apprendi. United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201-02 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). Also, as noted by the Government, there is no <em>Rhynes </em>error. Finally, we find no merit to the issues raised in Reeves\u2019 pro se supplemental brief and deny his motion to dismiss his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We have examined the entire record <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We deny Reeves\u2019 motions to dismiss his attorney, for judicial review, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> Because this case is back before the court after remand, our scope of review is limited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
