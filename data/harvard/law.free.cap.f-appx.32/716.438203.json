We find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">Hunt pleaded guilty in April 2000 to one count of bank robbery and a related count of using of a firearm in relation to the commission of a violent crime. At the time, Hunt was in the midst of serving a 63-month sentence for a separate robbery, for which he had been convicted in 1996. At his June 2000 sentencing hearing, Hunt requested that, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3, the district court order that his sentence for the second bank robbery conviction run concurrent with his undischarged sentence for his first conviction, and that the second sentence commence as of the date of arrest for the first bank robbery conviction (August 1996) or, in the alternative, as of the time of sentencing for the first bank robbery conviction (January 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">The district court decided that Hunt\u2019s second bank robbery sentence should run concurrent with the undischarged sentence \u2014 but only as of the date of sentencing, June 27, 2000. As a result, the two sentences would run concurrently for only 17 months, and Hunt would be required to serve the remaining 40 months of the second sentence after the first sentence was discharged. In addition, as mandated by statute, the district court ordered that Hunt\u2019s 60-month sentence for the firearm count run consecutive to Hunt\u2019s second bank robbery sentence. Hunt now appeals the district court\u2019s sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-20\">The district court has discretion to impose a sentence concurrently or consecutively on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). In exercising this discretion, the district court is required to consider the applicable guidelines and policy statements in ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>feet at the time of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s \u201c[d]ecision[ ] to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence [is] reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>266 F.3d 462, 466 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Section 5G1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines addresses the imposition of a sentence on a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. Subsection (a) of the guideline has no application here. Subsections (b) and (c), which are potentially implicated here, provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. On appeal, the defendant complains that \u201cthe district court did not take into account U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) or (c) or the appropriate federal statutes: \u00a7\u00a7 3553 and 3584.\u201d We find no basis in the record to support this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The defendant\u2019s argument with regard to \u00a7 5G1.3(b) appears to be based on the contention that the two robberies for which he was convicted and sentenced were \u201cprecisely the same crime\u201d and part of \u201cthe same course of conduct.\u201d Disregarding for the moment that this contention is a vast overstatement, based upon our reading of the facts in the two unrelated robbery cases, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s further conclusion that if he had been charged and convicted of both crimes at the same time, he would have served only a single sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Subsection (b), by its terms, applies only where \u201cthe undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense.\u201d In this case, the offense giving rise to the undischarged sentence was <em>not </em>factored into the calculation of Hunt\u2019s offense level, although it was considered in determining his criminal history score. Hence, subsection (b) is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Moreover, although it has been held by at least one circuit court that \u201crelevant conduct\u201d should be subject to concurrent sentencing under subsection (b), <em>see United States v. Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d 1515 (11th Cir.1997); <em>but see United States v. Williams, </em>260 F.3d 160, 167-68 (2d Cir.2001)(rejecting the <em>Fuentes </em>analysis), the offense giving rise to the undischarged sentence in this case cannot be considered \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) instructs us to treat as relevant conduct certain acts and omissions \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d By its terms, however, this instruction applies <em>\u201csolely </em>with respect to offenses of a character for which \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require <em>grouping </em>of multiple counts .... \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">Section 3D1.2 requires grouping of \u201c[a]ll counts involving substantially the same harm.\u201d To involve \u201csubstantially the same harm,\u201d the counts must come within one of four subsections. The first two of these subsections ((a) and (b)) have no possible application here, notwithstanding that (b) speaks of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan,\u201d because they both specify that the counts must \u201cinvolve the same victim.\u201d Subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tion (c) is likewise inapplicable on its face, which brings us to the final subsection. That subsection has potential application \u201c[w]hen the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss ... or if the offensive behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature ....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Although it is sometimes necessary to make case-by-case determinations with regard to the applicability of \u00a7 3D1.2(d), this guideline contains a bright-line test for many offenses. These are offenses set forth in one or the other of two lengthy lists of specific \u201coffense conduct\u201d guidelines. Offenses covered by guidelines in the first list \u201care to be grouped under this subsection,\u201d \u00a7 3D1.2(d) provides. Offenses covered by the guidelines in the second list, on the other hand, are \u201c[s]pecifically excluded from the operation of this subsection.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In the case before us, the defendant\u2019s various robbery offenses are covered by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 \u2014 a section included in the <em>second </em>list. Because all offenses covered by guidelines named in \u00a7 3D1.2(d)\u2019s second list are \u201c[s]pecifically excluded from the operation of this subsection,\u201d it necessarily follows that the robbery counts against Hunt may not be grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Without grouping, to recapitulate, \u00a7 1B1.3 does not require that the offense giving rise to the undischarged sentence be treated as relevant conduct as \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d That being so \u2014 and because it is obvious that the other offense was not, in the language of \u00a7 5G1.3(b), \u201ctaken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense\u201d \u2014 there is no basis on which to find that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">It follows that \u00a7 5G1.3(c) is applicable here. The commentary interpreting subsection (c) is found in Application Note 3, which provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">[T]he court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-11\">(a) the type <em>(e.g., </em>determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the prior undischarged sentence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-12\">(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-13\">(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in state court rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or different federal court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-14\">(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment (n.3) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">We have made clear that the district court has broad discretion under subsection (c), but that discretion is not without bounds: \u201c[T]he record on appeal should show that the district court turned its attention to \u00a7 5G1.3(c) and the relevant commentary in its determination of whether to impose a concurrent or consecutive sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Covert, </em>117 F.3d 940, 945 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-17\">Here, the defendant argues that the district court abused its discretion in ordering only a partially concurrent sentence by failing to \u201cmak[e] the statutorily required findings on the record.\u201d Whether the district court recited any specific findings on the record, however, is not the test for abuse of discretion. Rather, the question is whether the district court \u201cturned its attention\u201d to the applicable statutes and guidelines. <em>Covert, </em>117 F.3d at 945. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>making this determination, we review \u201cthe totality of the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">For example, in <em>Covert, </em>the court refused to find an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to impose a consecutive sentence in spite of the fact that the district court did not, on the record, specifically invoke the considerations of section 5G1.3(e). 117 F.3d at 946. There, it was implicit that the district court turned its attention to the appropriate factors because, among other things, the defendant\u2019s counsel went through the guideline methodology just prior to the imposition of sentence, and the court made a general statement that it had considered \u201cthe pertinent policy statements ... and the commentary of the sentencing commission.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Here, too, a review of the record as a whole shows that the district court properly turned its attention to section 5G1.3(c) and the applicable commentary before imposing a partially concurrent sentence. First, at the sentencing hearing, the defendant alerted the district court to the fact that the \u201cmost important issue\u201d to be resolved was determining whether and to what extent the two sentences in question would be served concurrently. Second, defense counsel referred the district court to the defendant\u2019s previously-filed memorandum of law regarding the application of section 5G1.3(c) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to Hunt\u2019s sentence and arguing for the sentence to run concurrently. Third, the government responded to the arguments in Hunt\u2019s sentencing memorandum by urging the court to \u201cexercise [its] discretion\u201d in determining whether to give a concurrent or consecutive sentence in light of the government\u2019s position that Hunt\u2019s prior offense \u201cwould not have been grouped\u201d with the crime in this case and \u201cthere would not have been a total concurrent sentence even if\u2019 the cases had been brought at the same time. Fourth, although the district judge did not specifically refer to 5G1.3(c) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), he stated on the record immediately before imposing sentence that he had \u201creviewed the presentence investigation report,\u201d which contained information about Hunt\u2019s prior conviction and sentence, and had \u201ctake[n] everything into account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">We further note that the district court must have \u201cturned its attention\u201d to section 5G1.3(c) by deciding to run Hunt\u2019s sentence in this case <em>partially </em>concurrent with the sentence in the prior case, obviously in an attempt to approximate a \u201creasonable punishment\u201d for the second robbery. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c). Had the district court commenced Hunt\u2019s sentence at the time of his arrest for the prior robbery\u2014 which it had the discretion to do so long as the record showed it first properly turned its attention to the appropriate considerations \u2014 there would have been no incremental penalty for the second offense. Hunt\u2019s 60-month sentence for the firearm conviction does not constitute incremental punishment for the robbery offense, as that sentence must, by Congressional command, run consecutive to any other sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Our holding in <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>15 F.3d 610 (6th Cir.1994), on which Hunt relies, does not change the result. In <em>Coleman, </em>which arose under the 1992 edition of the sentencing guidelines, we vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing where the district court failed to <em>\u201cexpressly </em>turn [its] attention\u201d to the section 5G1.3(c) commentary and perform a specific calculation required under Application Note 3. <em>Id. </em>at 613 (emphasis added). There is, however, a substantial difference in the commentary between the version of the guidelines applicable in <em>Coleman </em>and the version at issue here. The 1992 edition contained a detailed methodology for the district court to consider in exercising its discretion un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>der section 5G1.3(c). However, this detailed methodology has not appeared in the guidelines since they were amended effective November 1995. Indeed, our subsequent decision in <em>Covert </em>\u2014 which was decided under the pre-amendment version of the commentary for section 5G1.3(c)\u2014 shows that the failure to perform the specific calculation on the record does not translate into an abuse of discretion unless the totality of the record shows the district court failed to turn its attention to section 5G1.3(c) and the relevant commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">For the reasons set out above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
