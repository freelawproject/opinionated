R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny Briggs\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Ray T. Briggs appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment following a bench trial in his action alleging that the City of Palmer (the \u201cCity\u201d) violated the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6901-6992k. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">The district court committed harmless error, if any, by denying Briggs\u2019s request for a jury trial, because no reasonable jury could have found in his favor based upon the evidence he presented at trial. <em>See Kulas v. Flores, 255 </em>F.3d 780, 784 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">The district court\u2019s finding that Briggs failed to establish that the City caused the contamination of his groundwater is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>127 F.3d 1154, 1156 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion of Gilbert Shea, Briggs\u2019s domestic partner, to join as a co-plaintiff and add numerous new causes of action because granting the motion would have caused the City prejudice. <em>Cf. Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir. 1999) (affirming denial of plaintiffs motion to amend complaint to add new causes of action because of delay, prejudice, and bad faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Briggs\u2019s motions to compel and motion to suppress his deposition because it is not more likely than not that the rulings affected the judgment against him. <em>See Kulas, </em>255 F.3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Briggs\u2019s motion to recuse Judge Holland because the motion was premised solely on prior rulings adverse to Briggs. <em>See id. </em>at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-18\">Briggs\u2019s contentions regarding the trial transcripts are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-19\">Briggs\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1020-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
