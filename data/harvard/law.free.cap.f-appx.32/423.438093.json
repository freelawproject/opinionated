R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b469-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-20\">Dongerial Alexis Sarah appeals his 346-month sentence imposed following conviction for armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 and use of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">Sarah contends that the district court erred, in light of the constitutional rule recognized in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 </em>U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), when it applied the seven year mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), because whether he \u201cbrandished\u201d a weapon during the robbery was not found beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-22\">We need not decide whether \u201cbrandishing\u201d must be submitted and proven at trial, because we conclude that <em>Apprendi </em>has no application here. Sarah concedes that he was subject to a maximum sentence of 360 months under the facts found by the jury. The record shows that the district court imposed a 346-month term of imprisonment. Because Sarah was sentenced below the statutory maximum, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Sanchez, </em>238 F.3d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-23\">Furthermore, even if we were to apply <em>Apprendi, </em>we would conclude that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the uncontested testimony that the firearm was pointed at a security guard during the robbery. <em>See United States v. Velasco-Heredia, </em>249 F.3d 963, 968 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that sentence imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi </em>stands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>where error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>282 F.3d 758, 771 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>error was harmless where district court\u2019s drug quantity decision at sentencing was supported beyond a reasonable doubt by uncontradicted evidence presented at trial).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b469-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-15\">. Sarah\u2019s June 12, 2001, pro se Motion to Take Judicial Notice was forwarded to counsel and denied on June 28, 2001.
