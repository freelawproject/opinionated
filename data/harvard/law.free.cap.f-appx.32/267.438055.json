Because Ms. Roberts sought a declaration that a state superior court had erred in myriad ways, the district court concluded that the dictates of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine denied it jurisdiction. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">In December 1998, the Los Angeles Fire Department Arson Investigator submitted a 32-page affidavit in support of a warrant to search Ms. Roberts\u2019 residence. After the warrant\u2019s exercise, Ms. Roberts requested a hearing in California Superior Court to challenge its validity pursuant to <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Ms. Roberts alleged that the warrant issued based on an affidavit containing false and misleading statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">Following a <em>Franks </em>hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders found that the warrant issued based on probable cause. Ms. Roberts petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate or prohibition to reverse Judge Pounders\u2019 decision. Ms. Roberts\u2019 petitions included allegations that Judge Pounders exhibited bias and, as a result, that he conducted the <em>Franks </em>hearing improperly in a number of ways. The California Court of Appeal and California Supreme Court both denied the petitions without written opinions on April 16,1999 and May 19,1999, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">Ms. Roberts filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Fourth and Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Amendments in federal district court in the Central District of California. In her complaint, she relates the details of the allegedly false affidavit that precipitated the search of her home. She argues that she was denied a full and fair hearing for a variety of reasons. Ms. Roberts argues that, but for the flaws she alleges, the <em>Franks </em>hearing \u201cwould have resulted in a finding of lack of probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant and a suppression and return to plaintiff of all materials seized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law we review de novo. <em>Harden v. Roadway Package Sys., Inc., </em>249 F.3d 1137,1140 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prohibits lower federal courts from reviewing final decisions of state courts. <em>Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-1006, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994). A losing party in a state action may not seek to vindicate any alleged violation of federal constitutional rights that were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court proceedings. <em>Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). If the federal district court may only grant Ms. Roberts the declaratory and injunctive relief she seeks by determining that the <em>Franks </em>hearing was flawed, the judge was biased, and there was not probable cause to support the search warrant, it may not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Ms. Roberts\u2019 complaint aims at the heart of the state court proceeding. In her federal complaint, Ms. Roberts demands injunctive relief based on unreasonable search and seizure. She contends, among other things, that \u201call rulings of the state court should be vacated. Further ... this entire investigative team is tainted and plaintiff seeks injunctive relief so ordering the removal of the entire team from the investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Ms. Roberts\u2019 request for declaratory relief seeks to disembowel her entire state court proceeding and all decisions and ramifications flowing therefrom. Specifically, Ms. Roberts demands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5c\">a judicial declaration finding that the affidavit in support of the search warrant against plaintiffs residence was false, made in reckless disregard for the truth, and perjurious, and did not support the probable cause required for the issuance of said warrant, that the state court failed to conduct a full and fan-hearing in connection with determining probable cause and the crime/fraud exception, that the state court was biased against her which deprived her of a full and fair hearing, and that the state court completely and inadequately failed to follow the law with respect to mandatory procedure concerning the handling of privileged materials as well as materials that exceeded the scope of the warrant and that the state court acted extra-judicially in releasing the seized materials once the Statement of Disqualification [against the state court judge] was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Ms. Roberts makes exactly the kinds of \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d claims that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">She also contends that, because her request for writs of mandate or prohibition were summarily denied without comment by both the California Court of Appeal and the California Supreme Court, she has been denied a hearing to which she is entitled. Here again she is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Our recent decision in <em>Doe &amp; Associates Law Offices v. Napolitano, </em>252 F.3d 1026 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>(9th Cir.2001) is dispositive. In <em>Doe &amp; Associates, </em>the federal district court denied jurisdiction over Doe\u2019s constitutional challenge to a state grand jury subpoena duces tecum apparently issued as part of an Attorney General review of his law firm\u2019s billing practices. <em>Id. </em>at 1027-1028. Just as Ms. Roberts contends with respect to the materials seized from her home, Doe argued the subpoena would compel disclosure of confidential client information. The state Superior Court denied Doe\u2019s motion to quash part of the subpoena; because the order was non-final and interlocutory \u2014 like that issued by the Superior Court against Ms. Roberts \u2014 Doe had to pursue relief through an extraordinary writ. As in Ms. Roberts\u2019 case, the Arizona Court of Appeals declined to hear the petition on its merits, and the Arizona Supreme Court declined to entertain the petition for review. Neither issued an opinion. After striking out in the state courts, Doe filed a federal claim, alleging Fourth Amendment violations and deprivation of his clients\u2019 constitutional privacy rights. Like Roberts, he sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the subpoena. We held that we lacked jurisdiction to hear Doe\u2019s claim. Considering whether the claims were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d within the meaning of <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>we observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUJ\">the district court could not have found in favor of Doe on the constitutional claims without holding that the state court had erred in denying Doe\u2019s renewed motion to quash. Where the district court must hold that the state court was wrong in order to find in favor of the plaintiff, the issues presented to both courts are inextricably intertwined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Both procedurally and substantively Ms. Roberts\u2019 case is virtually indistinguishable from <em>Doe &amp; Associates. </em>It is clear from the face of her complaint that she could not have the relief she seeks unless the district court expressly held that the state court was wrong in a wide assortment of ways pertaining to her <em>Franks </em>hearing. This is exactly the kind of claim <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>will not tolerate.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-14\">. <em>Franks v.
