Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b813-19\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b813-20\">Indiana inmate James Higgason was disciplined for disorderly conduct and lost 180 days of earned credit time. After exhausting his administrative remedies, he challenged the sanction through a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied relief, and Higgason appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-21\">As a preliminary matter, we reject Indiana\u2019s contention that \u00a7 2254(d) and \u00a7 2254(e)(1) \u2014 which command deference to a state court\u2019s determination of the merits and the facts, respectively \u2014 apply to this case. We have expressly held that prison disciplinary boards are not \u201ccourts\u201d for purposes of those provisions. <em>See Piggie v. McBride, </em>277 F.3d 922, 925-26 (7th Cir. 2002); <em>White v. Ind. Parole Bd., </em>266 F.3d 759, 763-66 (7th Cir.2001). The state apparently believes that <em>Piggie </em>and <em>White </em>left standing earlier decisions implying that the word \u201ccourt\u201d includes prison administrative bodies. <em>See Gaither v. Anderson, </em>236 F.3d 817, 819-20 (7th Cir. 2001); <em>Sweeney v. Parke, </em>113 F.3d 716, 719 (7th Cir.1997); <em>Evans v. McBride, </em>94 F.3d 1062, 1065 (7th Cir.1996). But a plain reading of <em>Piggie </em>and <em>White </em>does not support the state\u2019s position, and we accordingly reaffirm their holdings that \u00a7 2254(d) and \u00a7 2254(e)(1) are irrelevant to collateral review of prison disciplinary board decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>We turn now to the merits. Higgason contends that he did not receive a fair and impartial hearing because, he says, two members of the conduct adjustment board (CAB) \u2014 officers Mundt and Roose \u2014 witnessed the incident that led to the underlying charge for disorderly conduct. But we agree with the district court that the statement of facts in Higgasoris petition establishes only that Mundt and Roose <em>may </em>have witnessed the incident; the petition alleges that Mundt and Roose were in an office adjoining the area where the incident occurred but does not lay out facts showing that the officers saw or heard anything relating to the disciplinary charge. Higgason\u2019s claim is therefore only speculative, which is not enough to survive dismissal. <em>Dellenbach v. Hanks, </em>76 F.3d 820, 822 (7th Cir.1996); <em>see also </em>Advisory Committee Note to Rule 4 of Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts (habeas corpus petition must state facts that point to real possibility of constitutional error); <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 75 n. 7, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">We may quickly dispose of Higgason\u2019s remaining arguments. First, he contends that \u201cno federal court has jurisdiction over any Indiana state prisoner\u2019s federal petition for writ of habeas corpus directed at a CAB conviction ... because pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 the [CAB] must be recognized as a \u2018state court\u2019 as a prerequisite to federal court review.\u201d This is a curious argument since Higgason was the one who filed this case, but in any event .we have said many times before that \u00a7 2254 is the proper vehicle to contest a loss of good-time credits. <em>E.g., Montgomery v. Anderson, </em>262 F.3d 641, 643 (7th Cir. 2001); <em>Moran v. Sondalle, </em>218 F.3d 647, 650-51 (7th Cir.2000). Higgason also contends that CAB members lack authority to sanction him because they are not \u201cstate judicial officers.\u201d All that due process requires, however, is a \u201cneutral and detached\u201d decision-making body, <em>Ramirez v. Turner, </em>991 F.2d 351, 355 (7th Cir.1993), as we have already told Higgason in another one of his many appeals. <em>Higgason v. Lemmon, </em>No. 99-4289, 2001 WL 436180, at *1, 6 Fed.Appx. 433 (7th Cir. Apr.26, 2001). Finally, Higgason argues that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the sanctions he received were excessive in proportion to his offense. But the Eighth Amendment forbids only \u201cextreme\u201d punishment that is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the crime, <em>Koo v. McBride, </em>124 F.3d 869, 875 (7th Cir.1997); <em>see also Leslie v. Doyle, </em>125 F.3d 1132, 1134-35 (7th Cir.1997), which is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
