JoAnne B. Barnhart has been appointed to serve as Commissioner of Social Security, and is substituted as appellee pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b212-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Dennis Davidson appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of supplemental security income. After a careful review of the record, <em>see Pearsall v. Massanari, </em>274 F.3d 1211, 1217 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">In his April 1997 application Davidson alleged disability since December 1988 from chronic back pain. He later added anxiety and nervous disorders. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Davidson could not perform his past relevant work, but that he could perform certain jobs which a vocational expert identified at the hearing in response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">Davidson generally contends that the ALJ ignored evidence of disabling mental impairment. We disagree. The ALJ specifically noted the diagnosed mental conditions, finding that Davidson had severe major depression and a personality disorder, <em>cf. Gowell v. Apfel, </em>242 F.3d 793, 796 (8th Cir.2001) (there is no doubt claimant is experiencing pain, but real issue is how severe that pain is); and contrary to Davidson\u2019s assertion, none of the VA physicians who treated him for mental problems opined that he could not work, <em>cf. Tennant v. Apfel, </em>224 F.3d 869, 870 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (claimant was properly discredited in part based on lack of physician-ordered limitations). Further, the Social Security Administration physicians, like the ALJ, found that Davidson was \u201coften\u201d deficient in concentration, persistence, or pace, not that he \u201coften\u201d decompensated at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Davidson suggests the ALJ improperly discredited him based solely on his demeanor at the hearing. The ALJ did not even mention Davidson\u2019s demeanor. Instead, the ALJ listed the factors from <em>Polaski v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir.1984), and cited multiple inconsistencies in the record on which he based his credibility determination. <em>See Haggard v. Apfel, </em>175 F.3d 591, 594 (8th Cir.1999) (declining to disturb decision of ALJ who considered, but for good cause expressly discredited, claimant\u2019s subjective complaints).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Davidson\u2019s remaining arguments are either unsupported by the record or provide no basis for overturning the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-11\">. The Honorable George Howard, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Jerry W.
