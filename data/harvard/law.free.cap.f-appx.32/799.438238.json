Appellant contends that his sentence should be vacated because it exceeds the statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>mum allowable, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir.2000), <em>overruled in part by United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1182 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc). Appellant further contends that there was insufficient evidence to establish drug quantity and that the district court erred in denying him an adjustment in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Appellant pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)\u00ae, and 846. \u201cA guilty plea \u2018eomprehend[s] all of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gough, </em>152 F.3d 1172, 1173 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 569, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989)) (alteration in original). Section 841(b)(1)(A) carries a penalty of ten years to life; thus, Appellant\u2019s sentence was \u201cwithin the statutory range for the crime to which [he] pleaded guilty\u201d and, accordingly, did not violate <em>Apprendi. United States v. Silva, </em>247 F.3d 1051, 1060 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility was based on its finding that Appellant decided to plead guilty not out of remorse, but because he saw the strength of the government\u2019s case against him. This finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d 944, 947-48 (9th Cir.1999) (reviewing for clear error the district court\u2019s determination as to a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The sentence imposed by the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
