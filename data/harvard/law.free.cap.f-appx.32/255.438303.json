We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 HOSala),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). To succeed on a motion to reopen, an alien must present evidence that is material and was \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d in support of his claims. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 326, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The BIA abused its discretion by considering only two of the four declarations Baria submitted with his motion. <em>Cf. Villanueva-Franco v. INS, </em>802 F.2d 327, 330 (9th Cir.1986) (noting that the BIA decision must make it apparent that the BIA has fully heard and considered the relevant issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The BIA also abused its discretion by concluding that the evidence it did consider was not material because it was not \u201cdispositive\u201d of Baria\u2019s claim. <em>See Elias-Zacarias v. INS, </em>921 F.2d 844, 854 n. 13 (9th Cir.1990) (noting that evidence is material if it \u201ctend[s] to strengthen the alien\u2019s claim for relief ....\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The BIA also abused its discretion by concluding that Baria had \u201cnot presented any evidence regarding any of [the procedural requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)].\u201d <em>Cf. Villanueva-Franco, </em>802 F.2d at 330. To the contrary, Baria submitted evidence that he did not inform his former counsel, Aurelio Arnobit, Jr., of his allegations because he could not locate Arnobit, and that he did not file a complaint with the bar because Arnobit was already disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">To the extent Baria\u2019s motion to reopen was based on claims that the BIA violated his due process rights in its August 25, 1993 decision, his motion was untimely. It was too late for a motion to reconsider <em>(see </em>8 CFR 3.2(b)(2)), and it is inappropriate to argue errors of law in a motion to reopen <em>(see 8 </em>CFR 3.2(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The BIA properly refused to consider Baria\u2019s second motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(2); <em>Bolshakov v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1279,1281 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">We remand for the BIA to reconsider Baria\u2019s initial motion to reopen in light of all the evidence submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b301-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

Under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, however, this new provision does not apply to proceedings initiated prior to April 1, 1997 that result in a final deportation order entered after October 30, 1996.
