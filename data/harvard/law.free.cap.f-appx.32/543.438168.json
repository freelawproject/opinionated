Redschlag opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In this court, Redschlag seeks review of a September 6, 2001 decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board that sustained Redschlag\u2019s removal and affirmed the Administrative Judge\u2019s determination that she did not prove her removal was due to discrimination based on her sex. The Army notes that Redschlag filed an appeal regarding her discrimination claims at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and filed a petition for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The Army argues that Redschlag is prohibited from seeking review of the MSPB decision in two fora. We agree. In <em>Williams v. Department of the Army, </em>715 F.2d 1485 (Fed.Cir.1983) (en banc), this court held that we have no jurisdiction to review a mixed case in circumstances such as these. Here, Redschlag admits that she is seeking simultaneous review in the EEOC and that she may, if necessary, seek additional review in a district court. Despite Redschlag\u2019s arguments that she should be permitted to also seek review in this court, this court\u2019s precedent dictates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">(1) The Army\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
