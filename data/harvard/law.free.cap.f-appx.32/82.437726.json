Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 528 (4th Cir.1998). The Director for the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs for the Department of Labor\u2019s (\u201cthe Director\u2019s\u201d) interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference and will be sustained unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Harris, </em>149 F.3d 307, 309 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>This appeal requires us to construe the fee-shifting provision of Section 28 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928 (1994) (incorporated into the Black Lung Benefits Act (\u201cBLBA\u201d) by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a) (1994)), and its implementing regulation. The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">If ... the person seeking benefits ... utilized the services of an attorney at law in the successful prosecution of his claim, there shall be awarded, in addition to the award of compensation, in a compensation order, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee against the employer or carrier in an amount approved by the deputy commissioner, Board, or court, as the case may be, which shall be paid directly by the employer or carrier to the attorney for the claimant in a lump sum after the compensation order becomes final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A58\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a) (1994). The implementing regulation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">An attorney who represents a claimant in the successful prosecution of a claim for benefits may be entitled to collect a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the responsible operator that is ultimately found liable for the payment of benefits, or, in a case in which there is no operator who is liable for the payment of benefits, from the fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.367(a) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">We agree that the statute does not permit the fees of a lay representative to be shifted to an employer. Further, Kuhn has failed to demonstrate the Director\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u2019s implementing regulation is flawed. We therefore affirm the decision of the Board. <em>See Galle v. Director, OWCP, </em>246 F.3d 440, 451 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 479, 151 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001); <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Director, OWCP, </em>545 F.2d 1176, 1181 (9th Cir.1976); <em>Madrak v. Director, OWCP, </em>7 BLR 1-559 (1984); <em>Harrison v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>3 BLR 1-596 (1981). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b128-17\"> Kuhn and his lay representative, John Cline, successfully prosecuted a claim for black lung benefits. The Board\u2019s decision granting benefits to Kuhn is not at issue in this appeal. The only issue is whether a lay representative\u2019s fee must be paid by the black lung claimant or may be shifted to the employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
