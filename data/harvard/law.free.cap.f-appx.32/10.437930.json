The plaintiff, an employee of the New York Transit Authority, alleges that the Transit Authority and his supervisor William Yost demoted him because of his race, color, and national origin following an investigation concerning falsified time sheets. The plaintiff also asserts that William Yost retaliated against him because of a personal \u201cgrudge\u201d that Yost held as a result of the plaintiffs participation in a 1998 union grievance hearing regarding overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-18\">Having conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s 47-page Report and Recommendation, which was adopted by the district court. <em>See Gonzalez v.
