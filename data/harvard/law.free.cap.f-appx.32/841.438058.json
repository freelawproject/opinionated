Ahmed seeks to challenge his state jury trial conviction and sentence for one count of first degree murder, with a sentence enhancement for personally using a firearm in the commission of the murder. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">We granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the sole issue of whether the district court properly determined that Ahmed\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on our de novo review, <em>see La Crosse v. Kernan, </em>244 F.3d 702, 704 (9th Cir.2001), we conclude that Ahmed has procedurally defaulted his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Federal courts will not review the merits of a \u00a7 2254 petition if the petitioner has procedurally defaulted his claims. <em>Id. </em>A petitioner has procedurally defaulted a claim if he: 1) has not given the state court an opportunity to act on the claim, 2) is now barred from presenting the claim because of the state\u2019s procedural rules, and 3) is unable to demonstrate cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Park v. California, </em>202 F.3d 1146, 1150-51 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 918, 121 S.Ct. 277, 148 L.Ed.2d 202 (2000). For the procedural default rule to apply, application of the state procedural rule must provide an independent and adequate basis on which the state court can deny relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1151 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">The California Supreme Court summarily denied Ahmed\u2019s claims by citing to <em>Ex parte Dixon, </em>41 Cal.2d 756, 264 P.2d 513, 514-15 (Cal.1953) and <em>Ex parte Swain, </em>34 Cal.2d 300, 209 P.2d 793, 796 (Cal.1949). <em>Dixon </em>is known as the default rule, <em>Park, </em>202 F.3d at 1151, and <em>Swain </em>is known as the untimeliness bar, <em>Washington v. Cambra, </em>208 F.3d 832, 833 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 919, 121 S.Ct. 282, 148 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000). Application of the <em>Dixon </em>and <em>Swain </em>rules subsequent to <em>In re Robbins, </em>18 Cal.4th 770, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 153, 959 P.2d 311 (Cal.1998) and <em>In re Clark, </em>5 Cal.4th 750, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729 (Cal.1993) constitutes independent and adequate state grounds barring federal review. <em>Bennett v. Mueller, </em>273 F.3d 895, 899-901 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">The California Supreme Court denied Ahmed\u2019s claims post <em>-Robbins </em>and post-<em>Clark. </em>Ahmed has failed to demonstrate cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the \u00a7 2254 petition as procedurally defaulted. <em>See id. </em>at 899, 902-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b888-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

Instead, Ahmed has raised many other issues, which we do not consider because they fall outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Hiivala v.
