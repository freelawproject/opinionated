Rakoff of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b54-16\">DENYING PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b54-17\">In its petition for rehearing, the government argues that pursuant to <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), this Court should have undertaken a <em>\u201ccausal, evidence-based </em>determination of whether the alleged error affected substantial <em>rights </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the alleged procedural error actually affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d Gov\u2019t Brief in Support of Petition, 28 n.*. The government fails to recognize that <em>Apprendi </em>runs somewhat counter to <em>Ned-er. </em>Thus <em>Apprendi </em>itself did not undertake a <em>Neder </em>analysis. Nor did our <em>in banc </em>opinion in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655 (2d Cir.2001). We conclude that in the circumstances presented in this case as well, <em>Neder </em>does not control. The petition for rehearing is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b54-18\">Judge CALABRESI,</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">concurring dubitante.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-19\">On the one hand, I find it very hard to distinguish <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), and its progeny, including this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>196 F.3d 383 (2d Cir.1999), from the case before us. On the other hand, as the majority of the panel notes, the <em>Neder </em>arguments made here would also have been relevant in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). All this leaves me puzzled, but not sufficiently to justify a dissent. Accordingly, I join the majority\u2019s order, albeit a mite queasily.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
