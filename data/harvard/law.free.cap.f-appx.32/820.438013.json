The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">The district court ruled that the remedial provision of Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12188, does not allow an equitable remedy in monetary form, such as an accounting for unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that the relief sought here is not authorized, given the circumstances of this case, and need not decide any broader question.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-21\">Plaintiffs have not stated a cognizable claim for unjust enrichment. They do not allege that defendant Santa Fe gained profits from its alleged ADA violation that properly belonged to the plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g. Oregon Laborers-Employes Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund v. Philip Morris, </em>185 F.3d 957, 968 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that \u201cto state a cause of action for unjust enrichment, plaintiffs must show that they conferred a \u2018benefit\u2019 on defendants and that it would be unjust for defendants to retain that benefit\u201d). Here, plaintiffs were able to ride other Santa Fe buses during the time that the defendant\u2019s larger and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>non-conforming bus was in service. Under the circumstances, by seeking an accounting for unjust enrichment when Santa Fe did not reap profits that rightfully belonged to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are in essence pursuing punitive damages for defendant\u2019s alleged ADA violation. Damages are not an available remedy for a violation of Title III of the ADA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a-3(a). Thus, the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b866-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-22\">.
