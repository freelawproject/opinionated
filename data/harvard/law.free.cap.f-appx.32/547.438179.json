Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Everett C. Mahl\u2019s appeal because he has appealed from a nonfinal order. Mahl moves for leave to file a response out of time, with response attached. The Secretary replies. Mahl moves without opposition for leave to file a surreply, with surreply attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">On July 30, 1999, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied Mahl\u2019s claim for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10% for post-traumatic stress disorder and for total disability rating based on individual unemployability. Mahl appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and the Secretary moved for remand based on the retroactive provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096. Mahl agreed that his case should be remanded, but argued that such remand should be for the purpose of correcting Board errors unrelated to the VCAA. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims concluded that, in light of the VCAA, the case should be remanded to the Board and, accordingly, vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded for readjudication of Mahl\u2019s claims consistent with the VCAA. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims declined to consider Mahl\u2019s allegations of Board error, noting that \u201ceach of appellant\u2019s additional arguments may be presented to the Board on remand and in the event this appeal should return to the Court, the Court would be in a better position to review the issues after receiving the benefit of the Board\u2019s analysis.\u201d Mahl moved for reconsideration, arguing that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims should have ruled on his allegations of Board error. A majority of the panel denied Mahl\u2019s motion for reconsideration and Mahl appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">This court generally refuses to review nonfinal decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>Williams v. Principi, </em>275 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2002). Departure from this rule is justified only if three conditions are fulfilled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-19\">(1) there must have been a clear and final decision of a legal issue that (a) is separate from the remand proceedings, (b) will directly govern the remand proceedings or, (c) if reversed by this court, would render the remand proceedings unnecessary; (2) the resolution of the legal issues must adversely affect the party seeking review; and, (3) there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand, <em>i.e., </em>that the remand proceeding may moot the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 1364 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-21\">If on remand the Board recommits the alleged errors, Mahl will be free to return to the Court of Appeals for Veterans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Claims and challenge such errors. Consequently, the alleged errors in the 1999 Board decision, if repeated, will survive the remand. In addition, Mahl will be able to challenge the whole of the Board\u2019s readjudication of his claim. Because Mahl\u2019s appeal fails the test of <em>Williams, </em>the appeal is not sufficiently final for the purposes of our review and is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">(3) Mahl\u2019s motion for leave to file his response out of time is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">(4) Mahl\u2019s motion for leave to file a surreply is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">(5) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
