Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 787-91, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>859 F.2d 325, 326 (4th Cir.1988) (discussing doctrine); <em>United States v. Webster, </em>639 F.2d 174, 182-83 (4th Cir.1981) (stating that court must be able to \u201cforesee with reasonable certainty that no adverse collateral consequences will redound to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-22\">Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s orders, and remand for further proceedings. We express no opinion on the timeliness of Morton\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>see Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002), or on the merits of Morton\u2019s claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-23\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-18\"> Although the district court construed the motion for reconsideration as being filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), the motion was filed no later than ten days after entry of judgment and, therefore, should have been construed as a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). <em>See Small v. Hunt, </em>98 F.3d 789, 797 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
