We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Townsend, </em>98 F.3d 510, 511 (9th Cir. 1996) (per curiam). It is an abuse of discretion if the district court failed to apply the correct law, or rested its decision on clearly erroneous findings of material fact. <em>See United States v. Sprague, </em>135 F.3d 1301,1304 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Robins claimed that he was entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 484 of the sentencing guidelines because the weight of the confiscated drug decreased when it \u201csomehow changed from a solid powder state to a liquid state\u201d while in evidence storage. The district court concluded that Amendment 484 was not a basis for decreasing Robins\u2019 sentence because he failed to satisfy his burden of proof. <em>See Sprague, </em>135 F.3d at 1307. The district court\u2019s conclusion was proper. <em>See Townsend, </em>98 F.3d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">Robins also claimed that his sentence should be reduced because if Amendment 487\u2019s definition of \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d was in effect at the time of his sentencing, he would have been sentenced under the \u201ccocaine powder\u201d guideline, not the \u201ccrack\u201d guideline. Amendment 487 by its terms was not retroactive and therefore not applicable to Robins. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lB1.10(a), (c), and n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b491-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\">. We disagree with the government's assertion that we lack jurisdiction. Indeed, we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision not to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Lowe, </em>136 F.3d 1231, 1233 (9th Cir.1998). However, we have jurisdiction in this case because the district court\u2019s decision was one of law, not discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 1232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-20\">. We do not consider the other issues raised in Robins\u2019 briefs because they were not properly presented to the district court for consideration in the first instance. <em>See United States v. Flores-Payon, </em>942 F.2d 556, 558-60 (9th Cir.1991). Moreover, the issues raised by Robins are not relevant to a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
