We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">The district court properly dismissed Ford\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because he failed to allege any facts demonstrating that any defendant was deliberately indifferent to his health and safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970,128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">The district court properly dismissed Ford\u2019s equal protection claim because Ford failed to allege that defendants acted with an intent or purpose to discriminate against him based upon his membership in a protected class. <em>See Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194-95 (9th Cir.1998) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Ford\u2019s complaint without leave to amend because further amendment would have been futile. <em>Cf. Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1007-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
