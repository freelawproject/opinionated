For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-24\">Holthaus claimed that defendants conspired to deprive him of his due process and equal protection rights by selectively prosecuting him and sentencing him more harshly than others who were similarly situated. After carefully reviewing the record, we agree with the district court that Holthaus\u2019s complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to support his claims, <em>see Martin v. Sargent, </em>780 F.2d 1334, 1337 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>(8th Cir.1985), and that the claims would in any event be barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">. The Honorable Ann D.
