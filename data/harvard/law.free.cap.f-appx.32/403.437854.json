The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Wick, finding that Wood failed to state a <em>prima facie </em>case of gender discrimination. The district court also held that in the alternative, even if Wood had stated a <em>prima facie </em>case, she had not raised a genuine question of material fact about whether Wick\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory reason for her termination, a reduction-in-force through the combination of two publications\u2019 advertising departments, was pretextual. Wood appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of Wick, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">We have held on many occasions that establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case is a \u201cminimal\u201d burden. <em>See, e.g., Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Sischo-Nownejad v. Merced Cmty. Coll. Dist., </em>934 F.2d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir.1991). Here, Wood put forth direct evidence of gender bias that more than adequately supported a <em>prima facie </em>case. For instance, Wood offered her own testimony, which was corroborated by that of other witnesses, that her supervisor stated on a number of occasions that a \u201cyoung woman\u201d could not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>form her job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This evidence alone raises the minimal inference of discrimination necessary to support a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Following the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 98 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), Wick rebutted Wood\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case by asserting that her termination was part of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reduction-in-force affecting the entire company. The district court then held that, assuming Wood had stated a <em>prima facie </em>case of gender discrimination, she had failed to create a genuine question of material fact as to whether Wick discriminated against her. However, \u201c[w]hen the plaintiff offers direct evidence of discriminatory motive, a triable issue as to the actual motivation of the employer is created even if the evidence is not substantial.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>150 F.3d at 1221-22. Indeed, we have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">n evaluating whether the defendant\u2019s articulated reason is pretextual, the trier of fact must ... consider the same evidence that the plaintiff introduced to establish her <em>prima facie </em>case. When that evidence, direct or circumstantial, consists of more than the <em>[prima facie </em>] presumption, a factual question will almost always exist with respect to any claim of nondiscriminatory reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\"><em>Sischo-Nounejad, </em>934 F.2d at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Here, the comments by Wood\u2019s supervisor are sufficient direct evidence of discriminatory motive to raise a genuine question of material fact regarding his reasons for terminating her. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>A finder of fact could reasonably construe the supervisor\u2019s comments as expressing a gender stereotype motivated by an unlawful bias. <em>See Cordova v. State Farm Ins. Cos., </em>124 F.3d 1145, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). It is significant that the comments were not isolated \u201cstray remark[s],\u201d <em>Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Group, </em>892 F.2d 1434, 1439 (9th Cir.1990), but instead occurred repeatedly. Moreover, the supervisor\u2019s statements were not general expressions of stereotypical viewpoints, but could be construed as directly related to whether Wood could perform her job.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wood has therefore raised a genuine question of material fact about the reason for her termination, and we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Wick\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Wick cross-appeals the denial of its motion for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). Because we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Wick\u2019s favor, that appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b450-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\">. Because we review the district court's grant of defendant\u2019s summary judgment, we make every reasonable factual inference in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\">. Wood also offered other evidence of discriminatory animus. For instance, she alleged that her supervisor would regularly brush up against her in the hallways of their offices when it was obviously unnecessary for him to do so, and then \u2014 without provocation \u2014 state that he did not mean the contact to be sexual. We have held that evidence of offensive behavior may afford insight into a supervisor\u2019s motivation for employment decisions. <em>Anderson v. Reno, </em>190 F.3d 930, 937 (9th Cir. 1999)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
