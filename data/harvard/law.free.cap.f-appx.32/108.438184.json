He also seeks to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motions to amend the \u00a7 2255 motion in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and to expand the record. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error in the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief. In addition, we note that McBride failed to show cause and prejudice under <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152,167-68,102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982), to excuse his failure to raise on direct appeal his claim under <em>United States v. Rhynes, </em>196 F.3d 207 (4th Cir.1999), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>218 F.3d 310 (4th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1222, 120 S.Ct. 2234, 147 L.Ed.2d 263 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Nor do we find any error in the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of the motion to expand the record or the motion to amend. Even assuming that McBride\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claims related back to the timely filing of his \u00a7 2255 motion, we have held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 573, 151 L.Ed.2d 445 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal substantially on the reasoning of the district court and magistrate judge. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>Nos. CR-96-264; CA-00-239-1 (M.D.N.C. filed Mar. 28, 2001; entered Mar. 29, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
