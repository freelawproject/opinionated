Law contends that his waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude his claims that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) is facially unconstitutional and that his possession of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine was not established. We conclude that the waiver in Law\u2019s plea agreement is valid and applies to his claims. Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The record shows that Law knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty pursuant to a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>285 F.3d 1179, 1182-84 (9th Cir.2000). Because his sentence is in accordance with the plea agreement, Law is precluded from appealing his sentence. <em>See United States v. Abarca, </em>985 F.2d 1012, 1013 (9th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b534-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
