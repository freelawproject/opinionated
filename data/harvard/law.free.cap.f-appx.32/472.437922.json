We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings regarding the calculation of loss for clear error. <em>United States v. West Coast Aluminum Heat Treating Co. </em>265 F.3d 986, 990 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-19\">Armstrong first contends that the district court miscalculated the amount of loss upon which it based a 17-level upward adjustment to his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(R). Based on the evidence before it, the district court did not clearly err by finding that the amount of loss to Armstrong\u2019s victims exceeded $40 million. <em>See id. </em>at 991-92 (stating the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-20\">Armstrong further contends that the district court violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) by failing to submit the amount of loss to the jury. Because Armstrong\u2019s 108-month sentence was less than the statutory maximum, we find this contention unavailing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>(prescribing a maximum sentence of ten years); <em>West Coast Aluminum Heat Treating Co., </em>265 F.Bd at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b518-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
