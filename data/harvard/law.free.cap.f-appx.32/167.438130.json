The evidence does not support an inference that the named defendants knew of his need for protection, or of his subsequent need for medical care. <em>See Johnson v. Bi-State Justice Ctr., </em>12 F.3d 133, 135-36 (8th Cir. 1993) (hearing to determine whether pro se inmate\u2019s \u00a7 1983 damage claims warrant jury trial is permitted, but hearing must be consistent with right to jury trial and standard is whether case would survive motion for judgment as matter of law). We further conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Johnson\u2019s request to call additional witnesses at the evidentiary hearing. <em>Cf. Williams v. Carter, 10 </em>F.3d 563, 566 (8th Cir.1993) (decision to grant or deny subpoenas for indigent parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(c) is within discretion of trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-19\">. The Honorable George Howard Jr., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable H. David Young, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
