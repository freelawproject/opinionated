We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Jayson\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App.. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on June 28, 2001. Jayson\u2019s notice of appeal was filed at the earliest on November 11, 2001. Because Jayson failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
