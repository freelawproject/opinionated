Holy Family Hosp., </em>121 F.3d 537, 540 (9th Cir.1997) (25 pound lifting restriction does not establish disability). Kersey claims to have a ten pound lifting restriction, but that restriction applied to her back injury and not fibromyalgia, the impairment that she now asserts is a disability; all of her more recent work releases either mention a weight limit obviously controlled by <em>Thompson </em>or fail to mention a lifting restriction at all. Kersey\u2019s limitations with regard to prolonged sitting, standing, or walking do not substantially limit major life activities, nor do her limitations with respect to repetitive twisting, bending, kneeling, or reaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Kersey fails to meet her burden to demonstrate that the impact of her fibromyalgia condition will be permanent or long-term. <em>See Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 122 S.Ct. 681, 691, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">Kersey did not exhaust her ADA retaliation claims through the appropriate administrative channels, and thus may not pursue them here. <em>See Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 275 (1st Cir. 1999). Furthermore, she has provided no grounds for disbelieving Costco\u2019s legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for its actions. <em>See Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1105, 1121 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), <em>cert. granted, </em>532 U.S. 970, 121 S.Ct. 1600, 149 L.Ed.2d 467 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
