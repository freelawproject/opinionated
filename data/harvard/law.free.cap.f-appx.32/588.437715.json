Court appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, Docket No. CH0752000713-I-1, dismissing the appeal of his June 3, 2000 removal as a WG-9 Carpenter with the Department of Veterans Affairs. After thoroughly reviewing the submissions, we <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-35\">The Administrative Judge, in his Initial Decision, stated that \u201che heard the agreement as it was read into the record\u201d and concluded that it was \u201clawful on its face, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the parties freely entered into it, and the underlying subject matter was within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, the appeal was dismissed on October 27, 2000. The full Board denied review, and Mr. Court appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Mr. Court argues that his agreement to the settlement was not voluntary, that he entered into to it as the \u201clesser of evils.\u201d He states that he believed that the Administrative Judge would find for the DVA, so he felt compelled to accept settlement to protect his future employment prospects even though he believed it \u201cwrong.\u201d He does not allege that the DVA has not fulfilled its obligations under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It is well established that the choice between unpleasant alternatives does not render that choice involuntary and invalidate the resulting settlement. <em>See Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed.Cir.1984) (\u201cThe fact that an employee is faced with an inherently unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unpleasant alternatives does not make an employee\u2019s decision any less voluntary.\u201d). Accordingly, the Board\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Court\u2019s action must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
