R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Melvin R. Hassell appeals pro se the district court\u2019s order dismissing without leave to amend his action alleging, among other things, violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-68 (\u201cRICO\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and, after de novo review, <em>Schmier v. U.S.Ct. of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, </em>279 F.3d 817, 824 (9th Cir.2002), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">The district court properly concluded that Hassell\u2019s RICO claim arising from an October 1994 corporate merger was barred by the four-year statute of limitations. <em>See Grimmett v. Brown, </em>75 F.3d 506, 510-12 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">The district court was not required to inform Hassell of the deficiencies with his amended complaint and grant him leave to amend because it was clear that he could not allege a timely RICO claim. <em>See Noll v. Carlson, </em>809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987) (a notice of deficiencies and opportunity to amend are not required when amendment would not cure the complaint\u2019s deficiencies).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">Hassell\u2019s contention that the district court improperly relied upon a transcript of a settlement hearing among the parties in a related state court action is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">We do not consider the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hassell\u2019s remaining causes of action and imposition of Rule 11 sanctions, because Hassell does not challenge those rulings on appeal. <em>See Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>797 F.2d 727, 738 (9th Cir. 1986) (\u201cCourt of Appeals will not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">We deny all pending requests for sanctions and costs pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38 and for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Fed. RApp. P. 39, without prejudice to the filing of such motions in accordance with Fed. RApp. P. 38 and Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-18\">We also deny without prejudice Alpha Omega Publications, Inc.\u2019s motion for judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b999-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
