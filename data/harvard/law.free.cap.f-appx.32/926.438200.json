We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Sommatino v. United States, </em>255 F.3d 704, 707 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">Because the \u201cno disconnect\u201d rule, 47 C.F.R. 54.401(b) (1997), was declared invalid and removed by the Federal Communications Commission, the district court was correct in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction arising from this regulation. <em>See </em>64 F.R. 60349, 60357-60358; <em>see also Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel v. FCC, </em>183 F.3d 393, 421-24 (5th Cir.1999) (holding that the FCC exceeded its jurisdiction when it imposed the \u201cno disconnect\u201d rule). Further, Casserley\u2019s first amended complaint did not provide an alternative basis for subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Ove v. Gwinn, </em>264 F.3d 817, 821 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that court is not required to accept as true conclusory allegations of law). Also, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Casserley\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Kona Enter. v. Estate of Bishop, </em>229 F.3d 877, 883 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b972-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
