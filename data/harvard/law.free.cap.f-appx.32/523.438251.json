Winder, United States District Court for the District of Utah, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b570-12\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"Ap4\">SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">Plaintiffs brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that violations of the Fourth Amendment led to the shooting death of decedent Lance Krebs. Defendants Chris Monroe, Ricardo Martinez, and Michael LeBlanc moved for summary judgment, claiming qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion, holding that plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence to create factual disputes precluding summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. Defendants appeal. Because we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">As the Supreme Court has recently reiterated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-18\">Qualified immunity is \u201can entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). The privilege is <em>\u201can immunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As a result, \u201cwe repeatedly have stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) <em>(per curiam).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-19\"><em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156,150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (emphasis in original). For these reasons, the Court has held that \u201ca district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, <em>to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, </em>is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806 (emphasis added). The Court has made it clear, however, that where issues of fact preclude a legal determination that a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity from suit, an order denying qualified immunity is not final and appealable. <em>See Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 312-13, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996); <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 312-14, 115 S.Ct. 2151,132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <em>see also Foote v. Spiegel, </em>118 F.3d 1416, 1422 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>(10th Cir.1997); <em>Sevier v. City of Lawrence, </em>60 F.3d 695, 700 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In the case before us, plaintiffs filed a civil rights action alleging, among other things, that the fatal shooting of the decedent, arising out of an attempt by sheriff\u2019s deputies to arrest him at his father\u2019s home for suspected domestic violence, violated the Fourth Amendment. One of the deputies fired the fatal shot, another fired but missed, and a third did not fire at all but was allegedly in charge with respect to the decision to arrest decedent with guns drawn. The three deputies filed motions for summary judgment, claiming they are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court, at a hearing on the motion, denied summary judgment. The court made findings at the hearing but did not set forth its findings in a written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Relying on <em>Armijo v. Wagon Mound Pub. Sch., </em>159 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir.1998), defendants argue that the district court failed to make sufficient specific findings, thereby giving this court jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s determination that there are fact issues precluding summary judgment on defendants\u2019 claim of qualified immunity. Plaintiffs contend the district court\u2019s findings, as laid out at the hearing, are sufficiently detailed and support the court\u2019s conclusion that fact issues preclude summary judgment. Therefore, plaintiffs assert, we lack jurisdiction over defendants\u2019 interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">As we have noted, this court does not have interlocutory jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s determination that genuine issues of fact preclude summary judgment on a claim of qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 1259. In <em>Behrens </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>the Court recognized the difficulties presented when a district court does not fully identify the particular conduct of defendants that it deemed adequately supported by evidence to defeat a pre-trial determination of qualified immunity. In such a case, an appellate court must undertake a review of the record \u201cto determine what facts the district court, in light most favorable to the nonmoving party, likely assumed.\u201d <em>Behrens, </em>516 U.S. at 313, 116 S.Ct. 834 (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>515 U.S. at 319, 115 S.Ct. 2151). Our independent review of the record makes clear there are multiple questions of fact regarding defendants\u2019 conduct in the death of decedent that preclude our review of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Because there are disputed issues of fact precluding judgment in defendants\u2019 favor, we have no jurisdiction over this appeal. Accordingly, we DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction defendants\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b570-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
