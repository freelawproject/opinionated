We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">Livingstone was granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on (1) whether appellant may raise on collateral review a claim that his sentence is unconstitutional based on the new rule of constitutional law enunciated in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and, if so, (2) whether appellant\u2019s sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>because he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years based on the judge\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs involved in his offense. The first COA issue is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>282 F.3d 664, 666-72 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on initial collateral review). Accordingly, we do not reach the second COA issue, regarding the merits of Livingstone\u2019s claim. <em>See id. </em>at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AWM\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
