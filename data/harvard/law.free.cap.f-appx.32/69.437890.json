At the time Tidwell filed his petition, the district court had taken no significant action in this case for over four years. We directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the United States to respond to the mandamus petition. In reply, the United States informed us that the district court was prepared to file its final order. We have since received a copy of the order. Tidwell therefore has received the relief he sought through his mandamus petition. Accordingly, we deny the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
