However, the Supreme Court has held that a \u00a7 2255 motion will not be considered successive if the prior motion was dismissed for technical or procedural reasons. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-86, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Stewart v. Martinez Villareal, </em>523 U.S. 637, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">In 1998, attorneys representing Webb filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court dismissed this motion due to counsel\u2019s failure to comply with local rules. Because this prior motion was not dismissed on the merits, Webb\u2019s instant motion cannot be considered successive and he did not need to seek leave from this court prior to its filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-19\">For this reason, we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s order, and, without indicating any view as to any other procedural or substantive issue presented by Webb\u2019s motion, remand the matter for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-20\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-16\"> Although Webb was convicted in 1996, and the present petition was filed in 2001, he argues that his \u00a7 2255 motion is timely due to an alleged impediment to filing. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. The district court did not address this issue when it summarily denied Webb\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as successive. We express no opinion as to the timeliness of the motion. <em>Cf. Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701, 707 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
