We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review the BIA\u2019s decision under the substantial evidence standard. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We review Petitioner\u2019s claims of due process violations de novo, <em>Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Persecution is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d that includes the \u201c \u2018infliction of suffering or harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1043-44 (9th Cir.1998) (citation omitted); <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (explaining that persecution is \u201c \u2018an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">Although the IJ made an adverse credibility finding, the BIA credited Huang\u2019s testimony, but found that the events Huang described did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998). Huang testified that he was forced to write a self-criticism letter, was suspended from school, and was transferred to work for a construction company in his home town that was not accepting of him. He complains of ostracism in that he was not invited by his employer and co-workers to a national day of celebration that is specifically related to the founding of the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China by the Communist Party (\u201cPRC\u201d). Fully credited, this evidence does not compel a finding of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995) (four to six hour detention by Fiji military did not constitute past persecution even though detention included physical abuse); <em>Kazlauskas v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 902, 907 (9th Cir.1995) (prevention of advancement to the university is not enough to rise to the level of past persecution); <em>cf. Desir v. Ilchert, </em>840 F.2d 723, 727 (9th Cir.1988) (multiple arrests in combination with \u201csevere beatings\u201d constitutes past persecution). Although we recognize that Huang suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>mistreatment by the PRC, we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to compel a finding of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">If an asylum applicant does not establish past persecution, he must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution by establishing a genuine fear of persecution and by introducing credible, direct, and specific evidence supporting an objectively reasonable fear of persecution. <em>Singh, </em>134 F.3d at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Huang relied on the same evidence of past persecution to support his fear of future persecution. He also testified that, while in the United States, he subscribed to two periodicals and wrote a letter that was published, using his true name, in <em>China Spring, </em>a Chinese language periodical advocating democratic reform in China. Although Huang\u2019s fear of future persecution because of these activities may be subjectively genuine, he fails to demonstrate that his fear is objectively reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 966 (petitioner\u2019s fear of persecution if he is returned to his native country must be subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable). Huang fails to demonstrate how the subscriptions and the published letter would subject him to any danger. <em>See id. </em>at 967 (noting that petitioner cannot simply prove that there exists a generalized or random possibility of persecution; he must know that he is at a particular risk \u2014 that his predicament is appreciably different from the dangers faced by his fellow citizens). As the BIA correctly noted, \u201c[a] subscription to a magazine in the United States is a passive act.\u201d Moreover, the mere publication of Huang\u2019s letter by <em>China Spring, </em>without more, does not establish that the Chinese government would view the letter as a cause for persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Finally, the record is devoid of any evidence that Huang\u2019s family, still resident in China, has experienced any harm from his departure to the United States or because of his published letter. <em>See Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 571 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201c[Alien\u2019s] claims are further undercut by the fact that his father and brother have not been harmed, and they apparently still reside unmolested in El Salvador.\u201d); <em>Estrada v. INS, </em>775 F.2d 1018, 1021-22 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe absence of harassment of an alien\u2019s family tends to reduce the probability of persecution.\u201d). The BIA properly considered the continued safe residence of Huang\u2019s family in China as a factor to be weighed in deciding whether Huang has a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Therefore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Huang failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481; <em>Aruta v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389,1393 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"ARs\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b916-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
