Simmons pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) (1994). The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to twenty-seven months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief arguing that the District Court should have granted a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.4 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines because of Simmons\u2019s artificial leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-19\">We conclude that the District Court did not plainly err by not departing downward sua sponte. Counsel acknowledged at sentencing that Simmons did not qualify for departure, and Simmons received the sentence he requested. <em>See United States v. Carrasco, </em>271 F.3d 765, 767-68 (8th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>248 F.3d 777, 779-80 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny all other pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-14\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
