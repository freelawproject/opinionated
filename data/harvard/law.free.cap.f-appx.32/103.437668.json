Accordingly, we deny Milton\u2019s motion to place his appeal in abeyance, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Milton, </em>Nos. CA-95-74; CA-00-31-7 (W.D.Va. Aug. 1, 2001; Aug. 30, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-12\"> Milton appeals the denial of his motion for a certificate of appealability by a magistrate judge, correctly noting that the magistrate judge was without authority to enter a final order disposing of his motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636 (West 1993 &amp; Supp.2001). While the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to enter a final order on this post-judgment motion, we find relief is not warranted, as we have considered Milton\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and determined it to be without merit. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
