The ultimate question on appellate review of a district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>See, e.g., Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., 252 </em>F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Tropicana Products, Inc., </em>690 F.2d 312, 315 (2d Cir. 1982). An abuse of discretion could consist of an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, <em>see, e.g., Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), or a \u201cdecision [that,] though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding[,] cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions,\u201d <em>Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., 252 </em>F.3d at 169. We see no such error or abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
