In complaints filed in July 1997 that were later consolidated, the government alleged that Lowney defaulted on several student loans from New York University, Rutgers University and the State University of New York at Buffalo that the federal Department of Education had guaranteed in the 1970s. After extensive litigation regarding both Lowney\u2019s liability to the government and the amount she owed, the district court in a memorandum and order dated November 13, 2000, granted in part the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and directed the government to submit an order indicating the total amount of judgment. The district court subsequently denied Lowney\u2019s motion for reconsideration of its order. On April 18, 2001, the district court signed a judgment indicating that Lowney owed the government $4,226.76, which represented the loans\u2019 principal balances, accrued interest and costs. Lowney now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">After careful review of the record, we hold that the district court correctly rejected Lowney\u2019s defenses to liability, which concerned the statute of limitations, lack of personal service, and res judicata. However, we find that further consideration is warranted with respect to Lowney\u2019s contention that she is entitled to some degree of forbearance on the loans due to her teaching service and participation in Volunteers in Service to America (\u201cVISTA\u201d). Lowney submitted some evidence that she had worked as a teacher, but she did not present evidence that she ever actually applied for forbearance as 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 674.52(a) requires. It is within the discretion of the district court to permit Lowney to submit evidence of her application as well as relevant evidence pertaining to service as a VISTA volunteer. We also find that remand is required for further proceedings on the issue of the precise amount due on the loans. The government concedes that its evidence on this issue did not conform to the district court\u2019s direction to provide specific information regarding the making of the loans, the payments on the loans and the balances as of the date of the month preceding the government\u2019s summary judgment motion. In addition, the government acknowledges that the calculations of amounts due must consider receipts from New York University that Lowney submitted to the court and offsets from Lowney\u2019s federal income tax refunds. We therefore vacate that portion of the judgment relating to the amount Lowney owes on the defaulted student loans and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>We have considered all of defendant-appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
