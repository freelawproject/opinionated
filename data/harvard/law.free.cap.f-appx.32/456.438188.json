We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258. We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, <em>see Duckett v. Godinez, </em>67 F.3d 734, 739 (9th Cir.1995), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Federal habeas appeals are governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which requires this Court to examine whether the state court determinations were \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Under this standard, habeas relief is available only when we are firmly convinced that the state court clearly erred in its application of federal law. <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Mefford raises three errors in his habeas appeal. First, Mefford claims that his conviction was based on an erroneous jury instruction on lying-in-wait, in violation of due process. After hearing the evidence, the jury was allowed to convict Mefford of first degree murder if it found either premeditation, lying-in-wait, or felony murder. Mefford claims that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of lying-in-wait and that this basis should have been excluded from the jury. Even assuming that this factual deficiency existed, his conviction is valid because there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction on alternative grounds. <em>See Griffin v. United States, </em>502 U.S. 46, 59-60, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991); <em>People v. Guiton, </em>4 Cal.4th 1116, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45, 51 (Cal.1993). The prosecution introduced evidence, which if believed, could support a finding of premeditation and deliberation. The jury was instructed to disregard any instruction that it found unsupported by the evidence. In such a case, \u201cbecause a jury is \u2018equipped to analyze the evidence^J\u2019 ... a court may assume that it rested its verdict on the ground that the facts supported.\u201d <em>Keating v. Hood, </em>191 F.3d 1053, 1062 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Griffin, 502 </em>U.S. at 59, 112 S.Ct. 466). Even if the instruction was erroneous, it had no \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the verdict. <em>Shumway v. Payne, </em>223 F.3d 982, 986 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">II. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">Mefford also raises two claims of evidentiary errors related to his alleged fear of the Mexican mafia. A state court\u2019s evidentiary rulings do not give rise to habeas relief unless they violate federal rights. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Mefford claims that these evidentiary rulings violated his Sixth Amendment and Due Process rights. A criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense, however, is \u201cnot unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\u201d <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). And in order to violate due process, the rulings must be errors so egre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>gious that they render the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Estelle, </em>502 U.S. at 72-73, 112 S.Ct. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">A. Mefford\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Mefford sought to introduce evidence of his mental state on the night of the shootings to bolster his claim of self-defense. The court ruled that if Mefford were to put his mental state at issue, the prosecution could offer alternative explanations for his nervous mental state, including limited references to Mefford\u2019s other felonies and his fugitive status. Mefford claims that he limited his testimony regarding the Mexican mafia because of this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Even assuming that the trial court erred in this ruling, it did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. Mefford testified about his fears of the Mexican mafia, the failed drug transaction, and the death threats he had received. He has not specified what other testimony he would have submitted or how he was constitutionally harmed by the exclusion of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">B. Limitation of Defense Expert</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In addition, Mefford also claims that the court improperly restricted the testimony of a defense expert. Because of this restriction, Mefford decided not to put on his rebuttal expert and claims that the limitation was a violation of due process and his right to present evidence. However, \u201c[t]he qualifications of an expert witness are for the trial court,\u201d <em>see People v. Penny, </em>44 Cal.2d 861, 285 P.2d 926, 929 (Cal. 1955), which has \u201cconsiderable latitude\u201d in making this determination. <em>People v. Kelly, </em>17 Cal.3d 24, 130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240, 1250 (Cal.1976). The trial court\u2019s \u201cruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the defense expert\u2019s expertise to those years in which he had direct knowledge of the drug trade. The defense expert specifically admitted to the trial court that he had no knowledge of the relevant state of the methamphetamine trade during the time period subsequent to his tenure as a narcotics officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">The trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings with respect to Mefford\u2019s testimony are not errors, let alone errors so egregious as to violate due process. In addition, the rulings do not violate Mefford\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense. Any error in jury instruction did not prejudice the defendant. Accordingly, the state appellate court\u2019s affirmation of his conviction did not violate clearly established federal law, and his federal habeas petition was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
