Willett\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">On March 16, 1999, the United States Postal Service terminated Willett\u2019s contract as a mail carrier, due to her failure to lock the mail compartment of her vehicle which resulted in the theft of 11 bags of registered mail. The contracting officer\u2019s cancellation letter informed Willett of her options to appeal to the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals (PSBCA) within 90 days or bring an action before the Court of Federal Claims within 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-22\">Willett appealed to the PSBCA. The PSBCA denied her appeal and Willett appealed to this court. On July 10, 2001, this court dismissed that appeal for failure to file a brief. Meanwhile, on March 28, 2001, Willett filed a complaint challenging the termination of her contract at the Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed her complaint because, inter alia, Willett had already challenged the contract termination before the PSBCA and because Willett\u2019s complaint was filed more than one year after the contracting officer\u2019s decision. Willett now appeals that dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-23\">The United States argues that the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 judgment should be summarily affirmed. We agree. Summary disposition of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994). In the present case, it is clear that summary disposition is warranted. Dismissal of Willett\u2019s complaint was appropriate both because she had previously challenged the contract termination before the PSBCA and because her complaint was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-24\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b600-25\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-26\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
