We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Balint v. Carson City, </em>180 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc). We must determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether genuine issues of material fact exist and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. <em>Id. </em>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Appellants first argue that the district court erred in finding that there were no triable issues of material fact as to their contract and bad faith claims. We agree. Royal Maccabees denied disability benefits to Dr. Ortiz on the ground that he was not under the \u201cregular care\u201d of a physician. Under the policy, \u201cregular care\u201d means \u201ccare and treatment as required by the physician.\u201d Under the section entitled, \u201cExceptions Reductions and Limitations Of This Policy,\u201d the insurance contract provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">We pay no benefits for Disability or Loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">- Unless you are under the regular care of a physician other than yourself. This requirement may be waived under the terms of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">The reasonable expectations of the insured are to be protected. <em>See Saltarelli v. Bob Baker Group Med. Trust, </em>35 F.3d 382, 386-87 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Cat-Farm Ins. Co. v. TAC Exterminators, Inc., </em>172 Cal. App.3d 564, 572-73, 218 Cal.Rptr. 407 (1985). Moreover, \u201c[ajccording to the law of California and, indeed, every other state as well as the District of Columbia, ambiguities in insurance contracts must be construed against the insurer. This rule of <em>contra proferentem </em>has been called \u2018the most familiar expression in the reports of insurance cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kunin v. Benefit Trust Life Ins. Co., </em>910 F.2d 534, 538-39 (9th Cir.1990) (quoting 2 G. Couch et al., <em>Couch on Insurance 2d. </em>\u00a7 15:74, at 334 (rev. ed.1984)) (footnote omitted); <em>see also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Partridge, </em>10 Cal.3d 94, 101-02, 109 Cal.Rptr. 811, 514 P.2d 123 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">Dr. Ortiz visited Dr. Hernandez on seven occasions during the months of February, March, and April, 1998. Additionally, the record details that Dr. Hernandez had prescribed Valium to Dr. Ortiz, which he \u201ccontinued to take ... until the time of his death.\u201d Athough six months had elapsed between the last time Dr. Ortiz saw his physician and the date of his suicide, there is a triable issue of fact as to whether, in light of these facts and the applicable rules of contract interpretation, Dr. Ortiz remained under the \u201cregular care\u201d of Dr. Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>We also agree that the district court erred in finding no triable issues of material fact as to the claims for wrongful death. To prevail on a wrongful death claim, Appellants must prove that Royal Maccabees\u2019 conduct was a substantial factor in causing Dr. Ortiz\u2019s death. <em>Bromme v. Pavitt, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1498, 7 Cal. Rptr.2d 608 (1992). Under California law, Royal Maccabees\u2019 conduct may be found to be a substantial factor in causing Dr. Ortiz\u2019s death even though' Dr. Ortiz committed suicide. <em>See Wilson v. Blue Cross, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 660, 672, 271 Cal.Rptr. 876 (1990) (where an insured was denied hospitalization benefits and thereafter committed suicide, a cause of action for wrongful death may arise if the conduct of the insurance company or its agents was a substantial factor in bringing about the suicide).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Appellants presented more than a scintilla of evidence linking Royal Maccabees to Dr. Ortiz\u2019s suicide, including, Dr. Ortiz\u2019s own statement to the insurance company that his life depended on it fulfilling its obligations under the disability contract. In light of the foregoing, summary judgment was also inappropriate as to Appellants\u2019 punitive damages claim. <em>See Pistorius v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>123 Cal.App.3d 541, 555-56, 176 Cal.Rptr. 660 (1981) (breach of covenant of good faith sufficient to support award of punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">We disagree with Appellants\u2019 argument that triable facts exist as to the claims for professional negligence and promissory fraud against the insurer\u2019s agent. An insurer (or its agent) is not required to offer any particular coverage unless certain specific conditions exist (such as that the insured asked for such coverage). <em>Fitzpatrick v. Hayes, </em>57 Cal. App.4th 916, 927, 67 Cal.Rptr.2d 445 (1997); <em>see also Tenzer v. Superscope, Inc., </em>39 Cal.3d 18, 30, 216 Cal.Rptr. 130, 702 P.2d 212 (1985) (\u201c \u2018[Something more than nonperformance is required to prove the defendant\u2019s intent not to perform his promise.\u201d) (citations omitted). Given our resolution of the appeal, we need not address any of the other arguments raised by Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
