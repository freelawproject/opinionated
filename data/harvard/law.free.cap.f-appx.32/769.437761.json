That litigation began more than a quarter of a century ago, and in 1976 the district court ordered the school district to desegregate its schools pursuant to an approved plan. <em>See McPherson v. School Dist # 186, </em>426 F.Supp. 173 (S.D.Ill.1976). In January 2000 the school district filed a motion to modify the desegregation order. After the district court granted that motion, Collins filed a motion to intervene as of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2). The district court denied Collins\u2019s motion, and she appeals, appearing once again pro se on behalf of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">On appeal the parties focus their attention on whether the district court properly denied Collins\u2019s motion to intervene. We must confront a preliminary question, however, and that is whether Collins may prosecute this appeal pro se on behalf of her children. <em>See Navin v. Park Ridge Sch. Dist, </em>270 F.3d 1147, 1148-49 (7th Cir.2001) (per curiam); <em>see also Wenger v. Canastota Cent Sch. Dist, </em>146 F.3d 123, 125 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam) (court has obligation to sua sponte consider pro se representation of child). Litigants in federal court have a statutory right to proceed pro se. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 (permitting parties to \u201cplead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel\u201d). But that right is limited to self-representation; a nonlawyer may not proceed pro se on behalf of another. <em>See Lewis v. Lenc-Smith Mfr. Co., </em>784 F.2d 829, 830 (7th Cir.1986) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>569 F.2d 448, 451 (7th Cir.1978); <em>Machadio v. Apfel, </em>276 F.3d 103, 106 (2d Cir.2002); <em>Fymbo v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>213 F.3d 1320, 1321 (10th Cir. 2000); <em>Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1021 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Herrera-Venegas v. Sanchez-Rivera, </em>681 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 1982). This rule similarly applies where a parent proceeds on behalf of a child under Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(c), <em>see T.W. by Enk v. Brophy, </em>124 F.3d 893, 895 (7th Cir.1997); thus, a parent may not proceed pro se on behalf of a child, <em>see Navin, </em>270 F.3d at 1149 (IDEA case); <em>Collinsgru v. Palmyra Bd. of Educ., </em>161 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir. 1998) (IDEA case); <em>Wenger, </em>146 F.3d at 124-25 (IDEA case); <em>Johns v. County of San Diego, </em>114 F.3d 874, 876 (9th Cir. 1997) (civil rights case); <em>Cheung v. Youth Orchestra Found., </em>906 F.2d 59, 61 (2d Cir.1990) (civil rights case); <em>Meeker v. Kercher, </em>782 F.2d 153, 154 (10th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (civil rights case); <em>cf. . Machadio, </em>276 F.3d at 106-07 (nonlawyer parent could proceed pro se on behalf of child in social security case because parent had a financial stake in outcome); <em>Harris v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 413, 416-17 (5th Cir.2000) (same). As the court in <em>Cheung </em>reasoned, the choice to appear pro se is not a \u201ctrue choice\u201d for minors and therefore they are entitled to trained legal assistance so that their rights may be fully protected. <em>See </em>906 F.2d at 61. Collins is a not lawyer and she has not retained a lawyer to prosecute this appeal. Her pro se representation of her children is therefore forbidden, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
