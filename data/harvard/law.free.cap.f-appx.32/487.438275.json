R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b533-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">Penny Ray appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to correct errors in the pre-sentence report or to seal it pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(1). We affirm on the alternative grounds that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>153 F.3d 1037, 1045 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that this Court can affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any grounds supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-23\">In two separate prior appeals we affirmed Ray\u2019s jury-trial conviction for exporting blade cutters to China in violation of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778, <em>United States v. Lee, </em>183 F.3d 1029 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1128, 120 S.Ct. 963, 145 L.Ed.2d 835 (2000); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>187 F.3d 650 (9th Cir.1999) (unpublished table opinion), ce<em>rt. denied, 528 </em>U.S. 1128, 120 S.Ct. 963, 145 L.Ed.2d 835 (2000), and we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate her conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Ray, </em>29 Fed.Appx. 457 (9th Cir.2002) (unpublished table opinion). Ray did not pursue her Rule 32 motion until both of her prior appeals had been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-24\">Rule 32 sets forth the procedure which the district court must follow when a defendant alleges any factual inaccuracy in a pre-sentence report. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1). The defendant must \u201cchallenge factual inaccuracies during imposition of sentence, not later.\u201d <em>United States v. Freeny, </em>841 F.2d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam). \u201cThus, once the district court has imposed sentence, the court lacks jurisdiction under Rule 32 to hear challenges to a presentence report.\u201d <em>United States v. Catabran, </em>884 F.2d 1288, 1289 (9th Cir.1989) (per curiam). Because Rule 32 does not create a jurisdictional basis for a motion filed after sentence is imposed, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Ray\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b533-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
