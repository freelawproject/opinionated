Alvarez-Ramirez\u2019s attorney has filed \u00e1 brief and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Alvarez-Ramirez has filed pro se supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">Alvarez-Ramirez\u2019s counsel identifies three potential issues for appeal, the first being whether Alvarez-Ramirez\u2019s guilty plea was intelligent and voluntary. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>record shows that the magistrate judge complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in taking the plea, and that Alvarez-Ramirez understood the nature of the guilty plea proceedings and pled guilty knowing the consequences, of his decision and not as a result of improper coercion, promises or threats. His guilty plea was therefore intelligent and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>203 F.3d 614, 618-19 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Counsel next identifies the potential issue of whether the district court abused its discretion by only departing downward two levels for \u201csentencing entrapment.\u201d However, Alvarez-Ramirez cannot challenge on appeal the extent of the district court\u2019s departure. <em>See United States v. Riggins, </em>40 F.3d 1055, 1058 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Counsel finally identifies the potential issue of whether Alvarez-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is constitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Counsel correctly concludes, however, that no reversible <em>Apprendi </em>error occurred in this case. <em>See United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 861-62 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply where guideline sentencing increase in offense level \u201cdid not increase the maximum penalty for the crime to which [defendant] pled guilty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We have considered the issues raised in Alvarez-Ramirez\u2019s pro se briefs and find them to be meritless. To the extent Alvarez-Ramirez attempts to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, we decline to consider such a claim in this direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Laughlin, </em>933 F.2d 786, 788 (9th Cir. 1991) (\u201cAs a general rule, we will not review challenges to the effectiveness of defense counsel on direct appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Our independent review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no other issues requiring further review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b394-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
