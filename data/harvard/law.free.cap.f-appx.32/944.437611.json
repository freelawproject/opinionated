We disagree. \u201cThere is no doubt that issuance of a certificate of appealability is a jurisdictional prerequisite to appeal.\u201d <em>Gatlin v. Madding, </em>189 F.3d 882, 886 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1087, 120 S.Ct. 815, 145 L.Ed.2d 686 (2000). However, this certificate was adequate to satisfy jurisdictional requirements. <em>See id.; Furman v. Wood, </em>190 F.3d 1002,1005 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">This petition as filed was wholly unexhausted, as petitioner\u2019s counsel appropriately noted at oral argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the petition contained no exhausted claims, the district court lacked jurisdiction and was obliged to dismiss the federal petition immediately; neither amendment nor a stay was permissible. See <em>Jiminez v. Rice, </em>276 F.3d 478 (9th Cir.2001). Exhaustion is the only issue properly before us, because Brewer has failed to clearly raise the issues of excuse and procedural default on appeal. Because the petition was properly dismissed, we need not reach the equitable tolling issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b990-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-10\">. The state <em>did not </em>waive exhaustion. <em>See 28 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2254(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-11\">. This is a particularly critical step given that Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act time limits often mean that a dismissal without prejudice has the effect of permanently barring the door to federal habeas corpus review-as it does here. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b991-8\">McKEOWN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8A\">Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Dismissal without prejudice for failure to exhaust is inappropriate where, as here, there was a claim of procedural default. An exception to the exhaustion requirement allows consideration of unexhausted claims where \u201cthere is an absence of available state corrective process.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(B)(i); <em>see O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 848,119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999) (stating that the majority agrees with Justice Stevens\u2019 \u201cdescription of the interplay between\u201d exhaustion and procedural default); <em>id. </em>at 853-56 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The exhaustion analysis is thus only the first step; the court must go on to consider procedural default, with its attendant excuses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Brewer asserts on appeal that the district court \u201crefused to anticipate any procedural defaults,\u201d and specifically that \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d excuse his failure to exhaust Ground Two of his amended petition. The state remedies may well be procedurally defaulted, particularly under Nevada Revised Statute 34.726, which requires post-conviction petitions to be filed within a year. <em>See Pellegrini v. State, </em>34 P.3d 519 (Nev.2001) (clarifying Nevada procedural law); <em>Petrocelli v. Angelone, </em>248 F.3d 877, 887 (9th Cir.2001) (acknowledging \u201ctension in our case law regarding the adequacy of Nevada\u2019s procedural bars\u201d). Assuming the claims are defaulted, the petitioner\u2019s assertion of cause and prejudice as to Ground Two must be considered as a potential exception to the procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">I would therefore remand as to Ground Two, for consideration of procedural default and cause and prejudice. I agree that on appeal Brewer waived objection to this error as to Grounds One and Three. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>also agree with the majority\u2019s remaining determinations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
