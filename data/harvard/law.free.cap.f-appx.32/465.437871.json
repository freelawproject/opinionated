The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not recited herein, except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-19\">The INS argues that Ng may be detained pursuant to \u00a7 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c), which provides for mandatory detention for certain aliens pending the finality of their removal proceedings. After briefing was completed in this appeal, we decided <em>Kim v. Ziglar, </em>276 F.3d 523 (9th Cir.2002). <em>Kim </em>held that INA \u00a7 236(c) is unconstitutional as applied and that the INS must release lawful permanent residents on bond unless they would pose a flight risk or a danger to the community. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 539. As Ng is a lawful permanent resident, <em>Kim </em>dictates that he is entitled to a bond hearing for his release pending the result of his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-20\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b511-21\">Because the mandate has issued in <em>Kim, </em>the INS\u2019s motion to hold the appeal in abeyance is DENIED as moot. Ng\u2019s request to take judicial notice of certain documents is similarly DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b511-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
