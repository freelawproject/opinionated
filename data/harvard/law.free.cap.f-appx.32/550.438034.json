Picolet moves to stay proceedings pending resolution of <em>Airington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>v. Principi, </em>01-7075, 2002 WL 539088 (Fed.Cir.2002). The Secretary of Veterans Affairs opposes and moves to to dismiss Picolet\u2019s appeal because she has appealed from a nonfinal order. Picolet responds. The Secretary replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On March 23, 1999, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied Picolet\u2019s claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder. Picolet appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, seeking a remand addressing alleged Board error. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded for re-adjudication of Picolet\u2019s case in accordance with the retroactive and potentially veteran-friendly provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims declined to consider Picolet\u2019s allegations of Board error, noting that there was an \u201cinsufficient basis for review\u201d at the time, and that \u201c[t]he appellant will be free to raise these arguments on remand [and] will be free to submit additional evidence and argument on the remanded claim[.]\u201d There is no indication that Picolet moved for reconsideration of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">This court generally refuses to review nonfinal decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>Williams v. Principi </em>275 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2002). Departure from this rule is justified only if three conditions are fulfilled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">(1) there must have been a clear and final decision of a legal issue that (a) is separate from the remand proceedings, (b) will directly govern the remand proceedings or, (c) if reversed by this court, would render the remand proceedings unnecessary; (2) the resolution of the legal issues must adversely affect the party seeking review; and, (3) there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand, <em>ie., </em>that the remand proceeding may moot the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1364 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">If on remand the Board recommits the alleged errors, Picolet will be free to return to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and challenge such errors. Consequently, the alleged errors in the 1999 Board decision, if repeated, will survive the remand. In addition, Picolet will be able to challenge the whole of the Board\u2019s readjudication of her claim. Because Picolet\u2019s appeal fails the test of <em>Williams, </em>the appeal is not sufficiently final for the purposes of our review and is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">(2) Picolet\u2019s motion to stay proceedings is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
