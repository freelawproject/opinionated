We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-21\">Jimenez-Juaregui contends the district court erred by denying his request for a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a). We review the district court\u2019s determination that Jimenez-Juaregui is not entitled to this reduction for clear error, <em>United States v. Dia, </em>69 F.3d 291, 292 (9th Cir. 1995), and we are satisfied that JimenezJuaregui \u201c[was] not the rare defendant who accepts responsibility after trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Sotelo, </em>109 F.3d 1446, 1449 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-22\">Jimenez-Juaregui also contends that the district court erred by increasing his base offense level 16 levels under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on a finding that he had been previously deported following an aggravated felony conviction. The qualifying aggravated felony was Jimenez-Juaregui\u2019s prior conviction of Felony Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 484.379(l)(c). After the district court rendered its decision in this case, we reviewed similar driving under the influence statutes and concluded that they were not crimes of violence, and therefore could not be counted as an aggravated felonies. <em>See United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140,1146 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Portillo-Mendoza, </em>273 F.3d 1224, 1227-28 (9th Cir.2001). Thus, as the government con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>cedes, Jimenez-Juaregui\u2019s prior conviction was not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d at 1146. Accordingly, we vacate Jimenez-Juaregui\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b305-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
