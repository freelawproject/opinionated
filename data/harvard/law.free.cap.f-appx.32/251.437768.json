Haggerty sued Federal when it rejected Haggerty\u2019s tender of defense for an underlying lawsuit brought by Haggerty\u2019s former employers, Travelways, Inc. (\u201cTravelways\u201d) and Stardust Executive Transportation, Inc. (\u201cStardust\u201d). Because the facts are known to the parties, we cite them herein only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">I. Arguments Raised For The First Time on Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">This court will only review an issue that has been raised for the first time on appeal under certain narrow circumstances, one of which is when the issue is purely one of law that does not require a developed factual record. <em>Marbled Murrelet v. Babbitt, </em>88 F.3d 1060, 1063-64 (9th Cir.1996). The decision to consider an issue not raised below is discretionary, and we do not address the issue if it would prejudice the other party. <em>See Kimes v. Stone, </em>84 F.3d 1121,1126 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Haggerty\u2019s arguments raised <em>for </em>the first time on appeal concern the purported ambiguity of the terms \u201cunder this coverage section\u201d and the term \u201ctotal assets,\u201d as those terms are used in the \u201cChanges in Exposure\u201d provision. We exercise our discretion to consider Haggerty\u2019s new arguments as they are questions of law. <em>See Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 18, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619 (1995) (interpretation of insurance contracts is a question of law).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">II Stardust Automatically Became An Insured Under The \u201cChanges in Exposure\u201d Policy Provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The underlying goal of Haggerty\u2019s appeal is to demonstrate that Stardust was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under its\u2019 parent company\u2019s policy, the purpose of which is essentially to except the claim from the \u201cinsured-versus-insured\u201d exclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Haggerty lodges three attacks by parsing the language in the \u201cChanges in Exposure\u201d provision in the policy in order to accomplish this goal. None of his arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">A. \u201cUnder This Coverage Section\u201d Is Not Ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">First, Haggerty argues that the term \u201cunder this coverage section\u201d in the \u201cChanges in Exposure\u201d section of the Policy is ambiguous. The purported ambiguity exists, he argues, because \u201cunder this coverage section\u201d can reasonably be read to limit the application of the 1998-1999 policy to that single policy year. Because Haggerty tendered his claim in May 1999, during the renewed policy period, he seems to assert that Stardust was no longer covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">There is no ambiguity. A clear reading of the provision confirms that the term \u201cunder this coverage section\u201d limits coverage to subsidiaries acquired during the policy period. However, the district court did not find that Stardust attained its status as an insured under the 1999-2000 policy from this provision. Rather, it became insured under the renewed 1999-2000 policy because the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d on that policy is \u201cGlobal Passenger Services and its Subsidiary(ies).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Stardust became a subsidiary of Travel-ways in 1998, there is no doubt it qualified as an insured when Haggerty tendered his claim in 1999. Haggerty\u2019s attempt to ere-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ate an ambiguity out of the term \u201cunder this coverage section\u201d where none exists, fails. <em>See La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club, Inc. v. Industrial Indemnity Co., </em>9 Cal.4th 27, 37, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048 (1994) (courts will not adopt an ambiguity where none exists).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">B. \u201cTotal Assets\u201d Is Unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Haggerty next argues that the district court wrongly found the term \u201ctotal assets\u201d unambiguous and argues for the first time on appeal that the term \u201ctotal assets\u201d is ambiguous because it is uncertain whether the term should include goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u201cTotal assets\u201d appears in the second paragraph of that section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">If the fair value... paid by the Insured Organization for any such acquisition [of an organization] exceeds 10% of the total assets of the Parent Organization as reflected in the Parent Organization\u2019s most recent audited consolidated financial statements, the Parent Organization shall give written notice of such acquisition. .. [to Federal] as soon as practicable....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Thus, Global was required to give Federal notice when it acquired an organization whose value exceeded 10% of Global\u2019s \u201ctotal assets.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To determine Global\u2019s \u201ctotal assets\u201d both the parties and the district court relied on Global\u2019s December 31, 1997 balance sheet for figures reflecting the company\u2019s worth. Finding the term unambiguous, the court used the line item figure on Global\u2019s balance sheet, which listed \u201ctotal assets\u201d as $122,565,072. The parties do not dispute that Stardust\u2019s purchase price was $9,221,019. According to these calculations, the notice requirement was not triggered by the acquisition of Stardust.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Nonetheless, Haggerty argues that the term \u201ctotal assets\u201d is ambiguous because it is uncertain whether the term should include goodwill. Accepting his calculations, the acquisition of Stardust for $9,221,019 would exceed 10% of Global\u2019s \u201ctotal assets\u201d and trigger the notice in the \u201cChange in Exposure\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Haggerty has failed to demonstrate that the term \u201ctotal assets\u201d is ambiguous. The policy specifically refers to \u201ctotal assets as reflected in the Parent Organization\u2019s most recent audited consolidated statement.\u201d The term does not stand alone, but must be interpreted in context to find its plain meaning. <em>Bank of the West v. Superior Court, 2 </em>Cal.4th 1254, 1265, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545 (1992) (language in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract). When read in conjunction with the qualifying phrase, its meaning is clear. \u201cTotal assets\u201d means the amount reflected on Global\u2019s balance sheet as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">As the district court found, \u201ctotal assets\u201d means just what its ordinary and plain meaning would suggest. It does not mean that one type of intangible asset, namely goodwill, should be indiscriminately subtracted from the sum total. The term is unambiguous and Stardust did not exceed 10% of Global\u2019s \u201ctotal assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">The district court made no error in finding Haggerty was excluded from coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>under the \u201cinsured-versus-insured\u201d exclusion in Federal\u2019s Policy and, therefore, was not entitled to coverage for the underlying State Court Action. The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b298-21\"> This disposition is not intended for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\">. Because jurisdiction for this case is based upon diversity, this court applies California substantive law. <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., </em>107 F.3d 1344, 1346 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\">. Haggerty overlooks the obstacle he creates if he is able to prove Stardust is not an insured: if Stardust is not an insured, neither is he, as a Stardust officer. Notably, he never addresses whether he is seeking coverage in his capacity as a former Travelways officer or as a former Stardust officer. Because we find Stardust is an insured, however, we need not give this predicament further attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b299-18\">. Global Passenger Services (\"Global\u201d) is the parent company of Travelways.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\">. Because the first paragraph of the \"Change in Exposure\u201d section provides that subsidiaries automatically become insured, Haggerty assumes the second paragraph, in which \"total assets\u201d is used, affects coverage of subsidiaries. Specifically, Haggerty argues that the notice provision is a condition precedent to Stardust's coverage. Following his logic, failure to give notice when an acquisition exceeds 10% of total assets would result in negating coverage for a subsidiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
