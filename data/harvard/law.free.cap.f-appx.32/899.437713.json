We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104,1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Carrillo contends that the district court erred by dismissing his petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) because he was entitled to equitable tolling. The district court properly found, however, that Carrillo was not entitled to equitable tolling because his counsel\u2019s failure to notify him that the California Supreme Court had denied his petition does not constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling. <em>See Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that counsel\u2019s negligence did not constitute extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling where petitioner had no statutory right to assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b946-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
