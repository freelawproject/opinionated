We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">On September 6 and September 19, 1996, Freddy Vegas (a paid informant) met with Cervera and Samuel Zugasti (Cervera\u2019s co-conspirator) to arrange and complete a methamphetamine purchase. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Douglas Cypher observed and recorded both meetings, resulting in an audiotape of a September 6 meeting (\u201cthe September 6 audiotape\u201d), a transcript of that tape (\u201cthe September 6 transcript\u201d), an audiotape of a September 19 meeting (\u201cthe September 19 audiotape\u201d), a transcript of that tape (\u201cthe September 19 transcript\u201d), and a videotape of that meeting (\u201cthe September 19 videotape\u201d or, simply, \u201cthe videotape\u201d). At trial, Vegas, Zugasti, and Cypher testified against Cervera. Cervera advances six arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">First, we reject Cervera\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s destruction of the September 19 audiotape and videotape after his conviction but before his appeal prejudiced his appeal. Athough we strongly disapprove of the government\u2019s reckless treatment of the two items,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cervera does not assert bad faith, and we find no prejudice because the destroyed evidence was not crucial to establishing guilt. <em>United States v. Heiden, </em>508 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir.1974). The audiotape and videotape simply corroborated eyewitness testimony by Cypher (a federal law enforcement agent who observed the meeting), Vegas (a paid informant who participated in the meeting), and Zugasti (a co-conspir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ator who also participated in the meeting). In addition, the audiotape and videotape were largely unintelligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Second, Cervera\u2019s contention that the government\u2019s failure to turn over the videotape and the two transcripts during discovery amounted to a <em>Brady </em>violation fails. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194,10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Although the prosecution\u2019s curious decision to provide only an abridged version of the videotape during discovery (waiting until trial to reveal the full videotape) is troubling, the videotape was not crucial to the trial outcome for the reasons cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Regarding the audiotapes, Cervera contends that the prosecution failed to give him the transcripts at all, and also that it gave them to him only one week before trial. Because Cervera had the audiotapes eight months before trial and could have made transcripts from them had he wanted, and the government provided the transcripts immediately upon making them, one week before trial, there was no discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Third, we reject Cervera\u2019s argument that the court erred in admitting the September 6 transcript and the September 19 audiotape and transcript into evidence because substantial portions of both audiotapes were unintelligible. Although the audiotapes are uniformly poor and partly unintelligible, the unintelligible portions are not \u201cso substantial that the recording as a whole is untrustworthy.\u201d <em>United States v. Lane, </em>514 F.2d 22, 27 (9th Cir. 1975). Furthermore, we reject Cervera\u2019s authenticity challenge. The court translator, law enforcement officers, and Vegas all testified to the audiotapes\u2019 authenticity and the transcripts\u2019 accuracy. Lastly, Cervera\u2019s Rule 403 objection fails because the probative value of the intelligible inculpatory evidence in the audiotapes outweighed any theoretical prejudice that might have resulted from their being played. We find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Fourth, we reject Cervera\u2019s argument that the rereading of the September 19 transcript to the jury in response to its request during deliberations was improper. When the jury asked to hear both audiotapes and read both transcripts, the court consulted trial counsel and properly exercised its discretion in having its law clerk read only the September 19 transcript. The court reasonably feared that playing the audiotape would allow the jury to place undue weight on the intelligible portions, and it admonished the jurors to rely primarily on their recollections as opposed to the transcript. Although Cervera criticizes the admonitions themselves as unduly emphasizing the transcript (by referring to it as \u201cevidence\u201d), because those warnings were clear and explicit in cautioning the jurors against relying too much on the transcript, this argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Fifth, we reject Cervera\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Cervera\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to transcribe the audiotapes himself; his reliance on the government\u2019s transcripts, which he found adequate, was reasonable. Counsel\u2019s decision not to seek redaction or partial exclusion of the September 19 audiotape, which counsel used to attack Zugasti on cross-examination, pointing out his co-conspirator status, immunity arrangements, and history of lying, was within the range of professionally competent assistance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">Sixth, we reject Cervera\u2019s argument that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because his sentence of 151 months on each count was within the statutory maximum of 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b860-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-14\">. In its brief before this court, the government maintains that it destroyed the items pursuant to the DEA's normal destruction policy. If the DEA actually employs a policy that tolerates-let alone mandates-the destruction of evidence before a case is complete (i.e., at least before the time for filing an appeal has run), we find such a policy highly questionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
