During the pendency of the appeal, the Virginia Department of Corrections issued revised inmate religious property regulations and implemented them effective September 1, 2001. The revised regulations, in explicit terms, do not condition an inmate\u2019s access to religious items on proof of religious heritage. Because these department-wide regulations satisfy the declaratory and injunctive relief requested by Boyce and he does not allege an ongoing violation, we dismiss the appeal as moot. <em>See Toms v. Allied Bond &amp; Collection Agency, Inc., </em>179 F.3d 103, 105 (4th Cir. 1999) (holding that plaintiff must have concrete interest in litigation while case is on appeal or appeal may be dismissed as moot). We deny Boyce\u2019s requests for costs associated with filing the complaint and appeal because he does not qualify for such under either Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) or Fed. R.App. P. 38. We deny Boyce\u2019s motions for summary judgment and appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
