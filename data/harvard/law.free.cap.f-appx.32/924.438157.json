We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">Alarcon contends that the district court erred by including two motorcycles as relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), resulting in an incorrect loss amount determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b). We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination that behavior is \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under the guidelines. <em>United States v. Kahlon, </em>38 F.3d 467, 470 (9th Cir.1994). We also review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of the amount of loss at sentencing. <em>United States v. Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d 944, 949 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-19\">First, Alarcon contends that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that either the \u201cMgrdichian\u201d motorcycle was stolen, or even if stolen, that it constituted relevant conduct. We disagree. The district court accepted as credible the testimony of an undercover agent who gave evidence that the motorcycle was stolen. The district court\u2019s determination that the Mgrdichian motorcycle was stolen, and that the theft was a reasonably foreseeable act in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), was plausible in light of the record. <em>See Phoenix Eng\u2019g &amp; Supply Inc. v. Universal Elec. Co., </em>104 F.3d 1137, 1141 (9th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Accordingly, we conclude that there was no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-20\">Alarcon next contends that the district court erroneously attributed the loss amount of the \u201cMansion Mike\u201d motorcycle. Even if we agreed with Alarcon\u2019s contention, the values of both the Mgrdichian and the Mansion Mike motorcycles must be excluded from the loss amount determination to have an effect on Alarcon\u2019s offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b). In light of our determination regarding the Mgrdichian motorcycle, we do not reach Alarcon\u2019s claim regarding the Mansion Mike motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>cycle. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>234 F.3d 483, 491 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b970-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
