Kraynak alleging it was entitled to rescind an insurance policy based on Kraynak\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations on his insurance application. Kraynak filed a counterclaim for benefits under the policy. Lutheran filed a motion for summary judgment, and Kraynak filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, and a motion for partial summary judgment. The District Court granted Lutheran\u2019s motion and denied Kraynak\u2019s motions. Kraynak now appeals. For the reasons set forth by the District Court, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-24\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same standards as the District Court properly did. <em>Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120,130 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-25\">The District Court applied Pennsylvania law which provides: \u201c[A]n insurance contract is void if (1) the representation was false; (2) the insured knew it to be false when made or acted in bad faith; and (3) the representation was material to the risk being insured.\u201d <em>Matinchek v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., </em>93 F.3d 96,102 (3d Cir.1996). The court properly concluded that three fraudulent misrepresentations made by Kraynak in the course of obtaining disability insurance from Lutheran supported Lutheran\u2019s decision to rescind the insurance policy. First, he did not include on his application the fact that he was covered by other disability insurance policies. Second, he did not cancel any other disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>insurance as promised in his application. Third, he did not inform Lutheran that he had been diagnosed with arthritis \u201cduring the last ten years.\u201d We also agree with the District Court that laches does not bar Lutheran from pursuing its recission claim. Kraynak was not prejudiced by a \u201clack of diligence\u201d on the part of Lutheran \u201cin pursuing its rights.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Dennis J. Iulo, </em>564 Pa. 205, 766 A.2d 335, 338 (Pa.2001). First, Lutheran had no affirmative duty to investigate Kraynak\u2019s representations to it, and, second, the knowledge of a district representative is not binding on Lutheran.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">For the above reasons, we agree that Lutheran is entitled to rescind its policy and will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Lutheran, as well as its denial of Kraynak\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment, and its motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
