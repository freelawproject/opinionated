We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-22\">Cabrera-Arias contends that his three-year mandatory minimum sentence violates the Eighth Amendment because it exceeds the applicable sentencing guideline range, and because there is no safety valve provision. Because Cabrera-Arias raises this claim for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error, <em>see United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999), and find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-23\">Cabrera-Arias offers no support for his assertion that there is a constitutional right to the establishment of a safety valve for a three-year mandatory minimum sentence. Congress\u2019 determination that a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) warrants a three to ten year sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>154 F.3d 1082, 1084 (9th Cir.1998) (finding a 95-year mandatory minimum sentence for five counts of armed robbery did not violate the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-24\">Accordingly, we see no unconstitutional disproportionality or Eighth Amendment violation in this sentence. <em>See id. </em>(concluding only punishments grossly disproportionate to the crime are forbidden by the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b524-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
