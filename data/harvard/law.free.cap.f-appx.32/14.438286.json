The district court sentenced Schettler to a custodial term of eighty-two months followed by a four-year term of supervised release. On this appeal, Schettler claims that his conviction should be reversed because the trial court failed to suppress evidence and statements tainted by a warrantless search of Schettler\u2019s home. After a careful review of this matter, we are convinced that there was no error in denying Schettler\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">Review of a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to suppress evidence is plenary. See <em>United States v. Williams, </em>3 F.3d 69, 71 (3d Cir.1993). Review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact on a motion to suppress, including a subsidiary finding that a defendant\u2019s consent to search was voluntary, is for clear error. See <em>United States v. Kim, </em>27 F.3d 947, 954-55 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">At the suppression hearing on January 16, 2001, the district court correctly concluded that Schettler was illegally seized when postal inspectors directed him to open the front door of his home. The court noted that no reasonable person would have believed that he was free to remain in the house. Having found that Schettler was illegally seized, the district court was obligated to analyze the subsequent statements and evidence under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. See <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (mandating that a district court deciding whether evidence obtained following a Fourth Amendment violation is admissible must consider \u201c[t]he temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, the presence of intervening circumstances, ... and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-17\">The district court denied Schettler\u2019s motion to suppress. The court concluded that Schettler voluntarily invited the postal officers into his kitchen and the officers minimized the coerciveness of the setting by holstering their weapons and limiting the number of the officers present in the kitchen. The court also explained that Schettler had been given his Miranda rights and signed various consent forms. The court considered Sehettler\u2019s age and educational background and found that he was an educated, middle-aged man. In the final analysis, the court declared \u201cthat any technical seizure which may have occurred on the porch is of no moment inso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>far as the suppression issues involved in this motion are concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Schettler contends that the district court failed to follow the law of Brown by not discussing the temporal proximity of the search or the statements to the illegal seizure, not mentioning the intervening circumstances, and not considering the purpose or flagraney of the illegal seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We conclude that the district court did follow the basic parameters of <em>Brown v. Illinois. </em>Schettler executed the consent forms while sitting at his kitchen table in a relatively calm, relaxed atmosphere. The postal inspectors had put their weapons away and the number of officers in the kitchen was limited. Schettler was allowed to go to the bathroom, he was over fifty years old, he had some college education, and he was employed. The encounter was not unduly prolonged and the officers engaged in no physical or psychological pressure or coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We reject Schettler\u2019s contention that the district court rested its ruling entirely on the fact that Schettler was given his Miranda warnings and was informed that he did not have to consent to a search. It is true that Brown unequivocally states that giving Miranda warnings does not, by itself, purge the taint of the illegal seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 95 S.Ct. 2254 (explaining that if Miranda warnings, by themselves, were held to attenuate the taint of an unconstitutional arrest, the effect of the exclusionary rule would be substantially diluted). In this case, however, the court also considered Schettler\u2019s age, educational background, the lack of coercion on the part of the officers, and the postal inspector\u2019s explanation of the consent forms. Further, consideration of the Brown factors was unnecessary to determine that the taint of the illegal seizure had been purged.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction and sentence entered against Schettler will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
