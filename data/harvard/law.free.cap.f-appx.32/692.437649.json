The Defendants, various prison officials, filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because Johnson had not exhausted his administrative remedies as to every claim. The district court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-19\">Subsequently, the district court discovered that three of Johnson\u2019s previous actions had been dismissed as frivolous or malicious or for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court ordered Johnson to pay the filing fee within twenty days or risk dismissal of the lawsuit. When Johnson failed to comply with this order, the court dismissed the action without prejudice for non-payment of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-20\">Johnson appealed, and the Defendants cross-appealed, seeking a review of the court\u2019s order denying their motion to dismiss and another order that the Defendants supply Johnson with copies of certain administrative regulations. Johnson\u2019s appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute. It is Defendants\u2019 cross-appeal that is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-21\">We dismiss the appeal for want of standing. A party must be aggrieved by a final order in order to have standing to appeal. <em>See Deposit Guaranty Nat\u2019l Bank v. Roper, </em>445 U.S. 326, 333-34,100 S.Ct. 1166, 63 L.Ed.2d 427 (1980); <em>HCA Health Servs. of Va. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>957 F.2d 120, 123 (4th Cir.1992). Here, the Defendants are not aggrieved by the final order; indeed, that order bears no substantive relationship to either of the earlier orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. The motions to consolidate and to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, for reconsideration, and for \u201cpanel hearing or rehearing en banc\u201d are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
