We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258. We review de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Russell contends that the district court erred by dismissing his petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) because he was entitled to equitable tolling. The district court properly found, however, that Russell was not entitled to equitable tolling because he has not demonstrated that his own lack of diligence did not account for his failure to file a timely petition. <em>See Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107 (stating external forces, rather than a petitioner\u2019s lack of diligence, must account for his failure to file a timely claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
