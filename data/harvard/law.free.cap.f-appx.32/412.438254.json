We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see United States v. Baker, </em>256 F.3d 855, 859 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-17\">Penn-Harris contends that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by erroneously advising him that under the plea agreement, the maximum sentence he would receive was 60 months. He further contends that as a result of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-18\">Because counsel\u2019s advice was not based on a gross mischaracterization of the likely outcome, counsel\u2019s performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-92, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Keller, </em>902 F.2d 1391, 1394 (9th Cir.1990). Moreover, Penn-Harris was repeatedly informed that his actual sentence would be within the sole discretion of the district court notwithstanding any predictions or agreements of the parties, and he acknowledged that the maximum sentence of 40 years could be imposed. He was not therefore prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance. <em>See Doganiere v. United States, </em>914 F.2d 165, 168 (9th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 1346,1348 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-19\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b458-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
