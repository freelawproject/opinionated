R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(c). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Michael Scott Morgan was convicted of three counts of unlawful possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), two counts of giving false statements to a licensed firearms dealer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), and three counts of possession of a firearm while subject to the terms of a judicial protective order, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>922(g)(8). </em>He was sentenced to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, a fine of $1,000, and a monetary assessment of $100 per count. We exercise our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">At trial and on the initial stages of appeal, Mr. Morgan was represented by counsel. During his appeal, however, Mr. Morgan fired his attorney and proceeded pro se. Upon receipt of Mr. Morgan\u2019s appellate brief, we determined Mr. Morgan should have counsel and appointed one to represent him. After counsel made several attempts to contact Mr. Morgan, Mr. Morgan finally responded on April 23, 2001 and identified four additional issues that are before us. Mr. Morgan did not file a separate pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Counsel for defendant has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), indicating his belief that the record contains no meritorious issues for appeal. Defense counsel has also filed a motion requesting leave to withdraw as counsel, stating his belief that the issues raised on appeal are frivolous. As required, a copy of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and motion to withdraw were provided to defendant, <em>see id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel related that defendant wished to raise several issues. The first two issues were raised in Mr. Morgan\u2019s initial pro se appellate brief: (1) whether he must abide by laws that are allegedly repugnant and unconstitutional; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and (2) whether as a descendant of participants in the American Revolution that Mr. Morgan, as a \u201cpeacemaker,\u201d must suffer at the hands of those who have impugned his character. Aplt\u2019s <em>Anders </em>Br. at 15 (quoting pro se opening br. at 3). The next five issues were raised at the suggestion of Mr. Morgan after conferring with appointed counsel; they include: (3) ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) unfair enhancement of sentence; (5) malicious and selective prosecution; (6) Mr. Morgan lacked the mental capacity to understand the charges against him; and (7) his prosecution was pursuant to an illegal Bill of Attainder. Finally, counsel raised an insufficiency of the evidence claim, culling together various strands of Mr. Morgan\u2019s pro se filings. The record indicates that none of the above issues was raised before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Pursuant to our duty under <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, we have conducted an independent review of Mr. Morgan\u2019s conviction and sentence and we agree with counsel\u2019s conscientious review of the record and conclusion that the appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As to Mr. Morgan\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, for which he provides no legal argument or record cites, we note that this \u201cclaim[ ] should be brought in collateral proceedings, not on direct appeal. Such claims brought on direct appeal are presumptively dismissible, and virtually all will be dismissed.\u201d <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>56 F.3d 1239, 1240 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc) (citing <em>Beaulieu v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 805, 808 (10th Cir.1991)). Our review of the record confirms that this is not one of those \u201crare instances\u201d permitting consideration of ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we dismiss Mr. Morgan\u2019s ineffective assistance claims, while noting that this does not bar its assertion in a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>at 1241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">After a thorough review of the record, this court also agrees that Mr. Morgan\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim is frivolous. In evaluating challenges to the sufficiency of evidence, this court applies the following standard: \u201c[E]vidence both direct and circumstantial, together with reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, is sufficient if, when taken in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Emanuel, </em>14 F.3d 1469, 1472 (10th Cir.1994) (quotations omitted). We will overturn a jury\u2019s finding only if no reasonable juror could have reached the disputed verdict. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>130 F.3d 1432, 1440 (10th Cir.1997). This purposefully high hurdle, faced by a party challenging a jury verdict, \u201creflects a deep respect for the fact-finding function of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>42 F.3d 586, 589 (10th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">There is evidence that Mr. Morgan \u2014 a convicted felon, according to an ATF determination \u2014 in fact purchased a rifle, a pistol, and ammunition for both, and that he intended to purchase a third firearm. After this purchase, a police officer stopped Mr. Morgan, who had a loaded shotgun in his possession in his truck, along with other devices. The testimony at trial showed that Mr. Morgan had been served with protective orders by officers who witnessed the same. Mr. Morgan also testified about his prior felony conviction and that he indeed pleaded guilty and possessed firearms. Without restating all of the evidence adduced at trial, we simply note that the evidence, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, is more than sufficient to support Mr. Morgan\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>As to the remaining challenges, we have reviewed the entire record, all of the briefs filed, and agree they are frivolous chailenges. Therefore, we AFFIRM Mr. Morgan\u2019s conviction and GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
