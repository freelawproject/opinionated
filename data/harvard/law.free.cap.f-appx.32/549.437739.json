Murray, Jr.\u2019s appeal because he has appealed from a nonfinal order. Murray responds. Murray renews his motion to stay proceedings pending resolution of <em>Airington v. Principi </em>01-7075, 2002 WL 539088 (Fed.Cir.2002). Murray states that the Secretary opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-27\">On September 30, 1998, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, inter alia, denied Murray\u2019s claim for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder. Murray appealed this portion of the Board\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, seeking a remand addressing alleged Board error including the Board\u2019s purported failure \u201cto notify him, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103, of what evidence was necessary to complete his application.\u201d The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded for readjudication of Murray\u2019s case in accordance with the ret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>roactive and potentially veteran-friendly provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096. The VCAA, among other things, clarifies the duty to notify and assist veterans in compiling required evidence under amendments to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103 and the addition of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims declined to consider Murray\u2019s allegations of Board error unrelated to the VCAA, noting that \u201c[o]n remand the Board is not limited to ensuring compliance with the VCAA. Rather, the appellant is free to proffer to the Board the additional arguments raised here, and the Board must address them.\u201d Murray moved for reconsideration, arguing that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims should have ruled on his additional allegations of Board error. The panel denied Murray\u2019s motion for reconsideration and Murray appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">This court generally refuses to review nonfinal decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>Williams v. Principi </em>275 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2002). Departure from this rule is justified only if three conditions are fulfilled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">(1) there must have been a clear and final decision of a legal issue that (a) is separate from the remand proceedings, (b) will directly govern the remand proceedings or, (c) if reversed by this court, would render the remand proceedings unnecessary; (2) the resolution of the legal issues must adversely affect the party seeking review; and, (3) there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand, <em>i.e., </em>that the remand proceeding may moot the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1364 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">If on remand the Board recommits the alleged errors, Murray will be free to return to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and challenge such errors. Consequently, the alleged errors in the 1998 Board decision, if repeated, will survive the remand. In addition, Murray will be able to challenge the whole of the Board\u2019s readjudication of his claim. Because Murray\u2019s appeal fails the test of <em>Williams, </em>the appeal is not sufficiently final for the purposes of our review and is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">(2) Murray\u2019s motion to stay proceedings is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
