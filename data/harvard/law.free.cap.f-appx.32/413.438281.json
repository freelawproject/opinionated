We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Amuehastegui contends that the district court erred in denying a downward minor or minimal role adjustment pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 because his only participation in the armed bank robbery was to drive the getaway car. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u201cA district court\u2019s finding that a defendant does not qualify for a minor or minimal participant status is heavily dependant on the facts of the particular case, and we uphold such a finding unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1436 (9th Cir.1994). Amuchastegui\u2019s role in the armed bank robbery, including giving his co-defendant the gun, driving the getaway car, and receiving a share of the loot, does not entitle him to either a minor or minimal role adjustment. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Franco, </em>189 F.3d 1151, 1160 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that the appellant has the burden to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that he is substantially less culpable than the average co-participant); <em>see also United States v. Pinkney, </em>15 F.3d 825, 828, (9th Cir.1994) (stating that \u201cone kind of average participant in a robbery would be the person who drove the robber to the scene and then drove him or her away again, and expected a share of the loot\u201d). Our review of the record indicates that the district court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
