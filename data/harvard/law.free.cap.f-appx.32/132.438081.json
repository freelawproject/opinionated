Marangos, for the appointment of counsel. This Court AFFIRMS the district court\u2019s denial of appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b178-27\">Dimitrious S. Marangos, an electrician employed by defendant-appellee, General Motors Corporation, sued his employer for national origin and disability discrimination occurring between 1986 and 1999. Marangos first filed his complaint with the EEOC, which dismissed his complaint and issued a \u201cright to sue letter.\u201d Next, Marangos filed a complaint with the district court and also moved for appointment of counsel. The district court rejected appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>lant\u2019s request, reasoning that absent exceptional circumstances, appointment of counsel is appropriate \u201conly after a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment has been denied and only after the court determines the party requesting the counsel is indigent.\u201d Later, General Motors moved for dismissal and summary judgment due to <em>res judicata </em>and failure to plead a <em>prima facie </em>case. The district court granted General Motors\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In support of his appeal, Marangos cites 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28(a)(4), the federal regulation governing the EEOC\u2019s issuance of right to sue letters. Marangos\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 1601.28(a)(4) is misplaced, however, because the regulation does not mandate that a district court or the EEOC appoint counsel. Rather, \u00a7 1601.28(a)(4) allows the EEOC to offer necessary or appropriate assistance to a person who receives a right to sue letter. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28(a)(4) (2001) (\u201cThe issuance of a notice of right to sue does not preclude the Commission from offering such assistance to a person issued such notice as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Similarly, the district court\u2019s ability to appoint counsel in employment discrimination cases is discretionary. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) (2001) (\u201cUpon application by the complainant and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, the court may appoint an attorney for such complainant ... \u201d). In reviewing employment-related appointment of counsel decisions for abuse of discretion, the Sixth Circuit considers three factors: \u201c(1) the plaintiffs financial resources; (2) the plaintiffs efforts to obtain counsel; and (3) whether the plaintiffs claim has any merit.\u201d <em>Leon v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Chicago, </em>823 F.2d 928, 930 (6th Cir.1987). Here, the district court refused to appoint counsel because there was no proof that Marangos was indigent or that the claims had enough merit to survive dismissal or summary judgment. Based on its consideration of these two factors, the district court acted within its discretion in denying the appointment of counsel to Marangos and that order should be AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
