Because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) governs this case, the petition will be granted only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Northern argues that the use immunity granted to his codefendant, Theresa Brown, pursuant to Ariz. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-4064, deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to renew the motion to sever the trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Brown invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination as to all questions asked of her at Northern\u2019s first trial. The state trial court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to give Brown use immunity, thereby compelling her to testify. Nevertheless, that trial ended in a mistrial. Because Brown\u2019s testimony was compelled, the trial court properly disallowed Northern\u2019s attempt to impeach her during the second, joint trial with her pri- or, immunized testimony lest it force her to testify involuntarily against herself. <em>See New Jersey v. Portash, </em>440 U.S. 450, 459, 99 S.Ct. 1292, 59 L.Ed.2d 501 (1979) (\u201cThe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide that no person \u2018shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u2019 As we reaffirmed last Term, a defendant\u2019s compelled statements, as opposed to statements taken in violation of <em>Miranda [v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)], may not be put to any testimonial use whatever against him in a criminal trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">Northern had and took full advantage of the opportunity to cross-examine Brown at length on her version of the events during the trial. He was able to point out inconsistencies in her testimony. The sole re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>strietion was that Northern could not ask questions about the testimony Brown had given in the first trial. He was free to ask the same questions and cover the same material; however, he could not specifically compare her answers to questions in the first trial with her answers in the second trial. Northern sought to use the immunized testimony to point out inconsistencies in Brown\u2019s two testimonies and thereby cast doubt on her credibility. The minor inconsistencies Northern sought to highlight would have been of little consequence as the jury convicted Northern on an accomplice theory of murder, apparently unconvinced by Brown\u2019s testimony. Even the trial judge remarked that \u201cBrown was one of the worst liars this Court has ever seen.\u201d It is clear that Brown cast doubt on her credibility all by herself. The state court\u2019s holding was not an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>See Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Northern cites <em>Thomas v. Hubbard, </em>273 F.3d 1164 (9th Cir.2001), for the proposition that truncation of cross-examination is prejudicial because of the competing constitutional interests. We do not agree that <em>Thomas </em>is applicable here. There, the court held that the combination of the improper introduction of triple hearsay statements, prosecutorial misconduct <em>and </em>truncation of cross-examination warranted habeas corpus relief. <em>Id. </em>The court expressly declined to hold that the truncation of cross-examination alone would have warranted such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that defense counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant such that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694. Northern\u2019s counsel admitted and the state stipulated that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient when she failed to renew the severance motion at trial. However, Northern fails to prove that he was prejudiced by this deficiency. The jury, unconvinced by Brown\u2019s testimony, convicted Northern on an accomplice theory of murder and there was sufficient evidence of Northern\u2019s guilt presented prior to Brown\u2019s testimony. Northern had motive to murder the victim, the murder weapon was found fully loaded in Northern\u2019s car, he admitted he was present at the crime scene and he subsequently used the victim\u2019s credit card. Northern failed to show that absent his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the outcome of the trial-his conviction based on the accomplice liability theory-would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b847-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this Circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
