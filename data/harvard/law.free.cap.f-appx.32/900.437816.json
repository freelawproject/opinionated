We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review a district court\u2019s deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>al of a \u00a7 2254 petition de novo, <em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Smith contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction of murder with premeditation and deliberation. Under the AEDPA, we may disturb a state court\u2019s legal conclusion only if it was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established law as determined by the U.S. Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). To be unreasonable, a state court\u2019s application of federal law must have been clearly erroneous. <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1152-54 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">To demonstrate insufficiency of the evidence, Smith must show that, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could not have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). We are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Smith acted with premeditation and deliberation. <em>See People v. Perez, </em>2 Cal.4th 1117, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 577, 831 P.2d 1159, 1163-66 (Cal.1992) (noting premeditation and deliberation can occur in brief period of time, and may be inferred from planning activity, motive, and manner of killing) (citing, <em>inter alia, People v. Anderson, </em>70 Cal.2d 15, 73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942 (Cal.1968)). The state court\u2019s decision was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b946-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
