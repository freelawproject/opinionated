The district court sentenced Guerra to serve 51 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release, and to pay $162,129.24 in restitution. His counsel has moved to withdraw, filing a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For reversal, counsel argues that the district court erred in (1) assigning criminal history points to a sentence imposed for a 1985 conviction, because the conviction was more than 15 years old at the time of the instant sentencing; (2) assigning criminal history points for a 2001 conviction, because the underlying conduct occurred after the conduct underlying the instant conviction and was part of a common plan or scheme with the instant offense; and (3) denying Guerra\u2019s objection to the government\u2019s refusal to move for a substantial assistance departure. In a pro se supplemental brief, Guerra argues that his plea was unknowing and involuntary because he was unaware of the effect his criminal history would have on his sentence. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-21\">We conclude that the district court properly assigned criminal history points to the sentences imposed for Guerra\u2019s 1985 and 2001 convictions. He was incarcerated on the 1985 conviction through February 1991, and he commenced the instant offense in May 1999. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(1) (Nov.2000). The 2001 conviction involved credit card fraud and occurred in Georgia, whereas the instant offense occurred primarily in Arkansas and involved fraudulent checks; further, the conduct underlying the 2001 conviction was not used to determine the amount of loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>for the instant offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1(a); 4A1.2, comment, (n.l) (Nov. 2000) (defining \u201cprior sentence\u201d). The district court also properly denied Guerra\u2019s objection to the government\u2019s refusal to move for a substantial assistance departure. The plea agreement reserved to the government discretion to determine whether Guerra had provided substantial assistance, and Guerra failed to make a substantial threshold showing of prosecutorial discrimination or irrational conduct. <em>See United States v. Amezcua, </em>276 F.3d 445, 447 (8th Cir.2002). Finally, Guerra\u2019s claim that his plea was unknowing and involuntary first must be raised in the district court. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>899 F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues following our independent review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, deny Guerra\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-18\">. The Honorable James M. Moody, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
