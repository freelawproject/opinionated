The Honorable Thomas S.

We note, however, that Parker did not raise this argument \u2014 either before the district court or an earlier merits panel of this Court\u2014 during the first phase of his federal habeas proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Parker was not time-barred from filing such a motion earlier, nor is there any indication in the record that Parker, who was appointed very able counsel by the district court to represent him post-conviction, was in any way impeded from attempting to restyle his \u00a7 2255 petition as a motion for a new trial. Consequently, Parker\u2019s Rule 33 argument is foreclosed because he failed to raise it prior to the district court\u2019s initial summary dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See United States v. Real Property Located At 25445 Via Dona Christa, Valencia, California, </em>138 F.3d 403, 409 (9th Cir. 1998), <em>as amended by </em>170 F.3d 1161, 1162 (9th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Parker also argues that the district court erred by finding that he was procedurally barred from raising the juror misconduct claim because he failed to demonstrate cause for not raising the claim in a motion for a new trial filed within days after the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152,168,102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo, <em>Manning v. Foster, </em>224 F.3d 1129, 1132 (9th Cir.2000), and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Mett, </em>65 F.3d 1531, 1534 (9th Cir.1995). Parker contends that he lacked the factual predicate for asserting a juror misconduct claim related to Parker\u2019s sexual misconduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">As Parker\u2019s attorneys disclosed during the evidentiary hearing, they had communicated with the potential witness, Burns, shortly after the verdict was announced; Burns told them about Benjamin\u2019s admission that she had conversed with the juror about the trial. Although Parker\u2019s attorneys did not learn explicitly until the evidentiary hearing that the juror was aware of a possible Parker girlfriend,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> their knowledge that the juror had conversed with one of Burns\u2019 colleagues was more than sufficient to place them on notice that improper communication occurred and that the juror may have learned about a possible affair. At that point, they could have alerted the district court about the supposed misconduct and sought an evidentiary hearing or other discovery to develop a factual basis for raising juror misconduct allegations. As the district court noted, however, Parker\u2019s attorneys made a \u201cconscious\u201d decision not to raise the juror misconduct claim in the motion for a new trial. Having failed to raise it at that time, Parker is procedurally barred from asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>it in a subsequent \u00a7 2255 petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUR\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. Indeed, the first merits panel made reference in its memorandum disposition to Parker's \"federal habeas corpus petition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">. If Parker had timely converted his \u00a7 2255 petition into a Rule 33 motion, he would not have qualified for collateral relief because he failed to present any \"newly discovered\u201d evidence. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b880-11\">. Considering that the district court was similarly unaware that Parker\u2019s attorneys had pri- or knowledge of contact between Burns and Benjamin, it would not have had reason to suspect during the first phase of this proceeding that Parker\u2019s juror misconduct claim was procedurally barred. Consequently, Parker's argument that the government is foreclosed by the first merits panel\u2019s mandate from argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>ing that Parker does not have \"cause\u201d lacks merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b881-17\">. Parker's reliance on <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>209 F.3d 1103 (9th Cir.2000), is misplaced. The petitioner in <em>Jackson </em>did not learn about the factual predicate for a juror misconduct claim until more than three years after the trial, <em>id. </em>at 1108, whereas Parker had sufficient information within days after his trial to raise the issue with the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
