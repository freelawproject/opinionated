The District Court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner. Shea appeals, arguing that the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny him Disability Insurance Benefits was not supported by substantial evidence. The parties are familiar with the underlying facts and history and we shall not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">The District Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court Order is limited to determining whether the District Court properly found that there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence has been defined as more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). We find that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">In determining such a claim for Disability Insurance Benefits, the Commissioner follows a five-step analysis. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. In following the five-step analysis, the Commissioner considers: (1) whether the claimant is engaging in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment; (3) whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals the requirements of a listed impairment; (4) whether the claimant has the inability to return to his past work; and (5) if not, whether the claimant can perform any other work available in the national economy. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)-(f). At steps one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>through four, the burden of proof is on the claimant whereas at step five the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f). The inquiry at issue for purposes of this case is step five.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Shea argues that the Commissioner did not rely on substantial evidence at \u201cstep five\u201d to determine that he was found not to be disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act because he was capable of performing a significant number of jobs in the national economy. He contends that in making this decision, the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the medical-vocational rules was improper under <em>Sykes v. Apfel, </em>228 F.3d 259 (3d Cir.2000) because the ALJ only relied on Dr. Mandel\u2019s exertional restrictions of his exam findings of Shea and not his nonexertional restrictions. In Sykes, we held that \u201cgrids cannot automatically establish that there are jobs in the national economy when a claimant has severe exertional and nonexertional impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267. We agree with the District Court that the ALJ only determined that Shea had exertional impairments and not any nonexertional impairments. Thus, Sykes does not apply and the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the grids in the instant matter was wholly appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Shea also argues that the Commissioner\u2019s analysis is flawed at \u201cstep five\u201d because he found Shea not to be illiterate. To be found illiterate under the Code, the claimant must have the inability to read or write. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1564(b)(1). By Shea\u2019s own admissions to Dr. Cooper-stein and the ALJ, the District Court found that Shea is not illiterate. We also agree with this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">For the above reasons, we will deny Shea\u2019s petition to review the judgment of the Commissioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
