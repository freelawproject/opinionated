Having carefully reviewed the record, and having considered the unanimous expert opinion, we reject Moody\u2019s contention that the district court clearly erred in finding he suffered from a mental disease or defect such that his unconditional release would create a substantial risk of danger. <em>See United States v. S.A., </em>129 F.3d 995, 1000 (8th Cir.1997) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1011, 118 S.Ct. 1200, 140 L.Ed.2d 329 (1998). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court committing Moody to the custody of the Attorney General pending the location of a suitable facility to oversee his conditional release. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, over Moody\u2019s resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-24\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-22\">. The HONORABLE GARY A.
