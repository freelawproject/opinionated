We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), and we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by concluding that the petitioner has a \u201cfair chance\u201d rather than a \u201clikelihood\u201d of success on the merits of the unfair labor practice charge such that a showing \u2014 rather than a presumption \u2014 of irreparable injury is required. <em>Miller v. California Pacific Medical Center, </em>19 F.3d 449, 460 (9th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">But by emphasizing in its irreparable harm analysis the mere \u201ctwo week delay\u201d until the scheduled hearing before the administrative law judge (\u201cthe ALJ\u201d), the district court appears to have relied upon an erroneous assumption that the ALJ could compel the parties to bargain pending the Board\u2019s adjudication of the unfair labor practice complaint. The ALJ has no such authority; her decision is required to contain, and did here contain, <em>\u201crecommendations </em>as to what disposition of the case should be,\u201d <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.45 (emphasis added); <em>see also Sharp v. Webco Industries, Inc., </em>225 F.3d 1130, 1136 (10th Cir. 2000) (noting that an ALJ decision is not self-enforcing and therefore rejecting a suggestion that the commencement of the ALJ hearing on the underlying action obviated the need for \u00a7 10(j) interim relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">The ALJ did recommend that the parties bargain at a place close to the location of the bargaining unit, as requested by the petitioner. But because the ALJ has no authority to compel the parties to so bargain, her recommendation in the petitioner\u2019s favor could not have been, and was not, relevant to the parties\u2019 bargaining obligations pending final review by the Board. The imminence of the administrative hearing was therefore irrelevant to the question before the district court of whether irreparable harm would be suffered in the absence of interim injunctive relief under \u00a7 10(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for reconsideration of the question of irreparable harm without regard to the imminence of the hearing before the ALJ which has, in any event, since passed. We express no opinion regarding whether petitioner makes a sufficient showing of irreparable harm, based upon consideration of only permissible factors, to warrant \u00a7 10(j) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
