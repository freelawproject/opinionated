We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b958-15\">Sivilay argues that the district court erred in affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision to disregard the opinions submitted by her treating psychiatrists, Dr. Arnaldo Solis, M.D., and Dr. Al Raitt, M.D. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001). The district court properly affirmed the ALJ if the ALJ applied the correct legal standards and if substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the ALJ\u2019s factual determinations. <em>Pagter v. Massanari, </em>250 F.3d 1255, 1258 (9th Cir.2001). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance; it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Sandgathe v. Chater, </em>108 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir.1997) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">The ALJ rejected Dr. Solis\u2019 opinion because the ALJ found that it was based upon the subjective complaints of Sivilay and her husband, which the ALJ deemed not credible. We have previously recognized this reason as a proper legal ground for rejecting a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number><em>Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 602 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cA physician\u2019s opinion of disability premised to a large extent upon the claimant\u2019s own accounts of his symptoms and limitations may be disregarded where those complaints have been properly discounted.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Sandgathe, </em>108 F.3d at 980 (affirming the ALJ\u2019s rejection of a treating physician\u2019s opinion when it was based upon the claimant\u2019s self-reports, which the ALJ properly found to be exaggerated and unreliable); <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s factual determination that Dr. Solis\u2019 opinion was based upon subjective complaints from Sivilay and her husband, who sometimes attended his wife\u2019s sessions and whose statements are reflected in Dr. Solis\u2019 notes. Dr. Solis\u2019 monthly treatment reports contain a \u201csubjective\u201d section, in which he recorded Sivilay\u2019s symptoms as reported by Sivilay and her husband, and an \u201cobjective\u201d section, in which he noted his own observations regarding Sivilay\u2019s appearance, behavior, relating ability, thought processes, and the like. W\u00e9 find that Dr. Solis\u2019 opinion is largely based upon Sivilay\u2019s symptoms from the \u201csubjective\u201d sections of his treatment reports, and that therefore substantial evidence exists for the ALJ\u2019s factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Both the law and the record also support the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount the subjective representations that Sivilay and her husband made regarding the severity of Sivilay\u2019s mental impairment. We have held that an ALJ may properly discredit a claimant\u2019s allegations of disability \u201cif [the] claimant is able to spend a substantial part of his day engaged in pursuits involving the performance of physical functions that are transferable to a work setting,\u201d or if there is evidence of \u201can unexplained, or inadequately explained, failure to seek treatment or follow a prescribed course of treatment.\u201d <em>Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 6\u00d33. The record includes evidence inconsistent with the severely disabling mental impairment represented by Sivilay and her husband because the evidence shows Sivilay interacting socially and able to perform simple tasks that are transferable to a work setting. The record also contains evidence that Sivilay went for long periods of time without attending the mental health clinic, and was extremely inconsistent in taking her anti-depressant medications. The record does not explain why Sivilay periodically abandoned her prescribed treatment regimen. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sivilay\u2019s and her husband\u2019s descriptions of Sivilay\u2019s mental impairment were not fully credible. The ALJ therefore could properly disregard Dr. Solis\u2019 opinion based upon these unreliable, subjective complaints. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 602; <em>Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 603, 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">The ALJ rejected Dr. Raitt\u2019s opinion on the grounds that it was inconsistent with his treatment notes, and was based upon the subjective complaints of Sivilay and her husband. As already discussed, an ALJ may correctly disregard a treating physician\u2019s opinion when it is based upon the claimant\u2019s exaggerated self-reports. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 602; <em>Sandgathe, </em>108 F.3d at 980. It is also appropriate to discredit a physician\u2019s opinion when it lacks support in the physician\u2019s own treatment notes. <em>See Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1996) (the ALJ could disregard an examining physician\u2019s opinion because \u201cit was obtained solely for the purposes of the administrative hearing, varied from [the physician\u2019s] own treatment notes, and was worded ambiguously in an apparent attempt to assist [the claimant] in obtaining social security benefits.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Reviewing the record, we find that Dr. Raitt\u2019s opinion describes a mental impairment considerably more severe than that reflected in Dr. Raitt\u2019s treatment notes. Furthermore, the opinion seems to be based upon Sivilay\u2019s and her husband\u2019s complaints, rather than Dr. Raitt\u2019s clinical observations. Accordingly, we find that substantial evidence exists for the ALJ\u2019s factual determination that Dr. Raitt\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with his treatment notes, and was based upon Sivilay\u2019s and her husband\u2019s subjective statements, which the ALJ had properly found unreliable. The ALJ properly disregarded Dr. Raitt\u2019s opinion. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 602; <em>Saelee, </em>94 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">We therefore hold that the district court correctly affirmed the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the opinions submitted by Sivilay\u2019s treating psychiatrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Sivilay next argues that the district court abused its discretion in remanding her case to the ALJ for further administrative proceedings. We are not convinced that the district court\u2019s decision to remand under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) was \u201cbeyond the pale of reasonable justification under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1175, 1178 (9th Cir.2000). Rather, we find the decision sensible under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">As the district court indicated, remand serves a number of purposes in this case. First, remand allows a state agency medical or psychological consultant to review Sivilay\u2019s medical records and make findings of fact about the existence and severity of her mental impairment. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(f), this should have been done in Sivilay\u2019s case. <em>See Marcia v. Sullivan, </em>900 F.2d 172, 176 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cIf additional proceedings can remedy defects in the original administrative proceedings, a social security case should be remanded.\u201d) (quoting <em>Lewin v. Schweiker, </em>654 F.2d 631, 635 (9th Cir.1981)). As the Commissioner represents, the consultant will, among other things, review Sivilay\u2019s medical records to determine whether the ALJ might, upon reconsideration, find that her treating psychiatrists\u2019 opinions should be credited.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">Second, remand permits the Commissioner, under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(f), to seek a consultative mental status examination for Sivilay and a medical source statement from her current psychiatrist. As the district court noted, this additional evidence would be helpful in comparing the demands of Sivilay\u2019s past relevant work experience to her residual mental and physical capabilities. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Third, remand allows further development of the issue of Sivilay\u2019s noncompliance with her prescribed treatment regimen, and whether her noncompliance renders her ineligible for benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.930(b). As the Commissioner represents, if an ALJ denies benefits on this ground, the ALJ must specifically find based upon the record that the prescribed treatment can restore the claimant\u2019s ability to work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.930(a); S.S.R. 82-59. Furthermore, after finding that the claimant has not complied with prescribed treatment expected to restore the ability to work, the ALJ should give the claimant an opportunity to explain the noneompliance to determine whether a justifiable cause exists for it. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.930(b),(c); S.S.R. 82-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">Lastly, we find remand for further factual development appropriate because, having discredited Sivilay\u2019s and her husband\u2019s subjective complaints and her treating psychiatrists\u2019 opinions, the ALJ had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>before him a record that did not offer especially firm ground for a decision in Sivilay\u2019s case. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-460 (9th Cir.2001) (the ALJ has a duty to develop the record further when the evidence is ambiguous or inadequate to allow for a proper evaluation); <em>Brown v. Heckler, </em>713 F.2d 441, 443 (9th Cir.1983) (remanding for further development of the factual record when it was inadequate for decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We therefore hold that the district court properly exercised its discretion in remanding Sivilay\u2019s case for further administrative proceedings. In light of the supplementation of the factual record that is to occur, the district court also correctly denied Sivilay\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (summary judgment may be granted only when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b958-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
