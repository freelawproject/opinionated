We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Sanchez v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1448, 1451-52 (9th Cir. 1995), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Payan-Apodaca contends his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue on direct appeal that the district court erred by not applying a 2-level downward adjustment pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). His contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The district court did not clearly err by finding that Payan-Apodaca did not satisfy all of the requirements of \u00a7 5C1.2. He therefore was not prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s purported ineffectiveness because an appeal of this issue would not have provided grounds for reversal. <em>See Wildman v. Johnson, </em>261 F.3d 832, 840 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[AJppellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise issues on direct appeal does not constitute ineffective assistance when appeal would not have provided grounds for reversal\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Real-Hernandez, </em>90 F.3d 356, 360 (9th Cir.1996) (stating appellate review of district court\u2019s determination of eligibility for departure under \u00a7 5C1.2 is for clear error); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) (providing that defendant must meet criteria of \u00a7 5C1.2 in order to receive 2-level adjustment). The district court therefore did not err by denying Payan-Apodaca\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
