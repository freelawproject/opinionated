We lack jurisdiction to review the orders dismissing the action and denying reconsideration, because the notice of appeal was untimely. We have jurisdiction to review the vexatious litigant order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Moy v. United States, </em>906 F.2d 467, 469-70 (9th Cir.1990). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The district court dismissed the Olsens\u2019 complaint with prejudice on January 26, 2001, and denied the Olsens\u2019 motion for reconsideration on April 4, 2001. Thus, the Olsens\u2019 notice of appeal filed on June 29, 2001 was untimely as to these two orders. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). The Olsens\u2019 notice of appeal was timely as to the vexatious litigant order entered June 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">We review the entry of a vexatious litigant order for abuse of discretion. <em>De Long v. Hennessey, </em>912 F.2d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1990). The district court did not abuse its discretion in entering the vexatious litigant order because the Olsens had notice that the district court was considering entering such an order and had an opportunity to oppose it. <em>Cf. id. </em>In addition, the district court specifically identified numerous filings by the Olsens that the district court found to be frivolous. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1148. Finally, the district court\u2019s order is narrowly tailored to \u201cprevent infringement on the [Olsens\u2019] right of access to the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">DISMISSED in part, AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1008-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
