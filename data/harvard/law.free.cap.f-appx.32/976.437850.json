Although Calderin asserts an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>see also Gonzalez v. United States, </em>33 F.3d 1047,1052 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-16\">Calderin asserts that the circumstantial evidence of his knowledge that controlled substances were in the boxes he transported was not strong, yet admits being told</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-20\">that at least one box contained marijuana. Under California law, Calderin\u2019s belief that he transported marijuana rather than cocaine is sufficient to support his conviction. <em>People v. Romero, </em>55 Cal.App.4th 147, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 18 (1997). Moreover, Calderin has not demonstrated any errors in the transcript of his interrogation that show the translation of that interrogation was incompetent. <em>See Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir.2000). Therefore, Calderin has not proved that it is reasonably probable that a different outcome would have resulted if his attorney had checked the translation of his interrogation or objected to its introduction. <em>See United States v. Pena-Espinoza, </em>47 F.3d 356, 360 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b1022-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
