Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-19\">Carrillo-Acosta contends that the district court erred by failing to grant him safety valve relief pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. As part of his plea agreement, however, Carrillo-Acosta waived his right to appeal his sentence. Because Carrillo-Acosta has failed to show that the waiver is invalid, we lack jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-24\">We decline to consider Carrillo-Acosta\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Laughlin, </em>933 F.2d 786, 788 (9th Cir.1991) (stating that as a general rule, we will not review challenges to the effectiveness of counsel on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-25\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b525-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
