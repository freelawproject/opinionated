R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-19\">This is a pro se prisoner \u00a7 1983 civil rights appeal. Mr. Mathis, a federal prisoner housed in a New Mexico state facility, sought relief claiming state and federal violations of his safety and medical needs. The magistrate judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed, including exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the state claim. After reviewing Mr. Mathis\u2019 objections and Mr. Mathis\u2019 second response to the <em>Martinez </em>report, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and dismissed Mr. Mathis\u2019 complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-20\">Mr. Mathis claims on appeal that the district court \u201cerrored [sic] by simply choosing sides with the Defendant.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 3. Mr. Mathis claims that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>his claims. The magistrate judge did a comprehensive review of the evidence and, in a detailed and well-reasoned opinion, found that no material issues of fact existed. After a thorough review of Mr. Mathis\u2019 brief and the record, we find no error in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">For substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s March 15, 2001, Proposed Findings and Recommended Disposition, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Mathis.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
