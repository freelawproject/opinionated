R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-21\">Scott William Clewis, a federal prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the 135 month sentence imposed following his guilty plea convictions for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and money laundering. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo the denial of a section 2255 motion, <em>Sanchez v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1448, 1451 (9th Cir.1995), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-22\">Clewis contends that he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. As the district court correctly concluded, however, this claim was previously denied on direct appeal to this court. Because no circumstances exist in Clewis\u2019 case requiring us to reconsider our earlier decision, the district court properly denied relief on this claim. <em>See United States v. Scrivner, </em>189 F.3d 825, 828 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding that, absent certain circumstances, resolution of a defendant\u2019s claim on direct appeal precludes collateral review of same issue in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-23\">Clewis also contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the career offender enhancement. This contention lacks merit. In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s deficient representation, the result of the proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>would have been different. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Here, because Clewis was sentenced to a term of imprisonment below the applicable guideline range and below the government\u2019s recommendation, he failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Lastly, Clewis\u2019 contention that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) is retroactively applicable on collateral review is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>282 F.3d 664, 667-68 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1018-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
