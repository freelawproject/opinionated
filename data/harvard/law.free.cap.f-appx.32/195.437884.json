Loraas appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the District of Minnesota, granting judgment for defendants and disposing of her various federal and state law claims. This lawsuit arose when certain defendants initiated a sanctions action against Loraas after her client in a divorce proceeding had terminated Loraas\u2019s services. The parties submitted voluminous materials in support of their arguments, and the district court thoroughly reviewed each claim. After de novo review, <em>see Winkle v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>195 F.3d 418, 420 (8th Cir.1999) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 summary judgment); <em>Ring v. First Interstate Mortgage, Inc., </em>984 F.2d 924, 926 (8th Cir.1993) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal), we agree with the district court that all of Loraas\u2019s substantive claims lacked merit. Also, we defer to the district court\u2019s ruling that Loraas\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report be only ten pages, <em>see In re Starr, </em>152 F.3d 741, 745 n. 12 (8th Cir. 1998), and we concur with the district court\u2019s ruling that Loraas was not entitled to a default judgment for defendants\u2019 al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>leged untimely filings, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">. The Honorable John R.
