The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Appellant Diaz-Himely objects to the admission of evidence that he failed to notify his parole officer before traveling to New York, contending that admitting the evidence violated Rules 403 and 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. We have reviewed the record of the proceeding and, specifically the nature of objections lodged by counsel, and the limiting instruction given by the court with respect to this evidence, and do not find that the District Court abused its discretion in permitting the introduction of this evidence for a limited purpose. Accordingly, we will AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s Judgment and Conviction Order as to Appellant DiazHimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Appellant Mendinueta-Ibarro complains that the District Court improperly refused to grant a downward departure and failed to give \u201csubstantial weight to the government\u2019s evaluation of the defendant.\u201d He also requests the court to permit him to withdraw his guilty plea in order to correct a manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We have reviewed the record, including the District Court\u2019s consideration of the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and conclude that the District Court\u2019s refusal to depart downward was based upon an exercise of discretion on the part of the court, and is thus not reviewable on appeal. See <em>United States v. Denardi, </em>892 F.2d 269, 272 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We also find that a proper Rule 11 colloquy took place with respect to defendant\u2019s plea, and there is no basis for withdrawal of that plea. We will therefore AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s Judgment and Conviction Order as to appellant Mendinueta-Ibarro.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
