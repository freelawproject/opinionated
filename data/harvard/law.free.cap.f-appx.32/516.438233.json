He was deported in October 1992 after a 1991 conviction for unlawful possession with the intent to deliver a controlled substance. He appeals his sentence. We dismiss the appeal in part and affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">Unlawful reentry after an aggravated felony conviction results in an offense level of 24. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), (b)(1)(A) (2000). After reducing the base offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility, Mr. Salcido-Nava\u2019s total offense level was 21 with a criminal history category of III and a guideline range of 46 to 67 months. Mr. Salcido-Nava filed a sentencing memorandum pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 requesting a downward departure to 24 months for a combination of factors related to his INS status and family circumstances. On May 18, 2001, the trial court denied Mr. Salcido-Nava\u2019s request for a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0 and sentenced him to 46 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-20\">Mr. Salcido-Nava\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw. <em>Anders </em>holds that if counsel finds an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cto be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744. Counsel must also submit to the court a brief addressing anything in the record that arguably supports the appeal. <em>Id. </em>In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Mr. Salcido-Nava\u2019s counsel asserts that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant the downward departure was a reversible abuse of discretion. Aplt. Br. at 5. As required, a copy of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and motion to withdraw were provided to Mr. Salcido-Nava, who filed a \u201cletter-brief,\u201d raising the applicability of the November 2001 Amendments to the U.S.S.G. Pursuant to our duty under <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted an independent review. Because we agree that there are no non-frivolous issues on appeal, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, dismiss the appeal as to the denial of the downward departure for lack of jurisdiction, and affirm Mr. Salcido-Nava\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Unless the judge\u2019s language unambiguously states that the judge does not believe he has the authority to make a downward departure, we do not have jurisdiction to review the denial of a downward departure. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>30 F.3d 1318,1319 (10th Cir.1994). The transcript of Mr. Salcido-Nava\u2019s sentencing hearing contains no such statement. Although the sentencing court noted that \u201cif I could do what I would like to do as a person, [it] would be to send the defendant back to Mexico with some kind of chain that he couldn\u2019t come back,\u201d III R. 12, the court understood that it had the authority to grant a downward departure if it found the defendant\u2019s circumstances distinguished his case from the \u201cheartland\u201d cases covered by the guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0; III R. 12. The lack of direct appellate review does not \u201camount to a violation of due process of law,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 7, for Congress can limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts when it comes to sentencing, <em>see United States v. Thomas, </em>884 F.2d 540, 543 (10th Cir.1989), and pri- or to guideline sentencing federal sentences within statutory limits were virtually unreviewable. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 97, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">In his letter-brief to this court, Mr. Salcido-Nava asserts that the November 2001 amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced the base offense level for the offense he was convicted of and should be applied to him because his case is not final. While U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 was amended in November of 2001, it does not apply to his case; and, even if it did, it would not have changed his base offense level. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll(a), a sentencing court must apply the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing. <em>United States v. Alvarez-Pineda, </em>258 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (10th Cir.2001). The November 2001 amendments were not in effect on May 18, 2001 when Mr. Salcido-Nava was sentenced. Additionally, the amended \u00a7 2L1.2 retains 8 as a base offense level and a 16 point increase for a felony conviction of a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a)-(b)(l)(A)(i) (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Salci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>do-Nava\u2019s sentence, therefore, would not have been different under the 2001 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED. The appeal is DISMISSED in part and the SENTENCE is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b563-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
