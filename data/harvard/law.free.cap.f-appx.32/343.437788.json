We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion dismissals for failure to comply with a court order, <em>Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir. 1992), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-24\">Suenaga faded to file an amended complaint as directed by the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>order of August 9, 1999. The district court warned Suenaga that failure to comply could lead to dismissal with prejudice and provided him with thirty days to file a third amended complaint. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Suenaga\u2019s action with prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 1261-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We decline to consider Suenaga\u2019s remaining contentions raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Janes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>279 F.3d 883, 887 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Suenaga\u2019s motion to file an untimely and oversized reply brief is denied. <em>See </em>Fed.
