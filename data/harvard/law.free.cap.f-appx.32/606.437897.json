Smith, <em>Magistrate </em>Judge) affirming the determination of the Secretary of Agriculture that Stew Leonard\u2019s, a Connecticut milk handler and retailer, did not qualify as a \u201cproducer-handler\u201d under the provisions of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1001.10 (1999) despite its entrance into a lease arrangement with a local milk producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">After completing review pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c(15)(A), the Secretary deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>mined that Stew Leonard\u2019s was a \u201chandler\u201d as defined in 7 C.F. R. \u00a7 1001.9, not a \u201cproducer-handler\u201d as defined in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1001.10. Specifically, the Secretary found Stew Leonard\u2019s was not a \u201cdairy farmer\u201d and did not provide \u201cas [its] own enterprise and at [its] own risk, the maintenance, care, and management of the dairy herd or other resources and facilities used to produce milk\u201d as required by the language of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1001.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The district court reviewed the Secretary\u2019s determinations under the deferential standard outlined in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) decision, finding the Secretary\u2019s narrow interpretation of the \u201cproducer-handler\u201d definition consistent with both the purposes of the regulations and past interpretations thereof, and her application of the regulation to Stew Leonard\u2019s supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Stew Leonard\u2019s v. Glickman, </em>199 F.R.D. 48, 55-56, 57-58 (D.Conn. 2001). The district court thus concluded that the Secretary\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious, but rather \u201cin accordance with the law,\u201d within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) &amp; (E). <em>Id. </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">This Court notes that the evidence demonstrated no change in the daily operation of Oakridge Farm after the execution of the lease agreement and that Stew Leonard\u2019s admitted it did not know how to run a dairy farm. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58. As noted by the district court, these facts provide substantial evidentiary support for the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Stew Leonard\u2019s was not a \u201cdairy farmer\u201d and did not \u201c[p]rovide[ ] as [its] own enterprise and at [its] own risk the maintenance, care, and management of the dairy herd and other resources and facilities that are used to produce milk.\u201d <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1001.10(a)(1999). Bound by the constraints of deferential review, this Court affirms the district court\u2019s decision on the grounds that the Secretary\u2019s determination that Stew Leonard\u2019s did not fit the narrow definition of \u201cproducer-handler\u201d was adequately supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">This Court affirms the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Stew Leonard\u2019s due process and equal protection claims for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court. <em>Stew Leonard\u2019s, </em>199 F.R.D. at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
