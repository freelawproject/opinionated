We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s August 8, 2000, decision and conclude that Harsh\u2019s appeal to this court, filed September 8, 2000, was filed one day late under the applicable transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(C); 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (West 1999) (stating that petitions for review must be filed no later than thirty days after the date of the final order of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-19\">We are therefore compelled to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
