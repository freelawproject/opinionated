The court awarded compensatory damages, but not the punitive damages Higgins had requested. This appeal arises out of Olson\u2019s bankruptcy filing, and Higgins\u2019s subsequent successful attempt to have the state court judgment declared non-dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6), a debtor may not discharge debt \u201cfor willful or malicious injury\u201d to the property of another. The bankruptcy court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held a trial to determine whether Olson acted willfully and maliciously. It concluded she had and ordered the debt non-dischargeable. On appeal to the district court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Olson argued the state court\u2019s failure to award punitive damages was a ruling that she did not act willfully or maliciously, and should have had collateral-estoppel effect in the bankruptcy court. The district court disagreed. Olson renews her argument in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">Upon de novo review, see <em>In re Scarborough, </em>171 F.3d 638, 641 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 931, 120 S.Ct. 330, 145 L.Ed.2d 258 (1999), we conclude the district court properly found collateral estoppel was inapplicable. For collateral estoppel to apply, the issue must have been \u201cnecessarily and unambiguously\u201d decided in the prior action. <em>See State v. Nunley, </em>923 S.W.2d 911, 922 (Mo.1996) (en banc). The issue of willfulness and malice was not essential to the state court\u2019s determination that Olson had converted the property. <em>See Coffman v. Faulkner, </em>591 S.W.2d 23, 26 (Mo.Ct.App.1979) (questions of good faith or motive are not generally involved in conversion actions). Neither was the issue essential to the state court\u2019s decision not to award punitive damages. <em>See Koehler v. Warren Skinner, Inc., </em>804 S.W.2d 780, 782 (Mo.Ct.App.1990) (punitive damages are never a matter of right; whether or not they are awarded lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-23\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-19\">. The Honorable David P.
