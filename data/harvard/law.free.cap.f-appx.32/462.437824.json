We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-24\">Dollesin filed a motion to reopen proceedings before the BIA so that he could apply for adjustment of status, and suspension of deportation. The BIA held that because Dollesin had failed to establish prima facie eligibility for either form of relief, his motion should be denied. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>Caruncho v. INS, </em>68 F.3d 356, 360 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In order to be eligible for adjustment of status, Dollesin must obtain a waiver of the fraud he committed to procure a visa. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) &amp; 1182(i). Because Dollesin has not done so, it was not abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny the motion for failure to make a prima facie showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The BIA also held that Dollesin could not show prima facie eligibility for suspension of deportation because, as a transitional rule alien, the issuance of an Order to Show Cause stopped his period of continuous physical presence. Dollesin\u2019s argument on this point is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ram, v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b508-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
