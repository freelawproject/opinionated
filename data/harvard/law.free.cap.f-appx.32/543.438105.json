Fisher\u2019s petition for review should be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">On April 15, 1999, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) issued a final order dismissing Fisher\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The order advised Fisher that she could seek further review of the MSPB\u2019s decision by petitioning to this court for review within 60 days of receiving the final order. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). According to Fisher, she pursued her claims before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which dismissed her petition on June 7, 2000. Fisher states that she subsequently filied a civil action in a Colorado district court. The district court dismissed her case on November 11, 2001. On January 14, 2002, this court received Fisher\u2019s petition for review of the MSPB\u2019s 1999 order. Fisher maintains that her petition is timely because she \u201chas 60 days after the receipt of the most recent decision or order to submit\u201d her petition for review to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">When the MSPB has made no determination on discrimination issues, this court has exclusive jurisdiction to review an MSPB final decision dismissing an employee\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Ballentine v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>738 F.2d 1244, 1246-47 (Fed.Cir. 1984); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). The appeal period \u201cis statutory, mandatory, and bars the claim here.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., F.A.A., </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed. Cir.1984); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). Therefore, Fisher\u2019s failure to petition this court for review of the MSPB\u2019s final decision within the statutory 60-day period precludes this court from considering the merits of her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-19\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-20\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-21\">(1) Fisher\u2019s petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
