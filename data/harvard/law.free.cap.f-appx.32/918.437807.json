We deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-29\">Yehdego argues that aliens may restart a new period of seven years of continuous physical presence after receiving an Order to Show Cause (\u201cOSC\u201d). We reject this argument because it has been foreclosed by <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 518 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-30\">We also reject any argument that the BIA should have applied the law in effect at the time it first heard Yehdego\u2019s motion in 1996. The procedural history of Yehdego\u2019s case is nearly identical to that of <em>Ram. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>In <em>Ram, </em>we originally reversed the BIA\u2019s denial of Ram\u2019s suspension of deportation motion and remanded for further review of hardship. 243 F.3d at 512. On remand, the BIA applied the stop-time rule to Ram and denied the petition, and we approved the BIA\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Our cases which have required the BIA to apply pre-IIRIRA law are distinguishable. In <em>Guadalupe-Cruz v. INS, </em>240 F.3d 1209 (9th Cir.2001), the Immigration Judge had applied IIRIRA\u2019s stop-time rule four days before IIRIRA became effective. There was no premature application of IIRIRA here. In <em>Otarola v. INS, </em>270 F.3d 1272 (9th Cir.2001), the stop-time rule was able to be applied by the BIA only because the government pursued a frivolous appeal. Here, Yehdego was the one appealing the suspension of deportation decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\"><em>Ram </em>controls Yehdego\u2019s case. Application of the stop-time rule to Yehdego was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">However, we remand this case to the BIA so that it may consider a repapering request by Yehdego.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">PETITION DENIED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b964-32\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
