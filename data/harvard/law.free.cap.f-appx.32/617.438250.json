Nickerson, Judge). After entering into a written plea agreement, Harveypled guilty to one count of illegally reentering the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The district court sentenced Harvey to 70 months imprisonment, 3 years supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. This sentence was within the agreed upon sentencing range specified in the written plea agreement. Harvey did not object to the sentence or the calculation of the sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">On appeal, Harvey argues that his conviction is unconstitutional because the indictment did not allege that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony prior to his illegal reentry into the country. Because this fact was not alleged in the indictment, Harvey contends that his sentence was increased based upon a fact not charged in the indictment, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Harvey argues that the court should have sentenced him according to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), for reentry absent a prior conviction for an aggravated felony, which carries a two year maximum, not according to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), for reentry after a prior conviction for an aggravated felony, which carries a twenty year maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Supreme Court rejected this argument in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>which held that the aggravated felony requirement of \u00a7 1326(b) is a sentencing enhancement, not an element, and that subsections (a) and (b) do not establish two separate crimes. 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Further, the Supreme Court specifically exempted prior convictions from the holding of <em>Apprendi. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 <em>(\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added). Finally, the Second Circuit has held that the rule of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>still applies post <em>-Apprendi. See United States v. Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 264 (2d Cir.) (per curiam) (finding that the issue is \u201csquarely governed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and is foreclosed\u201d and that <em>Apprendi </em>\u201ccarved out an exception that is applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1045, 121 S.Ct. 2013, 149 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
