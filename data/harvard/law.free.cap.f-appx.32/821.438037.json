O\u2019Connor appeals from the judgment of the district court. He challenges two evidentiary rulings as well as the jury\u2019s verdict of disability insurance fraud and its award of punitive damages. O\u2019Connor also appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against O\u2019Connor on his counterclaims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1332 and affirm the judgment and rulings of the district court with regard to all issues except the question whether the punitive damages award was excessive. As the facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties, we restate them only as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">I. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 174 n. 1, 117 S.Ct. 644,136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997); <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>215 F.3d 930, 938 (9th Cir. 2000). To reverse on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, we must conclude not only that the district court abused its discretion, but also that the error resulted in \u201csome prejudice.\u201d <em>Defenders of Wildlife v. Bernal, </em>204 F.3d 920, 927-28 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">A. ATTORNEY COHEN\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">O\u2019Connor contends that Cohen\u2019s testimony regarding earlier out-of-court statements by O\u2019Connor\u2019s wife Joan constitutes inadmissible hearsay and that the district court committed reversible error by admitting it under the \u201cstatements against interest\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), and the \u201ccatchall\u201d exception, Fed.R.Evid. 807. We conclude that, although the district court may have erred in admitting the evidence, the error was not prejudicial because substantial other evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Miller, </em>676 F.2d 359, 364 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">In addition to Cohen\u2019s testimony, Provident presented surveillance videotape and the testimony of Tiffany O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s daughter, to show that O\u2019Connor faked medical exams and misreported his daily activities. Tiffany O\u2019Connor and Candice Witherspoon also testified that O\u2019Connor threatened potential witnesses and accomplices to cover up his fraud. And although Provident\u2019s counsel, in his closing argument, emphasized that O\u2019Con-nor threatened his wife, Cohen\u2019s testimony was not the strongest evidence against O\u2019Connor and Provident\u2019s counsel also emphasized other evidence. Any prejudice to O\u2019Connor was minimal because Mrs. O\u2019Connor ultimately testified, and thus O\u2019Connor was able to rebut and explain Cohen\u2019s testimony regarding her statements. <em>Cf. Mutuelles Unies v. Kroll &amp; Linstrom, </em>957 F.2d 707, 713 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that error was harmless where defendant was able to cross-examine a hearsay declaration with a previously obtained deposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Any suggestion that the Cohen evidence was improperly admitted because it was more prejudicial than probative, Fed. R.Evid. 403, is not properly before this court because O\u2019Connor objected only on other grounds. <em>See Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Group, </em>892 F.2d 1434, 1440 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">B. EVIDENCE OF O\u2019CONNOR\u2019S OCCUPATION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">Because his insurance policy contained a statutory incontestability clause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>O\u2019Connor also contends that the district court committed reversible error by admitting evidence, other than the fact of O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s statements in the policy application, regarding O\u2019Connor\u2019s occupation. O\u2019Con-nor argues that the incontestability clause barred Provident from challenging O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s statement in his policy application that his occupation was that of a real estate developer, and that as a result, any evidence which put O\u2019Connor\u2019s occupation in dispute or which indicated that O\u2019Con-nor misrepresented his occupation was irrelevant and more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Where an evidentiary ruling implicates conclusions of law, we review those conclusions of law de novo. <em>See Diamond v. City of Taft, </em>215 F.3d 1052, 1055 (9th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s ruling rested predominantly on its interpretation of California insurance law. The district court concluded that the statutory incontestability clause precluded only a challenge to the validity of the policy, not a claim that the insured was not disabled within the meaning of the policy. Because Provident had sold O\u2019Connor an \u201cown-occupation\u201d policy, in which disability was defined by ability to do the job in which the insured was employed at the time of disability, the court concluded that Provident sought to introduce the evidence to show that O\u2019Connor was not disabled within the meaning of the policy, not that the policy itself was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The district court\u2019s reasoning was correct and withstands the California Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Galanty v. Paul Revere Life Insurance Co., </em>23 Cal.4th 368, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 67, 1 P.3d 658 (Cal.2000). Unlike in <em>Galanty, </em>there is no \u201cunavoidable\u201d conflict here between the policy\u2019s \u201cdefinitional and coverage provisions\u201d and its incontestability clause. <em>Id. </em>at 671. The incontestability clause in O\u2019Connor\u2019s policy does not address \u201coccupation\u201d or attempt to limit the way in which an insurer may define coverage in terms of occupation. Because Provident was free to define coverage in terms of O\u2019Connor\u2019s occupation, evidence regarding O\u2019Connor\u2019s occupation was relevant and the district court did not err in admitting it over O\u2019Connor\u2019s Rule 402 and Rule 403 objections. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>982 F.2d 380, 383 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">II. JURY VERDICT AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD IN FAVOR OF PROVIDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">A. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE CHALLENGE TO THE JURY\u2019S FRAUD VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">O\u2019Connor next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s fraud verdict. To challenge a jury verdict on appeal on the basis of insufficient evidence, an appellant must have made a proper post-verdict Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law pursuant to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Saman v. Robbins, </em>173 F.3d 1150, 1154 (9th Cir.1999). Although O\u2019Connor filed a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or, Alternatively, to Alter or Amend Judgment after the verdict on March 23, 2000, this motion did not address the fraud verdict. As a result, O\u2019Connor has failed to preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Some circuits hold that a limited \u201cplain error\u201d exception exists to the rule that appellants must strictly comply with Rule 50(b) to raise an insufficient evidence challenge. <em>See, e.g., Shell v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., </em>684 F.2d 537, 540 (8th Cir.1982); <em>Urti v. Transp. Commercial Corp., </em>479 F.2d 766, 769 (5th Cir.1973); <em>see also Yohannon v. Keene Corp., </em>924 F.2d 1255, 1262 n. 7 (3d Cir.1991) (collecting cases). This is of no consequence, however, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>jury\u2019s fraud verdict here does not constitute plain error. Plain error review is \u201cextraordinarily deferential\u201d and is \u201climited to whether there was <em>any </em>evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of its sufficiency.\u201d <em>Patel v. Penman, </em>103 F.3d 868, 878 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Provident presented evidence of fraud from several sources, including evidence that O\u2019Connor faked medical exams and misrepresented his occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">B. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE CHALLENGE TO THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">O\u2019Connor has properly preserved his insufficient evidence challenge to the punitive damages award by making proper motions for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Therefore, we review under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard\u2014 \u201cthat is, such relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Three Boys Music Corp. v. Bolton, </em>212 F.3d 477, 482 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1126, 121 S.Ct. 881,148 L.Ed.2d 790 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The jury awarded punitive damages under California Civil Code \u00a7 3294, which permits punitive damages \u201cwhere it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3294(a). We find O\u2019Connor\u2019s contention that the jury must find all three statutory elements before it can award punitive damages to be contrary to the text of the statute and numerous California cases. <em>E.g., Michelson v. Hamada, </em>29 Cal. App.4th 1566, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 343 (Ct.App. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">O\u2019Connor also suggests that the evidence was insufficient to support the punitive damages award because Provident did not adequately establish O\u2019Connor\u2019s wealth. To determine the amount of punitive damages, the jury must consider three factors: the nature of the defendant\u2019s acts, the amount of compensatory damages awarded, and the defendant\u2019s wealth or ability to pay. <em>Prof'l Seminar Consultants, Inc. v. Sino Am. Tech. Exch. Council, Inc., </em>727 F.2d 1470,1473 (9th Cir.1984) (citing <em>Neal v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>21 Cal.3d 910, 148 Cal.Rptr. 389, 582 P.2d 980 (Cal.1978)). If the plaintiff fails to present evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s wealth, the punitive damages award cannot stand. <em>Adams v. Murakami, </em>54 Cal.3d 105, 284 Cal.Rptr. 318, 813 P.2d 1348, 1357 (Cal. 1991). California cases generally hold that evidence of net worth at the time of trial, not income or revenue, is the most appropriate measure of wealth for punitive damages calculations. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">The jury heard three different numerical estimates of O\u2019Connor\u2019s net worth and also had before it other evidence which tended to establish net income or assets, including such documentary evidence as statements of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. This evidence was sufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">C. EXCESSIVENESS OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">O\u2019Connor also contends that the punitive damages award of $800,000 was excessive as a matter of California law. In a diversity action where state law supplies the rule of decision, the role of the federal district court is \u201cto determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict is within the confines set by state law, and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered.\u201d <em>Brouwning-Ferris Indus. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., </em>492 U.S. 257, 279, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>(1989). \u201cThe court of appeals should then review the district court\u2019s determination under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">California law requires that punitive damages \u201cbear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages awarded.\u201d <em>Bouman v. Block, </em>940 F.2d 1211, 1234 (9th Cir.1991); <em>Torres v. Auto. Club, </em>15 Cal.4th 771, 781, 63 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 937 P.2d 290 (1997). \u201c[A] California court may set aside a punitive damage award only where the award \u2018appears excessive, or ... is so grossly disproportionate as to raise the presumption that it is the result of passion or prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyle v. Lorimar Prods., Inc., </em>13 F.3d 1357, 1360 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Neal, </em>148 Cal.Rptr. 389, 582 P.2d at 990). Whether the award raises the presumption of passion and prejudice is measured by the same three factors that the jury uses to determine the amount of the award initially: \u201creprehensibility of defendant\u2019s misdeeds, the ratio between the compensatory and punitive damages, and the ratio between the damages and the defendant\u2019s net worth.\u201d Id. (quoting <em>Las Palmas Assocs. v. Las Palmas Ctr. Assocs., </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1220, 1 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 323 (Ct.App.1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We find that the damages award is excessive in relation to O\u2019Connor\u2019s wealth. As a general rule, punitive damages awards of approximately 10 percent of the defendant\u2019s net worth and less have been upheld by California courts, while awards exceeding that amount have been set aside as excessive. <em>Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc., </em>155 Cal.App.3d 381, 202 Cal.Rptr. 204, 211 (Ct.App.1984) (tabulating a sample of sixteen cases); <em>see also Michelson, </em>36 Cal.Rptr.2d at 359 (\u201c[Punitive] awards generally are not allowed to exceed 10 percent of the net worth of the defendant.\u201d); <em>People ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Grocers Wholesale Co., </em>214 Cal.App.3d 498, 262 Cal.Rptr. 689, 700 (Ct.App.1989) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Here, neither the jury nor the district court made any express findings regarding net worth against which we can apply this 10 percent benchmark. Nevertheless, the only evidence that suggests that O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s net worth exceeded $8 million was Tiffany O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony that her father used to say that he was worth $25 million. Given that Provident made no attempt to establish any context, including when Tiffany heard these statements, that most of the events about which she testified happened when she was a young child, and that her report differed by almost an order of magnitude from other estimates of net worth, no reasonable jury would have relied on this statement. <em>Cf. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50,106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (judgment as a matter of law may be granted where evidence on the other side is \u201cmerely colorable\u201d or \u201cis not significantly probative\u201d). Nor can the award be saved by Provident\u2019s argument that the other two estimates of net worth, which were both between $2 million and $3 million, underestimated O\u2019Connor\u2019s assets, such as his collection of antique cars. Provident did not provide evidence that suggested that the other estimates of net worth were understated by over $20 million, as would have been the case were Tiffany O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony accurate, or even that they fell $4.5 million short, which would have been required to place the punitive damages award within the 10 percent range.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Because a reasonable jury could not have relied on Tiffany O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony, the $800,000 punitive damages award is excessive in relation to O\u2019Connor\u2019s wealth. And because California law provides that a punitive damages award can be excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number><em>\u201cfor that reason alone,\u201d </em>even if the award is \u201centirely reasonable in light of the other two factors,\u201d <em>Adams, </em>284 Cal.Rptr. 818, 818 P.2d at 1351 (emphasis in the original), we do not decide whether the award was reasonable in light of the reprehensibility of O\u2019Connor\u2019s misconduct or its ratio to the compensatory damages award. Rather, we conclude that the award was excessive as a matter of law and remand to the district court with instructions to enter an appropriate remittitur only as to the amount of punitive damages, or in the alternative for a new trial on the amount of punitive damages. <em>Michelson, </em>36 Cal.Rptr.2d at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">III. O\u2019CONNOR\u2019S COUNTERCLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Botosan v. Paul McNally Realty, </em>216 F.3d 827, 830 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Provident on O\u2019Connor\u2019s bad faith claim. Under California law, an insurer does not violate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing unless it withholds benefits \u201cunreasonably.\u201d <em>Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 31 Cal.Rptr.2d 433, 440 (Ct.App.1994). Provident\u2019s denial of O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim was not unreasonable because there existed genuine issues of fact as to O\u2019Connor\u2019s disability. <em>Franceschi v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., </em>852 F.2d 1217,1220 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">We also reject any arguments regarding O\u2019Connor\u2019s other counterclaims and his prayer for punitive damages because he waived these arguments by failing to raise them adequately in his opening brief. <em>See Greenwood v. FAA, </em>28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1994). Furthermore, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment because O\u2019Connor failed to present evidence which would indicate a genuine dispute of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the jury verdict and the rulings of the district court on all issues except the question whether punitive damages are excessive. With regard to that issue, we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court with instructions to enter an appropriate remittitur or alternatively to order a new trial on the amount of punitive damages. Each party shall bear its own costs on Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
