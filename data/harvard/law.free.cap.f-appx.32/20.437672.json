The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that Bronga was \u201cnot disabled\u201d under the Act, and therefore not entitled to Disability Insurance Benefits. The ALJ\u2019s determination was affirmed by the Appeals Counsel. The District Court\u2019s subsequent affirmance is now before us on appeal. We will also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and we have jurisdiction on appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-20\">Our standard of review requires us to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s determination was based on \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence requires \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation omitted). As long as the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, we must not conduct our own independent evaluation of the evidence. <em>Fargnoli v. Massanari, </em>247 F.3d 34, 38 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-21\">Bronga alleges that she is disabled due to abdominal pain, and disorders of the urinary tract and female reproductive sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tem. After considering evidence of Bronga\u2019s functional capacity, the ALJ acknowledged that her physical condition did limit her ability to do certain light work. Nonetheless, the ALJ concluded that she was still able to do her past relevant work as a computer systems hardware analyst, because it was a sedentary position.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The District Court carefully reviewed the evidence in this case, as well as the ALJ\u2019s opinion, and disposed of each of Bronga\u2019s arguments in a detailed and thoughtful manner. We agree with the District Court that the ALJ properly concluded at step four of the five-step analysis that Bronga was not disabled because she is able to do her \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d Furthermore, the District Court correctly found that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s determination of Bronga\u2019s residual functional capacity, as well as its finding that her subjective complaints were not fully credible. We likewise agree with the District Court that the ALJ properly considered the treating physician\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Accordingly, we will AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
