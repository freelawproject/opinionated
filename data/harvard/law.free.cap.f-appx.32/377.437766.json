R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b423-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">Victor Jango appeals the 24-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for conspiracy and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 871 and 1956(h), respectively. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Jango\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no arguable issues for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-19\">Jango has filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he contends that he was denied the right of allocution at sentencing. Our review of the record, however, reveals that Jango did have the opportunity to personally address the court, and therefore, no error resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">Having conducted an independent review of the record as required by <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no arguable issues for review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-18\">. Pursuant to a signed plea agreement, Jango waived his right to appeal any sentence imposed within the statutory maximum and where the district court determined the total offense level at 17 or below. Because the district court failed to comply with Fed. R. Crim P. Rule 11(c)(6) and informed Jango at the change of plea that he had the right to appeal the application of the guidelines, we determine that we retain jurisdiction to review Jango\u2019s claim on appeal. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"Given the district court judge\u2019s clear statements at sentencing, the defendant\u2019s assertion of understanding, and the prosecution\u2019s failure to object, we hold that in these circumstances, the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement controls and the plea agreement waiver is not enforceable.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
