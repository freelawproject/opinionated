We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order and uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1097-98 (9th Cir. 1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">The ALJ properly rejected treating physician Dr. Papillion\u2019s opinion because objective evidence did not support the opinion, and it conflicted with her own clinical findings. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751 (9th Cir.1989) (stating that an ALJ may reject the conclusory opinion of a treating physician if the opinion is unsupported by clinical findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-18\">The ALJ properly discredited Sainz\u2019s allegations of disabling pain because they were inconsistent with her testimony, her reported activities of daily living, her treating physician\u2019s conservative course of treatment, and the objective medical evidence. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1996) (explaining that ALJ must provide specific and cogent reasons for discrediting claimant\u2019s subjective testimony regarding pain). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that because Sainz retains the residual functional capacity to perform light work with certain functional limitations, she can perform her past relevant work. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">We decline to consider Sainz\u2019s contention that the ALJ improperly classified her past relevant work as \u201cCashier II\u201d because she failed to raise that issue before the district court. <em>See Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152,1158 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b440-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
