Graham appeals his conviction, following a jury trial, for unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.A \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West 2000), and sentence to sixty-three months incarceration followed by three years supervised release. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Graham first claims the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo, asking whether there is substantial evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, to support a jury\u2019s finding of guilt. <em>See United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996). Based on our review of the joint appendix, we find there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Graham previously had been convicted of a felony, that he voluntarily and intentionally possessed a firearm, and that the firearm had traveled in or affected interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1). <em>See also United States v. Gallimore, 247 </em>F.3d 134, 136 (4th eir.2001) (discussing elements of offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Graham next claims the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on the Government\u2019s remarks during closing argument about the veracity of a witness\u2019s testimony. We review the denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>221 F.3d 615, 618 (4th Cir.2000). The two-prong test for assessing prosecutorial misconduct requires the court to determine: (1) whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks or conduct were improper, and (2) whether such remarks or conduct prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights so as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>United States v. Francisco, </em>35 F.3d 116, 120 (4th Cir.1994). Even if the Government\u2019s statements were improper, we find Graham was not prejudiced by these remarks. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>1 F.3d 235, 241 (4th Cir.1993). We therefore conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Graham\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Graham next claims the district court\u2019s use of a cross reference, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) (2000), to sentence Graham under USSG \u00a7 2B3.1 for robbery violated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>does not prohibit a sentencing court from finding facts relating to the application of the guidelines, as long as the sentence imposed is less than the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>235 F.3d 215, 219 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 39, 151 L.Ed.2d 12 (2001); <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). Because Graham\u2019s sixty-three month sentence is within the applicable ten year statutory maximum for the offense of conviction, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (West 2000), <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">Graham finally claims the district court\u2019s assessment of a five-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) for brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm in connection with robbery constituted impermissible double counting. A general cross reference \u201crefers to the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tire offense guideline.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.5(a). Thus, we conclude the district court\u2019s enhancement of Graham\u2019s sentence under the guidelines for robbery did not constitute double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Graham\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
