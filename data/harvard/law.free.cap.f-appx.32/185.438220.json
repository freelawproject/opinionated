Jackson brought this action against the University of Nebraska Board of Regents (University), claiming the University terminated his Ph.D. program, harassed him, and otherwise discriminated against him based on his race, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d to 2000d-7. At trial, after the close of Jackson\u2019s proof, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered judgment as a matter of law for the University, and Jackson appeals. Having reviewed the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo, <em>see Clark v. Runyon, </em>218 F.3d 915, 918 (8th Cir.2000), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">We agree with the district court that Jackson did not prove that any of the allegedly discriminatory or harassing actions were based on his race. <em>See Habib v. NationsBank, </em>279 F.3d 563, 566 (8th Cir. 2001); <em>Bradley v. Widnall, </em>232 F.3d 626, 632 (8th Cir.2000); <em>Fuller v. Rayburn, </em>161 F.3d 516, 518 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-18\">. The HONORABLE DAVID L. PIESTER, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Nebraska, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
