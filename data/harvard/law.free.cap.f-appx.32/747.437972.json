Ashley sued various prison officials, alleging that they violated his constitutional rights when they confined him in segregation for threatening to sue a prison official. The district court dismissed for failure to state a claim, and Ashley appeals. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">Ashley is an inmate at the Danville Correctional Center. On March 28, 2000, Ashley met with Captain Vanessa Seamon because he wanted to declare an inmate on his assigned wing an \u201cenemy\u201d and be housed in another area. Seamon refused to authorize an immediate transfer, but promised to investigate the situation. Seamon then told Ashley that he had to return to his assigned cell that evening, but that he could speak with Internal Affairs in the morning. Ashley then asked, \u201cDid I mention that I work in the law library?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">Captain Seamon immediately ordered Ashley to be confined in segregation and prepared a disciplinary report charging him with \u201cintimidation and threats.\u201d Ashley spent five days in segregation.' After a hearing the Adjustment Committee found Ashley guilty of the charge and sentenced him to five days in segregation (time considered served). While detained in segregation, Ashley was not allowed to smoke cigarettes, watch television, listen to the radio, make telephone calls, or have reading material.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-19\">After his stay in segregation Ashley filed a grievance with the Illinois Department of Corrections claiming that Captain Seamon retaliated against him for allegedly threatening to sue her. The grievance officer denied Ashley\u2019s grievance, and Warden Paul Barnett concurred. Ashley appealed to the Administrative Review Board, which found the charge against Ashley unsubstantiated and recommended that the disciplinary report be expunged from his master file and disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>In January 2000 Ashley sued various prison officials, presumably under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that they violated his First Amendment right to free speech, his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights when they detained him in segregation for five days for allegedly threatening to sue Captain Seamon. The district court dismissed the case under \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim, concluding that Ashley\u2019s due process claim failed because he \u201chad no liberty interest to remain in the prison\u2019s general population\u201d and that Ashley\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim failed because \u201cAshley\u2019s description of his stay in segregation and its duration [were not] \u2018sufficiently serious.\u2019 \u201d The district court did not address Ashley\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim. In seeking leave to appeal in forma a pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d), Ashley informed the district court that it had not addressed his First Amendment claim. The court then granted leave to appeal IFP, noting that it had not interpreted Ashley\u2019s complaint \u201cin the light in which he now presents it.\u201d The court concluded that Ashley\u2019s IFP petition elucidated \u201ca first amendment claim that is consistent with his pleadings \u2014 retaliation for freedom of speech and access to the courts,\u201d and conceded that its \u00a7 1915A dismissal \u201cdid not pass on those particular claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We review dismissals under \u00a7 1915A de novo and will affirm only when it appears beyond doubt that no set of facts supports the plaintiffs claim. <em>Wynn v. Southward, </em>251 F.3d 588, 591-92 (7th Cir.2001). Although no party disputes our jurisdiction over this appeal, the district court\u2019s acknowledged oversight in not addressing Ashley\u2019s First Amendment claim calls into question the finality of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">A district court\u2019s order is final if the court clearly intends it to be final and uses language that is \u201ccalculated to conclude all the claims before the district court.\u201d <em>Munson Transp., Inc. v. Hajjar, </em>148 F.3d 711, 714 (7th Cir.1998) (concluding that district court\u2019s order was final, despite not addressing all claims before the court, because it stated that \u201c[t]his case is terminated\u201d); <em>see also Moreau v. Harris County, </em>158 F.3d 241, 244 (5th Cir.1998) (advocating a \u201cpractical approach\u201d in deciding finality issues and holding that a judgment is final \u201cso long as it is apparent that the district judge intended the judgment to dispose of all claims\u201d). In dismissing the case for failure to state a claim, the district court concluded that \u201c[t]he case is terminated.\u201d Because the court used language that was calculated to conclude all the claims before it, the judgment is final. <em>See Munson, </em>148 F.3d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Turning to the merits, Ashley first argues that he adequately stated a First Amendment retaliation claim by alleging that he was detained in segregation for allegedly threatening to sue Captain Seamon. Prisoners have a First Amendment right to free speech, <em>see Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 125, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977); <em>Martin v. Brewer, </em>830 F.2d 76, 77 (7th Cir.1987), and restrictions on that right will be upheld only if they are \u201creasonably related to legitimate penological interests,\u201d <em>see Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 413, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989) (citing <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)); <em>Massey v. Wheeler, </em>221 F.3d 1030, 1035 (7th Cir.2000). Further, prison officials may not retaliate against an inmate for exercising his First Amendment rights, even if their actions would not independently violate the Constitution. <em>See Zimmerman v. Tribble, </em>226 F.3d 568, 573 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Babcock v. White, </em>102 F.3d 267, 275 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>\u201cA complaint states a claim for retaliation when it sets forth \u2018a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>226 F.3d at 573 (citation omitted). Ashley\u2019s complaint alleges that he was immediately placed in segregation after asking Captain Seamon, \u201cDid I mention that I work in the law library?\u201d Because such a chronology arguably presents a colorable claim of retaliation, we conclude that Ashley\u2019s allegations state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See id </em>at 574. (reversing district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915A dismissal because inmate\u2019s allegations established that \u201cthe exercise of his [First Amendment] right was closely followed by the retaliatory act\u201d). Upon further development of the facts it may be the case that Ashley\u2019s threat of legal action was illegitimate or reasonably interpreted as a threat of physical violence, <em>see Goff v. Dailey, </em>991 F.2d 1437,1439 (8th Cir.1993); <em>Sires v. Berman, </em>834 F.2d 9, 13-14 (1st Cir.1987); <em>Harrison v. Seay, </em>856 F.Supp. 1275, 1279 (W.D.Tenn.1994), but such a determination is not possible on the record before us. Thus we express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of this claim, but decide only that Ashley has alleged enough to state a colorable First Amendment retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Finally, Ashley argues that he adequately stated a claim under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by alleging that while in segregation he was not allowed to smoke cigarettes, watch television, listen to the radio, make telephone calls, or have reading material. This contention is frivolous. First, the district court correctly determined that Ashley\u2019s deprivations were not sufficiently serious to rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (concluding that a sufficiently serious deprivation must result in the denial of \u201cthe minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities\u201d such as shelter, sanitation, food, personal safety, medical care, and clothing); <em>Harris v. Fleming, </em>839 F.2d 1232, 1235 (7th Cir.1988) (concluding that ten days in segregation unit without toilet paper, toothbrush or toothpaste, and in \u201cfilthy, roach-infested cell\u201d did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment). Second, the district court correctly determined that no liberty interest protected by due process was implicated by the disciplinary punishment of five days in segregation. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (concluding that detention in segregation did not constitute an \u201catypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest\u201d); <em>Thomas v. Ramos, </em>130 F.3d 754, 762 (7th Cir.1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
