Accordingly we have revised the caption to reflect the correct spelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b616-28\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b616-29\">MICHEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b616-30\">The Secretary of Veterans Affairs moves to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Richard Myszka\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Myszka has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-31\">The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals determining that a 1959 rating decision denying Myszka\u2019s claim for service connection for pruritus ani was not the product of clear and unmistakable error. Myszka appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, not every decision entered by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is appealable. Section 7292(a) provides that a party may only seek review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims with respect to the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation relied on by the court in making its decision. Further, except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, this court may not review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). If an appellant\u2019s case does not meet these criteria, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d) requires this court to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In his informal brief, Myszka generally challenges the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision. Although he checks \u201cyes\u201d on his informal brief when asked whether the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided constitutional issues or rendered a decision involving the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation, Myszka fails to identify any such issues. Rather, Myszka alleges that certain medical records are missing, that the Regional Office failed to consider certain existing records, and asks this court \u201c[t]o establish that ... I receive and I am entitled to compensation .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Myszka\u2019s allegations of error relate to factual determinations and the application of law and regulation to the facts. Because Myszka does not challenge the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation or raise an identifiable constitutional issue, this court\u2019s limited jurisdiction does not permit appellate review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Livingston v. Derwinski, </em>959 F.2d 224, 225-26 (Fed.Cir. 1992); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">(4) The revised official caption is reflected above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
