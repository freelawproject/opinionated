Motto was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and 8 years\u2019 supervised release. He was also fined $5,000 and assessed $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">On appeal, Motto contends the District Court erred in relying on inaccurate information in the Presentence Report resulting in a sentence greater than the government\u2019s recommendation. He also claims error under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">After release from prison in July 1991, Vincent Motto started up a drug distribution conspiracy out of his home at 1943 South Jessup Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Over the course of the conspiracy, Motto supplied large amounts of marijuana and cocaine for resale to Louis Acciavatti and Vincent Vitola. He also sold cocaine to and purchased marijuana from Michael Cammarata. At times, Motto would have hundreds of pounds of marijuana stored at his South Jessup Street residence and in various parked cars in South Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">The District Court adopted the factual findings and sentencing guideline recommendations in the Presentence Report. Motto\u2019s initial offense level was 28. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6). Two levels were added because the offense occurred within 1000 feet of a protected area. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2(a)(l). Three levels were added for managing or supervising a conspiracy involving at least 5 people. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). Three offense levels were reduced because Motto accepted responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With an adjusted offense level of 30 and a Criminal History Category of III, the applicable sentence range was 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Motto stipulated to having a prior felony drug conviction, which brought him under the statutory mandatory sentence of 120 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The District Court imposed a 135 month prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">We lack jurisdiction to review the imposition of a sentence within the applicable guideline range, unless it is in violation of the law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). The District Court imposed a mid-range sentence, finding, inter alia, Motto not contrite (paragraphs 31, 89-95 of the Presentence Report). Motto asserts the District Court reached this conclusion in part because portions of paragraphs 90 and 91 were inaccurate. But Motto failed to raise these objections to the District Court. \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>is well established in this circuit, and all others, that a sentencing court may rely on the facts set forth in the presentence report when their accuracy is not challenged by the defendant.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Watkins, </em>54 F.3d 163, 167 (3d Cir.1995). See also <em>U.S. v. Bregnard, </em>951 F.2d 457, 460 (1st Cir. 1991) (\u201c[F]acts stated in presentence reports are deemed admitted if they are not challenged in the district court.\u201d). Sentencing judges have discretion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.1 to impose any term of imprisonment within the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. We see no error in sentencing Motto to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Motto claims the District Court erred by not following <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. We disagree. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490 (emphasis supplied). This is so because each fact that can change a defendant\u2019s potential punishment constitutes an \u201celement\u201d of the crime, which must be proved by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Applying a lesser standard of proof for elements of a crime would violate the defendant\u2019s Constitutional Due Process rights. But, \u201ca District Court\u2019s sentence under the statutory maximum cannot be constitutionally objectionable under <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Williams, </em>235 F.3d 858, 863 (3d Cir. 2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 49,151 L.Ed.2d 19 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Motto pled guilty to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), which is punishable under \u00a7 841(b). The lowest maximum sentence prescribed under the section applicable (\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)) to the attributable quantity of narcotics is 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. But the statutory maximum increases to life imprisonment if the defendant \u201ccommits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Therefore, Motto\u2019s maximum sentence increased from 40 years to life because he stipulated to a prior final conviction for a felony drug offense. (App.75) (Plea Agreement H 9(d)). With an adjusted offense level of 30 and a Criminal History Category III, his guideline range was 121-151 months\u2019 imprisonment at least 329 months less than the lower statutory maximum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The District Court sentenced Motto in the middle of the range to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment at least 345 months less than the lower statutory maximum. Had Motto been placed in Criminal History Category VI (the highest category), his guideline range would have been only 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment still at least 270 months less than the lower statutory maximum penalty under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). In light of Williams, a sentence of 135 months is not \u201cconstitutionally objectionable under <em>Apprendi.\u201d </em>253 F.3d at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
