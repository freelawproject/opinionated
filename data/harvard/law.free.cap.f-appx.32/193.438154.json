She was sentenced to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release, and was ordered to pay $197,744.86 in restitution. Her counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and O\u2019Tool has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-22\">Counsel first argues that the District Court erred in calculating the amount of loss and restitution. This argument fails because O\u2019Tool withdrew her objections to the presentence report, and the court was entitled to rely on the unobjected-to facts in it regarding that amount. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>75 F.3d 439, 442 (8th Cir. 1996). Counsel also argues that the District Court should have granted a requested downward departure, but this matter is unreviewable on appeal because the court acknowledged its authority to depart and declined to do so. <em>See United States v. Wolf, </em>270 F.3d 1188, 1192 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-23\">After reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no non-frivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-24\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-18\">.
