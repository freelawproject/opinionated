We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we review de novo, <em>United States v. Sumner, </em>226 F.3d 1005, 1009 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">Lopez-Serrato contends that the district court erred by concluding that it lacked the inherent power, under equitable principles, to expunge criminal records and subsequently denying his motion to expunge his prior convictions. This contention is unpersuasive as we have previously held that federal courts do not have ancillary jurisdiction \u201cin a criminal case to expunge [a] ... conviction record where the sole basis alleged by the defendant is that he or she seeks equitable relief.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 1015; <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>940 F.2d 395, 396 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that the effects of a conviction, including limitations on future employment, were not adequate grounds for expunction, but were instead, \u201cthe natural consequence of having been convicted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b422-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
