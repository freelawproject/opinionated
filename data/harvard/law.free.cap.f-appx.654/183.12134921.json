He contended that a prior Texas conviction for causing bodily injury was not a crime of violence or. an aggravated felony for purposes of increasing his ' sentence. During the pen-dency of this appeal, Jimenez-Trejo was released from custody and deported. He is not under a sentence of supervised release. Consequently, this court cannot afford him any of the relief sought with regard to his sentence, and his appeal is moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7-8, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>United States v. Ramon, </em>320 F.3d 519, 519-20 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"ANq\">The appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ACf_\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
