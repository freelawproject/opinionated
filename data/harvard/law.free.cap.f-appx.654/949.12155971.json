Plaintiff sued Defendant alleging, among other things, that Defendant negligently failed to warn of the deck\u2019s slippery condition and that Defendant negligently maintained the deck. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant. Plaintiff appealed. Because Plaintiff raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant breached its duty to warn Plaintiff, we reverse and remand the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant. Further, because Defendant never moved for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs negligent maintenance claim, the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Defendant as to that claim is likewise reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">On March 18, 2011, Plaintiff and his wife traveled from them home in Illinois to Honolulu. The following day, Plaintiff, his wife, and their friends, Tish and Steve Stanner, boarded the Pride of America, a cruise ship operated by Defendant. After dinner that evening, the couples set off to explore the ship. They exited to an outside deck through a sliding glass door. Plaintiff was the last to exit. After taking a couple of steps, he slipped and fell. Plaintiff testified that he was \u201cup all night\u201d in \u201cexcruciating pain.\u201d The next morning, the ship arrived at the Maui port, where Plaintiff and his wife disembarked the ship and went to the emergency room. Plaintiff was given cratches and pain medication. He spent the remainder of the cruise in significant pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">Back in Illinois, Plaintiff had an MRI, which revealed that his right hamstring had become detached from the bone. Plaintiff underwent surgery to repair his -hamstring, followed by more than a year of physical therapy. As of the date of his deposition, Plaintiff was still experiencing \u201ccontinuous pain,\u201d significantly impaired mobility, and \u201ca tremendous amount of social anxiety\u201d as a result of the fall. His personal relationships and his professional life diminished due to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">Plaintiff sued Defendant, alleging a single count for negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was referred to a magistrate judge with the consent of the parties. Defendant moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>ure to warn claim. The magistrate judge granted Defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant then filed a motion to tax costs against Plaintiff, which the magistrate judge granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiff appeals both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The district court granted Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion on three grounds. First, Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the water on the deck had come from a leak in the ceiling overhanging part of the deck. Yet Plaintiff presented no evidence that water from a leaky ceiling caused his fall. Instead, as the litigation progressed, it became clear that the water on the deck resulted from precipitation. But Plaintiff never amended his complaint to that effect. Second, the district court concluded that Plaintiff saw that the deck was wet before he slipped, and Defendant was under no obligation to warn Plaintiff of such an \u201copen and obvious\u201d condition. And third, the district court held that Plaintiff adduced insufficient evidence to show that Defendant was on notice that the deck was dangerously slippery when wet. The district court also entered summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiffs negligent maintenance claim. The court explained that Plaintiff had not adequately pled such a claim, and, even if he had, there was no evidence in the record to establish a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">On appeal, Plaintiff contends that the district court erred by holding that (1) Plaintiff had to amend his complaint to correct his allegation as to the source of the water on the deck, (2) record evidence did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Defendant\u2019s prior notice of the deck\u2019s dangerous condition, (3) the dangerously slippery nature of the deck was open and obvious, and (4) Plaintiff did not plead a claim for failure to properly maintain the deck surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, resolving all reasonable factual disputes in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Liebman v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>808 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir. 2015). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Gennusa v. Canova, </em>748 F.3d 1103, 1108 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); <em>Bradley v. Franklin Collection Serv., Inc., </em>739 F.3d 606, 608 (11th Cir. 2014)). On the other hand, summary judgment is improper \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We review the district court\u2019s fact-finding for clear error. <em>Levinson v. Reliance Std. Life Ins. Co., </em>245 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th. Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Federal maritime law governs this dispute because (1) the alleged tort occurred on navigable waters, (2) the incident (i.e., injury on a cruise) has the potential to disrupt maritime commerce, and (3) the general activity giving rise to the incident (i.e., transporting passengers on a cruise ship) has a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity. <em>See Doe v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., </em>394 F.3d 891, 900 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>513 U.S. 527, 534, 115 S.Ct. 1043, 130 L.Ed.2d 1024 (1995)). In order to prevail on a maritime tort claim, a plaintiff must show that \u201c(1) the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular injury; (2) the defendant breached that duty; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>(3) the breach actually and proximately caused the plaintiffs injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered actual harm.\u201d <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1336 (11th Cir. 2012). Regarding the breach element, \u201cthe benchmark against which a shipowner\u2019s behavior must be measured is ordinary reasonable care under the circumstances, a standard which requires, as a prerequisite to imposing liability, that the carrier have had actual or constructive notice of the risk-creating condition.... \u201d <em>Keefe v. Bahama Cruise Line, Inc., </em>867 F.2d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">1. Plaintiffs failure to warn claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Defendant does not dispute that under federal maritime law, an operator of a cruise, ship has a duty to warn of known dangers that are not open and obvious. <em>Isbell v. Carnival Corp., </em>462 F.Supp.2d 1232, 1237 (S.D. Fla. 2006) (quoting <em>Luby v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., </em>633 F.Supp. 40, 41 (S.D. Fla. 1986), <em>aff'd, </em>808 F.2d 60 (11th Cir. 1986) (unpublished)); <em>Samuels v. Holland Am. Line-USA Inc., </em>656 F.3d 948, 954 (9th Cir. 2011) (\u201cBecause Holland American had neither actual nor constructive notice of a dangerous condition on the Pacific Ocean side of Lover\u2019s Beach, it had no duty to warn Samuels about swimming there. For this reason, we have no need to address whether the possible dangers of swimming at that location were open and obvious....\u201d); <em>c.f. N. V. Stoomvaarb Maatschappij \u2019\u2019\u201cNederland\u201d v. Throner, </em>345 F.2d 472, 472 (5th Cir. 1965). Defendant argues, however, that it did not have prior knowledge of the danger and that the danger was open and obvious to Plaintiff. Thus, in order to defeat summary judgment in favor of Defendant, Plaintiff must raise a genuine issue of material fact as to (1) whether Defendant had notice, either actual or constructive, of the deck\u2019s slipperiness and (2) whether the dangerous condition was open and obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">We deal first with the question whether the dangerous condition was open and obvious. At the outset, we note that, as with general tort law, our analysis is guided by the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard. <em>Lamb by Shepard v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>1 F.3d 1184, 1189-90 (11th Cir. 1993) (applying Georgia law and stating that \u201c[wjhether a danger is open and obvious is determined \u2018on the basis of an objective view\u2019 and that \u2018the subjective perceptions of the ... injured party are irrelevant\u2019 \u201d); <em>Lugo v. Carnival Corp., </em>154 F.Supp.3d 1341, 1346, (S.D. Fla. 2015) (\u201c[The plaintiffs] subjective observations are irrelevant in determining whether a duty to warn existed.\u201d). Thus, the question is whether a reasonable person would have observed the deck\u2019s wetness and appreciated its resultant slickness. The relevant facts are as follows. Plaintiff, his wife, and their friends finished dinner and decided to explore the ship\u2019s outside deck. They exited the restaurant and walked through an adjoining wine bar to access the deck via a glass sliding door. Although the sun had set, it is undisputed that (1) the deck was well lit, (2) there was a \u201cheavy fog\u201d or mist in the air, (3) the deck was visibly \u201cwet and shiny,\u201d and (4) there were \u201cpuddles of water\u201d on the deck\u2019s surface. Under these circumstances, a reasonable person approaching the outer deck would have perceived the outdoor conditions through the \u201cordinary use of [his] senses\u201d and would have concluded based on those conditions that the deck\u2019s surface would likely be slicker than usual. <em>Luby, </em>633 F.Supp. at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Importantly, however, Plaintiff introduced an expert\u2019s report suggesting that the deck in question is <em>unreasonably </em>slippery when wet. The report suggests that a reasonable person would have known that the deck would be slippery, but not as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>slippery as it actually was. A jury could credit the expert\u2019s testimony and conclude that the deck\u2019s visible wetness and the weather conditions would not alert a reasonable observer to the <em>extent </em>of the deck\u2019s slipperiness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This conclusion is bolstered by the uncontroverted fact that Mr. Stanner, one of Plaintiffs travel companions, also slipped (though did not fall) when exiting onto the deck. Given these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the degree of slipperiness on the deck was not open and obvious. Thus, Plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to that issue. The district court erred in granting Defendant summary judgment on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Defendant\u2019s second argument is that summary judgment is warranted because it lacked prior notice of the dangerous condition and therefore had no duty to warn Plaintiff of the deck\u2019s slickness. <em>See Keefe, </em>867 F.2d at 1322. Plaintiff points to three pieces of record evidence to show that Defendant did know about the slippery condition: (1) a safety video that Defendant played on the televisions in passenger cabins that warned passengers that the ship\u2019s decks could be \u201cvery slippery,\u201d (2) testimony that there were prior slip and falls on the same surface,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) an expert report concluding that Defendant\u2019s decks did not meet industry standards for how slippery a cruise ship deck should be. We address only the first piece of evidence, which is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding Defendant\u2019s prior notice of the dangerous condition on the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Defendant\u2019s safety video for the Pride of America, which played on televisions in passenger cabins, warns passengers that \u201coutside decks will get wet from salt spray and sea air <em>and can become very slippery.\u201d </em>In analyzing whether this video warning raises a genuine issue of material fact as to Defendant\u2019s knowledge, our recent decision in <em>Sorrels v. NCL (Bahamas) Ltd., </em>796 F.3d 1275 (11th- Cir. 2015), is instructive. There, we held that the plaintiff had raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the cruise ship operator\u2019s prior knowledge where there was testimony that \u201cwarning signs were sometimes posted on the pool deck after rain\u201d to warn passengers of the deck\u2019s slipperiness. <em>Id. </em>at 1288-89. We find no meaningful distinction between the practice of displaying warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>signs on the one hand and of showing warning videos on the other. Each allows the inference that the cruise ship operator had \u201cactual or constructive knowledge that the [surface in question] could be slippery (and therefore dangerous) when wet.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1288. It follows that the safety video warning of the decks' slipperiness when wet is enough to withstand summary judgment as to Defendant\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">There is also testimony that Defendant warned passengers about the decks\u2019' slippery nature during a safety drill on the first day of the cruise. Although Plaintiff does not cite this testimony in support of his argument regarding Defendant\u2019s prior notice of the dangerous condition, we note that it is probative of Defendant\u2019s knowledge, just as the warning video is.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">In sum, Plaintiff raised a genuine issue of material fact as to (1) whether the slippery condition on the deck was open and obvious and (2) whether Defendant had prior notice of the slippery condition. Accordingly, the district court erred in granting Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">2. Plaintiff\u2019s negligent maintenance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">After Defendant moved for summary judgment, Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint stipulation of facts, in which Plaintiff asserted that Defendant \u201cdid not take the appropriate action to construct and maintain the deck in reasonable non-skid transition and/or warn of the dangerous condition of the deck when wet.\u201d In response, Defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude all evidence of theories not presented in Plaintiffs complaint, including Plaintiffs theory of negligent construction and maintenance of the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>The magistrate judge addressed Defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>in his summary judgment order, explaining that Plaintiffs complaint \u201cdoes not allege a negligent design, maintenance, selection, or construction theory.\u201d This factual finding is clearly erroneous, in part. Plaintiffs complaint does assert a negligent maintenance claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the introductory section of Plaintiffs complaint states that \u201c[Defendant] breached its duty to [Plaintiff] by failing to maintain this area in a reasonably safe condition under the circumstances.\u201d And Count I alleges that Defendant \u201chad a duty to operate and maintain its [ ] cruise ship ... in a reasonably safe condition under the circumstances, and to warn of and correct any dangerous -or defective conditions of which [Defendant] knew or should have known existed or which it created in or near the area where [Plaintiff] was injured.\u201d Count I goes on to allege, among other things, that Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff by \u201cnegligently fail[ing] to maintain [the] vessel\u201d and \u201cb. negligently failing] to warn [Plaintiff] about the slippery wet conditions on [the] deck.\u201d Thus, Plaintiff unambiguously alleged that Defendant was negligent by (1) failing to maintain the deck in a reasonably safe condition and (2) failing to warn Plaintiff of the deck\u2019s slippery condition. The magistrate judge clearly erred by finding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The magistrate judge compounded his error by granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiffs negligent maintenance claim because Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion addressed only Plaintiffs failure to warn claim. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 states that a party seeking summary judgment must \u201cidentify ] each claim ... or the part of each claim ... on which summary judgment is sought.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A court may grant a motion for summary judgment on grounds not raised by a party only \u201c[a]fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond_\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the magistrate judge provided the parties such notice. Thus, the magistrate judge erred by <em>sua sponte </em>entering summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiffs negligent maintenance claim. <em>See Gentry v. Harborage Cottages-Stuart, LLLP, </em>654 F.3d 1247, 1261 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cIn this case, the court entered judgment on claims not identified by Plaintiffs in their Rule 56 motion and without advance notice. This was error.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">The magistrate judge\u2019s order granting summary judgment and order awarding costs to Defendant are REVERSED. <em>See Sorrels, </em>796 F.3d at 1279 n.1 (\u201cBecause we vacate the district court\u2019s summary judgment order, we vacate the award of costs.\u201d). This action is REMANDED for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\">. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint also asserted a count for loss of consortium, but that count was later voluntarily dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">. The magistrate judge held that there was \u201c[ijnsufficient [ejvidence\u201d to show that \u215b\u215e. deck was unreasonably slippery. With respect to Plaintiff's expert, the magistrate judge explained that the expert did not test the exact spot of the deck on which Plaintiff slipped. Specifically: \"[The expert] tested six different locations, on the ship, two of which admittedly were not where the accident occurred. The other four locations tested were right outside of the wine bar[.] ... [H]owever, [the expert] tested the area outside the <em>wrong </em>doorway.\u201d <em>Frasca v. NCL (Bahamas) Ltd., </em>No. 12-20662-CIV-GOODMAN, 2014 WL 1385806, at *10 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 9, 2014) (internal citations omitted). On appeal, Plaintiff disputes this finding. But even if the expert did not test the location where the slip occurred, the report would not be inadmissible on that basis. <em>See Rosenfeld v. Oceania Cruises, Inc., </em>654 F.3d 1190, 1194 (11th Cir. 2011) (\"[The ship owner] argues that [the expertj's ... [tests were] based on 'incorrect assumption[s]' about the location of [the plaintiff]'s fall. However, ... these arguments attack the weight and the persuasiveness of [the expert\u2019s testimony, not its admissibility. [The ship owner] can raise these arguments on retrial through 'vigorous cross-examination\u2019 and 'presentation, of contrary evidence,\u2019 \u201d),</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b979-10\">. Plaintiff also points to an injury log detailing accidents that occurred on the ship dur-. ing the week of his cruise. The log shows that other passengers also slipped and fell on the decks during the cruise. However, each slip- and-fall listed occurred <em>after </em>Plaintiff\u2019s. Therefore, those falls are not probative of Defendant\u2019s knowledge of the dangerous condition prior to Plaintiff\u2019s fall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. We assume that Defendant\u2019s staff members were aware of the weather conditions, just as we explained above that a reasonable passenger would have known of the conditions. In any event, Defendant has not produced any evidence to suggest that its staff were unaware of the weather conditions at the relevant times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b980-7\">. Plaintiff asserts that he did not see the safety video or hear the warnings concerning wet decks during the safety drill. But even if Plaintiff did see the warning in the video or hear the warning during the drill, a fact-finder will determine whether such warnings were sufficient under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b980-8\">. We disagree with the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that summary judgment was also warranted because Plaintiff\u2019s complaint erroneously alleged that the water on the outer deck came from a leak in the ceiling rather than rainwater. It is true, as the magistrate judge stated, that a party cannot raise a new <em>claim </em>at the summary judgment stage. <em>E.g., Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1314-15 (11th Cir. 2004) (rejecting the plaintiff's attempt to assert a contract claim in his response to the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion where the plaintiff had asserted only tort claims in his complaint). However, the magistrate judge took that proposition too far when it relied on a footnote in <em>GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc. v. Georgia, </em>687 F.3d 1244, 1258 n.27 (11th Cir. 2012), to support the idea that a party cannot introduce additional facts at the summary judgment stage. The pertinent footnote in <em>GeorgiaCanry.org. </em>states that a plaintiff may not convert a count that fails to state a claim into a count that states a claim by alleging new facts in response to a summary judgment motion. Here, however, Plaintiff\u2019s complaint stated a claim for negligence. That claim was premised on Plaintiff\u2019s slip and fall on a slippery deck on Defendant's cruise ship, whatever the source of the water causing the fall may have been. In any event, Defendant was aware of Plaintiff\u2019s causal theory at least two-and-a-half months before Defendant moved for summary judgment. And Defendant knew that the deck was wet from \"rain and sea spray\u201d long before that. Furthermore, the parties appear to have been operating under a mutual understanding that rain, rather than a leaky ceiling, was the culprit. Accordingly, we have no reason to believe that Defendant was ambushed by the erroneous statement in Plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. The magistrate judge correctly concluded, however, that Plaintiff's complaint does not assert a negligent design, selection, or construction theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b981-7\">. The magistrate judge's conclusion is also problematic insofar as it conflates a negligent maintenance claim with a negligent construction, design, or selection claim. The evidence needed to prevail under these theories is different, as is the evidence necessary to withstand summary judgment. And it is not at all clear that the magistrate judge considered whether there was any record evidence to support a negligent <em>maintenance </em>theory. Indeed, the judge reasoned that \"[t]o be liable for negligent design or construction, a defendant must have played some role in the design or construction.\u201d <em>Frasca, </em>2014 WL 1385806, at *9. But no such showing is required to prevail on a negligent maintenance claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
