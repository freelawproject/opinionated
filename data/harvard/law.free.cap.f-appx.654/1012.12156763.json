After various enhancements and reductions, the total offense level was 39. Based on a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history category of I, Valencia-Mosquera\u2019s advisory guideline range was 262 to 327 months. The statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment as to Counts One and Two was 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">At sentencing, the government moved to reduce Valencia-Mosquera\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on his substantial assistance to authorities, and requested that the district court impose a sentence that was 15% below the low end of the advisory guideline range. The court granted the motion and applied a greater reduction than was requested, sentencing Valencia-Mosquera to 126 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts One and Two, the terms to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">In 2015, Valencia-Mosquera filed a motion to reduce his sentence, asserting that the district court had authority to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, and requesting that the court reduce his sentence to 102 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court granted his motion, but only reduced his sentence to 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">On appeal, Valencia-Mosquera argues that the district court did not adequately explain its reasons for the amount of the reduction it granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir. 2008). Where a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1368 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">A district court may modify a sentence if the defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 782 reduced by 2 levels the base offense levels that apply to most drug offenses, including offenses involving cocaine. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir. 2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range. <em>Id. </em>At this step, all other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must decide whether, in its discretion and in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence and, if so, to what extent. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence becomes the guideline sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). In any other case, the sentence may be imposed at any point within the applicable guideline range, provided that the sentence is not less than the statutorily required minimum sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5Gl.l(c). A defendant convicted of possession, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503(a), 70506(b), is subject to a 10-year or 120-month mandatory minimum sentence. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B); 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70506(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">A district court may apply a variance and impose a sentence outside of the advisory guideline range if it finds that a variance is justified under the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir. 2009). At a defendant\u2019s original sentencing, a court may impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum, on the government\u2019s motion, in order to reflect his substantial assistance to authorities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). Guided departures, which are departures specifically provided for in the Sentencing Guidelines, also permit a court to impose a sentence outside of the advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1252 (11th Cir. 2006). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 provides for a departure from the guideline range based on a government motion stating that the defendant provided substantial assistance to authorities. In the absence of a request by the government for the district court to impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum, the government\u2019s filing of a substantial assistance motion pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 does not authorize the court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. <em>Melendez v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 120, 124-30, 116 S.Ct. 2057, 2060-63, 135 L.Ed.2d 427 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">Generally, a district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) below the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A); <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir. 2012). However, where a defendant originally received a below-guidelines sentence pursuant to a government motion to reflect his substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction that is \u201ccomparably less\u201d than the amended guideline range \u201cmay be appropriate.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) provides that, where the sentencing court originally had the authority to impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, the amended guideline range is determined \u201cwithout regard\u201d to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1\u2019s requirement that the guideline range not fall below the mandatory minimum. <em>See also United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that the district court\u2019s grant of the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion did not effectively waive the statutory mandatory minimum for purposes of resentencing, where the defendant\u2019s guideline range was displaced by the statutory mandatory minimum that was higher than the top end of the otherwise applicable guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">Here, the district court was not authorized to reduce Valenciar-Mosquera\u2019s sentence any further in light of the applicable 120-month statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B); 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70506(a). At the original sentencing proceeding, the district court did not have the authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum because the government only moved to reduce Valencia-Mos-quera\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See Melendez, </em>518 U.S. at 124-30, 116 S.Ct. at 2060-63. At the proceeding, the government stated that it was only authorized to request a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1, requested a 15% reduction from the guideline range, and did not request that the court sentence Valencia-Mosquera below the statutory minimum in light of his substantial assistance. Therefore, at resentencing Valencia-Mos-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>quera remained subject to the 120-month statutory minimum and the bottom of the amended guideline range was 120 months, and the court could not reduce his sentence to a term below 120 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A), (c); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.1(b)-(c). Because the district court was not authorized to grant Valencia-Mos-quera any greater sentence reduction, we need not address whether it adequately stated the reasons for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-2\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
