Damone argues that the administrative law judge erred by failing to consider her combination of impairments, discrediting her subjective complaints of pain, and discounting the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Derrick Bowling. We affirm'.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">The administrative law judge considered, the combination of Damone\u2019s impairments in determining whether she was disabled. In his decision, the administrative law judge stated that Damone had four severe impairments: \u201cfirst right toe arthritis status post reconstructive surgery, lumbar degenerative disk disease, affective disorder and personality disorder.\u201d But the administrative law judge found that Da-mone\u2019s combination of impairments did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u201cmeet[ ] or medically equal[ ] the severity of one of the [listed] impairments.\u201d <em>See Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir. 1991). The administrative law judge explained how Damone\u2019s toe injury did \u201cnot meet the criteria ... dealing with major dysfunction of a joint\u201d; how her disk disease did not satisfy the criteria to qualify as a \u201cdisorder[] of the spine\u201d; how her \u201cmental impairments, considered singly and in combination, [did] not meet or medically equal\u201d a listed impairment; and how her daily activities revealed that her impairments were not disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The administrative law judge was entitled to. discredit Damone\u2019s testimony about the limiting effects of her pain and her impairments. Damone testified that she could sit, stand, and walk between 15 and 30 minutes, she had to lay down for 2 to 3 hours between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., she could not perform a chore for more than 30 minutes, her medications caused her to be drowsy, she had poor balance that caused her to fall frequently, and she had difficulty concentrating for more than 30 minutes. Even though Damone\u2019s \u201cmedically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause [her] alleged symptoms,\u201d substantial evidence supported the finding of the administrative law judge that Damone\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of [her] symptoms\u201d and her \u201callegations of pain and functional restrictions [were] disproportionate to the objective medical evidence\u201d and to her \u201cdescription] ... [of] normal daily activities.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir. 2002). Medical notes from orthopedic physicians Dr. Gary Russell and Dr. John Featheringill reflected that Damone refused to stop smoking to allow her toe to heal. And Dr. Bowling\u2019s treatment notes reflected that Damone had \u201cgood tolerance of her usual medication\u201d and that, \u201cexcept for exacerbations, [her] pain [was] generally controlled with medications.\u201d Despite Damone\u2019s complaint of \u201cdisabling back pain,\u201d she told Dr. Bowling that she had helped move a tree off her parents\u2019 car. Damone also stated in a function report and during her testimony that she cleaned her house, washed dishes, made her bed, cooked and tended to her personal hygiene, swam, participated in arts and crafts, went shopping, cared for and walked her dog to her parents\u2019 home, worked in her parents\u2019 yard, drove a car, and managed her finances. Although Dr. Bowling increased the dosages of and changed Damone\u2019s medications, he did so usually to alleviate her self-inflicted injuries caused, for example, by moving heavy items or spraining her foot. The administrative law judge provided \u201cexplicit and adequate reasons\u201d to discredit Damone\u2019s testimony. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Bowling\u2019s opinion that Damone was totally disabled as of May 2011. As the administrative law judge stated, Dr. Bowling\u2019s opinion was \u201cinconsistent with other medical evidence, his own records, and particularly with the objective diagnostic imaging.\u201d <em>See Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583 (11th Cir. 1991). Dr. Bowling\u2019s opinion that Damone had debilitating pain from her lumber spine was inconsistent with magnetic resonance imaging tests in 2008 and 2009 that showed \u201cmild\u201d disc disease and bulges, with the doctor\u2019s sworn statement that Damone\u2019s pain was exceptional based on the test results, and with his treatment notes that Damone\u2019s back pain was controlled with medication. Dr. Bowling reported that Damone suffered from chronic pain in her right foot, but Dr. Featheringill reported in March 2011 that Damone\u2019s foot injury did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>affect her stance or stability. Dr. Bowling also recorded that Damone\u2019s foot pain was alleviated with medication and that her functioning had improved. Dr. Bowling\u2019s portrayal of Damone\u2019s fibromyalgia as incapacitating was inconsistent with his treatment notes that her condition was stable except for a brief period in early 2010 and with Dr. Jose Ruiz\u2019s report that Damone was malingering during a physical residual function assessment. And the medical records did not reflect that Da-mone\u2019s mental impairments were debilitating. Dr. Bowling recorded in his treatment notes that Damone\u2019s depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were controlled with medication. Dr. Michael Holt, the only physician to conduct a comprehensive mental evaluation, and Dr. Robert Estock, a psychiatrist who performed a mental residual functional capacity assessment, reported that Damone had a moderate limitation to understand, remember, and carry out instructions and to respond to supervision, coworkers, and pressure, and that she had a mild impairment in her ability to deal with interpersonal conflict and stress. The administrative law judge had good cause to discount Dr. Bowling\u2019s opinion that Damone was unable to work. <em>See Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">We AFFIRM the denial of Damone\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
