Soderstrom appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment in favor of J. Thompson Investments, LLC and Joan Thompson for $811,000 and the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding that the judgment is not dischargeable pursuant to the fraud exception, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). So-derstrom contends the bankruptcy court erred by finding justifiable reliance notwithstanding allegedly contradictory information, by finding causation despite insufficient evidence, and by making an erroneous finding of fact regarding whether Soderstrom actually made the allegedly fraudulent representation. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">As the bankruptcy court noted, the underlying fraud claim presents \u201ca true \u2018he-said-she-said\u2019 factual dispute.\u201d Thompson insists Soderstrom misrepresented that her investment was needed to complete construction and build-out of the office space. Soderstrom denies making this statement. After hearing live testimony from the parties and considering the parties\u2019 extensive evidentiary submissions the bankruptcy court found Thompson to be more credible than Soderstrom. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court found that So-derstrom in fact made the alleged misrepresentation. We defer to the bankruptcy court\u2019s credibility determination and find no clear error. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d); <em>In re T &amp; B Gen. Contracting, Inc., </em>833 F.2d 1455, 1458 (11th Cir. 1987) (\u201c[D]ue regard shall be given to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of witnesses.\u201d). The testimony of Scott Buono on which Soderstrom relies is equivocal and fails to directly coptradict Thompson\u2019s testimony. <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. Doc. 15-6 at 35 (\u201cQ. Do you know if Roger Soderstrom made any representations? A. Not <em>that I\u2019m aware of. </em>Not other than <em>I think </em>what\u2019s in\u2014in the operating agreement and the subscription agreement.\u201d (emphasis added)). Even if Buono\u2019s testimony contradicted Thompson\u2019s, because the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of fact remains a permissible view of the evidence, it would not be clear error. <em>See Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">We likewise find no error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that Thompson justifiably relied upon Soder-strom\u2019s misrepresentation. While the parties\u2019 subscription agreement and operating agreement together created a mechanism for Soderstrom to repay himself with invested funds, the bankruptcy court correctly observed that the parties\u2019 subscription agreement permitted repayment only to the extent the money was not needed for build-out. Because Soderstrom represented to Thompson that he needed to and would use the investment to pay for construction and build-out of the office space, the contract provisions did not contradict Soderstrom\u2019s misrepresentation. Although it would have been more prudent for Thompson to inquire further before making the investment, she was justified in relying upon Soderstrom\u2019s misrepresentation. <em>See In re Vann, </em>67 F.3d 277, 283 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cTo constitute justifiable reliance, the plaintiffs conduct must not be so utterly unreasonable, in the light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>information apparent to him, that the law may properly say that his loss is his own responsibility. This conclusion, however, does not mean that the reliance must be objectively reasonable.\u201d. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Finally, the bankruptcy court did not err in finding that Thompson\u2019s justifiable rebanee on Soderstrom\u2019s misrepresentation proximately caused her loss. The finding that Thompson lost $811,000 is not challenged on appeal. The only causation dispute is whether Thompson would not have made the investment but for Soder-strom\u2019s misrepresentation. Thompson testified that had she known build-out was nearly complete and Soderstrom intended to pay himself, she would have perceived the investment to be a sinking ship and would have not invested. The bankruptcy court did not clearly err in crediting this testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504. The fact that Soderstrom did not completely cash out of the business does not undermine the bankruptcy court\u2019s causation finding. Soderstrom invested approximately $1,050,000 between his two tiers of membership in the business and ultimately withdrew over $900,000, much of it from money that Thompson invested. Thompson\u2019s testimony does not suggest that she was any more likely to make the investment had Soderstrom told her he would use her investment to recoup most but not ab of his investment, and the bankruptcy court could properly consider So-derstrom\u2019s paying himself with Thompson\u2019s investment to be the .very thing she wished to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">. When reviewing a district court's affir-mance of a bankruptcy court order, we review for clear error the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact, and we review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions of both the bankruptcy court and the district court. <em>In re Fisher Island Invs., Inc., </em>778 F.3d 1172, 1189 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">. Soderstrom\u2019s contention that other testimony refutes causation lacks merit. The fact that Thompson conducted additional due diligence before investing and had other sources of information does not alter the causative effect Soderstrom\u2019s misrepresentation had on . Thompson\u2019s decision to invest. <em>See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 704, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004) (\u201c[A] given proximate cause need not be, and frequently is not, the exclusive proximate cause of harm.\u201d), The information to which Soder-strom refers would be probative of the justifiable reliance element bpt does not refute the bankruptcy court\u2019s causation finding, As discussed above, this information does not render Thompson's conduct \"so utterly unreasonable .., that the law may properly say that [her] loss is [her] own responsibility.\u201d <em>In re Vann, </em>67 F.3d at 283.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
