We review the denial of such motions under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard and will uphold the decision of the BIA unless it is capricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2005). Motions to reopen are disfavored, and we have held that the moving party \u201cbears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Escalante-Alvarez asserts that the BIA abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the removal proceedings on account of changed country conditions in Honduras. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). She argues that she presented evidence showing that violence against women in Honduras, particularly murder, has increased dramatically. However, the evidence presented reflects that violence against women has been, and remains, an ongoing problem in Honduras. In addition, Escalante-Alvarez failed to compare in any meaningful way the conditions in Honduras at the time of her 2002 removal hearing and her 2013 motion to reopen. Thus, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion because its decision was not capricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304. Finally, Escalante-Alvarez argues that the BIA erred by failing to consider her eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief; however, the BIA was not required to consider these other issues in light of its conclusion on her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
