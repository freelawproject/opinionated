Muhammad, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his complaint for failure to follow a court order and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Muhammad raised claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and various other federal and Alabama state statutes. On appeal, Muhammad argues that federal jurisdiction exists and that the district court was biased against him, which denied him a fair trial. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal of an. action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41. Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, 178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). A district court may sua sponte dismiss an action under Rule 41(b) for failure to comply with a court order. See Moon v. Newsome, 863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir. 1989). \u201c[Dismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. However/ a district court must grant a pro se plaintiff at least one opportunity to amend his complaint before dismissal if \u201cit appears a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Silva v. Bieluch, 351 F.3d 1045, 1048-49 (11th Cir. 2003). Additionally, where the statute of limitations will bar future litigation of an action dismissed without prejudice, we review the dismissal as if it was with prejudice. Gray v. Fid. Acceptance Corp., 634 F.2d 226, 227 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[F]ailure to comply with an order of the court is grounds for dismissal with prejudice.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 489, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1606, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">Although we give liberal construction to the pleadings of pro se litigants, \u201cwe nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). Rule 8 requires that a pleading contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Though there is no required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>technical form, \u201c[e]ach allegation must be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d Id. at 8(d)(1). The statement must \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quotation omitted) (ellipses in original). Additionally, each separate claim should be presented in a separate numbered paragraph, with each paragraph \u201climited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">A complaint that fails to follow Rules 8 and 10 may be classified as a shotgun pleading. A shotgun pleading \u201cincorporate[s] every antecedent allegation by reference into each subsequent claim for relief or affirmative defense.\u201d Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., 464 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir. 2006). As a result, it is \u201cvirtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\u201d Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., 77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir. 1996). The proper remedy for a shotgun pleading is for the court to order repleading for a more definite statement of the claim. Wagner, 464 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in its Rule 41 dismissal of Muhammad\u2019s complaint. Even construed liberally, Muhammad\u2019s complaint fails to meet the pleading standard set by Rule 8. It is a 31-page mixture of allegations and legalese with no substantial facts to establish grounds for his claims. Muhammad\u2019s complaint appears to concern a custody contract regarding his daughter between him and her mother, but Muhammad failed to plead any factual details about that agreement. Muhammad was ordered twice to amend his complaint. Both times, he was given detailed instructions that highlighted the ways in which his complaint was deficient. The magistrate judge also gave Muhammad a final chance to address the deficiencies in his complaint by issuing a show-cause order. Because Muhammad\u2019s complaint is a classic example of a shotgun pleading, the district court did not err in dismissing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">As Muhammad failed to plead detailed facts about the agreement in question, it is unclear if the district court\u2019s dismissal will bar future litigation due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. However, even if we needed to review this dismissal as a dismissal with prejudice, the district court did not abuse its discretion because \u201cfailure to comply with an order of the court is grounds for dismissal with prejudice.\u201d Slack, 529 U.S. at 489, 120 S.Ct. at 1606.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">We review de novo dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Nicholson v. Shafe, 558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir. 2009). The lack of jurisdiction may be raised by a federal court on its own initiative at any stage of litigation. Arbaugh v. Y&amp;H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 506, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1240, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). \u201c[A] federal district court must have at least one of three types of subject matter jurisdiction: (1) jurisdiction under a specific statutory grant; (2) federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; or (3) diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).\u201d Baltin v. Alaron Trading Corp., 128 F.3d 1466, 1469 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">For a federal court to have diversity jurisdiction, the action must be between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). To establish federal question jurisdiction, a \u201cplaintiffs well-pleaded complaint [must] raise[ ] issues of federal law.\u201d Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 1546, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \u201cA well-pleaded complaint presents a federal question where it establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiffs right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\u201d Smith v. GTE Corp., 236 F.3d 1292, 1310 (11th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The district court did not err by finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. On this record, it is clear that diversity jurisdiction is lacking because Muhammad and several of the defendants are citizens of the same state. Furthermore, due to the deficiencies in Muhammad\u2019s complaint, federal question jurisdiction is also lacking. Although Muhammad mentioned a number of federal-law claims, his complaint is not \u201cwell-pleaded\u201d because he failed to assert adequate facts on which to base his claims. See Metro. Life Ins. Co., 481 U.S. at 63, 107 S.Ct. at 1546. Muhammad failed to meet his burden of showing that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction, and therefore the district court correctly dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\">.
