He seeks to challenge the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in which he sought a sentence reduction pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines Amendments 782 and 788, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>which retroactively lowered certain offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Singleton\u2019s guidelines range was not based on the quantity of cocaine pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); his guidelines range was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. Accordingly, he was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, and the amendments do not apply to him. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 <em>&amp; </em>n.8 (5th Cir. 2009). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying him a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir. 2009). Finally, because there is no constitutional right to appointed counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir. 1995), Singleton cannot claim ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 752, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Because the appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous, Singleton\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n.24 (5th Cir. 1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
