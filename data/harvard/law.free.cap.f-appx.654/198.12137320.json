In his petition, Pettaway challenged the sentence imposed following his conviction of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. Robinson contends that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Section 2255 provides \u201cthe primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir. 2000). Section 2241, on the other hand, is generally used to challenge \u201cthe manner in which a sentence is executed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, under \u00a7 2555\u215b savings clause, a \u00a7 2241 petition that challenges a federal sentence may be entertained if the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the petitioner\u2019s detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>accord Robinson v. United States, </em>812 F.3d 476, 476-77 (5th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Pettaway bears the burden of showing that \u00a7 2555\u2019s remedy is inadequate or ineffective and thus that his claims fit within the savings clause. <em>Robinson, </em>812 F.3d at 477. To do so, Pettaway must show, among other things, that his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The district court found that Pettaway\u2019s claims did not fit within the savings clause because they challenged only the validity of his sentence. Pettaway invokes <em>Persaud v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1023, 188 L.Ed.2d 117 (2014) (mem.), contending that it announced a change in the law and sanctioned the use of \u00a7 2241 petitions to challenge an illegal sentence. However, <em>\u201cPersaud </em>was not a substantive decision,\u201d and it therefore does not support Pettaway\u2019s contention that his sentencing challenges are adequately brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Robinson v. United States, </em>812 F.3d 476, 477 (5th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Because Pettaway does not attack his conviction and his claims challenge only the validity of his sentence, Pettaway\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition does not fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) and the district court properly dismissed it. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Pettaway\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
