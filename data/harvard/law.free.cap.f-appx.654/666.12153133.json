In 2010, he pleaded guilty to: possession, with intent to distribute, 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A); possession, with intent to distribute, 500 grams or more of cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">Benjamin\u2019s pre-sentence investigation report (PSR) calculated his total-offense level at 29, and his criminal history category at V, which resulted in an advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 140 to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court adopted the PSR, and sentenced Benjamin to 170 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">In 2011, citing Guideline Amendment 760, Benjamin moved for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court: granted the motion; reduced Benjamin\u2019s total-offense level to 27, giving him a Guidelines range of 120 to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>and reduced his sentence to 158 months\u2019 imprisonment. Our court affirmed that above-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Benjamin, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 937, 938 (5th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In 2014, Benjamin filed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that forms the basis of this appeal, asserting he was entitled to another sentence reduction based on Amendment 782 (reducing base-offense levels provided for in Guidelines\u2019 drug-quantity table). As a result of that amendment, Benjamin\u2019s total-offense level was reduced to 25, and his amended Guidelines range was reduced 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. Nonetheless, the court denied his motion, stating Benjamin\u2019s current 158-month sentence was \u201cfair and reasonable under the circumstances\u201d and that he \u201creceived the prior benefit of a sentence reduction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In challenging that determination, Benjamin asserts: he was eligible for a sentence reduction; and, the court abused its discretion in denying, his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it clearly erred in its assessment of the evidence when weighing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. A decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Section 3582(c)(2) provides for reductions where a sentence was imposed \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered' by the Sentencing Commission\u201d. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Such reductions \u201care not mandatory; this section merely gives the district court discretion to reduce a sentence under limited circumstances\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The record shows the court gave due consideration to: Benjamin\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion; the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and his mitigating assertions, including his positive post-sentence rehabilitation efforts. As noted,' the court was under no obligation to grant a sentence reduction. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. Accordingly, Benjamin fails to show the requisite abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 672-73 &amp; n.11; <em>United States v. Whitebird, 55 </em>F.3d 1007, 1009-10 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. . R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
