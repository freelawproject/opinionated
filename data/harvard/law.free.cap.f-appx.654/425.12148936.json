After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Denis served as counsel in the district court for Robert Krupiczer in Krupiczer\u2019s suit against Appellee State Farm Life Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d). Krupic-zer alleged that State Farm unlawfully failed to pay proceeds from a life insurance policy on an individual named Zsolt Rado. State Farm answered that Krupiczer had not demonstrated that Rado was deceased, State Farm believed Rado to be alive, and Rado had made false representations about the source of his income on the life insurance policy application. State Farm also countersued to rescind the policy. Discovery began, and Krupiczer and Denis refused to cooperate in any of State Farm\u2019s discovery requests notwithstanding an order compelling responses to State Farm\u2019s interrogatories and requests for production. Krupiczer also failed to appear for his deposition despite State Farm\u2019s repeated attempts to contact him and Denis,</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">State Farm moved, pursuant to the district court\u2019s inherent authority and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, to strike Krupiczer\u2019s complaint and dismiss the case, for a default judgment, and for attorney\u2019s fees. State Farm\u2019s motion contained detailed allegations regarding Kru-piczer\u2019s and Denis\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s discovery schedule and order on the motion to compel, as well as their failure to respond to numerous telephone calls and emails inquiring whether Kru-piczer intended to pursue the action. State Farm detailed the ways in which it had expended attorney\u2019s fees and costs, including: research, issuing subpoenas and reviewing subpoenaed responses, taking depositions of Rado\u2019s prior counsel, identifying local counsel in Hungary to assist in investigation and discovery, and motions practice related to the discovery violations. State Farm specifically alleged that Krupiczer\u2019s actions were in bad faith and warranted severe sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Krupiczer and Denis failed to respond to State Farm\u2019s motion despite the district court ordering them to do so. The district court granted the motion for sanctions, striking Krupiczer\u2019s pleadings, dismissing his claim, awarding State Farm a default judgment on its counterclaim, and awarding State Farm \u201creasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure\u201d of Krupiczer and Denis to respond to discovery. Doc. 38 at 10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its order, the district court found that Krupiczer acted in bad faith, willfully noncomplying with discovery, State Farm was prejudiced, and lesser sanctions would not serve the goals of punishment and deterrence. The district court awarded State Farm attorney\u2019s fees and costs based on an affidavit State Farm\u2019s counsel submitted. Denis now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Denis argues that the district court abused its discretion by awarding the entire amount of State Farm\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs rather than only those costs caused by the noncompliance with discovery. He further complains that the district court failed to explain how it calculated the amount of the award. Under Rule 37, when a party fails to attend its own deposition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>serve answers to interrogatories, or respond to a request for inspection, \u201cthe court must require the party failing to act, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3). District courts also have inherent authority to impose sanctions upon a finding of bad faith. <em>Barnes v. Dalton, </em>158 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir. 1998). Ordinarily, we review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order on sanctions pursuant to Rule 37 or its inherent authority. <em>Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>446 F.3d 1137, 1146-47 (11th Cir. 2006) (Rule 37); <em>Barnes, </em>158 F.3d at 1214 (inherent authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Here, however, Denis failed to assert in the district court the objections he now raises. \u201cAppellate courts generally will not consider a legal issue that was not presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Slater v. Energy Servs. Grp., Int'l, </em>634 F.3d 1326, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011). We have recognized exceptions to this rule, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av1\">where (1) the issue involves a pure issue of law and refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice; (2) the appellant did not have the opportunity to raise the issue to the district court; (3) substantial justice is at stake; (4) the proper resolution is beyond any doubt; and (5) the issue presents significant questions of great public concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\"><em>Id. </em>None of these exceptions applies here. Because determining whether the district court was within its discretion to impose sanctions would involve an inquiry into whether its fact findings had sufficient support in the record, Denis\u2019s challenges cannot involve a pure issue of law, and the proper resolution necessarily is not beyond any doubt. <em>See id; Stewart v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>26 F.3d 115, 116 (11th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he resolution of factual questions can never be beyond doubt.\u201d). Moreover, Denis had ample opportunity to raise his challenges to the district court; indeed, he violated an order to do so. Finally, we do not believe Denis\u2019s complaints raise issues of substantial justice or significant questions of great public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">For these reasons, we decline to address Denis\u2019s arguments, all of which he failed to submit to the district court for its consideration in the first instance. We affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs,</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\">. \u201cDoc.\u201d refers to the docket entry in the district court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
