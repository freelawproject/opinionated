On appeal, Macias argues for the first time that the MDLEA, as applied to him, exceeded Congress\u2019s authority under the \u201cPiracies and Felonies Clause\u201d of the U.S. Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Defendant Macias, an Ecuadorean citizen, and two other individuals were on-board a vessel when they were interdicted by the U.S. Coast Guard \u201cin international waters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, approximately 206 nautical miles northeast of the Galapagos Islands.\u201d After the Coast Guard boarded the vessel, none of the crew claimed a nationality for the vessel. Upon inspection of the vessel, the Coast Guard found approximately 300 kilograms of cocaine. After Macias pled guilty, the district court imposed concurrent 120-month sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The Piracies and Felonies Clause grants Congress the power \u201c[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl.10. As interpreted by the U.S. Supreme\u2019 Court, the Piracies and Felonies Clause contains \u201cthree distinct grants of power:\u201d (1) \u201cthe power to define and punish piracies\u201d (the Piracies Clause); (2) \u201cthe power to define and punish felonies committed on the high seas\u201d (the Felonies Clause); and (3) \u201cthe power to define and punish offenses against the law of nations,\u201d (the Offences Clause). United States v. Bellaizac-Hurtado, 700 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir. 2012). Macias\u2019s case involves the exercise of the grant of power under the Felonies Clause. The Felonies Clause is \u201ctextually limited to conduct on the high seas.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The MDLEA provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]n individual may not knowingly or intentionally ... manufacture or distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance\u201d while onboard \u201ca. vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70503(a)(1), (e)(1). A \u201cvessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d includes <em>\u201ca </em>vessel without nationality.\u201d Id. \u00a7 70502(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">By enacting the MDLEA, Congress specifically sought \u201cto punish drug trafficking on the high seas, because drug trafficking aboard vessels (1) is a serious international problem and is universally condemned, and (2) presents a specific threat to the security and societal well-being of the United States.\u201d United States v. Estupinan, 453 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). To that end, the MDLEA broadly prohibits drug trafficking on any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States even if \u201cthe act is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70503(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">This Court has already twice rejected the argument that Congress exceeded its authority under the Felonies Clause in enacting the MDLEA. See United States v. Campbell, 743 F.3d 802, 809-10 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 704, 190 L.Ed.2d 438 (2014); Estupinan, 453 F.3d at 1338-39. Moreover, \u201cwe have always upheld extraterritorial convictions under our drug trafficking laws as an exercise of power under the Felonies Clause.\u201d Bellaizac-Hurtado, 700 F.3d at 1257; see also United States v. Marino-Garcia, 679 F.2d 1373, 1383 (11th Cir. 1982) (\u201cHaving determined that international law in no way restricts the right of the United States to assert jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas, we hold that Section 955a [the predecessor to the MDLEA] properly extends the criminal jurisdiction of this country to any stateless vessel in international waters engaged in the distribution of controlled substances\u201d). As we explained in Campbell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">The Felonies Clause empowers Congress to punish crimes committed on the high seas. And inasmuch as the trafficking of narcotics is condemned universally by law-abiding nations, we see no reason to conclude that it is fundamentally unfair for Congress to provide for the punishment of persons apprehended with narcotics on the high seas. Congress may assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over vessels in the high seas that are engaged in conduct that has a potentially adverse effect and is generally recognized as a crime by nations that have reasonably developed legal systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">743 F.3d at 810 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Based on this Court\u2019s well-settled precedent, there is no merit to Macias\u2019s argument that the MDLEA as applied to his drug trafficking in international waters exceeds Congress\u2019s power under the Felonies Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Citing this Court\u2019s decision in Bellaizac-Hurtado, Macias contends that under the Felonies Clause, Congress can proscribe conduct on the high seas only if that conduct is recognized as a felony under customary international law, and that his conduct, drug trafficking, does not violate customary international law. Macias\u2019s reliance on Bellaizac-Hurtado is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">Bellaizac-Hurtado addressed Congress\u2019s authority under the Offences Clause to proscribe drug trafficking committed in another country\u2019s waters, not Congress\u2019s power under the Felonies Clause to proscribe drug trafficking crimes committed in international waters. See Bellaizac-Hurtado, 700 F.3d at 1248-49. Specifically, Bellaizac-Hurtado concluded that the MDLEA was unconstitutional under the Offences Clause as applied to defendants who had committed their drug trafficking offense within the territorial waters of Panama. Id. at 1247, 1258. This Court explained that Congress\u2019s power under the Offences Clause to define offenses against the law of nations is limited to proscribing violations of \u201ccustomary international law,\u201d and that drug trafficking, like most private criminal activity, is not a violation of customary international law. Id. at 1249-58.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Bellaizac-Hurtado reconfirmed, however, that \u201cCongress possesses additional constitutional authority to restrict conduct on the high seas,\u201d through both the Piracies Clause and the Felonies Clause, and that this Court has \u201calways upheld extraterritorial convictions under our drug trafficking laws as an exercise of power under the Felonies Clause.\u201d Id. at 1257 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Macias contends that under BellaizacHurtado's reasoning, the.term \u201cdefine\u201d in the Piracies and Felonies Clause limits Congress\u2019s authority under all three clauses to violations of customary international law. Thus, a court has jurisdiction over felonies committed onboard a stateless vessel on the high seas only if Congress has the power to \u201cdefine\u201d that crime as a felony under customary international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Macias misreads Bellaizac-Hurtado. The Court in Bellaizac-Hurtado reasoned that it was the terms that follow \u201cdefine\u201d (i.e., \u201cPiracies,\u201d \u201cFelonies committed on the high Seas,\u201d and \u201cagainst the Laws of Nations\u201d) that narrow Congress\u2019s authority. See id. at 1249. And, unlike the Offences Clause, the Felonies Clause is not narrowed by the language \u201cagainst the Laws of Nations.\u201d See U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 10. Bellaizac-Hurtado\u2019s discussion of the meaning of the word \u201cdefine\u201d as it pertains to the Offences Clause does not support Macias\u2019s argument as to the Felonies Clause. Furthermore, the interpretation of the Felonies Clause Macias urges upon us conflicts with this Court\u2019s long-standing precedent that \u201cthe assertion of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas in no way transgresses recognized principles of international law.\u201d See Marino-Garcia, 679 F.2d at 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Macias does not dispute that he committed his drug trafficking offenses in international waters. Therefore, Bellaizac-Hurtado does not apply, and Macias\u2019s prosecution under the MDLEA for drug trafficking crimes committed onboard a stateless vessel in international waters is a constitutional exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction under the Felonies Clause. See U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 10; Campbell, 743 F.3d at 809-10; Estupinan, 453 F.3d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">For these reasons, we affirm Macias\u2019s drug trafficking convictions under the MDLEA and 120-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\">. The parties dispute whether Macias's newly raised constitutional argument is subject to plain error review or is a jurisdictional challenge subject to de novo review. We need not resolve this question as Macias fails to show any error at all, and thus his argument fails under either standard of review. See United States v. Estupinan, 453 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir. 2006) (declining to resolve which standard of review applies to a previously unraised challenge that Congress exceeded its authority under the Piracies and Felonies Clause because the defendant\u2019s claim failed under \"the more exacting standard of de novo review\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-14\">. Macias does not appeal his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\">. '-\u2018Customary international law\u201d is a term of art that refers to \"a general and consistent practice of states\u201d that is followed out of \"a sense of legal obligation\u201d pertaining to \"a matter of mutual legal concern.\u201d See Bellaizac-Hurtado, 700 F.3d at 1252. The fact that states universally proscribe certain conduct in their domestic laws \"is not necessarily significant or relevant for purposes of customary international law.\u201d Id. The subset of offenses which violate customary international law that can be committed by a private individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and punished criminally is very small. Id. at 1254. Such offenses include counterfeiting foreign currency, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and violations of safe conducts or ambassadorial rights, but exclude most ma-lum in se crimes, even those universally condemned, such as rape and murder. Id. at 1254, 1256-57.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
