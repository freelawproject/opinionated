He completed his sentence and now has filed a civil rights\" complaint, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and monetary damages, alleging that the defendants violated his constitutional rights, in part, by failing to disclose a statement from the victim in his aggravated oral sexual battery conviction. The district court dismissed Lavergne\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, determining, in part, that the claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">A district court is required to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) <em>&amp; </em>(ii). We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lavergne\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A and \u00a7 1915(e). <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Lavergne renews his claims against the defendants and contends that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint. Contrary to Lavergne\u2019s assertions, he has not overcome the <em>Heck </em>bar. <em>See Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir. 1992). Lavergne\u2019s claims arise out of the aggravated oral sexual battery prosecution, and they reflect his view that his prosecution and guilty plea for aggravated oral sexual battery was tainted by the defendants\u2019 actions. If the district court were to award Lavergne relief as to any of these claims, it would implicitly call into question the validity of his 2000 conviction for aggravated oral sexual battery. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Additionally, <em>Heck </em>is applicable even though Lavergne has served the entirety of his aggravated oral sexual battery sentence. <em>See Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, Lav-ergne has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Lavergne\u2019s appeal lacks an arguable basis in law or fact, and, thus, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Lavergne\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental brief in which he attempts to submit new evidence and raise new issues is DENIED. <em>See Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 &amp; n.26 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Section 1915(g) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxYH\">[i]n no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding ... if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dis-miss\u00e9d on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Lavergne\u2019s complaint counts as one strike, and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as an additional strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Lavergne previously filed \u00a7 1983 complaints that the district court dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, which counted as strikes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>He now has accumulated at least three strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g) and is prohibited from proceeding in forma pau-peris in any civil action or appeal that is filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Additionally, we WARN Lav-ergne that future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Coghlan v. </em>Starkey, 852 F.2d 806, 817 n.21 (5th Cir. 1988). Lavergne is advised to review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION DENIED; 28 U.S.C; \u00a7 1915(e) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
