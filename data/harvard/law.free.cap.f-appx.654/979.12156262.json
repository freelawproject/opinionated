The district court held that Plaintiffs were barred from recovery because there was no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the provisions of the Policy before filing suit. Specifically, the district court held that Plaintiffs were not entitled to recover because they failed to cooperate with the insurer in the investigation and resolution of the claim as required by th\u00e9 Policy because Plaintiffs failed to produce certain federal income tax returns requested by the Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">On appeal, Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the Policy authorizes the Insurance Company to request, and requires the insureds to provide, \u201crecords and documents we request and permit us to make copies,\u201d and that compliance with such was a precondition to suit. Plaintiffs also do not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that they failed to fully comply with the Insurance Company\u2019s request to produce \u201cincome tax returns dating back to 2009, including all worksheets and schedules.\u201d Instead, Plaintiffs argue that it was error for the district court to grant summary judgment because there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether they acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d in producing tax returns in their possession and authorizing the Insurance Company to obtain the tax returns directly from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and whether the insurance company failed to act with \u201cdiligence and good faith\u201d in procuring the requested documents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits submitted by the parties show no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Under Georgia law, an insurer may require its insured to abide by the terms of his policy and cooperate with the insurer\u2019s investigation as a precondition to recovery. Diamonds &amp; Denims, Inc. v. First of Ga. Ins. Co., 203 Ga.App. 681, 417 S.E.2d 440, 441-42 (1992). Where the insured is required to produce documents and those documents are unavailable, the insured has a duty to \u201ccooperate with the insurer to obtain or reconstruct the information needed from other available sources.\u201d Id. at 442. The Georgia Supreme Court has held that an insured\u2019s failure \u201cto provide <em>any </em>material information called for under ... the policy\u201d constitutes a breach of contract. Halcome v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 254 Ga. 742, 334 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1985) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Plaintiffs rely on the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in Diamonds &amp; Denims for the proposition that where an insured \u201ccooperates to some degree or provides an explanation for its noncompliance\u201d or where \u201cthe insure[r] fail[s] to act with diligence and good faith in securing the necessary information,\u201d summary judgment in favor of the insurer is inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>ate. 417 S.E.2d at 442. In that case, the plaintiff, a silk plant and flower supply company, made a claim under its commercial property and liability insurance policy after its warehouse was destroyed by fire. The insurance company made broad general requests for \u201cbooks and records\u201d per the policy requirement but did not specify any particular documents to be produced. Id. The insured explained that all of its documents were destroyed in the fire but during the course of depositions offered to provide alternative documentation. The insurance company, however, made no attempt to follow up on this offer and procure those documents, and \u201cno evidence showed that the insurer followed up these generalized statements with specific requests, sought releases from appellant in order to obtain records from other sources, or otherwise pursued the matter further.\u201d Id. In light of the evidence of the insured\u2019s good faith, the Georgia Court of Appeals held that summary judgment in favor of the insurer was inappropriate because \u201cquestions of fact remain concerning appellant\u2019s compliance with the policy prerequisites and appellee\u2019s diligence in obtaining the needed information.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The Insurance Company responds that the facts in the instant case are much closer to Allstate Insurance Company v. Hamler, 247 Ga.App. 574, 545 S.E.2d 12 (2001). Hamler was a breach of contract action brought by an insured homeowner against her insurer for property that was allegedly stolen from the insured\u2019s home. In that case, the insured provided certain documents to the insurer but failed or refused to provide specific other documents requested by the insurance company, including federal income tax returns, during the insurance company\u2019s investigation of her claim. The insured then sued for breach of contract. The Georgia Court of Appeals rejected the insured\u2019s proffered defense based on Diamonds &amp; Denims that \u201cbecause she provided some documentation requested by Allstate, a fact question exists as to whether she complied with the policy terms.\u201d Id. at 15. Instead, the court held that the insurance company was entitled to summary judgment because the insured \u201crefused to provide information ... despite a lengthy and detailed request by Allstate.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">We agree with the Insurance Company. This case is readily distinguishable from Diamonds <em>&amp; </em>Denims and much closer to Hamler. As in Hamler and unlike in Diamonds <em>&amp; </em>Denims, the Insurance Company in the instant case requested specific documents: all income tax returns dating back to 2009, including all worksheets and schedules. The insureds failed to provide all of the requested documents, explaining that their tax information had been stolen by a former accountant. Instead, in early March 2014, the insured provided the Insurance Company with a written authorization to retrieve the tax returns directly from the IRS. The Insurance Company attempted to retrieve the records from the IRS, but the documents were apparently mailed to the Plaintiffs. As in Ham-ler, and unlike in Diamonds &amp; Denims, the Insurance Company then diligently pursued the matter and the insureds failed to cooperate. On May 19, 2014, the Insurance Company sent a follow-up letter to Plaintiffs, explaining that the IRS had sent the documents directly to the Plaintiffs and requesting Plaintiffs to forward the documents to the Insurance Company. Plaintiffs failed to respond. On June .22, 2014, the Insurance Company sent a second follow-up letter requesting Plaintiffs to forward the requested documents to the Insurance Company. Plaintiffs again failed to respond. Plaintiffs offer no excuse or explanation for this failure to respond to the Insurance Company\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>quests. Plaintiffs subsequently filed suit on June 30, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">We agree'with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiffs breached the contract of insurance. Therefore, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">. Plaintiffs also argue for the first time on appeal that the requested documents were not '\u2018material\u201d to their claim. Because Plaintiffs did not raise this issue before the district court, it is abandoned. See Access Now, Inc. v. S.W. Airlines Co., 385 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir. 2004) (\"This Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this Court,\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
