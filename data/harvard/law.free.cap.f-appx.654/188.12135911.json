He argues that the district court erred in refusing to grant a mitigating role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and examines its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir. 2006). In deciding whether an adjustment under the Guidelines should apply, a district court may draw reasonable inferences from the facts, and these inferences are findings of fact that are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Harris argues that the district court erred in denying him a mitigating role reduction given the amended Guideline commentary for \u00a7 3B1.2. While the 2015 amendments gave additional guidance to district courts in applying the mitigating role adjustment, they did not, as the Government points out, change the overarching consideration when determining whether to apply \u00a7 3B1.2, that is, whether the defendant is \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average defendant?\u201d <em>See </em>3B1.2, comment. (n.3A).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">Here, the district court correctly assessed Harris\u2019s role in the offense. The district court observed that \u201cin many respects that [Harris] operated his own network for the\u2014whatever, period of time he got back into the drug business.... \u201d Harris had multiple ties to the organization as evidenced by his numerous sources of supply; he obtained methamphetamine from at least seven of his coconspirators. The court also noted that Harris \u201cserved as protection\u201d for one of his coconspirators during drug sales. Although Harris dealt in smaller quantities of methamphetamine than most of his coconspirators and was not a supplier himself, he was held responsible for the distribution of over four kilograms of the drug in less than eight months and was correctly classified as playing an average role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">Based on the foregoing facts, the district court\u2019s determination that Harris was not entitled to a \u00a7 3B1.2(b) reduction was plausible in light of the record and was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
