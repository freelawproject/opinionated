She seeks to challenge the denial of her 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in which she sought a sentence reduction pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines Amendments 782 and 788, which retroactively lowered certain offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-23\">The quantity of methamphetamine that Becerra was held responsible for triggers the same base offense level under both the version of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) in effect when she was sentenced and the retroactive, amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ed version. Accordingly, Amendments 782 and 788 did no.t change her offense level or lower-her guidelines range, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying her a sentence reduction under \u00a7 8582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir. 2009). She may not, as she attempts to do, use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to challenge the correctness of her original sentence. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Because the appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous, Becerra\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and her appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n.24 (5th Cir. 1997); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983); 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
