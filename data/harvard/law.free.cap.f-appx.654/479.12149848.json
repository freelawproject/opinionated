Everidge appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his various state law claims against Wells Fargo and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). Everidge brought a diversity action in district court against Wells Fargo and Fannie Mae, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of contract, wrongful foreclosure, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court granted summary judgment to Wells Fargo' on all of Everidge\u2019s claims against it. Moreover, after denying Everidge\u2019s requests to amend his complaint to include additional allegations against Fannie Mae, the court dismissed on the pleadings Everidge\u2019s claims against Fannie Mae.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">On appeal, Everidge argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims that Wells Fargo (1) made fraudulent representations to him about insurance proceeds and a loan modification contract; (2) breached a loan modification contract; (3) violated the terms of his security deed; (4) wrongfully foreclosed his property; (5) failed to exercise good faith and fair dealing in carrying out its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>contractual obligations as the servicer of his' mortgage loan; and (6) intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him. Ever-idge also claims that the district court erred by denying his requests to amend his complaint to include additional allegations against Fannie Mae.</p>\n<p id=\"AS7\">After careful consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error as to any of the issues raised by Everidge. For substantially the same reasons given by the thorough opinion of the district court, we conclude that the court properly dismissed all of Everidge\u2019s claims and appropriately denied his requests to amend his complaint. <em>See Everidge v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>No. 12-00497, 2015 WL 5786738 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 29, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
