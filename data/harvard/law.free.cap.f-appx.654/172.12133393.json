His petition alleges that his mandatory life sentence was unconstitutional because his prior convictions did not qualify as felony drug offenses for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-19\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge his conviction or sentences must file a \u00a7 2255 motion in the sentencing court. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir. 2005). A petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to \u00a7 2241 is generally reserved for challenges to the manner in which the sentence is being executed. There is an exception, however, pursuant to the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. That clause allows a federal prisoner to attack the legality of his conviction or sentence via \u00a7 2241 when relief under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001). We have held that the \u00a7 2255 procedure is inadequate when a claim (i) is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the defendant may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in his trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Reyes, </em>243 F.3d at 904. We have consistently held that challenges to the validity of a sentencing enhancement, which is the argument Abdul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Ali raises, do not satisfy the savings clause. <em>See, e.g., In re Bradford, </em>660 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir. 2011) (holding that the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was actually innocent of the career offender enhancement was not a claim that he was actually innocent of the offense of conviction); <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27 (holding that the petitioner\u2019s claim that his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum did not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test because he failed to show that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense); <em>Preston v. Ask-Carlson, </em>583 Fed.Appx. 462, 463 (5th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[C]laims relating to sentencing determinations do not fall within the savings clause and are not cognizable under \u00a7 2241, even where the petitioner asserts a \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 or actual innocence relating to the alleged sentencing errors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Relying on the Solicitor General\u2019s concession in <em>Persaud v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1023, 188 L.Ed.2d 117 (2014), Abdul Ali argues that the savings clause should extend to a previously foreclosed argument that the prisoner was actually innocent of a mandatory life sentence. But the Department of Justice\u2019s litigation cannot override our precedent holding that sentencing issues do not invoke the savings clause. And the Supreme Court did not issue a substantive ruling in <em>Persaud-, </em>it only granted the petition, vacated the judgment below, and then remanded to the Fourth Circuit for reconsideration in light of the Solicitor General\u2019s position. 134 S.Ct. at 1023. Under our precedent, Abdul Ali has failed to demonstrate that his claim fell within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5:4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
