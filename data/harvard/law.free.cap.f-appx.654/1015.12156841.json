As the sole issue on appeal, Grantham argues that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred by assigning little weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">We normally review the Commissioner\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir. 2011). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. We may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">The ALJ must give a treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201csubstantial or considerable weight\u201d unless there is \u201cgood cause\u201d not to do so. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2). \u201c\u2018[G]ood cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was eonclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. If the ALJ articulates specific, legitimate reasons for assigning limited weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion that demonstrates good cause, then we must conclude such determination is supported by substantial evidence and there is no reversible error. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam); <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240. The ALJ also must consider the amount of knowledge a treating source has about a patient\u2019s impairments and the treatment the physician has provided. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">The ALJ did not err by assigning little weight to Dr. Sarazin, Grantham\u2019s psychiatrist at Lakeview Center, Inc. (Lakeview), because the ALJ clearly articulated reasons that established good cause to give his opinion less weight. Grantham received mental health treatment at Lakeview beginning in February 2012, and continued for approximately one year. Erik Ster-nung, a registered nurse practitioner working under Dr. Sarazin\u2019s supervision, actually saw and examined Grantham. Dr. Sarazin met with Grantham once, the week before being deposed, \u201cto get a better idea into his problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">The ALJ noted that Dr. Sarazin\u2019s conclusions were inconsistent with other parts of the record, including treatment notes from Dr. Sarazin\u2019s facility and Grantham\u2019s own testimony. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. For example, Dr. Sarazin characterized Grantham as \u201chav[ing] marked and extreme difficulties\u201d in dealing with the public and others because \u201che easily get [sic] frustrated around people, feeling that they are about to get him or harm him,\u201d while Grantham himself testified that he regularly attended Church services, Sun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>day school, Bible study, and shopping trips with no severe impact on social functioning due to his depression. <em>See id. </em>at 1241 <em>&amp; </em>n.9 (concluding substantial evidence supported ALJ\u2019s decision to give limited weight to treating physician\u2019s opinion when it was \u201ccontrary to [claimant]\u2019s admissions concerning her activities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Additionally, Dr. Sarazin\u2019s opinion is at odds with his own facility\u2019s treatment record. Dr. Sarazin opined that Grantham exhibits debilitating paranoia and loss of focus. But Grantham\u2019s treatment at Lake-view was limited, and Sternung never prescribed counseling, therapy, or any specific treatment for chronic anxiety, paranoia, or post-traumatic stress. <em>See Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>987 F.2d 580, 584 (11th Cir. 1991) (good cause existed to disregard treating physician\u2019s opinion when record lacked objective medical evidence to support that opinion). In fact, Stemung\u2019s notes indicate successful treatment of Grantham\u2019s mental health complaints through medication. Therefore, Dr. Sarazin\u2019s opinion proves inconsistent with Lakeview\u2019s record, supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding of good cause to limit its weight. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-18\">The ALJ has articulated sufficient \u201crelevant evidence [that] a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d that Dr. Sarazin\u2019s opinion was entitled to little weight.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income is</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">. Grantham also attempts to appeal the Magistrate Judge\u2019s decision issued pursuant to consent jurisdiction\u2014however, our review is limited to the agency decision. <em>See Shinn ex rel. Shinn v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>391 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir. 2004) (\"We consider this appeal essentially as if we were the district court, reviewing the AU\u2019s ruling rather than the district court judgment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1043-21\">. Even if the ALJ incorrectly stated certain facts regarding Grantham\u2019s psychiatric hospitalization history and seizure disorder in support of his conclusion, he provided other factors that indicate there was more than a scintilla of relevant evidence in support of the conclusion that Dr. Sarazin's opinion was entitled to little weight. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted) (\"Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
