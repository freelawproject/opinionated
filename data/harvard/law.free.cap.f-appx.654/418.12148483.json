She was sentenced to 30 months in prison plus three years of supervised release. Sassau filed a timely notice of appeal through her lawyer Sharon K. Wilson on June 11, 2015. On September 18, 2015, Wilson filed a motion to withdraw from the appeal. The motion included a brief based on Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), explaining that Wilson had examined the record in Sassau\u2019s case and concluded that an appeal would be wholly frivolous. In particular, the brief analyzed five potential issues that could have been raised on appeal and concluded that none had any merit. This Court\u2019s Acting Clerk of Court then informed Sassau of her right to respond to Wilson\u2019s motion. Sassau responded by filing a pro se brief raising issues related to the calculation of her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Our independent review of the entire record reveals that Wilson\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. This includes both the issues identified in Wilson\u2019s brief and other issues that are apparent from Sassau\u2019s pro se brief and the record in her case. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Sassau\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
