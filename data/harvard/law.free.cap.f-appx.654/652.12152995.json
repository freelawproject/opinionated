He argues that the district court erred in assessing a base offense level of 24 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2,l(a)(2), because his prior Texas convictions for burglary of a habitation and attempted burglary of a habitation were not crimes of violence. Strecker argues that the state court records do not indicate whether he was convicted under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02 (a)(1) or Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) for his burglary of a habitation and his attempted burglary convictions. Because \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) does not constitute generic burglary, he asserts that the statute can be violated by means beyond the generic, contemporary meaning of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Strecker raises the same arguments now as he raised in the district court. Therefore, this court reviews the district court\u2019s determination that attempted burglary and burglary were crimes of violence de novo. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The documentation submitted to the sentencing court established that Strecker was convicted under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) for both convictions. A conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) qualifies as a generic burglary offense. <em>See United States v. Castaneda, </em>740 F.3d 169, 173 (5th Cir. 2013). Moreover, Strecker\u2019s attempt argument is without merit because the commentary to the Guidelines specifically states that a crime of violence includes attempting to commit a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l). Accordingly, the district court did not err in assessing a base offense level of 24 based on these convictions. <em>See id.; Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">Strecker also argues that the district court erred in assigning criminal history points to his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation because that conviction was relevant conduct to his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Because Strecker did not raise this argument in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d at 497. The district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in assigning criminal history points to the burglary of a habitation conviction because even though there were no intervening arrests, the sentences for his burglary of a habitation conviction and his felon in possession of a firearm conviction did not result from the same charging instrument and the sentences were not imposed on the same day. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
