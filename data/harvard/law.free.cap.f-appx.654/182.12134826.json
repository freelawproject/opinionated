He does not renew his contention concerning withholding of removal or CAT protection; therefore, those two claims are abandoned. <em>See, e.g., Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">Because the BIA based its decision in part on the IJ\u2019s reasoning, our court may review the findings of both the BIA and IJ for substantial evidence. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). In that regard, Singh must demonstrate the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by the BIA and IJ. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">An IJ\u2019s credibility determination is reviewed under a highly deferential standard, and must be upheld \u201cunless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 538. (quoting <em>Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008)). The IJ \u201cmay rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-24\">Here, Singh based his application for asylum on harm suffered due to his involvement with the Shiromani Akali Dal political party. The IJ found Singh was not credible because, <em>inter alia: </em>he exaggerated his position in the party; was vague about the injuries he suffered; and was not forthcoming about the details of his escape to the United States. The BIA agreed, concluding the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding was supported by the record, and not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AHb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Singh has not shown the evidence compels a contrary conclusion regarding his credibility. He essentially contends inconsistencies in his testimony were minor and sufficiently corroborated by \u2022 other evidence, and the IJ and BIA did not give appropriate consideration to the evidence presented. Given our highly deferential standard of review, and because the credibility finding was \u201csupported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record\u201d, Singh has not met his burden of proof. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"A1i\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
