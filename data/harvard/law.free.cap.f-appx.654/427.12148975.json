He argues that the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony. He also contends that the district court erred by indicating in the Statement of Reasons that the sentence was not greater than 24 months and the district court was not required to give specific reasons for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1278 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Evaluating whether a firearm was used \u201cin connection with\u201d a felony offense is a factual determination and we evaluate for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 &amp; n.8 (11th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">In calculating .the guideline range for a firearm possession offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) provides for a four-level enhancement where the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). Section 2K2.1 Application Note 14 states that subsection (b)(6)(B) applies \u201cif the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 comment. (n.l4(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">We have held that the term \u201cin connection with\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) should be given its ordinary and natural meaning, and we have expressly rejected a more restrictive interpretation that required the firearm to serve a purpose related to the crime. <em>Smith, </em>480 F.3d at 1280 (citation omitted). Moreover, in interpreting Guideline provisions that contain an \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement identical to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2,1(b)(5), we have held that, \u201cin certain circumstances, mere possession of a firearm can be enough to apply a sentencing enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). Generally, we have held that drugs and guns go together. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1242 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">The district court did not clearly err by applying a four-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), because Johnson had possession of the firearm and a felonious amount of marijuana at the same time in his car. Mere possession of a firearm can be enough to apply a sentencing enhancement because drugs and guns generally go together, and the firearm was not required to serve a purpose related to the crime. Therefore, we affirm the application of the four-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">We review the question of whether a district court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) <em>de novo, </em>even if the defendant did not object below. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), the sentencing court must explain its reasons for imposing a sentence at a particular point in the guideline range \u201cwhen the range exceeds 24 months.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1); <em>United States v. Veteto, </em>920 F.2d 823, 826 (11th Cir. 1991). A sentence may be imposed at any point within the applicable guideline range, provided that it is not greater than the statutorily authorized maximum sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c). When the statutory authorized maximum sentence is less than the maximum of the guideline range, the guideline range becomes the statutory maximum and the low end of the guideline range. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The district court did not err by indicating in the Statement of Reasons that the sentencing range was not greater than 24 months. Because of the statutory authorized maximum sentence of 120 months, Johnson\u2019s range was no longer 120 months to 150 months but merely 120 months. Thus, there was a range of zero. Therefore, the district court did not err by indicating that the sentence was within an advisory range that was not greater than 24 months, and thus was not required to give specific reasons for the sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
