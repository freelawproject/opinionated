No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">On appeal, Stevens first argues that his guilty plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily. Because Stevens failed to object to the adequacy of his plea proceedings in the district court, we review this argument only for plain error. See United States v. Mosley, 173 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">In determining whether a plea was knowing and voluntary, the district court must address three core concerns underlying Fed. R. Crim. P. 11: (1) whether the plea was free from coercion; (2) whether defendant understood the nature of the charges; and (3) whether defendant understood the consequences of his guilty plea. United States v. Hernandez-Fraire, 208 F.3d 945, 949 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">The district court committed no plain error in determining that Stevens\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. First, nothing evidences that Stevens was coerced into pleading guilty. Although Stevens\u2019s trial lawyer advised Stevens strongly to plead guilty, Stevens\u2019s lawyer stressed repeatedly that the final decision about whether to plead guilty or to proceed to trial was up to Stevens. \u201cA defendant cannot complain of coercion where his attorney, employing his best professional judgment, recommends that the defendant plead guilty.\u201d United States v. Buckles, 843 F.2d 469, 472 (11th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">We also reject Stevens\u2019s contention that he was coerced by the government. Although the prosecutor told Stevens at the plea hearing that the government\u2019s plea offer (in which the government agreed to dismiss two of the three counts against Stevens and to withdraw the section 851 enhancement) would expire at the end of the day, that notice amounted to no coercion. Stevens still had ample time to consider his options and to discuss his plea with his lawyer. The deadline imposed only the common pressure faced by all defendants who consider pleading guilty. See id. (\u201cAll pleas of guilty are the result of some pressures or influences on the mind of the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-16\">Moreover, at the plea hearing, the district court expressly told Stevens that the decision whether to plead guilty was up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>him and gave Stevens several opportunities to discuss the decision with his lawyer. Then, Stevens declared that he had not been coerced into pleading guilty; and a strong presumption exists that statements made during the plea colloquy are true. See United States v. Medlock, 12 F.3d 185, 187 (11th Cir. 1994). That Stevens struggled with the difficult decision about whether to plead guilty is no evidence that his plea was coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The record also demonstrates that Stevens understood the charges against him. Given the district court\u2019s statement of the charge, the \u201csimple\u201d nature of the charge, and Stevens\u2019s stipulation to the facts supporting the charge\u2014in addition to Stevens\u2019s statement that he understood the charge against him\u2014the district court committed no plain error in determining that Stevens in fact understood the nature of the charge. See United States v. Puentes-Hurtado, 794 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 2015) (the sentencing court\u2019s short statement of the charge was sufficient when defendant was charged with a \u201csimple\u201d offense: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">About Rule ll\u2019s third \u201ccore concern\u201d, the district court informed Stevens of his right to plead not guilty, his right to assistance of counsel at trial, his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses at trial, and his right against self-incrimination. See Hernandez-Fraire, 208 F.3d at 950-51. The government also explained the terms of the plea agreement, including the possible penalties Stevens would face if he pleaded guilty compared to the possible penalties he could face if he proceeded to trial and was found guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Stevens was informed of the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and of the possible sentences he could receive under the plea agreement, the district court found properly that Stevens understood the consequences of pleading guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Stevens next challenges the district court\u2019s determination that Stevens\u2019s 2003 Georgia felony conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana qualified as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of applying the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Because Stevens raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. See United States v. Bonilla, 579 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">The Guidelines define a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits ... the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl,2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">Georgia law makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to possess, have under his or her control, manufacture, deliver, distribute, dispense, administer, purchase, sell, or possess with intent to distribute marijuana.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16\u201413\u201430(j)(l). A person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>who violates section 16-13-30(j)(l) is guilty of a felony and \u201cshall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years.\u201d Id. \u00a7 16\u201413\u2014 30(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Because section 16\u201413\u201430(j')(l) lists dis-junctively \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cpossession with intent to distribute\u201d\u2014thereby creating separate offenses\u2014the statute is divisible. See Descamps v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013) (a statute is \u201cdivisible\u201d when it \u201csets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative\u201d); see also Vines v. State, 296 Ga.App. 543, 675 S.E.2d 260, 264-65 (2009) (finding evidence sufficient to support conviction for possession of marijuana under O.C.G.A, \u00a7 16-13-30(j)(l), but vacating a conviction for possession with intent to distribute where insufficient evidence existed of defendant\u2019s intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Thus, we apply the modified categorical approach in determining which of the alternative crimes established in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16\u201413\u201430(j)(l) formed the basis for Stevens\u2019s 2003 conviction. See Descamps, 133 S.Ct. at 2283-84. Here, the undisputed facts in Stevens\u2019s PSI show that Stevens was convicted under Georgia law of possession with intent to distribute marijuana (not mere possession of marijuana). Cf. United States v. Ramirez-Flores, 743 F.3d 816, 823 (11th Cir. 2014) (\u201ca sentencing court applying the modified categorical approach may consider undisputed facts contained in the PSI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Stevens\u2019s 2003 conviction thus satisfies each of the criteria under the Guidelines\u2019 definition of a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d First, Stevens was convicted of a state offense punishable by at least one year in prison. Second, Stevens was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana: a controlled substance under federal law. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(6); 812, Schedule I(c)(10) (listing marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance). That marijuana may not constitute a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d under Georgia law is immaterial. The Guidelines are governed by definitions set forth in federal law, not state law. United States v. Tamayo, 80 F.3d 1514, 1523 (11th Cir. 1996). Moreover, because Stevens\u2019s conviction was punishable as a felony under Georgia law, it qualified as a \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d under the Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.2 comment. 1 (defining \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d as a conviction punishable as a felony under either federal or state law). The district court committed no plain error in concluding that Stevens\u2019s 2003 conviction constituted a qualifying conviction for purposes of the career offender enhancement in section 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">. The government explained expressly that if Stevens was found guilty after trial, he would face a sentencing range between 262 and 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. In the alternative, Stevens would face a sentencing range of only 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment if he pleaded guilty pursuant to the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">. To the extent Stevens contends his plea was rendered involuntary by his trial lawyer\u2019s failure to pursue a motion to suppress evidence, that argument is in essence a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We decline to consider that claim on direct appeal; the issue is more appropriately addressed in a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, on a more fully developed record. See United States v. Puentes-Hurtado, 794 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
