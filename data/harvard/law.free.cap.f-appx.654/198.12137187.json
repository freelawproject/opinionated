HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">The attorney appointed to represent Huey Joseph Hebert, III, has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Hebert has filed a response in which he argues, inter alia, that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by asserting that Hebert\u2019s appeal waiver is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Hebert\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. We decline to consider Hebert\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
