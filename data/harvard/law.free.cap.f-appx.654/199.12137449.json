Casares also argues that the district court erred in admitting cross-examination testimony that the Zetas cartel had supplied the vehicle used in the subject drug conspiracy. He contends that the evidence was unduly prejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Because his objection in the district court was based on Rule 403, Casares\u2019s Rule 404(b) challenge to the witness testimony is subject to plain error review only. <em>See United States v. Ceballos, </em>789 F.3d 607, 617 (5th Cir. 2015). \u201cTo establish plain error, [Casares] has the burden of proving (1) an error (2) that was \u2018clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u2019 and (3) that affected [his] \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)). If he makes this showing, then the court may correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Casares has not made the required showing. Even if this court were to determine that the testimony about the Zetas cartel was extrinsic to the charged offenses, Casares cannot show plain error. Pursuant to <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>this court uses a two-pronged test to determine if Rule 404(b) testimony was erroneously admitted. 582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc). The court first asks whether the evidence is \u201crelevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character,\u201d such as intent, knowledge, plan, pattern of conduct, or motive. <em>Id.; see </em>Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2). If it is, the court next examines whether the evidence possesses \u201cprobative-value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice.\u201d <em>Beechum, </em>582 F.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">Here, the testimony was relevant because it demonstrated that he possessed the requisite knowledge and intent to participate in the drug conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Misher, </em>99 F.3d 664, 670 (5th Cir. 1996). Moreover, the strength of the other evidence speaking to Casares\u2019s unlawful intent reduces the potential prejudice of the Zetas reference. <em>See United States v. Chavez, </em>119 F.3d 342, 346 (5th Cir. 1997). Consequently, Casares cannot show plain error regarding the admission of the complained-of testimony. <em>See Beechum, </em>582 F.2d at 911; <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Relatedly, Casares also cannot show plain error as to whether the district court should have sua sponte issued a lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>iting instruction, as he cites to no law showing clear or obvious error in that regard. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Casares\u2019s Rule 403 claim is similarly unavailing. \u201cIn reviewing Rule 403 findings, [this court] give[s] \u2018great deference to the [trial] court\u2019s informed judgment and will reverse only after a clear showing of prejudicial abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Peden, </em>961 F.2d 517, 521 (5th Cir. 1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Rocha, </em>916 F.2d 219, 241 (5th Cir. 1990)). As the Government correctly notes, defense counsel\u2019s own question invited the error that Casares now challenges on appeal. \u201cThe doctrine of invited error applies to this situation; when injection of inadmissible evidence is attributable to the actions of the defense, the defense cannot later object to such \u2018invited error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 339 (5th Cir. 2012) (en banc). In addition, even assuming the district court abused its discretion, any error was harmless. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>577 F.3d 273, 287 (5th Cir. 2009) (\u201cReversible error occurs only when the admission of evidence substantially affects the rights of a party\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Crawley, </em>533 F.3d 349, 353 (5th Cir. 2008))). Given the overwhelming circumstantial evidence presented at trial, any error in the admission of the complained-of testimony did not substantially affect the verdict. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
