After District Judge Alto-naga dismissed Yeyille\u2019s third amended complaint and while Yeyille\u2019s appeal of that dismissal was pending in this Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yeyille sought Judge Altonaga\u2019s retroactive recusal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 465. Yeyille claimed that recusal was warranted because Judge Altonaga had apparent conflicts with respect to his case, which \u201crendered] the adversarial legal system[] a farce.\u201d Judge Altonaga denied Yeyille\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion, and Yeyille appealed. After careful consideration, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We review a district judged decision not to recuse herself for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam). A district judge must recuse herself \u201cin any proceeding in which [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). \u201cThe test is whether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Parker v. Connors Steel Co., </em>855 F.2d 1510, 1524 (11th Cir. 1988). \u201cA judge should not recuse [her]self based upon unsupported, irrational, or tenuous allegations.\u201d <em>Giles v. Garwood, </em>853 F.2d 876, 878 (11th Cir. 1988) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Yeyille argues that Judge Altonaga should have recused herself for two reasons: (1) Judge Altonaga was a member of the steering committee for a 2014 \u201cBench and Bar Conference\u201d in Miami, as was opposing counsel in this case (along with forty other people); and (2) Judge Altona-ga\u2019s husband is a partner at Holland <em>&amp; </em>Knight, which was hired by the defendant school board to work on an unrelated matter several months after Judge Altonaga dismissed Yeyille\u2019s ease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the first reason, Yeyille says that Judge Altonaga\u2019s \u201cmembership in the Steering Committee predisposed [her] to rule in favor of [opposing counsel],\u201d though he does not explain why. As to the second reason, Yeyille <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>implies that Judge Alton\u00e1ga knew the school board might hire Holland <em>&amp; </em>Knight to work on ah unrelated matter in the future, so she dismissed Yeyille\u2019s case because it \u201cconstituted an obstacle\u201d to that agreement and \u201cin exchange for a retainer contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Yeyille makes serious accusations against the judiciary\u2014including branding the judges of the Southern District of Florida \u201cmere agents and hacks.\u201d Yet he supports these accusations with no facts. As a member of the bar, he should know better. Regarding the \u201cBench and Bar Conference,\u201d Yeyille identifies nothing beyond shared membership in the forty-two-person steering committee that could suggest Judge Altonaga was biased in favor of opposing counsel. An objective, disinterested, lay observer would not entertain a significant doubt about Judge Altonaga\u2019s impartiality based on her mere participation in a large conference in which an attorney who appeared before her also participated. <em>See Parker, </em>855 F.2d at 1524. This type of unsupported and tenuous allegation does not warrant recusal. <em>See Giles, </em>853 F.2d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The same goes for Yeyille\u2019s second ground for recusal\u2014that the school board retained Holland &amp; Knight on an unrelated matter after Judge Altonaga dismissed Yeyille\u2019s case. Although Yeyille claims this creates the appearance of a <em>quid pro quo </em>agreement, he presents no relevant facts supporting the existence of such an agreement. To the contrary, the facts show that: (1) Judge Altonaga dismissed Yeyille\u2019s case before the school board even began the process of selecting a law firm in the other matter; and (2) the matter for which the school board sought representation was wholly unrelated to Yeyille\u2019s case. This was- not a sufficient ground for recu-sal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Yeyille\u2019s recusal motion, because he failed to show that an objective observer would question Judge Altonaga\u2019s impartiality. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Yeyille\u2019s motion. Yeyille\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\">. We affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the suit on February 22, 2016, <em>Yeyille v. Miami Dade Cty. Pub. Sch., </em>No. 15-13053, 2016 WL 692050 (11th Cir. Feb. 22, 2016) (per curiam) (unpublished), and Yeyille\u2019s petition for rehearing was denied on April 20, 2016.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\">. On appeal, Yeyille also moved to supplement the record with a school board memorandum and meeting minutes. We may allow a parly to supplement the record on appeal if this would \"aid [in] making an informed decision.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Mill\u00f3n Air, Inc., </em>341 F.3d 1220, 1225 n. 4 (11th Cir. 2003). Neither of these documents would aid in making our decision. The memorandum is a slightly revised version of one Yeyille included in his Rule 60(b)(6) motion, and none of the revisions are relevant to Yeyille\u2019s recusal claim. The meeting minutes show that the law firm of Holland &amp; Knight, LLP was ultimately retained by the school board, but this fact does not aid in considering Yeyille's recusal claim. We deny Yeyille's motion to supplement the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-15\">.Yeyille appears to make several additional arguments that are not relevant to his recusal motion: First, Yeyille claims that Judge Alto-naga erred by refusing to exercise jurisdiction over his motion. Yeyille has this wrong. Judge Altonaga exercised jurisdiction in order to consider his motion and never mentioned lacking jurisdiction over it. Second, Yeyille claims that the Dominican Republic hired Holland &amp; Knight to appeal an order by Judge Altonaga in an unrelated case, malting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>it appear that Judge Altonaga helped her husband's law firm secure the Dominican Republic as a client. This allegation is not related to Yeyille's recusal motion in this case. Finally, Yeyille claims that some relatives of judges in the Southern District of Florida work for Miami law firms, which makes the court \"resemble[ ] a <em>private court </em>run by an oligarchy composed of the local <em>noblesse de robe </em>similar to a French <em>parlement </em>before the Revolution.\u201d This allegation is also unrelated to Yeyille\u2019s recusal motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
