California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Aguilar-Aguilar has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief, relevant portions of the record reflected therein, and Aguilar-Aguilar\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. In his response, Aguilar-Aguilar challenges, <em>inter alia, </em>the drug-trafficking enhancement; he maintains that his New Mexico conviction of possession with intent to deliver does not qualify as a drug-trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because it does not require remuneration. That contention is foreclosed, <em>see United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 205 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 533, 193 L.Ed.2d 426 (2015), but by raising the issue, Aguilar-Aguilar has preserved it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
