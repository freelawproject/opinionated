Walter Komanski was a judge in the Ninth Judicial Circuit in Florida and had signed the arrest warrants for the American Front members; Lawson Lamar was the State\u2019s Attorney in the Ninth Judicial Circuit at the time of the arrests; and Kelly Boaz, was the case agent assigned to the American Front investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Defendant was charged with five counts of extortion by interstate communications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b), for sending three emails containing extortionate threats (Counts 1-3), and for posting the extortionate threats on the websites of the Southern Poverty Law Center and. the Anti-Defamation League (Counts 4-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">Defendant pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial. At the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, and again at the close of the Defendant\u2019s case, Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. The district court denied the motion, and a jury convicted Defendant on all counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>trict court subsequently sentenced Defendant to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, which reflected a 59-month upward variance from the top of Defendant\u2019s guideline range. Defendant now appeals his convictions and sentences. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">According to the trial evidence, while Defendant was on federal probation in the Western District of Virginia, he absconded with Sabrina Gnos to Mexico in early-May 2012. On the car ride from Roanoke, Virginia, to Mexico, Defendant and Gnos stopped at places such as Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s because Defendant wanted to use the free internet. Although Defendant did not permit Gnos to bring any electronics, he brought along a Toshiba laptop computer and used it to send emails and talk to people on Facebook. During the trip, Defendant and Gnos talked about Charles Manson and they listened to the Beatles song \u201cHelter Skelter.\u201d Defendant also told Gnos about a software program called TOR, which allows an individual to mask the location of his internet IP address so that the Government cannot find the geographic location of that individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Prior to leaving the United States, Defendant had asked Gnos to take care of his affairs while he was out of the country. As a result, he added her to his bank account and provided her with the key to his post office box. Accordingly, after the two arrived in Mexico, Defendant gave Gnos money to drive his ear back to Virginia. He also asked her to mail several packages along the way. Gnos mailed the items when she got back to Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">On May 11, 2012, Judge James C. Turk (a now-deceased judge from the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia who had presided over an unrelated federal case involving Defendant) received a package at his home address that had a return address from Tom Bondurant (the Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted the unrelated federal case against Defendant). The package contained a book written by Defendant entitled \u201cThe Centuries of Revolution,\u201d and a handwritten message stating, \u201cBe glad it\u2019s just a book, pig.\u201d On the same day, Bondurant, and his supervisor, Timothy Heaphy (the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia), also received packages that contained Defendant\u2019s book, as well as handwritten messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">On May 18, 2012, at 10:21 A.M., the email address, \u201cnslf_helterskelter@ hotmail.com,\u201d was created. Approximately ten minutes later, the nslf_helterskelter@ hotmail.com email address was used to send a threat directed at Judge Turk, which demanded the termination of the legal proceedings against Defendant. Almost immediately after that email was sent, the Facebook account for the user-name, \u201cBill White,\u201d posted the text of the threat directed at Judge Turk.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">The next day, at 2:03 P.M., the Bill White Facebook account posted a request for information pertaining to the names of the judges, federal prosecutors, and FBI agents involved in the American Front case. The Bill White Facebook account later wrote that the state officials involved in the American Front case were Judge Komanski, Lawson Lamar, and Boaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>A short time thereafter, the Bill White Facebook account posted a photo of Lawson Lamar\u2019s family and listed the names of Lamar\u2019s wife, adult children, and grandchildren. Then, approximately thirty min? utes later, Lawson Lamar received an email from nslf_helterskelter@hotmail. com, which is the subject of Count 1. The email stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-4\">Okay PIGS.

Within minutes of this email being sent, the Bill White Facebook account posted a virtually identical copy of the email to its page.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-22\">Shortly thereafter, the Bill White Face-book account posted information about the architecture business of Thomas Lamar, Lawson Lamar\u2019s adult son. Within minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>of this post, Thomas Lamar received a threatening email from nslf_ helterskelter@hotmail.com at his work address. This email is the subject of Count 3 and stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-5\">All right pigs, DIG IT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-6\">We tried to speak to speak [sic] to Grand Pa-pa but we don\u2019t know that he got it, so we\u2019re speaking to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">You might know me.

Minutes later, an individual who was once again identified as \u201cCharlie Fucking Manson\u201d posted the threat on the website for the Anti-Defamation League (Count 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">Several days passed, and then on May 28, 2012, the Bill White Faeebook account wrote that Florida officials had not yet complied with the demand to release the American Front prisoners. The next day, the Bill White Faeebook account posted that the federal government was \u201cexhausting their limited bodyguard budget protecting the homes of the three Florida officials involved and their children/grandchildren. So, as noted, political terror is working pretty well to resolve a situation that could not have been resolved peacefully or legally.\u201d On June 2, 2012, a link was shared by the Bill White Faeebook account, which included a caption containing Boaz\u2019s home address, Judge Komanski\u2019s home address, and Lawson Lamar\u2019s home address, as well as the names of Lawson Lamar\u2019s adult children and grandchildren. The caption also stated, \u201cAre we going to let them have a monopoly on violence or are we going to stop this injustice?\u201d In the subsequent days, the Bill White Faeebook account continued to make various other posts.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">Defendant was arrested in Mexico on June 8, 2012. After this date, the activity on the Bill White Faeebook account stopped, as well as all outgoing communications from Defendant\u2019s personal email account dhyphen@yahoo.com.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">Following a five-day trial, the jury convicted Defendant of five counts of extortion by interstate communications, in violation of \u00a7 875(b). In anticipation of sentencing, the probation officer prepared a Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR grouped Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5 together pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(b), but grouped Count 3 separately because it involved different victims. As to both groups, the PSR assigned Defendant a base offense level of 18, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.2(a). Defendant also received several enhancements and adjustments, including (1) a three-level enhancement because the offense involved preparation or ability to carry out a threat of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(3)(B) and (2) a two-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) because Defendant knew or should have known that the victim was vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4, Defendant received a multiple-count adjustment of two levels, which resulted in a total offense level of 32. Because Defendant had 11 criminal history points, the PSR assigned him a criminal history category of V. Based on a total offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of V, Defendant\u2019s guideline range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Defendant raised several objections to the PSR. He objected to the two-level adjustment under \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) for threatening a vulnerable victim, and the three-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(3)(B) for the preparation or ability to carry out the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">At sentencing, the district court sustained an objection not relevant to the present appeal and overruled Defendant\u2019s other objections. Having sustained one of Defendant\u2019s objections, the district court re-calculated Defendant\u2019s amended guideline range as 151 to 188 months, based on a total offense level of 30 and a criminal history category of V.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Defendant requested that the district court impose the sentence to run concurrently with the 92-month sentence he had received in the Western District of Virginia for making extortionate threats to his ex-wife while he was on the run in Mexico. After considering the parties\u2019 arguments and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court explained that an upward variance was necessary in this case to comply with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors given Defendant\u2019s criminal history, his conduct leading up to the charges in the present case, the need to protect the public from Defendant, and Defendant\u2019s inability to be rehabilitated. Consequently, the district court imposed a 210-month sentence on each count to.run concurrently, but ordered the 210-month sentence to run consecutive to the 92-month sentence Defendant received in the Western District of Virginia. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">Defendant first argues that the evidence was not sufficient to convict him of extortion by interstate communications pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b). In particular, he asserts that the Government did not provide sufficient proof to identify him as the person who allegedly sent the extortionate threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir. 2009). In reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>The evidence will be sufficient to sustain a conviction if a reasonable trier of fact could find that it established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1284-85. When the Government relies on circumstantial evidence, the conviction must be supported by reasonable inferences, not mere speculation. <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">To convict a defendant of extortion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b), the Government must prove that the defendant (1) transmitted a communication in interstate commerce (2) containing any threat to kidnap or injure the person of another (3) with the intent to extort any money or other thing of value. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b). Here, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support Defendant\u2019s convictions for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>tortion by interstate communications. Based on the evidence presented by the Government, a reasonable jury could find that Defendant sent the threats to kidnap or seriously injure another person through interstate commerce with the intent to extort a thing of value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">A reasonable jury could infer that Defendant sent the threatening emails and made the online posts using the nslfi. helterskelter@hotmail.com email address. \u201cNSLF\u201d stands for the National Socialist Liberation Front and is a defunct neo-Nazi group that was founded in the 1960\u2019s by individuals who worked for the American Nazi Party. The Bill White Facebook account \u201cliked\u201d the National Socialist Liberation Front\u2019s Facebook page and posted a manifesto for the group two days after the nslf_helterskelter@hotmail.com email address was created. Heidi Beirich\u2014director of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, which produces a magazine and a blog that tracks publications about extremist groups\u2014testified that she was familiar with Defendant because of his involvement with the neo-Nazi movement. In fact, the Southern Poverty Law Center had written repeatedly about Defendant\u2019s activities in various hate groups, including the group that he created\u2014The American Nationalist Socialist Worker\u2019s Party..</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Moreover, the nslf_helterskelter@ hotmail.com email address was used to send a threat directed at Judge Turk (the judge who presided over an unrelated federal case involving Defendant), demanding the cessation of Defendant\u2019s criminal proceedings. Investigators were not able to determine the geographic location of the IP address used to create the nslfi. helterskelter@hotmail.com email address because it had been made anonymous. The Bill White Facebook account, however, had requested information about using \u201cano-nymizing\u201d software various times, and Defendant discussed this very- software with Gnos on their trip to Mexico. Likewise, the posts on the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s blog and the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s website were posted by an individual identified as \u201cCharlie Fucking Manson\u201d at nslf_helterskelter@hotmail.com, and Defendant discussed Charles Manson with Gnos and played the Beatles song \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d on the drive to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Furthermore, the activity on the Bill White Facebook account was very close in time and content to the threatening emails and website posts. Indeed, the Bill White Facebook account posted a verbatim copy of the threat directed at Judge Komanski, Lawson Lamar, Boaz, and their families within minutes of the threat having been emailed to Defendant\u2019s personal address, dhyphen@hotmail.com. The Bill White Fa-cebook account also solicited others on social media for the names and addresses of the state and federal officials involved in the American Front prosecution. The Bill White Facebook account later posted the names and addresses of these officials, as well as a photograph of Lawson Lamar\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">A reasonable jury could infer that Defendant was responsible for the posts on the Bill White Facebook account. At trial, Gnos testified that she saw Defendant using Facebook on their trip to Mexico and identified the Bill White Facebook account as Defendant\u2019s account. FBI Special Agent James Majeski also testified that the FBI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>had connected the Facebook account to Defendant based on several facts, including that the account contained photographs of Defendant. Agent Majeski further testified that the email address used to set-up the Bill White Facebook account, \u201cvolundl065@hotmail.com,\u201d sent multiple emails in response to an advertisement for a boat ride in early-May 2012. In these emails, the user of the \u201cvolundl065@ hotmail.com\u201d stated that he was in Mexico and in need of a ride to Panama, and signed the name \u201cBill\u201d on one of the emails. Moreover, Defendant\u2019s personal email address, dhyphen@yahoo.com, was referenced in private conversations on the Bill White Facebook account. And notably, the activity on the Bill White Facebook account, as well as outgoing communications from dhyphen@yahoo.com ended on June 8, 2012\u2014the day Defendant was arrested in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">We are not persuaded by Defendant\u2019s speculation that someone else could have used his account in an attempt to frame him. Gnos testified that although she had access to his bank account and post office box, Defendant had not given her his internet passwords and usernames. In light of the jury\u2019s verdict, the jury found her to be credible, and we therefore defer to that determination. <em>See Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1285; <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1290-91 (11th Cir. 2005) (stating that we accept all credibility choices made in the Government\u2019s favor unless they are incredible as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Moreover, the fact that Agent Majeski testified that the user information for the nslf_helterskelter@hotmail.com email address stated that a female created it in Roanoke, Virginia, is of no consequence because Agent Majeski also explained that this information is personally entered by the user. Therefore, the user can identify himself as any gender he wishes and state that the email address was created in any place that he wishes. And while the Bill White Facebook account did make various posts stating that it had been hacked, it never made any posts disavowing the comments made about the Florida officials involved in the American Front prosecution. Similarly, although defense witness Richard Connor, a computer forensic analyst, testified that his analysis of the dhyphen@ yahoo.com email account showed that an attachment to one email contained a Trojan horse application\u2014that, if activated, could steal data or otherwise obtain a user\u2019s passwords\u2014Connor also stated that he did not know if the Trojan horse application was actually installed on Defendant\u2019s computer. The above evidence therefore, which Defendant says showed the possibility that someone tried to frame him, does not alter our conclusion that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant was guilty. <em>See Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1285 (\u201c[I]t is not enough for a defendant to put forth a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, because the issue is not whether a jury reasonably could have acquitted but whether it reasonably could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">We turn next to Defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to show that the threats were made for a thing of value. Specifically, Defendant contends that the Government did not establish a link between the American Front members and Defendant, such that the release of the American Front members would be of any value to Defendant. \u201cWhen a defendant raises specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence in the district court, but not the specific challenge he tries to raises on appeal, we review his argument for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Baston, </em>818 F.3d 651, 664 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>(11th Cir. 2016). Because Defendant raised specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence before the district court, but did not raise the argument he raises here, our review is limited to plain error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Even assuming Defendant could show that the district court committed error, he cannot show that the error was plain because he does not cite to, and our research has not revealed, any published decision holding that a defendant must personally benefit from the \u201cthing of value\u201d that is the subject of the extortion under \u00a7 875(b). <em>See United States v. Legarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (llth Cir. 2003) (\u201cIt is the law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d). In any event, we have interpreted the phrase \u201cany thing of value\u201d in the bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B), broadly to mean \u201cquite literally \u2018any thing whatever; something, no matter what.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Townsend, </em>630 F.3d 1003, 1010-11 (llth Cir. 2011). Defendant\u2019s Fa-cebook post stating that \u201cpolitical terror\u201d was working to achieve the goal of releasing the American Front prisoners shows that the prisoners\u2019 release had value to him. <em>See id. </em>In short, the district court did not plainly err by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>acquit Defendant on the basis that the release of the American Front members did not have any value to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Lastly, Defendant argues that the district court should have struck Gnos\u2019s testimony because she appeared impaired to the point that her personal knowledge was not satisfactory under Federal Rule of Evidence 602. In support of this argument, Defendant asserts that Gnos testified inconsistently on direct and cross-examination about the medications that she was taking. Because Defendant did not object to Gnos\u2019s testimony before the district court, our review is again limited to plain error. <em>See Baston, </em>818 F.3d at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">We conclude that the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise. Rule 602 provides that a witness \u201cmay testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 602. At trial, Gnos testified in significant detail about her relationship with Defendant and about their trip to Mexico, which demonstrated that she had personal knowledge of the events. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cEvidence to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness\u2019s own testimony.\u201d). Her testimony was also consistent with the other evidence showing that Defendant fled to Mexico and that Judge Turk, Heaphy, and Bondurant received packages containing Defendant\u2019s book after Gnos mailed the items Defendant had asked her to send. Thus, the district court did not err plainly, or otherwise, by failing <em>sua sponte </em>to strike Gnos\u2019s testimony on the ground that she lacked personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">In short, viewing all of this evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant was guilty of extortion by interstate communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">B. Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Defendant next contends that venue was improper in the Middle District of Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>with respect to Counts 4 and 5 (the threats posted on the websites for the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League). Because the Southern Poverty Law Center is located in Alabama, the Anti-Defamation League is located in New York, and the Hotmail servers are not located in Florida, Defendant contends that the threatening statements alleged in Counts 4 and 5 did not travel through Florida. As such, he asserts that he was entitled to judgment of acquittal on this basis, as well as a jury instruction on venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">At the close of evidence, Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal as to Counts 4 and 5, on the basis that the Government had not proven venue to be in the Middle District of Florida. Defendant also requested a jury instruction on venue. The district court determined that Defendant\u2019s objection to venue was not timely raised. However, even if the issue were timely raised, the district court concluded that there was no issue of fact related to venue. Thus, the district court denied Defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury on venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Article III of the Constitution provides that the \u201cTrial of all Crimes .., shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.\u201d U.S. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 .2, cl. 3. When considering a venue challenge, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, and make[] all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury verdict when deciding whether the government has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that an offense occurred in the trial district.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>918 F.2d 1551, 1657 (11th Cir. 1990). Nevertheless, with only a limited exception, a defendant waives a challenge to venue if he has failed to raise the issue before trial. That limited exception applies if the defendant does not become aware of the defect until after the Government has presented its case, <em>See United States v. Roberts, </em>308 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (11th Cir. 2002) (concluding that defendant waived his venue challenge by not raising it until the close of the prosecution\u2019s case because defendant was aware of the basis for his objection before the close of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Defendant did not raise the issue of venue until his motion for judgment of acquittal at- the close of the Government\u2019s case. He thei-efore waived this challenge by not timely raising it. <em>See id. </em>Further, we need not consider the applicability of the exception because Defendant did not allege in the district court, nor does he assert on appeal, that he only became aware of the basis for his objection after the Government had rested its case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">In fact, the indictment stated that the Southern Poverty Law Center was based in Alabama and that the Anti-Defamation League was based in New York. The indictment also stated that the servers that host those websites were not located in Florida, nor were the servers that store, maintain, and transmit email communications for Hotmail accounts. In short, the indictment set out the very information on which Defendant now rests his venue challenge. Therefore, Defendant was necessarily aware of the basis for this challenge prior to trial. That being so, Defendant\u2019s argument that venue was improper is without merit. <em>See id. </em>Defendant waived his venue challenge, and the district court did not err when it refused to give a venue instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">C. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Defendant next challenges two pattern jury instructions given by the court regarding the definition of\u2019\u201ctrue threat\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b) and reasonable doubt. We review the legal correctness of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>jury instruction <em>de novo. United States v. Mintmire, </em>507 F.3d 1273, 1292-93- (11th Cir. 2007). We will reverse a conviction on the basis of an improper jury instruction only if \u201cthe issues of law were presented-inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">1. Definition of True Threat under \u00a7 875(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Defendant asserts that the district court erred by instructing the jury that the definition of \u201ctrue threat\u201d as it pertains to a violation of \u00a7 875(b) requires that a reasonable person would view the communications as a threat. He contends that the district court should have instead instructed the jury that a violation of \u00a7 875 requires proof of a defendant\u2019s subjective intent to threaten.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Prior to trial, Defendant objected to the pattern jury instruction, which defines a \u201ctrue threat\u201d as \u201ca serious threat\u2014not idle talk, a careless remark, or something said jokingly\u2014that is made under circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the Defendant intended to [kidnap] [injure] another person.\u201d <em>See </em>11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases), Offense Instruction 30.2 (2010). In support of his objections, Defendant asserted that the question of whether a \u201ctrue threat\u201d requires that the speaker have the subjective intent to communicate a threat was at issue in a case currently pending before the Supreme Court. The district court overruled Defendant\u2019s objection and provided the pattern instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Defendant now argues that the district court\u2019s instruction constituted reversible error in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Elonis v. United States, </em>575 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1.(2015). In <em>Elonis, </em>the Supreme Court overturned the defendant\u2019s conviction in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for making threatening .statements (which took the form of rap lyrics) because the jury was improperly instructed that in order to convict the defendant, it only needed to find that a \u201creasonable person\u201d would have viewed the defendant\u2019s communications as threats. <em>Elonis, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2005-07, 2012. The Court reasoned that unlike \u00a7 875(b), which requires an \u201cintent to extort,\u201d \u00a7 875(c) lacked any express mental state. <em>Id. </em>at 2008-09. However, the Court explained that, the fact that a statute does not identify any required mental state does not mean that one should not exist. <em>Id. </em>at 2009. And requiring criminal liability to turn on whether a reasonable person views a communication as a threat\u2014without consideration of what the defendant intends\u2014is erroneous because it \u201creduces culpability on the all-important element of the crime to negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2011-12 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Contrary to Defendant\u2019s contentions, <em>El-onis </em>does not call for reversal of Defendant\u2019s conviction for a violation of \u00a7 875(b). <em>Elonis </em>involved a violation of \u00a7 875(c), which does not require any mental state on a defendant\u2019s part, not \u00a7 875(b), which requires the mental state of an \u201cintent to extort.\u201d <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 875(c). Moreover, in <em>Elonis, </em>the Supreme Court was concerned with the fact that under the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard, a defendant could be convicted of \u00a7 875(c) without any awareness that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>had done anything wrong. <em>Elonis, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2011-12. Section 875(b), however, requires an \u201cintent to extort,\u201d which means that the Government must prove both the existence of the threat and the defendant\u2019s intention to extort something of value via the threats. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b); <em>see also United States v. White, </em>810 F.3d 212, 223 (4th Cir. 2016) (defining \u201cintent to extort\u201d under \u00a7 875(b) as the \u201cintent to procure something of value through the use of a wrongful threat to kidnap or injure the person of another,\u201d which is \u201cwrongful when delivered intentionally\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">In the present case, the district court instructed the jury on this mental state by stating that the Defendant could be found guilty of violating \u00a7 875(b) if he (1) \u201cknowingly sent a message in interstate or foreign commerce containing a true threat to kidnap any person or injure the person of another\u201d and (2) \u201cthe defendant did so with intent to extort money or something else of value to the defendant.\u201d In short, Defendant has not demonstrated that the district court erred by giving this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">2. Reasonable Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"Aqf2\">Defendant also asserts that the district court erred by using the pattern jury instruction, which defines \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d to mean \u201cproof so convincing that you would be willing to rely and act on it without hesitation in the most important of your own affairs.\u201d <em>See </em>11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases), Basic Instruction 3 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">As Defendant readily concedes, \u201cwe have repeatedly approved of the definition of reasonable- doubt provided in the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions.\u201d <em>See e.g., United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1333, 1337-38 (11th Cir. 2011). Therefore, Defendant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">D. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">Defendant raises several arguments on appeal challenging the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of two enhancements: a two-level vulnerable-victim enhancement and a three-level enhancement based on preparation and ability to carry out the threat. He also argues that the district court erred by running the sentence in the present case consecutive to the 92-month sentence he received in an unrelated case in the Western District of Virginia. Finally, he argues that his total 210-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">Using a two-step process, we review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cubero, </em>754 F.3d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 2014). We first look to whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guideline range, treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>quately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Then we examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">1. The vulnerable-victim enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Defendant asserts that Thomas Lamar was not a vulnerable victim and argues that the district court procedurally erred by applying the two-level vulnerable-victim enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). Although the application of \u00a7 3Al.l(b) is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo, </em>the district court\u2019s determination of a victim\u2019s vulnerability is a factual finding to which we accord \u201cdue deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Frank, </em>247 F.3d 1257, 1259 (11th Cir. 2001). We will reverse this factual finding only if we conclude that it is clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Here, Defendant sent a threat directly to Thomas Lamar threatening to kidnap, rape, and kill his two daughters if Thomas Lamar\u2019s father, the then-State\u2019s Attorney for Ninth Judicial Circuit in Florida, did not drop the charges against the members of the American Front organization. The district court determined that Thomas Lamar was a vulnerable victim because he was targeted due to the young age of his daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Section 3Al.l(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if \u201cthe defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). Although Defendant argues that Thomas Lamar cannot be a vulnerable victim because of his age, the Application Notes to \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) state, in relevant part, that a \u201c \u2018vulnerable victim\u2019 means a person ... who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, <em>or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), comment. (n.2 (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">Applying due deference, the district court did not clearly err by determining that Thomas Lamar was a vulnerable victim because of his circumstances, namely, his fear for the safety of his young children. <em>See United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1288 (11th Cir. 2011) (reasoning that a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is a person whose vulnerability is essential to the defendant\u2019s choice to victimize them and \u201cthat both circumstances and immutable characteristics can render a victim vulnerable\u201d). The threat Defendant sent directly to Thomas Lamar threatening to kidnap, rape, and kill his children exploited Thomas Lamar\u2019s concern for the safety of his two young daughters. <em>Cf. United States v. Villali, </em>926 F.2d 999, 1000 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that the district court did not clearly err in finding that a victim was unusually susceptible to extortion because of his concern for his kidnapped daughter\u2019s health and safety). Accordingly, the district court'did not err by imposing the two-level vulnerable-victim enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">2. The preparation or ability to carry out the threat enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Defendant argues that the district court erred by applying the three-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(3)(B) because the Government did not present sufficient evidence showing his preparation or that he had the ability to carry out the threat, given that he was in Mexico at the time he made the threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and its application of the Guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Moran, </em>778 F.3d 942, 959 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>(11th Cir. 2015). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Section 2B8.2(b)(3)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a three-level increase in the defendant\u2019s offense level if \u201cthe offense involved preparation to carryout a threat of (I) death; (II) serious bodily injury; (III) kidnapping ... [or] otherwise demonstrated the ability to carry out a threat.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Again, Defendant threatened Boaz, Lawson Lamar, Judge Komanski, and their family members with kidnap, rape, and murder, unless the charges against the members of the American Front were dropped. The district court concluded that Defendant\u2019s statements constituted threats of death, injury, and kidnapping, and that Defendant had the ability to carry out the threat because he used the victim\u2019s names and addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The district court did not clearly err by concluding that Defendant had the ability to carry out the threat, which is a requirement for the three-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(3)(B). Defendant not only knew the victim\u2019s names and addresses, but he went so far as to list the names of Lawson Lamar\u2019s grandchildren and to state that he knew they were at school. Defendant\u2019s intimate knowledge of the officials and their families demonstrated Defendant\u2019s ability to carry out the threat. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.2, comment, (n.6) (indicating that a \u201cthreat to kidnap a person accompanied by information showing a study of that person\u2019s daily routine\u201d is an example of a defendant\u2019s preparation or ability to carry out a threat). Based on this evidence, we find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of the three-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(3)(B). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">3. Consecutive Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Defendant argues that the district court erred by imposing his sentence to run consecutive to the 92-month sentence he received in the Western District of Virginia. He asserts that the sentences should have been imposed to run concurrently pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), because both cases involve the same relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">During the same time period that Defendant was in Mexico threatening the Florida state officials in the present case, he was also threatening his ex-wife in Virginia with violence in order to get her to make alimony payments to him. As a result, Defendant was charged in the Western District of Virginia with extortion by interstate communications and sending threats by interstate communications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b) <em>&amp; </em>(c). A jury later convicted Defendant on all charges, and he was sentenced to 92 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court in the present case ran Defendant\u2019s sentence in this case consecutively to that 92-month sentence!</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. <em>United States v. Bidwell, </em>393 F.3d 1206, 1208-09 (11th Cir. 2004). We review the imposition of a consecutive sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1346-47 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">Section 5G1.3(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that if \u201ca term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction ... the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2). If the other offense does not constitute relevant conduct, however, \u201cthe sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(d). In other words, it is the sentencing court\u2019s call.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The district court did not err by imposing Defendant\u2019s sentence in the present case to run consecutively to the 92-month sentence imposed in the Western District of Virginia because Defendant\u2019s act of threatening to extort his ex-wife was not relevant conduct to the present offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Relevant Conduct is defined as \u201call acts and omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). \u201cFor two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose or similar <em>modus opemndi.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(A) (emphasis added)). Where offenses are not part of the same common scheme or plan, they may be considered part of the same course of conduct \u201cif they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Although Defendant sent the extortionate threats in both cases from the same laptop while he was on the lam in Mexico, the two offenses involved different victims and had different purposes. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 IB 1.3, comment. (n.9(A)). The extortionate threats in the present case were directed at Florida state officials in an effort to obtain the release of the American Front prisoners. The extortionate threats in the case from the Western District of Virginia, however, were directed at Defendant\u2019s ex-wife in an attempt to obtain money that she allegedly owed to him. Because Defendant\u2019s extortion of his wife did not constitute relevant conduct for the present case, the district court here was not required to impose the sentence to run concurrently with the Virginia sentence. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(b)(2). Therefore the district court was entirely within its discretion to run the sentences consecutively. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">4. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Defendant\u2019s final argument is that the district court\u2019s imposition of an upward variance and its decision to run Defendant\u2019s sentence consecutive to his 92-month sentence in the Western District of Virginia is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">We disagree. Although Defendant\u2019s 210-month sentence reflected a 59-month upward variance from his guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, the sentence was still below the statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (indicating that a sentence well below the statutory maximum is indicative of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">Moreover, the district court relied on several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to support his decision to upwardly vary. <em>See United States v. Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2015) (concluding that a 60-month upward variance from the top of the guideline range was substantively rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>sonable where the district court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and provided significant justifications for imposing such a sentence). In particular, the district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, which were so serious and Defendant\u2019s potential for striking fear in the jurors so great, that the district court felt it necessary to select an anonymous jury. The district court also likened Defendant\u2019s conduct to terrorism because he used violence and threats to intimidate and coerce others for political purposes. Moreover, Defendant\u2019s criminal history, which included several other prior federal convictions for solicitation to commit a crime of violence, witness tampering, and extortion by interstate communications, as well as absconding while on supervised release, demonstrated the need to incapacitate Defendant for a long period of time. As noted by the district court, Defendant\u2019s prior conduct indicated that rehabilitation was unlikely and that confinement was the only way to prevent him from continuing to harass, threaten, and intimidate innocent people.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">We also reject Defendant\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences punishes him twice for conduct related to the present offense because the threats directed at the Florida state officials and the threats directed at Defendant\u2019s ex-wife were separate and unrelated. Again, the district court acted within its discretion and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it imposed the consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b) (\u201cThe court, in determining whether the terms imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, shall consider, as to each offense for which a term of imprisonment is being imposed, the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">In sum, we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, Defendant has not shown that the distinct court abused its discretion by imposing a 210-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">For all of the above reasons, Defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\">.

Section 875(c) of Tide 18 of the United States Code provides that, \"Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 875(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b994-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed education or vocational training or medical care; (6) the lands of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b997-7\">. We reject the Government\u2019s argument that we should review Defendant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence for plain error. Although Defendant stated during the sentencing hearing that the district court had discretion to impose his sentence to run concurrently or consecutively, he also belabored the point that the sentences should be imposed to run concurrently because the extortionate threats directed toward his ex-wife were relevant conduct to the present offense. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>728 F.3d 1286, 1295 (11th Cir. 2013) (\"To preserve an argument for appeal, the argument must be raised at the trial court if the party had the opportunity to do so.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
