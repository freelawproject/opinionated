An administrative law judge denied her application based on his finding that McGriff was not disabled. After the Appeals Council denied review, McGriff appealed to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In the district court, McGriff contended that the ALJ\u2019s decision was erroneous on several grounds. She also filed a motion to remand under sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). A magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the district court affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision and deny the motion to remand. McGriff filed objections to the report and recommendation in which she challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision, but did not challenge his recommendation to deny her motion to remand. The district court adopted the report and recommendation, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, and denied McGriffs motion to remand. This is McGriffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">When an ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. Doughty v. Apfel, 245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001). We review de novo the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion of law. Lewis v. Barnhart, 285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir. 2002). We accept its findings of fact as conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence. Id. \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">McGriff first contends that the ALJ erred in failing to give controlling weight to her treating physician\u2019s opinion. While a treating physician\u2019s opinion is ordinarily entitled to \u201csubstantial or considerable weight,\u201d the ALJ may disregard or discount the opinion where \u201cgood cause\u201d exists. Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation marks omitted). Good cause exists when: \u201c(1) [the] treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) [the] evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) [the] treating physician\u2019s opinion was con-clusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d Id, at 1241. \u201cWe will not second guess the ALJ about the weight the treating physician\u2019s opinion deserves so long as he articulates a specific justification for it.\u201d Hunter v. Soc. Sec. Admin., Comm\u2019r, 808 F.3d 818, 823 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">In this case, the ALJ explained that the treating physician\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with his own treatment notes, the examination notes of another physician, and McGriffs medical records. In light of those inconsistencies, the ALJ was entitled to give less than controlling weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">McGriff next contends that the ALJ did not properly consider her global assessment functioning (GAF) score in determining whether, she was disabled. A GAF score is a subjective determination that represents \u201cthe clinician\u2019s judgment of the individual\u2019s overall level of functioning.\u201d Am. Psychiatric Ass\u2019n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 30 (4th ed. text rev, 2000). A score between 41 and 50 indicates serious symptoms or \u201cany serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning.\u201d Id. at 32. A score between 51 and 60 indicates only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>moderate symptoms or \u201cmoderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning.\u201d Id. A score between 61 and 70 indicates only mild symptoms or \u201csome difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">McGriff argues that she received a GAF score of 50 in July 2011 and that the ALJ erred as a matter of law in assuming that a score of 50 \u201ctypically denotes nondisabling symptoms.\u201d That argument fails because even if a GAF score of 50 denotes more than nondisabling symptoms, the ALJ found that during the same time period, McGriff obtained GAF scores greater than 50 and that her GAF scores continued to improve with treatment. In April 2011 McGriff obtained a score of 52, in July 2011 she obtained a score of 54, and in April 2012 she obtained a score of 67. Those scores are not only consistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that McGriff was not disabled, they support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">McGriff also contends that the Appeals Council committed legal error when it refused to consider two pieces of new evidence: the opinion of a social worker and \u201cquality of life\u201d records. The Appeals Council normally must consider evidence that was not presented to the ALJ when that evidence is new, material, and chronologically relevant. See Washington v. Soc. Sec. Admin., Comm\u2019r, 806 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2015). Evidence is chronologically relevant if it \u201crelates to the period on or before the date of the [ALJ] hearing decision.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b), 416.1470(b). Evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d when it is \u201crelevant and probative so that there is a reasonable possibility that it would change the administrative result.\u201d Milano v. Bowen, 809 F.2d 763, 766 (11th Cir. 1987) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Appeals Council did not err in refusing to consider the new evidence that McGriff presented to it. The quality of life records were not chronologically relevant because they related to a time period after the date of the ALJ hearing decision. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b), 416.1470(b). The social worker\u2019s opinion was not material because there was not a reasonable probability that it would have changed the administrative result. Only opinions from \u201cacceptable medical sources\u201d can be used to establish the existence of an impairment. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513(a), 416.913(a), Because a social worker is not listed as an acceptable source, a social worker\u2019s opinion cannot be considered in determining the existence of an impairment. Cf. Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 363 F.3d 1155, 1160 (11th Cir. 2004) (stating that because a chiropractor \u201cis not considered an \u2018acceptable source\u2019\u201d under the applicable regulations, \u201chis opinion cannot establish the existence of an impairment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">McGriff next contends that the magistrate judge erred in recommending that the district court deny her motion for a sentence-six remand. As an initial matter, the Commissioner responds that McGriff waived that argument by failing to specifically object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on the motion to remand. Our Court\u2019s rules provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgY\">A party failing to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s findings or recommendations contained in a report and recommendation in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) waives the right to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s order based on unobjected-to factual and legal conclusions if the party was informed of the time period for objecting and the consequences on appeal for failing to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">11th Cir. R. 3-1 (emphasis added). Here, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation informed McGriff of the time period for objecting and cautioned that her failure to timely object \u201cwill bar any later challenge or review of the factual findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of the magistrate judge, except for plain error.\u201d The warning did not say that McGriffs failure to object would constitute a waiver of her right to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s legal conclusions. Because neither the magistrate judge nor district court fully informed McGriff of the consequences on appeal for failing to object, she has not waived her right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to remand based on the magistrate judge\u2019s unobjected-to legal conclusions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) provides that the district court may \u201cat any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding....\u201d In support of her motion for a sentence-six remand, McGriff submits a physician\u2019s report dated May 2013. Although .the report was not authored until seven months after the ALJ had issued its decision, McGriff obtained the report well before the Appeals Council denied her request for review in March 2014. McGriff offers no reason for failing to submit the report to the Appeals Council. The district court therefore correctly denied her motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Finally, McGriff contends that the district court wrongly \u201ccorrect[ed] or rehabilitate[d] the [ALJ\u2019s] decision,\u201d instead of reviewing it. In support of that argument, she points to the following portion of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">The ALJ accorded little weight to the opinion of [McGriffs treating physician], stating that \u201cthey are inconsistent with his own findings on examination and are unsupported by the weight of the evidence of record.\u201d (Tr. 86). This is a broad, generalized statement made all the more unhelpful by the fact that the ALJ did not bother to point to any particular records of [McGriffs treating physician] which were inconsistent with his opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Immediately after the portion of the report and recommendation that McGriff quotes, the magistrate judge goes on to state that his review of the administrative record confirmed that the treating physician\u2019s opinion was in fact inconsistent with his own medical records and the records of another physician, which supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusions. We can discern no err ror in that reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-21\">. The Commissioner argues that even if McGriff did not waive her challenge to the magistrate judge's legal conclusions by failing to object, we should nonetheless review only for plain error. Because we conclude that the magistrate judge did not err even under a de novo standard of review, we need not decide whether the plain-error standard applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
