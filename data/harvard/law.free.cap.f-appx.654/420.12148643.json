Athough Lewis states that he challenges his conviction as to all 22 counts, Lewis makes a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument only as to his conviction for seven counts of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. Lewis also contends the district court erred by limiting his cross-examination of a Government witness at trial and by applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 at sentencing. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-24\">There was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find Lewis guilty of aggravated identity theft. The Government presented evidence that Lewis deposited 92 federal income tax refund checks, including the seven related to the aggravated identity theft charges, into accounts for which Lewis had signatory authority. As to these seven checks, Lewis told bank officials that the named payees were members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of his church who had endorsed the check in his presence. The payees, however, testified that they never signed the checks, did not authorize anyone to sign the checks on their behalf, and were not members of Lewis\u2019s church. Six of the seven payees testified that they did not know Lewis at all. This testimony indicates that the checks were fraudulently endorsed without the payees\u2019 authority. By possessing the checks and submitting them to banks for negotiation with forged signatures, Lewis both knowingly possessed and used the means of identification of the checks\u2019 payees without lawful authority. <em>See Wilson, </em>788 F.3d at 1310 (\u201cThe use of a person\u2019s name and forged signature sufficiently identifies a specific individual to qualify as a \u2018means of identification\u2019 under the aggravated identity theft statute.\u201d). The Government need not have shown that Lewis himself forged the checks (although circumstantial evidence permitted that inference) or the means by which the payees\u2019 identities were stolen. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A; <em>Wilson, </em>788 F.3d at 1310. Therefore, the evidence permitted the jury to find Lewis guilty of seven counts of aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the Government\u2019s objection to Lewis\u2019s attempt to cross-examine a Government witness regarding the criminal history of a non-witness third party. Both the Government and the district court understood Lewis\u2019s questions to Agent Huebner regarding Brenda Berry\u2019s past conviction as an attempt to impeach the credibility and character of a non-witness for whom Agent Huebner did not vouch. Such evidence would be neither relevant nor permissible. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 401, 404(b). Not until this appeal did Lewis suggest that the questions were instead an effort to impeach the thoroughness of Agent Huebner\u2019s investigation, which Lewis did in numerous other ways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given the manner in which this issue was presented to the district court, we agree that the district court did not abuse its discretion by halting Lewis\u2019s attempted cross-examination of Agent Huebner on the past criminal convictions of a non-witness third party for whom Agent Huebner did not vouch.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Lewis willfully attempted to impede or obstruct the Government\u2019s prosecution of its case against him. At sentencing, a potential trial witness testified that, before trial, Lewis went to her place of work and told her that both she and another potential trial witness needed to change their statements \u201cor else.\u201d The witness testified that Lewis\u2019s demeanor made her feel threatened. After finding the witness\u2019s testimony to be \u201cextremely credible,\u201d the district court accepted her account of the events. We decline to disturb that determination. <em>See Owens v. Wainwright, </em>698 F.2d 1111, 1113 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cAppellate courts reviewing a cold record give particular deference to credibility determinations of a fact-finder who had the opportunity to see live testimony.\u201d). Therefore, the district court did not .err in applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311, 1313 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cA defendant obstructs the administration of justice if he threatens, intimidates, or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>unlawfully influences a witness, directly or indirectly, or attempts to do so.\u201d (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n.4(a))).</p>\n<p id=\"A11y\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-18\">.
