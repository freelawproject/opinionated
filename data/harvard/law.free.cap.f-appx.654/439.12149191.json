(\u201cWantman\u201d) (collectively the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) appeal the dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of their class action complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c), 1964(c). The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was premised on, among other actions, the defendants\u2019 alleged efforts to inundate the town with public records requests in an attempt to cause a violation of Florida\u2019s Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 119.07 (the \u201cAct\u201d), and then to threaten litigation and the possibility of liability for attorneys\u2019 fees to extort an unreasonable settlement. The district court recognized the \u201cvery difficult situation\u201d the plaintiffs allegedly found themselves in, Doc. 47 at 4, but nevertheless .held that the plaintiffs failed to allege at least two predicate acts in support of their RICO claim. After careful review, we agree that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, although troubling, fail to state a claim under RICO. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Gulf Stream is a tiny town of under 1,000 residents and just 17 full time employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants\u2014Martin E. O\u2019Boyle, William F. Ring, Christopher O\u2019Hare, Jonathan R. O\u2019Boyle, Denise De-Martini, and their associated companies\u2014 pummeled the town with nearly 2,000 public records requests, many of them frivolous, with no intention of actually reviewing the results. Examples of such requests included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">\u2022 \u201cAll email addresses created or received by the Town of Gulf Stream,\u201d Compl. Ex. B, Doc. 4-2 at 2 (No. 1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">\u2022 \u201cAll phone numbers in the town\u2019s records,\u201d <em>id. </em>(No.3); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">\u2022 \u201cAny and all records containing a social security number,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10, No. 322.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-15\">These and other bogus requests were \u201can essential first-step\u201d in a \u201cscheme to defraud and extort money from the class members.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 37, Doc. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">The purpose of this onslaught of records requests was to induce a violation of the Act and then threaten a lawsuit, or actually file one, which could entitle the defendants to prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 119.12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is this threat of prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d the plaintiffs alleged, \u201cthat is the nucleus around which the Defendants created their scheme to defraud and extort, and organized their RICO Enterprise to carry out that scheme.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 52, Doc. 1. The defendants then demanded unreasonable settlements and threatened to file more frivolous records requests if the town did not settle the claims. Since 2013, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>fendants have filed 43 public records suits against the town.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In addition, defendant O\u2019Hare employed aliases when making public records requests to avoid incurring a special service charge the town would have otherwise imposed. Florida authorizes the town to condition public records production on the payment of certain costs and expenses, but: only \u201c[i]f the nature or volume of public records requested to be inspected or copied ... is such as to require extensive use of information technology resources or extensive clerical or supervisory assistance by personnel of the agency involved, or both.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 119.07(4)(d). When the town began to assess special service charges against O\u2019Hare for his voluminous requests, he started using fake names to hide his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The defendants also lodged a bogus public records request with Wantman, a government contractor also covered by the Act. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 119.0701.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the defendants did not receive the document requested, they filed suit and promptly demanded nearly $4,000 to settle the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Based on these and similar allegations, the plaintiffs filed a class action complaint on their own behalf and on behalf of other similarly situated state or local municipalities, municipal agencies, or private contractors. They alleged that each defendant committed at least one predicate act of mail fraud, wire fraud, or extortion, constituting a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of RICO, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c), 1964(c). The defendants moved to dismiss arguing, among other points, that neither filing frivolous public records requests nor threatening to file or actually filing a lawsuit is a predicate act under RICO, The district court agreed, granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, and dismissed the case with prejudice. This appeal followed,</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true \u25a0 and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A \u201ccomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A complaint is insufficient if it \u201ctenders naked assertions devoid of fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ther factual enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations marks and citation omitted). To survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">To establish a federal civil RICO violation under \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and 1964(c), the plaintiffs must prove the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and an injury to business or property by reason of the RICO enterprise. <em>See Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., </em>465 F.3d 1277, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2006). The district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claim on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to allege a pattern of racketeering activity. We therefore focus on this element of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">A RICO \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d requires at least two \u201cqualifying predicate acts,\u201d each of which constitutes \u201ca violation of one of the state or federal laws described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1).\u201d <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1087 (11th Cir. 2004). The plaintiffs argue that they have adequately pled two types of predicate acts: (1) extortion under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and (2) mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) (listing violations of the Hobbs Act and the mail and wire fraud statutes). We consider each type of predicate act in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The Hobbs Act prohibits extortion, defined as \u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2). The plaintiffs contend that the defendants\u2019 \u201csystematic use of unjustified lawsuits as part of a more extensive extortion scheme to obtain money\u201d supports a claim of extortion under the Hobbs Act. Appellants\u2019 Br. at 18. Our precedent commands otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">We held in <em>United States v. Pendergraft </em>that a \u201cthreat to file litigation against [the government], even if made in bad faith and supported by false affidavits, [was] not \u2018wrongful\u2019 within the meaning of the Hobbs Act.\u201d 297 F.3d 1198, 1208 (11th Cir. 2002). The issue was whether a threat to add a bogus claim in a federal lawsuit against a county government in an effort to force a large settlement could support a Hobbs Act violation. \u201c[U]nder our system,\u201d we explained, \u201cparties are encouraged to resort to courts for the redress of wrongs and the enforcement of rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1206. Thus, \u201clitigants may be sanctioned for only the most frivolous of actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And even then, such sanctions\u2014through tort actions for malicious prosecution, for example\u2014\u201care heavily disfavored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also expressed confidence in the \u201ctime-tested procedures\u201d of the courts to resolve disputes in litigation by \u201cseparating validity from invalidity, honesty from dishonesty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, citizens have a constitutional right to petition the government for redress under the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 1207. For these reasons, we rejected the contention that a threat to file litigation against the government can trigger Hobbs Act liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1206-1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">We clarified in <em>Raney, </em>a civil RICO case, that <em>Pendergraft </em>applies both to threats of litigation and actual litigation. <em>Raney, </em>370 F.3d at 1088. In <em>Raney, </em>the plaintiff alleged that the defendants filed frivolous lawsuits in an effort to extort money from him. <em>Id. </em>at 1087. We held unequivocally that \u201cthe filing of a lawsuit may not state a claim for extortion under the federal RICO statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The material difference between this case and <em>Pendergraft </em>or <em>Raney </em>is the number of times the defendants allegedly threatened' to file a lawsuit or actually sued in an effort to extort money. Indeed, assuming the allegations in the complaint are true, as we must, the defendants have engaged in a pattern of frivolous litigation activity while abusing, on a grand scale, their statutory right to request public documents from the government. Nonetheless, the same concerns driving our decisions in <em>Pendergraft </em>and <em>Raney </em>are equally present here. Our judicial system, and the Act in particular, encourages citizens to use the courts to resolve public records disputes. Moreover, citizens have a constitutional right to petition the government for redress. We believe that regardless of the scope and scale of the litigation, the courts are amply equipped to deal with frivolous litigation. <em>See, e.g., The Florida Bar v. Committe, </em>916 So.2d 741, 749 (Fla. 2005) (sanctioning an attorney for, among other things, \u201crepeatedly attempting] to relitigate the same non-meritorious issue in an attempt to frustrate the legal process and to harass [an] attorney debt-collector\u201d). Thus, <em>Pender-graft </em>and <em>Raney </em>control, and the alleged misconduct cannot as a matter of law constitute the predicate act of extortion for purposes of the plaintiffs\u2019 civil RICO claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants abused their right to request public records; they argue on appeal that this abuse amounted to a RICO predicate act. As alleged in the complaint, the defendants intentionally set the town up to violate the Act. Whether it was a setup or not, the town may be on the hook for attorneys\u2019 fees if it failed to respond timely to the requests. <em>See Bd. of Trustees, Jacksonville Police &amp; Fire Pension Fund v. Lee, </em>189 So.3d 120, 124-25 (Fla. 2016) (holding that once the court determines that the defendant \u201cunlawfully refused\u201d to permit a public record to be inspected or copied, the court must assess reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, whether or not the defendant acted in good faith (citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7 119.12)); <em>Promenade D\u2019Iberville, LLC v. Sundy, </em>145 So.3d 980, 983 (Fla. 1st DCA 2014) (holding that a delay in producing non-exempt public records for no legally sufficient reason constitutes a violation of the Public Records Act). We nevertheless agree with the district court that the alleged abuse of the Act \u201cmust be addressed in the individual lawsuits filed, or through a change in the laws by the Florida Legislature.\u201d Doc. 47 at 8. RICO and the Hobbs Act in particular do not provide the remedy the plaintiffs seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The plaintiffs next contend that mail and wire fraud constitute the predicate acts necessary to support them RICO claim. Specifically, they argue that O\u2019Hare\u2019s use of aliases to avoid incurring a special service charge when lodging public records requests amounted to fraud. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u201cThe elements of mail and wire fraud are: (1) intentional participation in a scheme to defraud, and, (2) the use of the interstate mails or wires in furtherance of that scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d 1282, 1299 (11th Cir. 2009). \u201cNondisclosure of material information can constitute a violation of the mail and wire fraud statutes where a defendant has a duty to disclose, either by statute or otherwise.\u201d <em>McCulloch v. PNC Bank Inc., </em>298 F.3d 1217, 1225 (11th Cir. 2002); <em>accord Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1065 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that the failure to allege a duty to disclose is fatal to a RICO claim premised on mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>fraud arising out of alleged nondisclosure of material information).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Although the plaintiffs argue that O\u2019Hare\u2019s concealment of his true identity to avoid incurring a special service charge constituted fraud, they alleged no facts to plausibly suggest that O\u2019Hare had any duty to disclose that information. To the contrary, Florida law recognizes a person\u2019s right to request public records anonymously. <em>See Chandler v. City of Greenacres, </em>140 So.3d 1080, 1084-85 (Fla. 4th DCA 2014) (holding that a city cannot require a public records requester to provide identifying information, which \u201ccould have a chilling effect on access to public records and is not required by the Public Records Act\u201d). Accordingly, the plaintiffs failed to allege the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud to support their RICO claim. Because we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 mail and wire fraud allegations fail on this basis,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we do not consider the defendants\u2019 alternative reasons for rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint paint a frustrating picture. Accepting those allegations as true, the defendants have engaged in a concerted effort to capitalize on the relatively unfettered access to public records Florida has granted its citizens by bombarding small towns and municipalities with public records requests to which they cannot respond adequately. As distasteful as this conduct may be, the allegations do not support a RICO claim under our precedent. We therefore affirm the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">.The plaintiffs defined the proposed class to include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">All state or local municipalities, municipal agencies, or private contractors in the State of Florida, who have been served with a public records request by any of the Defendants and who either (a) paid a settlement amount in conjunction with, or to resolve the public records request; or (b) incurred attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to respond to or litigate against public records requests from any of the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Compl. \u00b6 31, Doc. 1.
