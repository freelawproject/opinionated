He challenges the sentencing court\u2019s conclusions as to the quantity of drugs that he was accountable for and asserts that the district court erred when it determined that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir. 2008). Once it is established that \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 n.8 (11th Cir. 2013). The district court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making its determination. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-20\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must first recalculate the guidelines range under the amended guidelines. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir. 2000). If the defendant is eligible for a sentencing reduction, the district court has discretion to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. In doing so, the district court should first consider the statutory factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)) (providing that the court \u201cshall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d in determining whether the reduction is warranted and the extent of the reduction). Although the district court must undertake this two-step analysis, the district court retains its discretion not to reduce the sentence. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-21\">The district court\u2019s denial of Fernandez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was within its discretion because it considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determined that Fernandez\u2019s sentence was necessary to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and serve as a deterrent. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>affirm the denial of Fernandez\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
