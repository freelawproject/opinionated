Obviously they would not, for these words would aptly describe applicant\u2019s product, which is cane molasses or cane syrup. We have1, repeatedly said that the law prohibiting such registrations could not be avoided by merely resorting to phonetic spelling. The mark \u201cKanelasscs\u201d conveys, and obviously was intended to convey, to the purchasing public definite information as to the character of the product sold under it. Certainly any producer of cane molasses would be entitled to sell it under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">It follows, therefore, that the Patent Office properly refused registration to this applicant. The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
