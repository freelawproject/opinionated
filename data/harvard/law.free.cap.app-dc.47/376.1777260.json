The vEolian company opposed the registration, and asserted that in 1900 it registered the word \u201cOrehestrelle\u201d as a trademark; that the goods for which the Thomas company ivas seeking to register \u201cOrchestrola\u201d \u2014 phonographs or talking machines \u2014 were of the same descriptive properties, and were comprised in the same general class of merchandise as the goods upon which it had used its registered trademark; and that the use of the word proposed by the Thomas company would lead to confusion. The parties \u00a1stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>lafed that the Niolian company had made and sold organs and playing1 mechanisms therefor since prior to 1894; pianos and playing mechanisms therefor since prior to 1895; and phonographs since 1914; also that it had applied the trademark \u201cOrchestrelle\u201d to \u201corgans comprising means for manual operation as well as automatic operation through perforated music sheets, and has applied the same trademark * * * to said music sheets;\u201d and that those instruments \u201cbearing its trademark have been widely and largely advertised and sold\u201d throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Would the use of \u201cOrchestrola\u201d by the Thomas company, in the language of the statute, \u201cbo likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, or deceive purchasers?\u201d (34 Stat. at L. 1251, chap. 2573, 37 Stat. at L. G49, chap. 7, Comp. Stat. 1916, \u00a7 9490.) If so, it should not be registered. This court, has frequently held that, because the field of selection is so very wide, practically unlimited, there is no good reason why a person should be permitted to select a trademark similar to one already in use by another engaged in a business of the same general nature, where the likely effect would be to lead to confusion concerning the goods themselves or their origin. <em>(Wayne County Preserving Co. </em>v. <em>Burt Olney Canning Co. </em>32 App. D. C. 279; <em>Ph\u0153nix Paint </em>&amp; <em>Varnish Co. </em>v. <em>John T. Lewis &amp; Bros. Co. </em>32 App. D. C. 285; <em>Kaut-Reith Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>International Shoe Co. </em>45 App. D. C. 545; <em>Goodrich Drug Co. </em>v. <em>Cassada Mfg. Co. </em>46 App. D. C. 146.) In the <em>Goodrich Case </em>it was held that \u201cVelvetina\u201d applied to the same character of goods as \u201cVelvelite\u201d would be likely to cause perplexity in trade, and therefore was not registerable. Assume that a person who had a good opinion derived from use or otherwise of an automatically operated organ produced by the iEolian Company and marked \u201cOrchestrelle\u201d desires to purchase a phonograph (the rEolian Company, as we have seen, now produces phonographs), and is shown one marked \u201cOrchestrola,\u201d would he not be likely to think it was produced by the same company as produced the organ and buy it on that account ? Perhaps if the two instruments were placed side by side, one marked \u201cOrchestrelle\u201d and the other \u201cOrchestrola,\u201d he would be able to detect the difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>between the marks; but where they wore not so placed and ho was compelled to rely upon Ins memory only, unless he possessed one remarkably accurate in its impressions, \u2014 the law considers the ordinary, not the extraordinary, in eases like this, \u2014 wo believe lie would not distinguish the one from the other. To be. sure, they have, points of differences, but tbe points of resemblance dominate and give character to the terms. <em>(Swift </em>v. <em>Dey, </em>4 Robt. 611; <em>Florence Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>101 C. C. A. 565, 178 Fed. 73.) Merely \u201carguable differences\u201d are not enough to save from condemnation the encroaching mark. <em>(Paris Medicine Co. </em>v. W. <em>H. Hill Co. </em>42 C. C. A. 227, 102 Fed. 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We entirely agree with the Assistant Commissioner that the two words are \u201cconfusingly similar,\u201d and would be likely to mislead not only as to the goods themselves, bnt also as to their source of manufacture, and henee his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>A \u00a1firmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
