The suffix \u2018ette\u2019 is very commonly and widely used to indicate a small edition or else an imitation. I think nobody would hesitate in assuming that a leghornette hat was an imitation leghorn hat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">We agree with the Assistant Commissioner, for in our view \u201cleghornette\u201d clearly would convey to the average purchaser the idea of the character or quality of the hat to which it was affixed, and therefore should not be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">The decision is affirmed. <em>Affirmed,.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
