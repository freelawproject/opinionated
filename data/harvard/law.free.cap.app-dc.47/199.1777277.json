Its mark is a mark for rubber goods. The very fact that for over thirty years the mark has been used on rubber goods would argue against its association with leather shoes, which are an entirely different class of goods, made by totally different processes. The testimony as to use of the mark in -1910 on tennis shoes is not material merely because these shoes had leather insoles. The testimony that the mark was used on lumbermen\u2019s rubber shoes with leather tops not only fails t\u00f3 state a date, but would not he material if it did; for such shoes are not leather shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The error into which the Patent Office has fallen is in a rigid adherence to the separate classification of rubber and leather goods. The particular subject-matter of this interference is whether or not the marks of the contending parties are so similar as to create confusion in trade when used on footwear generally or on particular grades of footwear. The use of leather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and. rubber, and partly leather and partly rubber, footwear is so general and so interrelated in use by the public that the purchaser should not be called upon to discriminate between the goods put out by one of two users of the same mark. The marks in question are the same, and we are disposed to hold that they are used upon goods of the same descriptive qualities within the provisions of the trademark law. That their use would be likely to lead to confusion in trade, we have no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The prior registration and use of the Boston company\u2019s mark on particular kinds of footwear would entitle it to extend its use to other kinds of goods within tlie same particular classification, and give it sufficient standing to contest the right of Abramowitz to registration. Tt is unnecessary for us to consider the question of the right of the Boston company to have its mark registered for \u201cboots and shoes having canvas uppers and leather and rubber soles,\u201d since its prior use on particular kinds of footwear is sufficient to forbid the registration of the Abramowitz mark for footwear generally or for particular grade's thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The field of selection of an arbitrary mark is sufficiently broad to enable' Abramowitz to select a mark which will have no tendency 1o conflict with the mark of the Boston company. To impose this duty is only consonant with a due regard for the restrictions which the law has placed upon the selection of trademarks sought to be registered. Public security is the first consideration, and the courts should diligently seek to construe the law to that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">We are of opinion that Abramowitz is not entitled to have his mark registered. The question of the right of the Boston Hubber Shoe Company to have its mark registered is left open for the further consideration of the Commissi oner of Patents in the light of this opinion. With this qualification, the decision of the Commissioner is reversed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>lie versed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
