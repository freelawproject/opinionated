Opposition to the registration was interposed by the Lambert Pharmaeal Company, a Missouri corporation, on the ground that it is the owner of a registered trademark consisting of the word. \u201cListerine,\u201d which it has used as a trademark for tooth powder since 1881, and \u201cthat there is such a similarity'between the words \u2018Listerine\u2019 and \u2018Mentho-Listine\u2019 that it is calculated to confuse the ordinary purchaser.\u201d' From an order of the Commissioner of Patents dismissing the opposition and adjudging applicant\u2019s mark entitled to registration, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">It is agreed that the goods on which the marks are used are the same, and that the only question before the court is whether the marks are so similar as to be liable to create confusion in trade. Passing over the possible nonregisterability of the mark because it is the name of the applicant company, we will dispose of the case on the single question of the deceptive similarity of the marks. The case is ruled by <em>Re Barrett Mfg. Co. </em>37 App. D. C. 111, where the word \u201cCreo-Carbolin\u201d was held to Ixo deceptively similar to the word \u201cOarbolineuni.\u201d It was there held that the prefix \u201cCreo\u201d did not render the marks dissimilar, and the same is here true of the prefix \u201cMentho.\u201d Besides, there would be nothing to control the manner in which the prefix might be printed so as to give especial prominence to the word \u201cListine.\u201d Where there is doubt it should be resolved in favor of the protection of the public. As was'said in the case of <em>Lambert Pharmacal Co. </em>v. <em>Bolton Chemical Corp. </em>219 Fed. 325, where the court was considering whether the trademark \u201cListonen\u201d was deceptively similar to \u201cListerine:\u201d \u201cOf course, the burden of proof always rests upon the moving party, but having shown the adoption of a similar tradename, arbitrary in character, I cannot sec why speculation as to the chance that it will cause confusion should be at the expense of the man first in the field. He has a right to insist that others in making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>up their arbitrary names', should so certainly keep away from his customers as to raise no question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
