That all licenses hereafter granted by this State, and by all parishes and municipalities therein, to persons engaged in business, or keeping places of public resort, shall contain the express condition, that the place of business or public resort shall be open to the accommodation and patronage of all persons, without distinction or discrimination on account of race or color; and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>person who shall violate the condition of such license shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by forfeiture of his license, and his place of business or public resort shall be closed, and, moreover, [he] shall be liable at the suit of the person aggrieved to such damages as he shall sustain thereby, before any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\">\u2022On the 27 th February, 1871, another act was passed, entitled \u201c An Act to regulate the mode of trying cases arising under the provisions of article thirteen (13) of the Constitution of Louisiana, or under any acts of the legislature to enforce the said article thirteen of the said Constitution, and to regulate the licenses therein mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">Sects. 1 and 2 of this act are as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">\u201c Section 1. <em>He it enacted by the Senate and Souse of Representatives of the State of Louisiana in general assembly </em>convened, That all cases brought for the purpose of vindicating, asserting, or maintaining the rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed to all persons under the provisions of the article thirteen of the Constitution of Louisiana, or under the provisions of any acts of the legislature to enforce the said article thirteen, and to regulate the licenses therein mentioned, or for the purpose of recovering damages for the violation of said rights, privileges, and immunities, shall be tried by the court, or by a jury if any party to the suit prays for a trial by jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">\u201c Sect. 2. <em>He it further enacted, Sc., </em>That if the jury do not agree, or fail to render a verdict, either for the plaintiff or defendant, the jury shall be discharged, and the case shall be immediately submitted to the judge upon the pleadings and evidence already on file, as if the case had been originally tried without the intervention of a jury; and it shall be the duty of the judge to decide the case at once, without any further proceedings, arguments, continuance, or delay; each party having the right to appeal to the Supreme Court in all cases where an appeal is allowed by law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">Walker in his answer denied all the allegations in the petition, and prayed for a trial by jury. The cause was thereupon tried by a jury, who failed to agree. This having been entered upon the minutes, Sauvinet, by his counsel, moved that the court proceed to decide the case under the provisions of sect. 2 of the act of 1871. To this Walker objected, alleging for cause that the act was unconstitutional, but without specifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>in what particular. Time was given counsel to file briefs upon the constitutional question; and at a later day, after consideration, a judgment was rendered against Walker for $1,000. That judgment was affirmed upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the State: whereupon Walker sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-5\"><em>Mr. C. W. Hornor </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">The act of the legislature of Louisiana of Feb. 27, 1871, under which the proceedings in this case were had, abridges the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and is, therefore, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. <em>Slaughter-House </em>Cases, 16 Wall. 72 <em>et seq.; Bartemeyer </em>v. Iowa, 18 id. 129.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-7\"><em>Mr. J. Q. A. </em>Fellows, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Axq\">Mr. Chief Justice Waite,</author>\n<p id=\"ACj\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">So far as we can discover from the record, the only Federal question decided by either one of the courts below was that which related to the right of Walker to demand a trial by jury, notwithstanding the provisions of the act of 1871 to the contrary. He insisted that he had a constitutional right to such a trial, and that the statute was void to the extent that it deprived him of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"AuZ\">All questions arising under the Constitution of the State alone are finally settled by the judgment below. We can consider only such as grow out of the Constitution of the United States. By art. 7 of the amendments, it is provided, that \u201c in suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.\u201d This, as has been many times decided, relates only to trials in the courts of the United States. <em>Edwards </em>v. Elliot, 21 Wall. 557. The States, so far as this amendment is concerned, are left to regulate trials in their own courts in their own way. A trial by jury in suits at common law pending in the State courts is not, therefore, a privilege or immunity of national citizenship, which the States are forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment to abridge. A State cannot deprive a person of his property without due process of law; but this does not necessarily imply that all trials in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>State courts affecting the property of persons must be by jury. This requirement of the Constitution is met if the trial is had according to the settled course of judicial proceedings. <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken L. &amp; I. Co., </em>18 How. 280. Due process of law is process due according to the law of the land. This process in the States is regulated by the law of the State. Our power OYer that law is only to determine whether it is in conflict with the supreme law of the land, \u2014 that is to say, with the Constitution and laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, \u2014 or with any treaty made under the authority of the United States. Art. 6 Const. Here the State court has decided that the proceeding below was in accordance with the law of the State; and we do not find that to be contrary to the Constitution, or any law or treaty of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">The other questions presented by the assignment of errors and argued here cannot be considered, as the record does not show that they were brought to the attention of either of the courts below. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b117-4\">Mr. Justice Field and Mr. Justice Clifford dissented from the opinion and judgment of the court.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
