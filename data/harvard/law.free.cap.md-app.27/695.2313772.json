(Baltimore) agreed to perform certain clearing, excavation and grading work on property owned by the appellees, Valley Mall Associates, et al. (Valley Mall) in Washington County consisting of approximately 70 acres. The property is surrounded by three highways, the grading of two of which (Nursery and Massey Boulevards) was included in the work to be performed by Baltimore. The contract provided for a lump sum payment of $475,000 for all work to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">On May 4, 1972, Baltimore entered into a contract with Frank M. Sheesley Co. (Sheesley), apparently to perform the same work it had agreed to do for Valley Mall. There is no privity of contract between Sheesley and Valley Mall, Sheesley\u2019s status being that of a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">On February 4, 1974, Baltimore filed a mechanics\u2019 lien against the property. On February 8, 1974, Valley Mall filed in the Circuit Court for Washington County, pursuant to Article 21, \u00a79-106 of the Maryland Code (1973 Repl. Vol.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) and Maryland Rule BG75, a \u201cPetition to Compel Defendant to Prove Validity of Mechanics\u2019 Lien and For Declaratory Judgment\u201d. The petition contains two counts. Count I recited, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">\u201c4. On or about February 7, 1974, defendant filed a mechanics\u2019 lien upon certain property owned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>plaintiffs in Washington County and known generally as Valley Mall Shopping Center. Said mechanics\u2019 lien is filed in Mechanics\u2019 lien Liber 7, folio 75, maintained among the mechanics\u2019 lien records of Washington County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">5. Plaintiffs deny the validity of the aforesaid mechanics\u2019 lien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Count II of the petition concerns itself only with the merits of Baltimore\u2019s claim against it. It does not mention the mechanics\u2019 lien. It identified Baltimore\u2019s claim in two parts: 1) a claim for $425,922.05 \u201cfor allegedly extra grading and excavating costs arising out of the removal of rock found on the subject land, together with overhead, profit and interest\u201d, and 2) a claim for $91,361.00 as \u201cbalance due and owing under the prime contract, plus interest\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The petition admits Valley Mall\u2019s liability for a portion of the $91,361.00 claim and denies all liability for the $425,922.05, alleging \u201cthe contract was for a fixed price and plaintiffs did not agree to any change in amount for any additional grading and excavating by change order or other-wise\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">In their prayer for relief Valley Mall, in addition to asking that the defendant be compelled to prove the validity of the mechanics\u2019 lien or have it declared void, sought a declaratory decree holding: a) that Valley Mall is not liable for Baltimore\u2019s claim for extra grading and excavating costs; and b) that Valley Mall is liable only for such portion of Baltimore\u2019s claim of \u201cbalance due and owing under the prime contract\u201d as may be proved at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">On April, 5, 1974, Baltimore filed its Answer to the Petition stating it \u201cdoes hereby intend that this proceeding, rather than duplicate proceedings, shall be considered also as [Baltimore\u2019s] bringing of a proceeding in equity to enforce its lien in fulfillment of the Annotated Code of Maryland\u2019s \u00a7 9-106.\u201d The Answer asserts the validity of its mechanics\u2019 lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">With respect to Count II the Answer recites that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Baltimore\u2019s claim for $425,922.05 is being litigated in a suit \u201cfiled in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland for [by] Frank M. Sheesley Company vs the Petitioner [Valley Mall] and Baltimore Contractors, Inc.\u201d and prayed a continuance of the instant proceedings until final determination of the federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">On July 2, 1974, Valley Mall filed a motion for summary judgment citing as a basis therefor \u201cth\u00e1t the lien at issue fails to meet the requirements of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, Maryland Code, Art. 21, \u00a7 9-101 et seq., and therefore, should be dismissed\u201d. A hearing was held on the motion on January 9, 1975, and on January 28, 1975, the trial court filed an order, accompanied by its Memorandum Opinion, declaring the mechanics\u2019 lien \u201cto be invalid and void and of no effect whatsoever\u201d. On January 29, 1975, Baltimore filed its appeal from that order to this Court. Thirteen minutes later on the same date the trial court filed a supplemental order denying Baltimore\u2019s previously filed motions for a continuance and leave to amend the mechanics\u2019 lien. Baltimore has also appealed from the supplemental order.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We conclude that the appeals must be dismissed as premature because of the provisions of Md. Rule 605 a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">So far as the record reveals Count II of Valley Mali\u2019s Petition is still pending before the Circuit Court for Washington County. The basis for the motion for summary judgment and the trial court\u2019s ruling thereon dealt only with whether or not Baltimore\u2019s mechanics\u2019 lien met the technical requirements of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of Maryland and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>in no way disposed of or attempted to dispose of any of the issues presented by Count II. Those issues deal with the extent to which Valley Mall is <em>liable </em>to Baltimore, not with Baltimore\u2019s <em>security </em>for that liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">As we see it, Valley Mall has presented in one action two distinct claims for relief which permit results that are not mutually exclusive. <em>See Diener Enterprises v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 556 (1972). The essence of the first claim (Count I) is that Baltimore\u2019s mechanics\u2019 lien is invalid and affords Baltimore no security for payment of <em>any </em>of its claims against Valley Mall. In its second claim for relief (Count II) Valley Mall seeks a declaration that, aside from the validity <em>vel 7io7i </em>of the mechanics\u2019 lien, it is not liable for the major portion of Baltimore\u2019s claim. Count I was decided by the trial court by its summary judgment order of January 28, 1975, declaring the mechanics\u2019 lien invalid; Count II is still unadjudicated. Under such circumstances, prerequisites to the immediate appealability of that order are that the trial judge make \u201can express determination that there is no just reason for delay\u201d and that he expressly direct the entry of a final judgment as to Count I. Md. Rule 605a. As we said in <em>Leach v. Citizens Bank of Md., </em>17 Md. App. <em>391 </em>(1973), quoting from <em>Tedrow v. Ford, </em>260 Md. 142, 144 (1970), at 397:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201c\u2018Judge Miller\u2019s order for summary judgment contained neither an expressed determination that there was no just reason for delay nor an expressed direction for the entry of final judgment for costs against Tedrow. <em>The absence alone of these explicit, directions by the trial court prevents the taking of a7i appeal at this time.\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis Supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-6\"><em>See also Blocker v. Harlow, </em>268 Md. 571 (1973), at 578 where the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201cUnder Rule 605 a, as we have previously indicated citing <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v: Mackey, </em>351 U. S. 427, the trial judge is expected to be the \u2018dispatcher\u2019 and \u2018to determine, in the first instance, the appropriate time when each \u2018final decision\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>upon \u2018one or more but less than all\u2019 of the claims in a multiple claims action is ready for appeal.\u2019 (Emphasis that of Mr. Justice Burton in <em>Sears.) </em>No such determination was made here. The order appealed from was not a final order nor does it fall within the category of interlocutory orders from which an appeal may be maintained. Therefore, the appeal must be dismissed. <em>Lang v. Catterton </em>and <em>Harlow v. Blocher, </em>both <em>swpra. It is elementary that parties may not confer appellate jurisdiction by consent upon this Court or the Court of Special Appeals. </em>\u201d (Emphasis Supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">As the issue of prematureness of the appeal was not raised by any of the parties, we must, <em>sua sponte, </em>recognize our lack of jurisdiction arising from the failure to comply with Rule 605 a and dismiss the appeal. <em>Diener Enterprises v. Miller, </em>supra, and <em>Greyhound Lines v. Alderson, </em>23 Md. App. 224 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">While we must dismiss the appeal as premature, we think it desirable to comment \u201cfor the guidance of the lower court\u201d upon the posture of this case upon remand and, hopefully, \u201cto avoid the expense and delay of another appeal to this Court\u201d. Md. Rule 1085. The last sentence of Rule 605 a makes it clear that in the posture of the case the summary judgment order of January 28, 1975, \u201cis subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims\u201d. As mentioned earlier herein, Baltimore had filed a \u201cMotion for Leave of Court to Amend Mechanics\u2019 Lien\u201d before the summary judgment order of January 28,1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In his \u201cSupplemental Order\u201d of January 29, 1975, the trial judge stated that he \u201cdid not give serious consideration to the request to amend because the Court is of the opinion that there is no way the claimant can amend this Mechanics\u2019 Lien to make it valid\u201d. For reasons already stated the merits of the case are not properly before us. We therefore express no opinion on the validity or invalidity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien in question; nor do we venture to say whether, if presently invalid, it can be cured by amendment. We think, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>however, that the trial judge should not have foreclosed Baltimore\u2019s attempt to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Present Rule 320 c 1, adopted July 1, 1974, provides that \u201cIn any case tried before the court without a jury, any amendment may be made at any time <em>before a final judgment </em>or decree is entered\u201d. (Emphasis supplied) Thus, since there is no final judgment in the case and since the summary judgment is \u201csubject to revision\u201d there would seem to be no impediment to Baltimore\u2019s offering amendments when the case is remanded for further proceedings. Rule 320 d 5 provides that, \u201cAmendments shall be freely permitted in order to promote justice\u201d. Rule BG72 provides that pleadings in an action to enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien may be amended pursuant to Rule 320. In the instant case, since the time within which the lien was required to be recorded has expired, any amendments offered may not increase the amount of the lien nor \u201cmaterially alter the description of the property against which the lien claim was recorded\u201d. Rule BG72.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Real Property Article, \u00a7 9-110, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cThis Law is remedial and shall be construed to give effect to its purpose. Any amendment shall be made in the proceedings, commencing with the claim or lien to be filed and extending to all subsequent proceedings, as may be necessary and proper. However, the amount of the claim or lien filed may not be enlarged by amendment\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Subject to the limitations contained in the above-quoted statute and applicable Rules, it is \u201cdifficult to imagine any more extensive power of amendment\u201d than that allowed in proceedings concerning mechanics\u2019 liens. <em>See Real Estate Co. v. Phillips, </em>90 Md. 515 (1900) at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Under the circumstances, upon remand we think the trial judge should strike out the summary judgment order of January 28, 1975 and allow Baltimore a reasonable time to amend pursuant to Rule 320. After due consideration of any objections that may be made by Valley Mall to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>amendments, the court should then permit Valley Mall to renew its motion for summary judgment if it desires to do so. If the court is still of the opinion that the motion should be granted, the order granting the motion will be appealable if there has been compliance with Rule 605 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\n<em>Appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-11\">.

In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
