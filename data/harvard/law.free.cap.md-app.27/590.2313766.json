Such was the status of the Administration at the time that \u00a7 \u00a7 538 through 546<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of Article 48A were added to the Annotated Code of Maryland by the passage of Chapter 73 of the Acts of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The contention of appellants basically is that the interaction of Article 48A, \u00a7 539 with Article 66V2, \u00a7 7-101<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> combined to subject the Administration and its insurer to an obligation to assure the payment of \u201cno fault\u201d claims thereby authorized. They argue that the provisions of Article 66V2, \u00a7 7-101 that every <em>owner </em>of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this State shall maintain required security and that every <em>person </em>must comply with \u00a7 539 of Article 48A, must be interpreted as requiring the Administration and its insurer to be bound by their respective obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Appellees counter with the alternative contentions: (a) that the Administration is a State agency whose sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>immunity protects it from suit and (b) that the Legislature did not intend the Administration to be within the purview of Chapter 73 of the Acts of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">There is a surface plausibility in appellants\u2019 contention but it does not survive careful analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Appellants brush aside the suggested defense of the State\u2019s immunity to suit upon the ground that such immunity was waived by statute in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">(1) Article 64B, \u00a7 8 a declares that the Administration shall: \u201cHave perpetual succession, and sue and be sued in its own name and plead and be impleaded\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">(2) Article 64B, \u00a7 49 declares that the Administration \u201cshall be liable for its contracts and for its torts * * * in connection with the performance of the duties and functions imposed in this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">We do not, however, see this case as one turning upon a question of immunity to suit and do not reach the issue. Instead, we conclude that the provisions of Article 48A, \u00a7 \u00a7 538 through 546, and Article 66V2, \u00a7\u00a7 7-101, 7-102 do not apply at all to the Administration. Subtitle 1 of Article 66V2 furnishes the definitional portion of that article. In \u00a7 1-157 \u201cowner\u201d is defined as \u201ca person having the property in or title to a vehicle.\u201d Section 1-160 defines a \u201cperson\u201d as \u201cevery natural person, firm, copartnership, association, or corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The State and St\u00e1te agencies generally are regarded as not included in statutes using such words as \u201cnatural person, firm, copartnership, association, or corporation.\u201d <em>State v. Rich, </em>126 Md. 643, 649, 95 A. 956, 958; <em>Mayor and City Council v. Baltimore Gas Co., </em>232 Md. 123, 135, 192 A. 2d 87, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">We recognize, of course, that the State or its agencies may fall within the purview of such statutes \u201cwhere such an intention is manifest.\u201d <em>Huffman v. State Roads Commission, </em>152 Md. 566, 584, 137 A. 358, 365. We do not, however, regard the subject case as falling within such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The statute by which \u00a7\u00a7 538 through 546 were added to Article 48A was of considerable complexity. Incident to purposes to be accomplished by those sections, the statute provided for the specific repeal and reenactment of sections or subsections of Article 26; of Article 48A; of Article 66V2 and of Article 81. Yet the statute made no reference to Article 64B. We are persuaded that this circumstance strongly indicates that the statute was not intended to affect that article or to subject the Administration or its insurer to the obligations imposed by Article 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 538-546 or by Article 66V2, \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 and 7-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Particularly significant, we think, is the circumstance that the statute did not address itself to Article 64B, \u00a7 44 that reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201c\u00a7 44. <em>Insurance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">(a) <em>Coverage; form; amount. </em>\u2014 The Authority shall self insure or procure and maintain insurance against loss or damage to any of its properties and against liability for injury to persons or property. The Board may also purchase insurance against loss of revenue from any cause whatsoever. <em>Such insurance coverage shall be in such form and amount as the board may determine, subject to the requirements of any agreement </em>arising out of issuance of bonds or other obligations by the Authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">It is instantly apparent that the Legislature left to the discretion of the Administration the decision (a) whether to carry insurance or to provide self insurance as to its own liability for negligence, and (b) to fix the form and amount of any insurance coverage it might elect to carry, subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>only to the requirements of any agreement arising out of the issuance of its bonds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Legislature made two policy declarations in conjunction with its broad grant of power to the Administration. By \u00a7 1 of Article 64B it was declared that, \u201cThe development of improved and expanded transit facilities * * * is essential for the satisfactory movement of people and goods, the alleviation of present and future traffic congestion, the economic welfare and vitality and the development of the metropolitan area of Baltimore * * By \u00a7 12 of that article it was declared that, \u201call costs incurred in constructing, acquiring, operating and maintaining the regional transit facilities shall be borne, as far as practicable, by fares charged for . the service performed by the transit facilities owned or controlled by the [Administration] * *</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Imposition upon the Administration of the additional costs inherent in the provisions of Article 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 538 through 546 well might affect adversely its capacity to carry out the legislative policies for which it was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In <em>Bowie v. Wash. Sub. San. Comm., </em>249 Md. 611, 618, 241 A.2d 396, 400, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that repeals not express will not be found unless demanded by irreconcilability or repugnancy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">See also <em>Loker v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 1, 9, 233 A. 2d 342, 348, affirmed 250 Md. 677, 245 A. 2d 814, cert. denied 393 U. S. 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">There is no such inconsistency between \u00a7\u00a7 538 through 546 of Article 48A on the one hand and the provisions of Article 64B on the other as to make their separate existence so repugnant that they cannot stand together. We decide, accordingly, that passage of Chapter 73 of the Acts of 1972 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>did not directly nor by implication repeal any section of Article 64B. The granted discretion to the Administration as to the form and amount of insurance to be carried by it remains undisturbed by its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In the exercise of that discretion the Administration initially chose insurance coverage in a form that quite naturally did not provide the benefits such as were required to be incorporated in policies issued to other owners by the subsequent legislation. Passage of that later legislation did not remove or alter that discretion. The insurer, accordingly, is bound only to the contractual undertaking in the form prescribed by the Administration in the exercise of its discretion, and is unaffected by the passage of Chapter 73 of the Acts of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Appellants\u2019 suggestion that recognition of the co-existence of the statutory provisions \u201cwould exempt [the Administration] from registering vehicles [or] obeying the rules of the road * * *\u201d is without merit. Section 3-402 of Article 66V2 does not exempt State vehicles from registration but exemption from the payment of registration fees is provided by \u00a7 3-829. The Administration specifically is made liable for the negligence of its employees. Article 64B, \u00a7 49. A violation of a rule of the road that is the proximate cause of injury is negligence. <em>Sun Cab Co. v. Walston, </em>15 Md. App. 113, 289 A. 2d 804; affirmed 267 Md. 559, 298 A. 2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Appellants\u2019 contention that legislative exclusion of the Administration and its insurer from the obligations imposed by Article 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 538-546 and Article 66V2, \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 and 7-102 would render such sections unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the law also is without merit. In <em>Allied American Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Motor Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 623, 150 A. 2d 421, 431, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201cThe constitutional need for equal protection does not shackle the legislature. It has the widest discretion in classifying those who are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>regulated and taxed. Only if the grouping is without any reasonable basis, and so entirely arbitrary, is it forbidden. Abstract symmetry or mathematical nicety are not requisites. The selection need not depend on scientific or marked differences in things or persons or their relations. If any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain a classification, the existence of that state of facts as a basis for the passage of the law must be assumed. The burden is on him who assails a classification to show that it does not rest on any reasonable basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The legislative aims in the creation of a transit authority on the one hand and initiation of \u201cno fault\u201d insurance on the other are not identical. In the former, the legislation was directed to supplying adequate public transit facilities to all members of the public benefiting from such services. In the latter it was directed to providing benefits to a more limited segment of the public. The classes sought to be benefited were in no sense identical. The Legislature, with reason, could have concluded that the problems it alleviated in the area of public transit would re-emerge if the Authority was included in the \u201cno fault\u201d obligations imposed by the later statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In <em>Allied American Co., supra, </em>it was said at 624 [432]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\u201cIf the classification made by the Legislature is otherwise justified, there can be no sound complaint that the legislative purpose might be better or more fully achieved by other or more expansive and inclusive classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Moreover, we note in passing that \u00a7 542 of Article 48A provides that, \u201cNothing in this subtitle shall be deemed to affect the right of any person to claim and sue for damages or losses sustained by him as the result of a motor vehicle accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Because the briefs and arguments of the named litigants addressed only the substantive merits of the litigation and in view of our decision on the merits, we do not reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>question whether a class action would be a proper vehicle for resolution of the supposed rights of multiple unnamed members of a class under the circumstances here existing. But see this Court\u2019s consolidated cases of <em>Johnson v. Chrysler Credit Corp. </em>and <em>Forcella v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>Nos. 789 and 790, September Term, 1974, filed May 6, 1975.
