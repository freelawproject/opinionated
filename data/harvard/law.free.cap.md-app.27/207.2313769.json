Spiller, Morton Richard Kimmel, Fred S. London </em>and <em>Kimmel, Spiller &amp; Bradley </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-9\"><em>Bernard A. Raum, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Richard R. Cooper, State\u2019s Attorney for Kent County, </em>and <em>Basil Wadkovsky, Deputy State\u2019s Attorney for Kent County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b226-10\">Morton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASv\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Davidson, J., dissents and filed a dissenting opinion at page 218 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The appellant, Philippe Andre Sinclair, was convicted by a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Caroline County (Wise, J., presiding) on five separate charges (contained in an information) of violating the so-called Worthless Check Act, Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 142. A sentence of five years, with three years suspended, was imposed on the first conviction (count 3 of the information) and identical concurrent sentences were imposed on the remaining four convictions (counts 7, 11, 15 and 19 of the information). The case had been removed from the Circuit Court for Kent County.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">In this appeal appellant raises a number of issues, in the first of which he contends that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding of guilt under Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">It appears from the record that the appellant was president of Sinwellan Corporation which operated a resort known as The Great Oak Lodge near Chestertown in Kent County, Maryland. On five separate occasions between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>July 13, 1973, and August 31, 1973, checks signed by the appellant, drawn on several banks in varying amounts totaling over $10,000, made payable to Fulton Meat Packing Company (Fulton), were delivered to that company in payment for meats sold and delivered to The Great Oak Lodge. Each of the five checks was presented to the appropriate bank by Fulton and each was returned with the notation \u201cInsufficient Funds\u201d and the further notation on several of the checks, \u201cCheck presented twice, please do not present again.\u201d There was evidence that at the time of the trial below the checks still had not been honored or payment made to Fulton in lieu of the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In contending that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the convictions, it is particularly contended that there was no evidence to show that appellant intended to cheat and defraud Fulton or that he signed the dishonored checks; that there was no \u201cevidence that proved insufficient funds\u201d; and that there was a failure to prove delivery of the meats.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 142, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201cEvery person who, with intent to cheat and defraud another, shall obtain money, credit, goods * * * or anything of value * * * by means of a check, draft or any other negotiable instrument of any kind drawn, whether by such person or by any other person, persons, firm or corporation, upon any bank * * * and the same be not paid upon presentation, shall be deemed to have obtained such money, credit, goods, services * * * or things of value by means of a false pretense. * * * The giving of the aforesaid worthless check, draft or negotiable instrument * * * shall be prima facie evidence of intent to cheat or defraud; provided that if such person shall be a bona fide resident of the State of Maryland and shall deposit with the drawee of such paper * * * within ten days thereafter funds sufficient to meet the same, with all costs and interest which may have accrued he shall not be prosecuted under this section, and no prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>either by presentment, indictment or otherwise, shall be instituted or commenced until after the expiration of said period of ten days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We cannot quarrel with appellant\u2019s statement that under the statute, the \u201cState mus; show that there was a representation of an existing fact made with intent to defraud, and that the operation: of such representation as a deception induced a transfer and the obtaining of the money or property by the person committing the fraud to the loss of another.\u201d <em>See League v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 681. We cannot agree, however, that the State failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The credit manager of Fulton (whose principal place of business was in Massachusetts) testified that Fulton agreed to deliver meats to The Great Oak Lodge upon order of the chef and that the shipments were to be made by common carrier (motor freight) on a C.O.D. basis. The driver of the truck was specifically instructed not to deliver the meats until he had received payment, either by check or in cash. He further testified that each of the five checks was given to Fulton for meats \u201csold and delivered\u201d to The Great Oak Lodge. According to the manager, on several occasions when the checks were returned unpaid, he talked with appellant who advised him \u201credeposit them and they are all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">We think it perfectly clear, therefore, that Fulton was induced to part with its property in reliance upon the representation of appellant (which turned out to be a misrepresentation) that the checks were good. The statute provides that the giving of a worthless check \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of intent to cheat; or defraud.\u201d The appellant not only failed to rebut the presumption by \u201cmaking good\u201d the checks within the ten days provided for in the statute, but the record indicates that the checks were still unpaid at the time of the trial below. Thus, rather than rebutting the statutory presumption, the appellant\u2019s course of action would appear to have confirmed his intention to cheat and defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">We find no merit in the contention that there was no proof of the delivery of the meats. There was the evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>truck driver was not to make delivery until he had received a check in payment therefor and Fulton had five checks in its possession which the manager stated ostensibly represented payment for the delivered meats. There was testimony from eyewitnesses to the delivery of the meats on several occasions. Finally, there was the testimony of the appellant himself who told the credit manager of Fulton to \u201credeposit the checks,\u201d a statement he would hardly have made in the absence of the delivery of the meats.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">With respect to proof of appellant\u2019s signature, it is highly unlikely that appellant would advise the credit manager to redeposit the checks \u2014 \u201cthey are all right\u201d \u2014 if they had not contained his signature as the drawer. Moreover, the jury had before it for comparison the checks themselves and the bank\u2019s signature cards. The issue of whether the checks were drawn by the appellant was for the jury and the members obviously concluded that it was his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The contention that there was no evidence to prove insufficient funds to pay the checks is patently frivolous. The evidence was overwhelming that they had not been paid. Thus, we find no merit in the appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding of guilt under Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The appellant mounts a vigorous attack upon the validity of his convictions because \u201cthe State\u2019s Attorney had a conflict of interest but prosecuted nevertheless * *</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">It appears that on January 24, 1974, the state\u2019s attorney wrote the following letter to the Governor of Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">Kent County is involved in the prosecution of one Philippe Andre Sinclair and the Sinwellan Corporation, both of whom were indicted on October 30, 1973, in Kent County. The charges arose out of a transfer of Great Oak Lodge and Yacht Club.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">Certain events have transpired which have rendered me incapable of handling the prosecution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>These events have been discussed with Clarence W. Sharp, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Attorney General\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">I, therefore, hereby request that the Attorney General\u2019s Office handle the prosecution of these cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">Thank you very much for your kind cooperation and consideration in this matter.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At a pretrial conference held on April 4, 1974, appellant discovered that, notwithstanding the State\u2019s previous motion to continue the case in order to permit its prosecution by an assistant attorney general, rather than by the state\u2019s attorney, the state\u2019s attorney himself was going to prosecute the case. On April 11, 1974, appellant filed a motion seeking, among other things, to disqualify the state\u2019s attorney and the deputy state\u2019s attorney from prosecuting the cases and to dismiss the cases because of a conflict of interest on the part of those officials. Attached to the motion was a sworn affidavit of appellant, dated April 11, 1974, which read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201c(1) That the State\u2019s Attorney, Richard Cooper, and the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney, Basil Wadkovsky, hold themselves out as a partnership in the practice of law in Chestertown, Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(2) That Basil Wadkovsky is or has acted as attorney for the Maryland National Bank and such Bank holds a note against Frank and Ethel Russell and Great Oak Estates Realty, Inc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">(3) That State\u2019s Attorney Cooper is or has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>attorney for Carrol Tilley who holds a note against the Russells and Great Oaks Resort &amp; Yacht Club, Inc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">(4) That the defendant, Philippe A. Sinclair during 1972 and 1973 was involved and negotiating with the purchase of Great Oak Resort &amp; Yacht Club, Inc., and Great Oak Estates Realty, Inc., and the lands of Frank and Ethel Russell;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">(5) That State\u2019s Attorney Cooper and Deputy State\u2019s Attorney Wadkovsky attempted to sell the notes they held to the defendant Philippe A. Sinclair in July and August of 1973. The matter was not consummated and thereafter in October of 1973, State\u2019s Attorney Cooper made presentment to the Grand Jury of Kent County and issued informations which are the subject matter of the present criminal actions; and the Grand Jury returned indictments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(6) That State\u2019s Attorney Cooper in October of 1973 prior to any presentment to the Grand Jury, informed the defendant Philippe A. Sinclair that if defendant filed an appeal in the civil action entitled Great Oak Resort &amp; Yacht Club, Inc., et al. v. Sinclair, et al., that he, State\u2019s Attorney Cooper, would indict the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">(7) The appeal was taken on October 29,1973;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">(8) The Grand Jury was called into special session on the day following the appeal of the civil action and indictments were returned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">(9) Previous to the appeal being filed on behalf of defendant Sinclair, the Grand Jury had been given presentments but had not returned any indictments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">A copy of the letter to the Governor of Maryland, dated January 24, 1974, from the state\u2019s attorney, set forth above, was attached to the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">On April 17, 1974, Judge Wise, considering the motion to dismiss as one to grant appropriate relief before trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>under Maryland Rule 725, entered an order, without a hearing, denying the motion. In the text preceding his order, Judge Wise stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u201cThe grounds for relief consist mostly of bald allegations. While it would appear therefrom that the State\u2019s Attorney and/or his Deputy may have had or evinced an adverse or even antagonistic interest, there is nothing alleged or inferable that would indicate any conflict of interest or other posture which would in any way unduly prejudice the defendant. The indictments represent action of the Grand Jury, rather than that of the prosecutor,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and any improper motivation of the State\u2019s Attorney in filing presentments should be pursued civilly or tactically. In any adversary proceeding the opposing counsel must of necessity be hostile, and in the case of a prosecutor he could not perform competently otherwise, yet that does not necessarily indicate ground for disqualification. Such seems to be the situation here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The office of the state\u2019s attorney is constitutionally created: \u201cThere shall be an attorney for the State in each county, and the City of Baltimore, to be styled The State\u2019s Attorney, who shall be elected by the voters thereof * * Constitution of Maryland, Art. V, \u00a7 7. The state\u2019s attorney is an official of the executive branch, <em>Powell v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 685, 694-95, n. 1, and serves as a state rather than a local officer, <em>Valle v. Pressman, </em>229 Md. 591, 600. \u201cThe State\u2019s Attorney shall perform such duties * * * as shall be prescribed by law * * Constitution of Maryland, Art. V, \u00a7 9. In implementation of these constitutional provisions, Code, Art. 10 \u00a7 34 provides: \u201cThe State\u2019s Attorney for each county and the City of Baltimore shall, in such county or city, prosecute and defend, on the part of the State, all cases in which the State may be interested.\u201d The office of state\u2019s attorney, being unknown to the common law, is possessed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>no other powers than those prescribed by the Constitution and statutes of the State, <em>Kilgour v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., </em>96 Md. 16, 29; <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>81 Md. 306, 310; but these powers are nowhere enunciated and defined. <em>Wells v. Price, </em>183 Md. 443, 446; <em>State v. Aquilla, </em>18 Md. App. 487, 493, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 755. The responsibility for prosecuting criminal cases at the trial level devolves upon the state\u2019s attorney by reason of his constitutional mandate as implemented by statute. <em>Aquilla, supra, </em>at 493; <em>State v. Hunter, </em>10 Md. App. 300, 305-06 n. 5, <em>writ of certiorari dismissed as having been improvidently granted, </em>263 Md. 17. In addition to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s routine duties as a prosecutor, he has certain obligations to the public and to the criminal court. \u201cHe not only represents the State in the realm of law enforcement, but is also in a very special sense as officer of the court * * * so that * * * he has, impliedly, both the right and the duty to help give effect to the law and the judgments under it as pronounced by the Court.\u201d <em>Wells, supra, </em>at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The state\u2019s attorney is vested \u201cwith broad official discretion to institute and prosecute criminal causes.\u201d <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>184 Md. 86, 90; <em>Aquilla, supra, </em>at 494; <em>Hunter, supra, </em>at 305-06 n. 5. In <em>Brack, supra, </em>at 90, the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cIn such prosecutions of persons accused of crime, he must exercise a sound discretion to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent. He must be trusted with broad official discretion to institute and prosecute criminal causes, subject generally to judicial control. The office is one not purely ministerial, but involves the exercise of learning and discretion. 42 <em>American Jurisprudence, </em>p. 245. As a general rule, whether the State\u2019s Attorney does or does not institute a particular prosecution is a matter which rests in his discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">It is at once apparent, therefore, that a state\u2019s attorney is an elected public official; holding a constitutional office; and a member of the executive branch of government. He can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>only be removed from office \u201cfor incompetency, wilful neglect of duty, or misdemeanor in office, on conviction in a Court of Law, or by a vote of two thirds of the Senate, on the recommendation of the Attorney General\u201d (Constitution of Maryland, Art. V \u00a7 7); and he is entrusted \u201cwith broad official discretion to institute and prosecute criminal charges\u201d <em>(Brack, supra, </em>at 90).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">That a state\u2019s attorney should perform the duties of his office in a fair, impartial and objective manner is to state the obvious. <em>{See </em>American Bar Association Fair Standards of Criminal Justice.) The words; fair, impartial and objective \u2014 words readily understood generally \u2014 are somewhat difficult, on occasion, to define in terms of specific acts and conduct. All individuals, including state\u2019s attorneys, are subject to degrees of emotion, prejudice, taste and innate predilection. Thus, it is always possible that the course of conduct of a state\u2019s attorney, as any other public official or private citizen, may be motivated by worthy or unworthy ideals. In appraising the conduct of a state\u2019s attorney who is charged, as here, with having a conflict of interest of such proportions as to disqualify him from prosecuting a particular individual, we think the true measure or standard by which his conduct should be viewed is posed in the simple issue: Did his action in prosecuting the individual result in a denial of due process of law to that individual. Otherwise stated, was the prosecution of the accused so wanton, blatant and harassing as to deny the accused his fundamental right to a fair and impartial trial. In our.view, therefore, the hard core issue is whether the bringing of the prosecution resulted in the accused being denied his fundamental and constitutional right to the due process of law as that right is known to us in modern society.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Thus, the issue before us cannot be disposed of by a simple finding that the state\u2019s attorney for Kent County had a conflict of interest insofar as the appellant is concerned, and we make no judgment on the finding of the trial judge in this respect. We look to the broader issue of due process and, measured by that standard, we cannot find a shred of evidence in the record before us to indicate in any way that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the appellant was denied his right to a fair and impartial trial. That the appellant\u2019s prosecution may have resulted from reprehensible conduct by the state\u2019s attorney or may have been motivated by ill will or personal prejudice toward the appellant on the part of the state\u2019s attorney, does not alter the simple, crystal-clear fact that on the record before us the convictions suffered by the appellant were the result of his being accorded a fair trial by an impartial judge and jury. Under these circumstances, we find no merit in the contention that the appellant\u2019s convictions should be reversed because \u201cthe State\u2019s Attorney had a conflict of interest but prosecuted nevertheless * * *.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The appellant next contends that \u201cThe Court\u2019s prejudicial remarks during the trial coupled with error in the instructions to the jury necessitates reversal of the conviction[s].\u201d He also asserts that \u201cThe trial court aided the prosecution * * We have carefully scrutinized the record and find no substance to these contentions. It is the responsibility of a trial judge to insure that the trial of an accused proceeds in a fair, orderly and expeditious manner. <em>See Douglas v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 647, 655. Judge Wise did just this and we see no prejudice to the rights of the appellant in the conduct of the trial. A review of the instructions to the jury demonstrates that they contained a clear and correct statement of the law of the case. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finally, appellant asserts that he \u201cattempted to demonstrate that $20,000.00 was on deposit with the Maryland Title and Guaranty Company and that [he] would have used these funds [to make good] * * * the five checks, but for the fact that he was under Court order not to use them.\u201d We agree with the trial judge that such evidence was entirely irrelevant and we find no error in its exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-11\">.

State,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which depicts the persistent efforts of a State\u2019s Attorney to protect the citizens of Kent County from criminal activity. These cases concern the activities of Philippe Andre Sinclair, the appellant (Sinclair), who, as president of the Sinwellan Corporation, leased and operated a marina and resort known as \u201cThe Great Oak Lodge\u201d situate near Chestertown in Kent County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The initial case arose when Sinclair became unable to pay the salary of one of his employees and for goods and services rendered the Great Oak Lodge by a television repair business. On 9 October 1973 in the Circuit Court for Kent County, a jury, presided over by Judge James A. Wise, convicted Sinclair and the Sinwellan Corporation of violating Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 144, \u201cObtaining money ... by check or other negotiable instrument with intent to stop payment.\u201d Accordingly, Sinclair was sentenced to six months imprisonment with three months of the sentence to be suspended upon a making of restitution. The corporation was fined $1,000 which fine was suspended. On 15 October 1973 in the Circuit Court for Kent County, a jury, with Judge Wise again presiding, convicted Sinclair and the Sinwellan Corporation of violating Art. 27, \u00a7 142, \u201cObtaining money ... by bad check.\u201d Sinclair was sentenced to a consecutive six month term of imprisonment. The corporation was again fined $1,000 which fine was suspended. The case concluded when both of the judgments were reversed. <em>Sinclair and Sinwellan Corporation, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">This case arose when Sinclair became unable to pay for some meat used in the lodge\u2019s restaurant. On 9 November 1973 in the Circuit Court for Kent County, Richard R. Cooper, State\u2019s Attorney for Kent County (Cooper), filed a 20 count information charging both Sinclair and the Sinwellan Corporation with violations on five separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>occasions of Art. 27, \u00a7 140, \u201cObtaining money .. . under false pretenses,\u201d and Art. 27, \u00a7 142. On 22 January 1974 Judge George B. Rasin, Jr., granted a motion for removal, filed by Cooper, and removed the case for trial to Caroline County.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">On 25 January 1974 Basil Wadkovsky, Deputy State\u2019s Attorney for Kent County (Wadkovsky), filed a motion for a continuance based upon, among other things, the fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201c3. That the Defendant has made certain allegations concerning the State\u2019s Attorney which has required the State\u2019s Attorney to request the Governor of the State of Maryland to appoint the Attorney General to prosecute these cases. That the Assistant Attorney General who has been tentatively assigned to handle the prosecution for the State is in trial in another county and will not be available to prosecute these cases for at least two (2) months. Attached please find a copy of my [sic] letter to Governor Mandel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The attached letter, from Richard R. Cooper, State\u2019s Attorney, to the Honorable Marvin Mandel, Governor, dated 24 January 1974, indicated that \u201ccertain events\u201d had transpired which had rendered Cooper \u201cincapable of handling the prosecution\u201d and requested that \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s office handle the prosecution of these cases.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Sinclair\u2019s discovery at a pretrial conference on 4 April 1974, that Cooper himself was going to prosecute the cases <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>was followed on 11 April 1974 by Sinclair\u2019s motion seeking, among other things, to disqualify State\u2019s Attorney Cooper and Deputy State\u2019s Attorney Wadkovsky from prosecuting the cases, and to dismiss the cases because of a conflict of interest on the part of those officials. Attached to the motion was Sinclair\u2019s sworn affidavit in which he stated that indictments and informations against him were issued and filed only after he refused to purchase certain notes representing the indebtedness of the owners of the Yacht Club to Cooper\u2019s and Wadkovsky\u2019s private clients, and after he ignored Cooper\u2019s and Wadkovsky\u2019s threats of criminal prosecution in the event that he filed an appeal from a civil judgment against him and in favor of the owners of the Yacht Club. A copy of the letter dated 24 January 1974, from Cooper, was also attached. On 17 April 1974, Judge Wise, without a hearing, denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">According to the docket entries on 22 April 1974 the State\u2019s motion to <em>nol pros </em>alii counts except numbers three, seven, eleven, fifteen and nineteen of the information, was granted. A jury trial then proceeded on that date solely on those five counts, each of which involved a charge against Sinclair for a violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 142 on five distinct occasions. At the conclusion of the trial the jury found Sinclair guilty of all five counts. Cooper, indicating that he hoped \u201cthe Court doesn\u2019t consider this as being in any [way] vindictive, as I have been accused,\u201d then asked that the pretrial bond of $95,500.00 be discontinued. Judge Wise continued bail and released Sinclair, remarking that \u201c$95,000.00 is ample for about any offense\u201d and that there had been no previous problem with Sinclair\u2019s appearances for trial. On 4 June 1974 Judge Wise sentenced Sinclair, on each of the five counts, to a term of five years imprisonment, three years of which were to be suspended, with all of the sentences to run concurrently. Other criminal charges pending against Sinclair remained to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>On appeal Sinclair raises eight grounds for reversal. I agree with the majority that seven of Sinclair\u2019s contentions are without merit. Unlike my colleagues, however, I believe that there was evidence presented which, if believed, would create the appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of Cooper and Wadkovsky and that such circumstances would necessitate reversal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The majority recognizes that the State\u2019s Attorney is vested with broad official discretion to institute and prosecute criminal causes but, despite its quotation from <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>184 Md. 86, 90, 40 A. 2d 319, 321 (1944), makes no mention of the fact that the exercise of that discretion is subject to judicial control. A quotation from <em>Brack, supra, </em>fuller than that provided by the majority, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cBy the Constitution of Maryland, Article 5, Section 9, the State\u2019s Attorney shall perform such duties as may by law be prescribed. By Section 33 of Article 10 of the Code, 1939, that officer is required to \u2018prosecute and defend, on the part of the State, all cases in which the State may be interested.\u2019 In such prosecutions of persons accused of crime, he must exercise a sound discretion to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent. He must be trusted with broad official discretion to institute and prosecute criminal causes, <em>subject generally to judicial control. </em>The office is one not purely ministerial, but involves the exercise of learning and discretion. 42 <em>American Jurisprudence, </em>p. 245. As a general rule, whether the State\u2019s Attorney does or does not institute a particular prosecution is a matter which rests in his discretion. <em>Unless that discretion is grossly abused or such duty compelled by statute or there is a clear showing that such duty exists, mandamus will not lie. </em>38 <em>Corpus Juris, </em>p. 623; Boyne v. Ryan, 100 Cal. 265, 34 P. 707; <em>McLaughlin v. Burroughs, </em>90 Mich. 311, 51 N. W. 283; <em>State v. Talty, </em>166 Mo. 529, 66 S. W. 361. There is no allegation in the petition in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>case that such discretion was grossly abused, nor do the facts as set out constitute gross abuse of discretion. The statement that he acted arbitrarily and capriciously is a conclusion of the pleader.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">I am persuaded that the facts set out here if believed, would constitute a gross abuse of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s discretion to institute a criminal prosecution. I further believe that this Court has the power and obligation to remedy such an abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The standards by which to appraise the conduct of a State\u2019s Attorney are established by Maryland law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is the duty of the prosecutor, as of every lawyer, to represent a client zealously within the bounds of the law. ABA, Code, Canon 7, Ethical Consideration 7-1. Because the power of the prosecutor to institute criminal prosecutions vests in him an authority in the administration of criminal justice at least as sweeping as, and perhaps greater than, the authority of the judge who presides in criminal cases, <em>American Bar Association, Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice, </em>The Prosecution Function, Introduction, at 77 (Compilation, 1974) [hereinafter referred to as <em>ABA, Standards], </em>the responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate. His duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict. <em>Powell v. State, </em>16 Md.

In July and August of 1973, State\u2019s Attorney Cooper and Deputy State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Attorney Wadkovsky, who were then partners in the private practice of law, and who represented clients who held notes against the Great Oak Resort and Yacht Club, Inc., Great Oak Estates Realty, Inc., and Frank and Ethel Russell, attempted to sell Sinclair the notes held by their clients. The matter was never consummated. Moreover, there was sworn, uncontradicted testimony to show that in October, 1973, Cooper informed Sinclair that if he filed an appeal in a civil action entitled Great Oak Resort and Yacht Club, Inc., et al., v. Sinclair, et al., that he, State\u2019s Attorney Cooper, would indict Sinclair. Thereafter, in October, presentments were made to the grand jury. On 29 October 1973 the appeal in the civil suit was noted by Sinclair. On the following day, 30 October 1973, the grand jury was called into special session and returned several indictments against Sinclair. On 9 November 1973, according to the docket entries, State\u2019s Attorney Cooper filed the 20 count information charging the violations here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On 24 January 1974, Cooper attempted to disqualify himself by requesting in a letter to the Governor the appointment of the Attorney General to prosecute the Sinclair-Sinwellan cases, indicating in the letter that \u201ccertain events\u201d had transpired which rendered him incapable of handling those prosecutions. The nature of the events was clarified in a motion for continuance, filed the next day, which explained that \u201ccertain allegations\u201d made by Sinclair concerning the State\u2019s Attorney had \u201crequired\u201d him to request the Attorney General\u2019s appointment as prosecutor. The motion pointed out that an assistant Attorney General had been tentatively assigned, but that he would not be available for at least two months, and that the continuance was necessitated by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s disqualification. On 4 April 1974, according to a motion for disqualification filed by Sinclair, notwithstanding the apparent fact that trial had been postponed until 22 April 1974 in order to permit Cooper\u2019s replacement by an Assistant Attorney General, Sinclair learned that Cooper was himself going to prosecute. On 11 April 1974 Sinclair filed the motion for disqualification and dismissal which, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>we have said, Judge Wise denied on 17 April 1974. On 22 April 1974 the State\u2019s Attorney <em>nol grossed </em>15 of the 20 counts in the information, and the case proceeded to trial on the five remaining counts. After the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, Judge Wise denied Cooper\u2019s motion to discontinue Sinclair\u2019s $95,500.00 bail bond. Other outstanding criminal charges against Sinclair remained to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">I think that, if believed, the evidence relating to the pattern of conduct engaged in by the State\u2019s Attorney and his assistant, viewed as a whole, and in particular the evidence that Cooper twice attempted to make arrangements with Sinclair for the benefit of his private clients, that he once threatened Sinclair with criminal prosecution in the event that Sinclair appealed an adverse civil judgment obtained by parties indebted to his private clients, and that, in fact, Cooper attempted to disqualify himself because of Sinclair\u2019s \u201callegations\u201d of his misconduct, at least would give the appearance that Cooper threatened to and did, in fact, present criminal charges for the purpose of obtaining the advantage of protecting his private clients\u2019 interests by securing repayment on their outstanding notes. The evidence, if believed, also would give the appearance that Cooper\u2019s determination to charge and prosecute Sinclair was motivated in part by the hope that successive prosecutions and convictions would cause Sinclair to capitulate and cooperate with Cooper, either by purchasing the notes of his clients or by not filing an appeal in the civil litigation involved, thus making it appear that Cooper used his position and the power of the government to harass Sinclair and to compel an unwarranted and unjust result. Consequently, the evidence, if believed, would support the inference that Cooper engaged in a pattern of conduct which, if it did not establish that he was neither disinterested nor impartial in the performance of his duties, did, at least, give the appearance that his special and personal interest was in conflict with his public obligation to administer justice fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In sum, the evidence concerning Cooper\u2019s activities, if believed, would be sufficient to show at least that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>conduct of the State\u2019s Attorney gave the appearance of violating the standards established by Maryland law. It also, if believed, would create the danger of substantial prejudice to the defendant resulting from his being unnecessarily subjected to prosecution for a reason other than the preservation of the public interest. Under such circumstances the discretion of the State\u2019s Attorney in instituting the instant criminal prosecution would be, in my view, grossly abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">I believe that a prosecuting attorney who abuses his discretion by initiating and acting in a criminal case in which he has a special or personal interest which conflicts with the fair and impartial discharge of his duties should be disqualified and that a conviction obtained when the prosecutor has such an interest should be reversed. Some state courts which have considered this problem agree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While there is no precedent in Maryland with respect to this question, the Court of Appeals and this Court have considered similar questions with respect to the grand jury system.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In Maryland it has long been recognized that there is no statutory or other requirement that grand jurors be unprejudiced. <em>Coblentz v. State, </em>164 Md. 558, 570-71, 166 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>45, 50-54 (1933); <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 53, 63-64, 329 A. 2d 738, 744-45 (1974). Yet in <em>Coblentz </em>the Court of Appeals recognized, in dicta, that a direct pecuniary interest in a prosecution would serve to disqualify a grand juror. The test for determining the existence of such disqualification, according to the Court of Appeals, was whether the grand juror would \u201cgain or lose\u201d by a conviction or acquittal of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Over a century ago. the Court of Appeals decided the case of <em>Clare v. State, </em>30 Md. 163 (1869). There the defendant pled in abatement to the indictment against him that the mandates of the law had not been followed in the selection-of the grand jury, because its members had been selected, not by judges as the law required, but by a court clerk. The lower court determined this allegation to be factually correct, but held that it concerned a mere informality and not a fatal defect. The plea was overruled and the defendant convicted. On appeal the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of conviction, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had not alleged or proved any specific prejudice to him from the unlawful method of selection. The Court of Appeals there said at 30 Md. 177-178:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201cIt is indispensable, in a criminal trial, that the grand inquest required to find the indictment should be constituted of \u2018good and lawful men,\u2019 and if the body, or any part of it, lie under substantial disqualification, they may be challenged by the prisoner before the bill is presented; or after the finding, the prisoner may plead the objection in abatement thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201cWe fully concur in the remarks of Judge Hitchcock, in his dissenting opinion in <em>Boyington v. State, </em>2 Porter, 143, which was subsequently followed in the Alabama decisions overruling the opinion of the majority in that case, \u2018what principle of public policy can be more sacred than that the sources of justice should be pure? .. . Ought not the court rather to say that indictments found by persons not good and lawful men, shall be revoked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>annulled and holden for none, forever? If I am to be put on trial for my life, let my accusers, at least, be <em>boni et legales homines.\u2019 </em>It results from these views that there has been no legal trial and conviction of the prisoner in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">\u201cUnder any government of law the trial of persons accused of crime, from its commencement to the conclusion, should be scrupulously conducted according to the requirements of the law. Not only the sacred administration of public and private justice, but the good order of the community, the security and protection of life, liberty and property, cannot be preserved, except by the inflexible maintenance and impartial enforcement of the statutory, as well as the fundamental laws of the land. Where the substantial provisions of the law have not been regarded, and a party has been convicted in violation thereof, and without their sanction, such party is entitled to a reversal, if legal steps in due time are taken to obtain redress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201cFor these reasons the judgment of the court below overruling the pleas in abatement, and the final judgment of conviction of the prisoner, must be reversed; but this does not entitle him to be discharged, or exonerate him from a legal trial for the same offense. He may be held under the original commitment or <em>capias, </em>until a new indictment is framed, under which a trial may be had; or until he is discharged in due course of law.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The same principles were affirmed and quoted in <em>State v. Vincent, </em>91 Md. 718, 732, 47 A. 1036, 1040 (1900), and <em>State v. Madison, </em>240 Md. 265, 269, 213 A. 2d 880, 883 (1965); <em>see Peters v. Kiff, </em>407 U. S. 493, 92 S. Ct. 2163 (1972); <em>Cassell v. Texas, </em>339 U. S. 282, 70 S. Ct. 629 (1950). <em>See also Beck v. Washington, </em>369 U. S. 541, 546, 82 S. Ct. 955, 958 (1972) (dicta), 369 U. S. 558, 82 S. Ct. 964 (dissenting opinion, Black, J.), 369 U. S. 579, 82 S. Ct. 975 (dissenting opinion, Douglas, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Viewed in a narrow perspective these cases establish that when a grand juror is disqualified by virtue of a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of a criminal prosecution, or when the method of selection of a grand jury is violative of law, the defendant is entitled to a reversal even though no actual prejudice is alleged or proved. Viewed in a broader perspective these cases establish that where there is inherent unfairness or a violation of law during the accusatory phase of a criminal prosecution reversal is warranted even in the absence of an allegation or proof of actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">I am convinced that these principles are applicable to the instant case. Accusers, be they the grand jury or the State\u2019s Attorney, should be \u201cgood a\u00ed\u00edid lawful men.\u201d A State\u2019s Attorney, like a grand juror, who has a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of a criminal prosecution, should be disqualified. Moreover, a prosecutor who exercises his duties in a manner contrary to the requirements of the law, like a grand jury which is selected in a way contrary to the requirements of the law, creates a fatal defect in the accusatory phase of the criminal prosecution. Continuation of the American concept that we are to be governed by the rules of law requires that the people have faith that justice can be obtained through our legal system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ABA, Code, Canon 9, Ethical Consideration 9-1. That faith is justified and can exist only when the people are convinced that justice is administered evenhandedly. The exercise of a State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s broad prerogative to determine whom, what and how to prosecute must adhere rigidly to the standards of conduct established by law. Any act not in accordance with those standards, because it impairs the confidence of the people in the integrity of the exercise of the State\u2019s sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>power to indict and prosecute, tends to destroy the people\u2019s faith in the fair and equal administration of justice. Such acts are not to be sanctioned or condoned by the courts. When they occur reversal is warranted notwithstanding the absence of any allegation or proof of actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Here, there was evidence adduced, which, if believed, would support the inference that the prosecution was brought by a person who had a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the criminal prosecution. He and his assistant would stand to gain financially, if as a result of successive prosecutions and convictions, Sinclair capitulated to their previous demands and either purchased the notes held by their clients or \u201cvoluntarily\u201d dismissed a pending civil appeal. Under such circumstances, both should have been disqualified. Moreover, there was evidence adduced here which, if believed, would give the appearance of a violation of the fundamental requirements of law that a State\u2019s Attorney act fairly and impartially in the discharge of his duties and the exercise of his discretion. I could not sanction or condone the conduct of the State\u2019s Attorney and his assistant if, in fact, it was as sworn to by the defendant. Accordingly, under such circumstances I would reverse the convictions, notwithstanding the absence of an allegation or proof of actual prejudice to Sinclair.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Here, however, the trial court, viewing the facts as sworn to by Sinclair as \u201cbald allegations,\u201d held no hearing with respect to the question of whether the State\u2019s Attorney and his assistant engaged in a course of conduct which gave the appearance of impropriety. Thus, no findings were made as to whether the facts sworn to by Sinclair were true. Under these circumstances I would neither affirm nor reverse the judgments below but would remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing and findings of fact on this question. If the trial court were to find that Cooper and Wadkovsky did not engage in a questionable course of conduct, the convictions would stand. If the trial court were to find to the contrary, it should then dismiss the informations and, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974) <em>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, </em>\u00a7 2-102 (a) [formerly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>codified as Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 26, \u00a7 ll].<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appoint assistant counsel for the State who should then determine on a fair and impartial basis whether the public interest requires either that a new criminal prosecution be instituted or that Sinclair be discharged. I would so do not only to protect the defendant here from the danger of substantial prejudice, but also because only by so doing could I be certain that the people\u2019s belief in the impartial, unbiased and unprejudiced use of the State\u2019s sovereign power to indict and prosecute would be vindicated and reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">.
