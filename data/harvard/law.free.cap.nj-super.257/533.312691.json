(Sunshine Chemical) and from a denial of a post-judgment motion by Sunshine Chemical for a new trial in this personal injury product liability tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Briefly, plaintiff instituted this action against defendants Sunshine Chemical and Concord Harley Corp., a/k/a Concord Chemical Company, Inc., a/k/a Harley Chemical Corp., a Division of Concord Chemical Company, Inc. (Harley) to recover damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of exposure to the product Sun-Clean Concentrate distributed by Sunshine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Chemical. Plaintiff pursued the action on theories of negligence, strict liability and breach of implied and expressed warranties. She sought to recover compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiff\u2019s husband, plaintiff Robert Herman, sued <em>per quod. </em>Prior to trial, plaintiffs settled their claims with Harley and the matter proceeded to trial solely against Sunshine Chemical. At the conclusion of the proofs, the jury, in answer to special interrogatories, found that Sunshine Chemical\u2019s product Sun-Clean Concentrate was defective, that the defect was a proximate cause of the harm to plaintiff, that Sunshine Chemical was negligent and that its negligence was a proximate cause of the harm to plaintiff. The jury also found that Harley knowingly placed in the stream of commerce the defective product Sun-Clean Concentrate and that this was a proximate cause of the harm to plaintiff. The jury then found that, based on comparative fault, Sunshine Chemical was 80% at fault and Harley 20% at fault and that the amount of money to fairly and reasonably compensate plaintiff for the injuries she sustained was $410,000. In addition, the jury awarded plaintiff punitive damages in the amount of $400,000 against Sunshine Chemical. The jury awarded Robert Herman nothing. The trial court thereupon molded the verdict and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff against Sunshine Chemical for $328,-000 compensatory damages plus prejudgment interest and $400,000 punitive damages. The trial court denied Sunshine Chemical\u2019s motion for a new trial which was based on the grounds that the evidence did not demonstrate willful, wanton or reckless conduct on its part and that plaintiff failed to introduce evidence of its financial worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Thereafter, General Accident paid plaintiff the compensatory damage portion of the judgment but refused to pay the punitive damages award. As a result, a partial warrant of satisfaction of the judgment was executed. Sunshine Chemical declined to appeal the punitive damages portion of the judgment and assigned to plaintiff any claim it may have against General Accident and Parker-McCay based on their failure to properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>settle or defend the case. According to the Parker-McCay firm, the punitive damages claim was settled when Sunshine Chemical agreed not to prosecute an appeal of the punitive damages awarded thereby locking in the judgment. Because of a potential conflict of interest presented by Sunshine Chemical\u2019s refusal to appeal the punitive damages award and Sunshine Chemical\u2019s suggestion of future litigation against both General Accident and Parker-McCay, we granted the latter leave to intervene and appeal from the punitive damages portion of the judgment as real parties in interest. We then consolidated both appeals on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Preliminarily, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s claim, leave to appeal was properly granted in this case. <em>Rule </em>4:33-2 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action if his claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common____ In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Plaintiff, as assignee, has instituted an action against General Accident to recover damages in the sum of $400,000 \u2014 the amount of the punitive damage award, together with interest and attorney fees. According to plaintiff,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">The predicate of that lawsuit is that General Accident and its agent, David Parker, failed to properly protect the individual interests of Sunshine Chemical by settling the case within policy limits for a sum of money which would have secured to them a general release including a release for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">As a secondary position it is claimed that General Accident through its agents did not provide a timely notice of the pendency of a punitive damages claim and did not provide a properly executed reservation of rights or permit Sunshine Chemical to obtain independent trial counsel in a meaningful fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">Despite plaintiff\u2019s assertion that General Accident\u2019s failure to put $400,000 in escrow (representing the punitive damages award) negates its standing to appeal, General Accident and Parker-McCay have sufficient interest in the present litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>to warrant their intervention and prosecution of these appeals as the real parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We turn now to Parker-McCay\u2019s and General Accident\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the punitive damages claim against Sunshine Chemical because plaintiff failed to present proofs of actual malice or fraudulent or evil motives sufficient to warrant the imposition of punitive damages as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Punitive damages reflect the importation of criminal law principles of punishment into the field of tort law. <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 2, at 9 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter <em>\u201cProsser &amp; Keeton </em>\u201d). Such damages constitute \u201ca sort of hybrid between a display of ethical indignation and the imposition of a criminal fine.\u201d <em>Cabakov v. Thatcher, </em>37 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 259, 117 <em>A.</em>2d 298 (App.Div.1955) (quoting <em>Haines v. Schultz, </em>50 <em>N.J.L. </em>481, 484, 14 <em>A. </em>488 (Sup.Ct.1888)). \u201cAn award of punitive damages, by its own terms, is punitive in nature----\u201d <em>Belinski v. Goodman, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 359, 354 A.2d 92 (App.Div.1976). In contrast to compensatory damages, punitive damages serve the \u201cadmonitory\u201d function of expressing the \u201ccommunity\u2019s disapproval of outrageous conduct----\u201d <em>Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>643, 657, 512 A.2d 466 (1986). The plaintiff is awarded punitive damages \u201cover and above the full compensation for the injuries, for the purpose of punishing the defendant, of teaching the defendant not to do it again, and of deterring others from following the defendant\u2019s example.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 2, at 9. In accord with these principles, our Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">Punitive or exemplary damages are sums awarded apart from compensatory damages and are assessed when the wrongdoer\u2019s conduct is especially egregious. They are awarded upon a theory of punishment to the offender for aggravated misconduct and to deter such conduct in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-13\"><em>Leimgruber v. Claridge Associates, Ltd., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>450, 454, 375 A.2d 652 (1977); <em>see 49 Prospect Street Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Sheva </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Gardens, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 479, 547 A.2d 1134 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">However, mere negligence, or even gross negligence, are not a sufficient basis for an award of punitive damages. <em>Enright v. Lubow, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 76, 493 A.2d 1288 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>376, 517 A.2d 386 (1986); <em>see Berg v. Reaction Motors Div., </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>396, 413, 181 A.2d 487 (1962). As noted by Professors Prosser and Keeton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">Something more than the mere commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages. There must be circumstances of aggravation or outrage, such as spite or \u201cmalice,\u201d or a fraudulent or evil motive on the part of the defendant, or such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of others that the conduct may be called willful or wanton.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 2, at 9-10. <em>See Enright, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 76, 493 A.2d 1288. Thus, to justify an award of punitive damages, there must be some \u201cpositive element of conscious wrongdoing\u201d on defendant\u2019s part. <em>Berg, supra, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>at 414, 181 A.2d 487. This standard is met \u201cupon a showing that there has been a deliberate act or omission with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm and reckless indifference to consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The focus is not with the underlying tort but with the defendant\u2019s conduct and motives therefor. <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 2, at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Here, punitive damages are claimed in the context of a products liability, failure-to-wam action. In products liability actions, punitive damages require some \u201c \u2018outrageous conduct\u2019 or conduct which evidences a reckless disregard for public safety.\u201d J.D. Lee &amp; Barry A. Lindahl, <em>Modem Tort Law: Liability &amp; Litigation </em>\u00a7 27.88, at 811 (rev. ed. 1988) (hereinafter <em>\u201cModem Tort Law </em>\u201d). Thus, although punitive damages are usually available only for intentional torts, such damages are also available in \u201ccases where, although defendant did not intend to harm the plaintiff, he showed \u2018such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of others that his conduct may be called willful or wanton.\u2019 \u201d 2 Louis R. Frumer &amp; Melvin I. Friedman, <em>Products Liability </em>\u00a7 8.01 (1990) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>omitted). In such actions, the Supreme Court has held that punitive damages are available,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">when a manufacturer is (1) aware of or culpably indifferent to an unnecessary risk of injury, and (2) refuses to take steps to reduce that danger to an acceptable level. This standard can be met by a showing of \u201ca deliberate act or omission with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm and reckless indifference to consequences.\u201d <em>Berg v. Reaction Motors, supra, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>at 414, 181 A.2d 487. <em>[Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 670-71, 512 A.2d 466],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Because the focus of products liability law is product safety, our Supreme Court in <em>Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>pointed out that a \u201ckey factor\u201d in justifying punitive damages \u201cis indifference to or disregard of the dangers posed by the product in its defective state____\u201d 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 672, 512 A.2d 466. The Court in <em>Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>set forth guidelines for the trier of fact in a punitive damages case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct was sufficiently egregious to justify punitive damages, fact-finders should consider the seriousness of the hazard to the public; the degree of the defendant\u2019s awareness of the hazard and its excessiveness; the cost of correcting or reducing the risk; the duration of both the improper marketing behavior and its cover-up; the attitude and conduct of the enterprise upon discovery of the misconduct; and the defendant\u2019s reasons for failing to act. [103 <em>N.J. </em>at 672-73, 512 A.2d 466].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Thus, it is the indifference to the known potential harm of a product which constitutes the egregious or aggravated conduct justifying an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Both Parker-McCay and General Accident contend that Sunshine Chemical\u2019s conduct here was not sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages. They argue that the failure to indicate that caustics were contained in Sun-Clean Concentrate was not done with knowledge of risks of harm because an \u201cinexperienced\u201d Robert Feldman, the president of Sunshine Chemical, had merely borrowed the contents of the labels of other distributors for Sun-Clean Concentrate\u2019s label. They claimed that Feldman\u2019s actions amounted to negligence or, at worst, gross negligence and were not sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages. We disagree. Our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of the record indicates that the jury had sufficient evidence presented to it to find that Sunshine Chemical was aware of the hazards posed by its products, but failed to put an adequate warning on Sun-Clean Concentrate\u2019s label.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The product which injured plaintiff, Sun-Clean Concentrate, is essentially a dyed version of Harley\u2019s product 3-D, a heavy-duty industrial cleaner known in the industry as a butyl cleaner. The label on 3-D contained a warning about breathing the product\u2019s vapors and using it with proper ventilation, to wit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akq\">Danger. Causes bums. Do not get in eyes, skin or clothing. Avoid breathing vapor. Keep container closed. Use with adequate ventilation. Wash thoroughly after handling. Keep out of reach of children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Harley prepared Material Data Safety sheets which listed the hazardous components of 3-D, which included the chemical sodium hydroxide. These sheets were sent to Sunshine to inform them of hazardous ingredients in the product. Due to quality-control tests on the product, Sunshine Chemical\u2019s chemist, Malcolm Haskel, was aware that Sun-Clean Concentrate contained sodium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is a highly alkaline substance and a ph test of a sample of Sun-Clean Concentrate registered a reading of 13 ph on a scale of 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The label on Sun-Clean Concentrate bears the statement \u201ccontains no ... caustics.\u201d This statement is inaccurate because Sun-Clean Concentrate contains sodium hydroxide, which is a high alkaline caustic. Plaintiff\u2019s expert opined that Sun-Clean Concentrate\u2019s label would not sufficiently warn users of its dangers due to the inaccurate statement that the product does not contain caustics and the failure to contain a warning about breathing the vapor from the product. Feldman created Sun-Clean Concentrate\u2019s label by cutting and pasting together the labels of several competitors. Feldman admits that he looked at 3-D\u2019s label, but doesn\u2019t recall if there was any warning about breathing the product\u2019s fumes. Feldman testified that he would submit labels to Robert Solly, former president of Harley, for his approval. However, Solly did not recall checking the Sun-Clean Concentrate label for accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Contrary to Parker-McCay\u2019s and General Accident\u2019s claims, Feldman was not as inexperienced as they would portray him. Feldman was the president of Sunshine Chemical since 1974, when he formed the company. Prior to forming Sunshine Chemical, Feldman worked in the chemical industry as president of Selective Chemical Specialties. That company had a product similar to Sun-Clean Concentrate which Feldman believes also contained sodium hydroxide. Moreover, Sunshine Chemical employed a chemist whose duties included examination of product labels to determine technical accuracy. Additionally, Sunshine Chemical marketed another product, Wipe-Out Oven &amp; Grill Cleaner, which also contained sodium hydroxide. The label on this product does contain a warning that it contains sodium hydroxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The evidence presented in this case could sustain a judgment in favor of plaintiff. The proofs would support a finding that Sunshine Chemical was aware of the hazards of Sun-Clean Concentrate, but provided inadequate warnings on the label so that its best selling product might appear safer. Such conduct could be found by a reasonable jury to be <em>\u201ca </em>deliberate act or omission with knowledge of a high degree of probability of harm and reckless indifference to consequences.\u201d <em>Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 671, 512 A.2d 466 (quoting <em>Berg v. Reaction Motors, supra, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>at 414, 181 A.2d 487). The jury could find that the defective warning on Sun-Clean Concentrate\u2019s label was not due to mistake or inadvertence, and that Sunshine Chemical\u2019s conduct in this case warranted punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">However, we are convinced that the punitive damages judgment must be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial because of plaintiff\u2019s failure to present evidence of Sunshine Chemical\u2019s wealth. Whether to award punitive damages and their amount is within the discretion of the trier of fact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Leimgruber, supra, 73 N.J. </em>at 456, 375 A.2d 652; <em>49 Prospect Street, supra, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 479, 547 A.2d 1134. <em>See also Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 2, at 14; 22 <em>AM. JUR.2D, Damages </em>\u00a7 806, at 853 (1988). However, as the <em>Leimgruber </em>Court recognized, a jury faces a \u201cmajor difficulty\u201d in setting the amount of a punitive damages award due to the lack of \u201cany definitive standard or criterion to guide the trier of fact in determining the proper amount.\u201d 73 <em>N.J. </em>at 456-57, 375 A.2d 652. This uncertainty raises concerns expressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Pacific Mutual Ins. Co. v. Haslip, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). There the United States Supreme Court found that the common law method of assessing punitive damages did not constitute a <em>per se </em>denial of due process. \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1042-43, 113 L.Ed.2d at 19. However, the Supreme Court also expressed \u201cconcern about punitive damages that \u2018run wild\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1043-44, 113 L.Ed.2d at 20. As the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">One must concede that unlimited jury discretion \u2014 or unlimited judicial discretion for that matter \u2014 in the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results that jar one\u2019s constitutional sensibilities. [7d.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">It is with respect for such concerns that the requirements of a punitive damages award must be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Clearly, the wealth or financial condition of the defendant is a relevant consideration in guiding the assessment of punitive damages. <em>See Belinski v. Goodman, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357-58, 354 A.2d 92. Prosser and Keeton note that \u201c[m]ost courts agree that evidence of the defendant\u2019s wealth may be received as bearing on the question of the amount which will adequately punish the defendant for the conduct.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 2, at 15. The trier of fact considers defendant\u2019s wealth because the \u201cdegree of punishment or deterrence is to some extent proportionate to the means of the wrongdoer.\u201d 22 <em>AM JUR. </em>2D, <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 807. <em>See also Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 908(2), comment e (1977). Thus, in assessing punitive damages \u201cevidence of finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>cial situation of the defendant is important for the jury so that it may determine the sum of damages which will be adequate enough to punish the defendant and to work as a deterrent to similar conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Modem Tort Law, supra, </em>\u00a7 21.37, at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In a recent ruling, the California Supreme Court recognized that the purpose of punitive damages is punishment and deterrence, not the financial destruction of the defendant. <em>Adams v. Murakami, </em>284 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>318, 322, 54 <em>Cal.3d </em>105, 813 <em>P.2d </em>1348, 1352 (1991). Without evidence of a defendant\u2019s wealth a reviewing court is unable to ascertain the effect that the amount of punitive damages will have on the defendant. In this regard, the <em>Adams </em>court pointed out the ancient roots behind examining the defendant\u2019s wealth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">The principle that a punitive award must be considered in light of the defendant\u2019s financial condition is ancient. After the Norman conquest in 1066, there arose in English law a system of civil sanctions known as \u201camercements.\u201d <em>(Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal </em>(1989) 492 <em>U.S. </em>257, 287-289, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2909, 2927, 106 L.Ed.2d 219, 246 [cone, and dis. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.].) Because of the sometimes abusive nature of amercements, the Magna Carta prohibited those that were disproportionate to the offense or that would deprive the wrongdoer of his means of livelihood: \u201cA freeman shall only be amerced for a small offence according to the measure of that offence. And for a great offence he shall be amerced according to the magnitude of the offence, <em>saving his contentment; </em>and a merchant, in the same way, <em>saving his merchandize. </em>And a villein, in the same way, if he fall under our mercy, shall be amerced <em>saving his wainnage.\u201d </em>(Magna Carta (1215) ch. 20, italics added.) Absent evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition, a punitive damages award can financially annihilate him. We see no reason why a modern-day civil defendant should be entitled to less consideration than one was given 800 years ago. [813 P.2d at 1352-53 (footnote omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In <em>Leimgruber, supra, </em>our own Supreme Court emphasized that the defendant\u2019s wealth is a factor to be considered in setting punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\"><em>In assessing such damages, the trier of fact should take into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the particular occurrence including </em>the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of the harm inflicted, the intent of the party committing the act, <em>the wealth of the perpetrator, </em>as well as any mitigating circumstances which may operate to reduce the amount of damages. [73 <em>N.J. </em>at 456, 375 A.2d 652 (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>See 49 Prospect Street, supra, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 479, 547 A.2d 1134; <em>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 908(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In <em>McDonough v. Jorda, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 348-49, 519 A.2d 874 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>302, 540 A.2d 1282 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1065, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1338, 103 L.Ed.2d 809 (1989), we held that the wealth of the defendant <em>must </em>be considered in the assessment of punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avpk\">The $225,000 punitive damage award must be set aside for failure of proof on the issue of the wealth of plaintiff and Grey. In assessing exemplary damages, a jury must take into consideration the wealth of the defendants. <em>Leimgruber v. Claridge Associates, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 456, 375 A.2d 652. This is so because the theory behind punitive damages is to punish for the past event and to prevent future offenses, and the degree of punishment resulting from a judgment must be, to some extent, in proportion to the means of the guilty person. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 908 comment d (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">Jorda offered no evidence on the ability of the wrongdoers to pay any award. That lack of evidence, an essential of Jorda\u2019s burden of proof, precluded the jury from having a proper foundation to assess damages. Moreover, in the absence of a ruling or instruction by the court, the jury had no idea of the appropriate law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\"><em>See Battista v. Western World Co., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 150, 545 A.2d 841 (Law Div.1988), <em>affirmed in part and reversed in part, Battista v. Olson, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 335-36, 594 A.2d 260 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>553, 606 A.2d 366 (1991) (based on <em>McDonough, </em>one million dollar settlement of punitive damages claim set aside since it bore no relationship to the offending party\u2019s assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Plaintiff asserts that a defendant\u2019s wealth is merely a factor which may be considered by the jury, but it is not determinative. This argument plainly runs counter to our holding in <em>McDonough. </em>Moreover, in <em>Leimgruber, </em>the Supreme Court recognized the importance of considering a defendant\u2019s wealth in its rejection of a \u201cratio rule\u201d under which punitive damages would be required to be in some fixed proportion to compensatory damages. 73 <em>N.J. </em>at 457, 375 A.2d 652. One of the reasons for rejecting the \u201cratio rule\u201d was that such a rule does not discuss \u201cother considerations which normally enter into a punitive damage assessment ... such as the comparative seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ousness of the misconduct and the wealth of the malefactor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 375 A.2d 652. In <em>Comdyne I., Inc. v. Corbin, </em>908 F.2d 1142, 1153 n. 4 (3d Cir.1990), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals cited <em>Leimgruber </em>as support for the proposition that the trial court <em>must </em>consider a defendant\u2019s wealth in assessing punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In addition, the recent California Supreme Court decision in <em>Adams, supra, </em>supports the holding in <em>McDonough. </em>The <em>Adams </em>court held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition is a prerequisite to a punitive damages award and that plaintiff has the burden of introducing such evidence. 813 jP.2d at 1351. In light of the purposes of punitive damages, punishment and deterrence, an award of such damages must be reviewed by an appellate court to determine if it \u201cexceeds the level necessary to properly punish and deter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350 (citations omitted). This analysis cannot be accomplished without relevant factual data regarding the defendant\u2019s wealth. \u201cDeciding in the abstract whether an award is \u2018excessive\u2019 is like deciding whether it is \u2018bigger\u2019 without asking \u2018Bigger than what?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350-51. Thus, without evidence of defendant\u2019s wealth or financial condition, the reviewing court can only speculate as to whether the punitive damages award appropriately serves the goals of punishment and deterrence. <em>Id. </em>at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Likewise, without evidence of a defendant\u2019s wealth, the jury would be forced to guess what amount of damages will properly punish or deter the defendant. The <em>Adams </em>court pointed out that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Haslip, </em>although not making evidence of defendant\u2019s wealth a constitutional requirement, requires judicial scrutiny of punitive damages awards which \u201cweighs heavily in favor of evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Finally, we are convinced that the California Court\u2019s reasoning is persuasive and totally in accord with our holding in <em>McDonough. </em>Clearly, evidence of the defendant\u2019s wealth must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>be introduced to justify a punitive damages award. Our Legislature has also recognized this in the enactment of the Products Liability Act of 1987, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 <em>et. seq., </em>which requires the trier of fact to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]he financial condition of the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-5d(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Plaintiff also argues that sufficient evidence of Sunshine Chemical\u2019s wealth was introduced at trial. Specifically, plaintiff points to Feldman\u2019s testimony that Sunshine Chemical had gross sales of about three million dollars in 1985 and gross sales of about three and a half million dollars in 1986. Feldman also testified that he had sold his stock in Sunshine Chemical to Share Corporation for $750,000. Additionally, Feldman indicated that sales of Sun-Clean Concentrate constituted approximately one-third of Sunshine Chemical\u2019s total sales and that Sun-Clean Concentrate was Sunshine Chemical\u2019s best selling product. A thorough review of the record reveals that the above is the only evidence introduced regarding Sunshine Chemical\u2019s wealth. The question remains whether this evidence is sufficient indicia of Sunshine Chemical\u2019s financial condition or wealth to support an award of punitive damages. In our view it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">We hold, therefore, that there was insufficient evidence introduced at trial for the jury to accurately assess punitive damages. Gross sales coupled with the fact that sales of Sun-Clean Concentrate constituted one-third of Sunshine Chemical\u2019s total sales may be some indication of the economic benefit derived from selling Sun-Clean Concentrate. However, without an analysis of Sunshine Chemical\u2019s overall financial condition, specifically its net worth, this information does not convey whether the amount of punitive damages awarded properly serves the goals of punishment and deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Accordingly, the punitive damages judgment under review is reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for a new trial solely on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
