Defendant, A.H.\u2019s grandson, lived with her. L.H. picked the children up later that evening. While walking home with the two boys, Ms. H. noticed that A. walked \u201cstiff\u201d and \u201cslightly gap-legged.\u201d She asked A. why \u201che was walking slow like that.\u201d A. simply shrugged his shoulders. At home, A. continued to walk \u201cstrangely\u201d and Ms. H. again questioned him about it. A. then told his mother that \u201che was hurting down below.\u201d Ms. H. asked A. \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem\u201d and he answered that defendant \u201chad bit him on his worm.\u201d Ms. H. examined A.\u2019s penis which \u201cwas like scratched ... the skin was broke [and it] had a little bit of blood on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Ms. H. \u201ccalled the police\u201d and A. was taken to Burlington County Memorial Hospital. Dr. Theodore M. Gilbert examined A. on the evening of January 13, 1989. Doctor Gilbert testified that prior to his examination A. \u201ccomplained that someone had played with him and bit him.\u201d Dr. Gilbert recounted that \u201cupon examination of the ... relevant area ... the genitalia, [he] found [A.] to be uncircumcised and a small abrasion was present on the tip of his penis.\u201d Over defense objection, Dr. Gilbert testified that the child\u2019s injury was \u201cconsistent\u201d with what [A.] had told [him],\u201d and Dr. Gilbert concluded \u201cthat there was definite evidence, considering what the young man complained of, of sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Edward M. Burns, an employee of the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), was working \u201cthe response unit\u201d on the evening of January 13, 1989 when he \u201creceived a call from [his] central office that ... the police had made a referral ... concerning the sexual assault.\u201d Shortly after Mr. Burns went to the Burlington County Hospital\u2019s Emergency Room and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>spoke with Dr. Gilbert, Ms. H. and A. At first Bums made \u201csmall talk\u201d with A. in the attempt \u201cto build some sort of small relationship with him.\u201d Thereafter A. told Bums that \u201che had been over [defendant\u2019s] home and he was watching T.V. [a]nd that at that time [defendant] had bit and squeezed his worm.\u201d Bums learned from Ms. H. that \u201cworm\u201d was the word that A. used in reference to his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Antonina Roller, an \u201cintake worker\u201d with DYFS, testified that she interviewed A. at his home on January 24,1989. When Ms. Roller asked A. why he was at the hospital, \u201che told [her] that because [defendant] bit his worm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Debbie Cross, an investigator with the Burlington County Prosecutor\u2019s office, was called by the defense. She interviewed A. on January 26, 1989 and videotaped the interview which was conducted at the prosecutor\u2019s office. In the interview A. recanted his earlier accusation of defendant. On cross-examination, Ms. Cross testified that it was \u201cnot uncommon for young children to recant\u201d their accusations of sexual abuse. Ms. Cross was permitted to answer the question based upon her \u201cexperience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objection the trial judge permitted A. to testify.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He testified that defendant \u201cmessed with my worm\u201d and \u201cbit[ ] it.\u201d A. demonstrated that \u201chis worm\u201d was \u201cin the genitalia area,\u201d and he identified defendant in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">A.H., defendant\u2019s grandmother, testified that she was in the house \u201call the time\u201d on January 13, 1989, the day of the incident. She further testified that she remained in the living room and the kitchen area \u201call the time\u201d A. and K. were in her home and that defendant was never alone with the children that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>[At the request of the Appellate Division, Points II-V of its opinion, rejecting defendant\u2019s contentions addressed to the conviction, are deleted].</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Defendant claims that the convictions must merge. The State notes, however, that our Supreme Court has held that sexual assault and endangering do not merge. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 120-21, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987). The defendant, nevertheless, argues that <em>Miller </em>related to \u201cparental endangering\u201d whereas this case did not. We agree and order merger, at least in these circumstances where the record suggests no basis for the endangering conviction beyond the sexual assault. The parent in <em>Miller </em>there had a legal duty to his daughter. The <em>Miller </em>Court spoke of \u201cthe violation of the duty that a parent owes to a child,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 118-119, 527 A.2d 1362, and stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">[w]e do not denigrate the effect of a sexual assault on a child even when it is committed by someone she does not know. However, we think it is clear that the effect is not the same as when the abuse is committed by a parent whom the child depends on and trusts. <em>[Id. </em>at 120, 527 A.2d 1362].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The Court concluded \u201c[i]n sum we hold that defendant\u2019s convictions for aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child do not merge,\u201d <em>id., </em>but added, \u201c[although both convictions are based on the same general conduct, the latter offense is also directed at the defendant\u2019s violation of his parental duty,\u201d which we note is a duty which transcends the isolated sexual act or acts. <em>See also State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 377-78, 537 A.2d 667 (1988) (applying the <em>Miller </em>\u201creasoning and holding\u201d to merge endangering into an aggravated sexual assault by a grandfather, but stating that under the <em>Miller </em>rationale \u201cthe child endangerment conviction was \u2018also directed at the defendant\u2019s violation of his parental duty,\u2019 \u201d 109 <em>N.J. </em>at 377, 537 A.2d 667, quoting <em>Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 121, 527 A.2d 1362). Here the defendant was not a parent and was not even the baby sitter herself, and no legal duty is asserted to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>been owed by him to the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was convicted of fourth\u2014 not third \u2014 degree endangering, and we merge the convictions even though the sentences were concurrent. <em>See e.g., State v. Dillihay, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>42, 601 <em>A.2d </em>1149 (1992); <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>462, 588 A.2d 816 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The judgment of conviction for sexual assault is affirmed. The matter is remanded for a corrected judgment merging count two into count one.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">At a pretrial <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing, the trial judge ruled that the victim\u2019s statements to his mother and D.Y.F.S. workers were admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"><em>See State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 369-371, 378, 537 A.2d 667 (1988); <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Further, there was no special verdict addressed to the basis for the endangering conviction beyond the sexual assault, and the record does not suggest an independent basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
