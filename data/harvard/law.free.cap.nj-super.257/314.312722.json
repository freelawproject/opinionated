(AHSA) and the officers of AHSA, essentially for their failure to choose her as a member of the American team which competed at the 1990 World Equestrian Championship in Stockholm. In a seven count complaint, plaintiffs Deborah Dolan and her horse farm, Sagamore Farms, Inc., charge violation of the federal Amateur Sports Act, 36 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 371, <em>et seq.; </em>false representations with respect to the selection procedures and criteria; negligent representations with respect to the selection procedures and criteria; breach of promise with respect to the selection procedures and criteria; breach of promise to permit her to compete as a member of the team after she had been selected; and fraudulent actions by the officers of the defendant United States Equestrian Team, Inc. (defendants William Steinkraus, Frank Chapot, Linda Allen and George Morris) to deprive her of her selection as a member of the team and malicious interference by those officers with her contractual right to compete as a member of the team.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The matter came before the trial judge on a series of motions by the different defendants which taken together essentially sought a dismissal for failure to state a cause of action, <em>see R. </em>4:6-2, and/or a summary judgment as a matter of law, there being no genuine dispute as to any material facts, <em>see R. </em>4:46-1. Although some argument is raised by plaintiffs as to the procedural propriety of the consideration of the motions as brought under both rules, we are satisfied that the court was procedurally correct in its interpretation of the moving papers and that, in any event, plaintiffs were not unfairly surprised or prejudiced by those rulings. <em>See State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>400, 428, 129 A.2d 417 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>In an oral opinion of January 28, 1991, the trial judge dismissed the complaint on alternative grounds: (1) whether viewed under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e) or under <em>R. </em>4:46-2, Ms. Dolan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has no cognizable cause of action citing <em>Rutledge v. Gulian, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>113, 124, 459 <em>A.</em>2d 680 (1983); <em>Higgins v. American Society of Clinical Pathologists, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>191, 202, 238 A.2d 665 (1968); and <em>Loigman v. Trombadore, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 449-450, 550 A.2d 154 (App.Div.1988), <em>i.e., </em>the complaint failed to allege a cause of action; (2) there was a failure to exhaust her administrative remedies; and (3) there was a failure to join an indispensable party, Ms. Kursinski.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Because we are satisfied that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred by a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, we do not consider the other grounds upon which the trial court based its decision nor other contentions raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Participation in international sports competitions on behalf of this country is governed by the federal Amateur Sports Act, 36 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 371 <em>et seq. </em>The Act and its legislative history have been exhaustively examined and carefully analyzed by a number of federal Courts of Appeal. <em>Behagen v. Amateur Basketball Ass\u2019n of US., </em>884 <em>F.2d </em>524 (10th Cir.1989), <em>cert. den., </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>918, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1947, 109 L.Ed.2d 310, (1990); <em>Oldfield v. Athletic Congress, </em>779 <em>F.2d </em>505 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Michels v. United States Olympic Committee, </em>741 <em>F.2d </em>155 (7th Cir. 1984); also <em>Devereaux v. Amateur Softball Ass\u2019n of America, </em>768 <em>F.Supp. </em>618 (S.D.Ohio 1991). Any further comment in this regard by us would be mere redundancy. It is sufficient to understand that an important feature of the Act is its provision for the use of administrative procedures to resolve disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The prompt resolution of disputes was a principal purpose of the Act. <em>See Michels v. United States Olympic Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>mittee, supra, </em>157; <em>Oldfield v. Athletic Congress, supra, </em>506-507; <em>also San Fran. Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S.O.C., </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>522, 544, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2971, 2985, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>427, 453 (1987) (\u201cThe Amateur Sports Act was enacted \u2018to correct the disorganization and the serious factional disputes that seemed to plague amateur sports in the United States\u2019\u201d). One of the enumerated purposes of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the vehicle created by Congress to coordinate amateur athletics and national governing bodies, was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbZ\">provide for the swift resolution of conflicts and disputes involving amateur athletes, national governing bodies, and amateur sports organizations, and protect the opportunity of any amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official to participate in amateur athletic competition ... [36 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 374(8)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">To this end the USOC was empowered to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">facilitate, through orderly and effective administrative procedures, the resolution of conflicts or disputes which involve any of its members and any amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, official, national governing body <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, or amateur sports organization and which arise in connection with their eligibility for and participation in the Olympic Games, the Pan-American world championship competition, or other protected competition as defined in the constitution and bylaws of the [USOC]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ... [36 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 375(a)(5).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">and was required to establish an appropriate mechanism in its constitution and bylaws.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">In its constitution and bylaws, the [USOC] shall establish and maintain provisions for the swift and equitable resolution of disputes involving any of its members and relating to the opportunity of an amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official to participate in the Olympic Games, the Pan-American Games, world championship competition, or other such protected competition as defined in such constitution and bylaws.

Amateur Basketball Ass'n of U.S., supra, </em>at 531; <em>Oldfield v. Athletic Congress, supra, </em>508; <em>Michels v. United States Olympic Committee, supra, </em>at 158; <em>Devereaux v. Amateur Softball Ass\u2019n of America, supra, </em>623; <em>DeFrantz v. United States Olympic Com., </em>492 <em>F.Supp. </em>1181, 1192 (D.D.C.1980), aff\u2019d, 701 <em>F.2d </em>221 (D.C.Cir.1980). We are persuaded as to the correctness of those views and satisfied that we should follow them. The comprehensive provisions for arbitration, as well as the legislative history, clearly demonstrate a congressional determination that disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Moreover, we believe the Act should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>be uniformly interpreted; that it would be inappropriate to attribute different or unique meanings to its provisions in New Jersey and thus create a jurisdictional sanctuary from the Congressional determination that these types of disputes should be resolved outside the judicial processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We agree with the trial judge that there is nothing unfair about requiring plaintiff to exhaust her administrative remedies. As we noted in <em>Alicea v. NTS., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 134, 581 A.2d 900 (App.Div.1990), aff'd, 128 <em>N.J. </em>303, 608 A.2d 218 (1992), a plaintiff who is required to rely on a non-judicial procedure is not remediless. And we agree with Judge Posner that courts are hardly suitable to determine the eligibility, or the procedure for determining the eligibility, of athletes to participate on our behalf in international competitions. <em>Michels v. United States Olympic Committee, supra, </em>159 (concurring opinion). <em>See also Mercury Bay Boating v.
