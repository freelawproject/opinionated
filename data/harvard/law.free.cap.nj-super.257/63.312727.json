The issue is whether a person who is not a public servant may, nevertheless, be guilty of the crime of official misconduct, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2, as an accomplice or co-conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2, the official misconduct statute, criminalizes certain acts of public servants. Harold Mosee was not a public servant at the time the alleged acts were committed. Count two of the indictment alleged that Lillian Bryant, as supervisor of the Atlantic City Landlord-Tenant Affairs Office, was a public servant, that she had the power to influence rent increases for rental units within Atlantic City and \u201cthat the said Lillian Bryant directly and indirectly through the said Harold Mosee, did agree to accept and accept $2,000 in United States currency from Albert Black, as compensation for the said Lillian Bryant\u2019s calculation and recommendation of rental increases for\u201d certain rental units in Atlantic City \u201ccontrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Count nine alleged that Sylvetta Pilgrim, as an employee of the Atlantic City Landlord-Tenant Affairs Office, was a public servant, and that the \u201csaid Harold Mosee and the said Sylvetta Pilgrim, directly and indirectly through said Harold Mosee, did agree to accept and accept $300 in United States currency from Albert Black ... as compensation for the said Sylvetta Pilgrim\u2019s calculation and recommendation of rental increases\u201d for certain rental units in Atlantic City \u201ccontrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Prior to trial, the State moved for a ruling regarding the sufficiency of the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See R. </em>3:10-1. The defendant Harold Mosee cross-moved to dismiss the indictment. <em>Id.; R. </em>3:10-2. After oral argument, the motion judge ruled \u201cthat the law is, and properly should be, that only a person who is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>public servant can be found guilty of misconduct in office. Mr. Mosee not being a public servant cannot be found guilty of that offense even as an accomplice or co-conspirator.\u201d We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6a provides that a person is guilty of an offense \u201cif it is committed by his own conduct or the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, or both.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6b provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">b. A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">(3) He is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of an offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">(4) He is engaged in a conspiracy with such other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">c. A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">(1) With the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense; he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">(a) Solicits such other person to commit it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">(b) Aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-14\">(c) Having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to make proper effort so to do; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">(2) His conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">The State\u2019s theory is that Mosee, though not a public servant, introduced Black to Bryant and Pilgrim and facilitated their corrupt relationship. Thus, the State\u2019s primary legal theory is that Mosee is guilty of official misconduct because he was legally accountable for the conduct of Bryant and Pilgrim as an accomplice. The State also contends that Mosee was legally accountable for Bryant and Pilgrim\u2019s misconduct because he was engaged in a conspiracy with them as charged in count one of the indictment. Defendant contends that being a public servant is an element of the offense of official misconduct, that he was not a public servant and, therefore, that he lacked capacity to commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:2-6d (hereafter \u00a7 6d) anticipates the defense of lack of capacity. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular offense himself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by another person for whose conduct he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing his incapacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">This section is consistent with and codifies pre-existing law in New Jersey. <em>See State v. Warady, </em>78 <em>N.J.L. </em>687, 691, 75 <em>A. </em>977 (E. &amp; A.1909) (defendant convicted of bigamy as aider and abettor); <em>State v. Marshall, </em>97 <em>N.J.L. </em>10, 12, 116 <em>A. </em>691 (Sup.Ct.1921) (defendant may be convicted, as aider and abettor, of crime of embezzlement by a tax collector, though defendant not the tax collector; however, defendant may not so convicted if the tax collector is acquitted); <em>State v. Goldfarb, </em>96 <em>N.J.L. </em>61, 114 <em>A. </em>143 (Sup.Ct.1921) (wife convicted of assisting her husband in carnal abuse of a child); <em>see also Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, Volume II: Commentary </em>(hereafter <em>Commentary), </em>p. 59 (1971) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6d \u201cis a fair statement of existing law\u201d). <em>But cf. State v. Aiello, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 463, 221 A.2d 40 (App.Div.) (defendant who did not own building could not be convicted as an aider and abettor of statute making it a crime to own a building where gambling is carried on), <em>certif. denied, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>138, 224 A.2d 324 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>913, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>2106, 18 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 1351 (1967). The <em>Commentary </em>describes <em>Aiello </em>as \u201cout of step with the Code, with authorities elsewhere and with prior New Jersey authorities.\u201d <em>Commentary, supra, </em>p. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Section 6d is also consistent with established legal principles in other states. <em>See Watson v. State, </em>158 <em>Tenn. </em>212, 12 S.W.2d 375 (1928) (though defendant could not be convicted as a principal because he was not a public officer, he was amenable to prosecution as an aider and abettor); <em>Commonwealth v. Weldon, </em>159 <em>Pa.Super. </em>447, 48 A.2d 98 (Super.Ct.1946) (defendant, though not a bank employee, may be convicted as accomplice under statute applicable to embezzlement by a bank employee); <em>see also Jack Berman, Inc. v. District of Columbia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>132 A.2d 147 (D.C., Mun.Ct. of Appeals 1957) (though not a licensed automobile dealer, defendant could be convicted as aider and abettor); <em>cf. State v. Carter, </em>66 <em>Ariz. </em>12, 182 P.2d 90, 92 (1947) (female may be guilty of rape as accomplice, though not physically capable of rape); <em>People v. Medrano, </em>24 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>429, 321 N.E.2d 97 (App.Ct.1974) (female may be guilty of rape as accomplice, though statute defines crime as being perpetrated by a male). <em>See generally, </em>22 <em>C.J.S. Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 132 (1989); Annotation, <em>Criminal Responsibility Of One Co-Operating In Offense Which He Is Incapable of Committing Personally, </em>5 <em>A.L.R. </em>782 (1920), supplemented, 74 <em>A.L.R. </em>1110 (1931) and 131 <em>A.L.R. </em>1322 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Defendant offers no sound reason grounded in public policy or in the criminal code not to apply \u00a7 6d in this case. Misconduct by public officials frequently is encouraged, aided and facilitated by persons outside government<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, therefore, accomplice liability is consistent with the statutory aims of deterrence and punishment implicit in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2. Consequently, we conclude that the last clause of \u00a7 6d is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Defendant relies on <em>State v. Williams, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 458 A.2d 1295 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>543, 468 A.2d 193 (1983); <em>State v. Penta, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 316 A.2d 733 (Law Div.1974) and <em>State v. Indelicato, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 210 A.2d 233 (Law Div.1965). These decisions are inapposite. Each addressed the narrow issue of whether the defendant was a public officer. Accomplice liability was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The order appealed from is reversed and counts two and nine are reinstated as to defendant Harold Mosee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Apparently the State considered the issue to be problematic because of a prior adverse ruling during trial in a related case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">One of the alternative elements of the crime is that the public servant acts 'with purpose to obtain a benefit for himself <em>or another.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
