(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Defendant Keene Corporation\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from an adverse verdict in this asbestos personal injury litigation requires us to address the issue of whether a plaintiff in a failure to warn products liability case may rely upon what has frequently been referred to as the \u201cheeding presumption\u201d in proving proximate cause. Although other states have adopted such a presumption in failure to warn cases, we have not yet addressed the issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>We now hold that plaintiffs in failure to warn asbestos products liability litigation may avail themselves of the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In 1951 when he was 27 years old, plaintiff George Coffman began his employment as an electrician at the naval shipyard in Philadelphia. In that capacity, plaintiff worked in cramped, confined, interiors of the various ships, carriers, or submarines that were being serviced, overhauled or constructed at the shipyard. Renovation or overhaul of a vessel entailed the removal of old, and the subsequent installation of new, asbestos insulation on pipes, boilers, and other surfaces throughout a. vessel. Consequently, during a renovation or overhaul, asbestos dust and fibers were everywhere; they permeated the closed, shipboard environment as old insulation was ripped out and new insulation was installed. There was very little ventilation on board the ships during such overhauls because usually the ship\u2019s ventilation system was removed at the beginning of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Plaintiff worked in the asbestos-laden environment of numerous naval vessels for varying amounts of time from April 1951 through July 1969, when he retired from the shipyard. During this period Keene was a chief supplier of asbestos insulating products installed on ships at the shipyard. There were no health warnings on any of the asbestos products Keene supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Following his retirement from the shipyard in 1969, plaintiff began working at the Defense Industrial Supply Center in Philadelphia. During that employment, he had very little exposure to asbestos products. However, plaintiff did develop Paget\u2019s disease \u2014 a degenerative bone condition \u2014 while so employed and, because of that disease, he retired from federal service on a disability pension in 1976. From 1979 through 1988, plaintiff held a series of five jobs but was not exposed to asbestos dust or fibers while employed at any of those work places. In 1988, he retired from all employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In the summer of 1985 plaintiff sought medical treatment for another ailment and became aware of his asbestos-related medical problem at that time. He was referred to a radiologist who x-rayed his chest. The x-rays, he was told, showed he had an asbestos-related disease. A pulmonary specialist, Dr. William Morowitz, determined he had extensive scarring on both lungs and asbestos fibers in his lungs. Dr. Morowitz diagnosed asbestosis and informed plaintiff an annual medical monitoring was necessary to detect any developing lung cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">When plaintiff learned he had asbestosis, he was shocked, angry, and frightened. He recalled he had watched as a brother-in-law wasted away and died from asbestos-induced cancer at an earlier time. As a result, he testified at trial that he lived in \u201c... constant worry, constant fear\u201d that a similar fate awaited him.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">During trial Keene requested the jurors be charged \u201c... they must specifically find that the lack of a warning was the proximate cause of the injury____\u201d As part of this request, the judge was also asked to tell the jury \u201cthey must find that the plaintiff would [not] have followed a warning had a warning been there.\u201d He rejected both requests. As to the latter, he said \u201c[t]he law is to the contrary. It is presumed that [if] there was one [a warning] that he would follow [it].\u201d As to proximate cause, then, the trial judge instructed the jury plaintiff had to prove he incurred an asbestos-related injury which was proximately caused by the asbestos products. Specifically, the judge explained \u201c[b]y proximate cause is meant that the defendants\u2019 product was an efficient cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, that is, it was a substantial or significant factor in bringing about the injury.\u201d He thus gave a medical causation charge but did not give a defective product causation charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The jury returned a verdict finding plaintiff had an asbestos-related injury, that seven of the nine named defendants (including Keene and Owens) had substantially contributed to that injury, and that Keene and Owens were 15% and 20% respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>sible, respectively, for that injury. The jury awarded plaintiff $300,000 in damages for pain and suffering. The jury also found that plaintiff had a reasonable fear of cancer brought on by his exposure to defendants' asbestos. To compensate him for this emotional distress, the jury awarded him $100,000. Finally, the jury determined that Coffman had proven his need for future medical surveillance and awarded him $6,000 to meet that <em>ongoing </em>future expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">On appeal, Keene argues the failure to instruct the jury plaintiff must prove, not only that the exposure to defendants\u2019 product was a proximate cause of medical injuries, but also that the absence of a warning on the product was a proximate cause of harm, was reversible error. Additionally it contends there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict of 15% responsibility for plaintiff\u2019s injuries and that the amount of damages for pain and suffering and fear of cancer was excessive. Finally it challenges an award of prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">It is not disputed that in order to establish strict liability a plaintiff must prove, in addition to a defect in the product, the element of proximate causation. In fact, in asbestos failure to warn cases, there are two separate components to a plaintiff\u2019s causation burden of proof. The asbestos-related injuries must be shown to have been proximately caused by exposure to a defendant\u2019s product (\u201cmedical causation\u201d). <em>Sholtis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 30-31, 568 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1989). In addition, and pertinent to this appeal, plaintiff must prove the defect in the product was a proximate cause of harm. <em>Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>198, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>209, 485 A.2d 305 (1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Here, the alleged defect is not the asbestos product itself, exposure to which medically caused injuries, but the failure to provide warnings. As a result, plaintiff was required to prove as an element of proximate causation, that the absence of a warning was a proximate cause of harm. <em>Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 209, 485 A.2d 305; <em>Michalko v. Cooke Color &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>386, 402, 451 A.2d 179 (1982). <em>See also Whitehead v. St. Joe Lead Co., Inc., </em>729 <em>F.2d </em>238, 248-49, 255 (3rd Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In a failure to warn case, establishing that the absence of a warning was a substantial factor in the harm alleged to have resulted from exposure to the product itself is particularly difficult. If the plaintiff dies from exposure to the product or its use, evidence of whether a label was or was not read or would or would not have been read may be impossible. Moreover, whether a warning, had one been provided, would or would not have been followed may be speculative, involving consideration not only of the particular individual involved but also the nature of his or her employment and whether he or she would have had some alternative choice. In response to these considerations in failure to warn cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">It has been suggested that the law should supply the presumption that an adequate warning would have been read. \u201cWhere warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read and heeded.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A, Comment j (1965). See Note, 50 <em>Texas L.\u00a3ev. </em>577 (1972). Such a presumption works in favor of the manufacturer when an adequate warning is present. Where there is no warning, as in this case, however, the presumption that the user would have read an adequate warning works in favor of the plaintiff user. In other words, the presumption is that [the plaintiff] would have read an adequate warning. The presumption, may, however, be rebutted if the manufacturer comes forward with contrary evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>presumed fact did not exist. <em>Sudduth v. Commonwealth County Mutual Ins. Co., </em>454 <em>S.W.2d </em>196 (Tex.1970); <em>Southland Life Ins. Co. v. Greenwade, </em>138 <em>Tex. </em>450, 159 <em>S.W.2d </em>854 (1942); 1 McCormick &amp; Ray, <em>Texas Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 53 (1956). Depending upon the individual facts, this may be accomplished by the manufacturer\u2019s producing evidence that the user was blind, illiterate, intoxicated at the time of the use, irresponsible or lax in judgment or by some other circumstance tending to show that the improper use was or would have been made regardless of the warning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\"><em>[Technical Chem. Co. v. Jacobs, </em>480 S.W.2d 602, 606 (Tex.1972)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Similarly, the Indiana Court of Appeals has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">The issue of causation in both negligence and strict liability cases wherein the defect is in design or manufacture differs fundamentally from causation in failure to warn cases. In the former, it is generally required that the plaintiff establish a causal connection in fact by proof that the harm resulted from the condition or ingredient that made the product defective. In the latter case, however, the difference arises in that the factor rendering the product defective is separable from the product itself. Applying the causation in fact test to the failure to warn case would give rise to a doctrine that liability is predicated upon a showing by the plaintiff that he would have suffered no injury but for the absence of warning. Stated differently, the plaintiff would be required to show that he would have heeded a warning had one been given. In our opinion, such an approach would undermine the purpose behind the doctrine of strict tort liability since any such testimony would generally be speculative at best. A more reasonable approach which represents a compromise within the framework of strict liability as suggested in <em>Technical Chemical Co. v. Jacobs </em>(Supreme Court of Texas 1972), 480 <em>S.W.2d </em>602, and discussed at 53 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>239 and 50 <em>Texas L.Rev. </em>577 (1972); is that the law should supply the presumption that an adequate warning would have been read and heeded, thereby minimizing the obvious problems of proof of causation. We find such an approach to be meritorious, workable, and desirable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">Placing the burden of rebutting the presumption of causation on the manufacturer in failure to warn cases is not inconsistent with the policies behind strict liability. It would encourage manufacturers to provide safe products and to warn of the known dangers in the use of the product which might cause injury. Such a presumption would also discourage those manufacturers who would rather risk liability than provide a warning which would impair the marketability of the product. The presumption of causation in failure to warn cases is not to be taken as an abrogation of the issue of causation, thereby subjecting a manufacturer to liability for almost any injury caused by his product. Rather, it merely shifts to the manufacturer the burden of proof where the fact-finder could only speculate as to whether the injury could have been prevented by a warning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\"><em>[Nissen Trampoline Co. v. Terre Haute First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>332 N.E.2d 820, 826-27 (Ind.Ct.App.1975), <em>rev\u2019d on procedural grounds, </em>265 <em>Ind. </em>457, 358 <em>N.E.2d </em>974 (1976)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>This presumption is premised upon Section 402A, Kestatement (Second) of Torts (1965), Comment j. That Comment provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if it is followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We recognize Comment j benefits the seller or manufacturer where an adequate warning has been provided. However a logical corollary of Comment j is that the buyer or user should benefit where a warning is not given. Thus, if the seller or manufacturer is entitled to a presumption that an adequate warning will be read and heeded, a plaintiff should be entitled to the same presumption when no warning is given. <em>See Reyes v. Wyeth Laboratories, </em>498 <em>F.2d </em>1264, 1281 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 <em>US. </em>1096, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>687, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>688 (1974); <em>Nissen Trampoline Co. v. Terre Haute First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>332 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 826; <em>Butz v. Werner, </em>438 <em>N.W.2d </em>509, 516 (N.D.1989); <em>Seley v. G.D.

Ford Motor Co., </em>6 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>346, 376 <em>N.E.2d </em>143, 147 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">An adequate warning is by definition one that would in the ordinary course have come to the user\u2019s attention. The failure to give such a warning therefore permits the inference that it would have alerted the user to the danger and forestalled the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Comment j has repeatedly been construed to provide a rebut-table presumption in failure to warn cases assisting plaintiffs in establishing proximate cause as to the defect. <em>See e.g., Reyes v. Wyeth Laboratories, </em>498 <em>F.2d </em>at 1281 (applying Texas law); <em>Dias v.

Raney v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., </em>897 <em>F.2d </em>94 (2d Cir.1990) (heeding presumption not applicable under New York law but fact that plaintiff would have heeded a warning can be inferred). <em>Contra Potthoff v. Alms, </em>41 <em>Colo.App. </em>51, 583 P.2d 309, 311 (1978) (\u201c[w]e have found no case authority construing Comment j to create a special presumption concerning proximate causation. We conclude that, at least as to an obviously dangerous machine ... whether the user of a product would have acted in the same manner had a proper warning been given is normally a question of fact on which a jury, unaided by presumptions and guided only by the evidence before it, is best qualified to speak.\u201d). <em>See also Thomas v. Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., </em>949 P.2d 806, 812-814, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>957 F.2d 869 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2304, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>226 (1992) (rejecting rebuttable \u201cheeding\u201d presumption under Mississippi law in a failure to warn drug prescription case in the context of an \u201cunavoidable risk\u201d and requiring proof that the risk was sufficiently high that it would have changed the treating physician\u2019s decision to prescribe the drug had he been adequately warned).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>We think Comment j provides ample support for application of the rebuttable \u201cheeding\u201d presumption in an asbestos failure to warn case to assist a plaintiff in proving the absence of a warning proximately caused harm. Although not directly acknowledging the existence of such a presumption under our law, we think this result was suggested by the Supreme Court in <em>Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>when Justice Schreiber said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">Indeed, plaintiff made little, if any, showing that with a proper warning the accident would not have occurred. Although there may be some question whether plaintiff sustained his burden of proving causation ... we are of the opinion that the matter should be remanded for a new trial. <em>See also </em>Twerski, \u201cSeizing the Middle Ground Between Rules and Standards in Design Defect Litigation: Advancing Directed Verdict Practice in the Law of Torts,\u201d 57 <em>N.Y.U.L.Rev. </em>521, 562 (1982) (noting that in failure to warn products liability cases some courts [footnote omitted] have helped plaintiffs overcome the burden of proof by positing a rebuttable presumption that the warning would have been heeded if given). [98 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, 485 A.2d 305].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We recognize in <em>Campos </em>such a presumption was not applied to the particular facts. Indeed, it does not appear plaintiff argued the existence of the presumption. The focus in <em>Campos, </em>rather, was whether plaintiff\u2019s alleged subjective knowledge of a danger or warning as a matter of law was not required. Plaintiff there had previously been injured in a similar incident and he thus was arguably already aware of the need to protect himself. There, thus, was a substantial issue as to whether plaintiff would have heeded a warning. Conversely, in <em>Vallillo v. Muskin Corp., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 514 A.2d 528 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>624, 546 A.2d 540 (1988), we concluded plaintiff\u2019s prior knowledge of the dangers associated with diving into a shallow pool, as a matter of law, established that the alleged defect, an inadequate warning, was not a proximate cause of any harm \u2014 i.e. even had an adequate warning been given, plaintiff would not have heeded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Here it is true plaintiff presented no evidence that had there been a warning he would have taken some action to protect himself. We have held, however, that he was entitled to rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>upon the rebuttable presumption that had a warning been present, he would have heeded it. Defendant presented no evidence to the contrary. The most it has argued is that plaintiffs testimony he used no safety devices while he was working at the shipyard, sufficiently rebuts the presumption so as to present an issue for the jury. We find this argument somewhat disingenuous for plaintiff also testified there were no safety devices available. <em>See Magro v. Ragsdale Bros., Inc., </em>721 <em>S.</em>W.2d at 834 (\u201claxity in judgment\u201d unrelated to reading or heeding safety information and occurring after exposure to product insufficient to overcome presumption, and causation found as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Where, as here, defendant produces no evidence to overcome the presumption, a trial judge need not submit the issue of proximate cause arising from the absence of a warning to the jury but may determine as a matter of law a warning would have been heeded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Reyes v. Wyeth Laboratories, </em>498 F.2d at 1281 (\u201c[wjhere a consumer, whose injury the manufacturer should have reasonably foreseen, is injured by a product sold without a required warning, a rebuttable presumption will arise that the consumer would have read any warning provided by the manufacturer, and acted so as to minimize the risks. In the absence of evidence rebutting the presumption, a jury finding that the defendant\u2019s product was the producing cause [medical causation] of the plaintiff\u2019s injury would be sufficient to hold him liable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Keene argues plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmedical causation\u201d evidence was insufficient to support a 15% apportionment against it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Plaintiff testified he worked at the shipyard from April 1951 through July 1969 as an electrician directly engaged in shipbuilding, renovation, maintenance, and overhaul and that as part of his job he daily worked side-by-side in crowded quarters with coemployees from various trades, including asbestos pipe insulators. In the course of that work, asbestos dust and fibers filled the air he breathed. This condition was aggravated by the fact the ventilation system on the vessel being serviced was almost always removed at the beginning of any overhaul or renovation operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The role of Keene\u2019s products in plaintiff\u2019s exposure to asbestos fibers was primarily established through the testimony of George Watts, a retired supervisor of the shipyard\u2019s pipe insulating section. Watts established that Keene\u2019s predecessor company<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was a chief supplier of asbestos insulation products to the shipyard during the period plaintiff worked as an electrician. Watts testified that Keene\u2019s products were used throughout the shipyard on a daily basis during this period and that electricians such as plaintiff \u2014 who necessarily worked in close proximity to pipe insulators \u2014 would be exposed to asbestos dust from those products every day. He specifically said that Keene\u2019s products and those of its predecessor were used in all the vessels worked on at the yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We said in <em>Sholtis v.

What has principally concerned us here is proof that each plaintiffs exposure to each defendant\u2019s asbestos was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s disease, <em>i.e., </em>that the exposure was a substantial factor in causing or exacerbating the disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">To prove an exposure was a substantial factor in causing or exacerbating the disease, we held a plaintiff must prove \u201can exposure of sufficient frequency, with a regularity of contact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>and with the product in close proximity____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 568 A.2d 1196. This \u201cfrequency, regularity and proximity\u201d test, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">... appears to us to be well-reasoned, properly focusing upon the cumulative effects of the exposure. It is a fair balance between the needs of plaintiffs (recognizing the difficulty of proving contact) and defendants (protecting against liability predicated on guesswork). Industry should not be saddled with such open-ended exposure based upon \u201ca casual or minimal contact.\u201d ... Yet the phraseology should not supply \u201ccatch words;\u201d the underlying concept should not be lost. Since proof of direct contact is almost always lacking, especially in bystander cases, courts must rely upon circumstantial proof of sufficiently intense exposure to warrant liability, [Id. at 29, 568 A.2d 1196. (citations omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Thus, the jury here was instructed: \u201c[i]n determining whether a particular defendant\u2019s asbestos product constituted a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiff\u2019s injury you must consider whether there has been an exposure of sufficient frequency with regularity of contact and with the product in close proximity rather than casual or minimal contact.\u201d We think such an exposure reasonably could have been found by the jury from the testimony of plaintiff and Watts. According to that testimony, plaintiff worked daily over a period of years in cramped shipboard environments permeated with asbestos dust and fibers. The testimony also reveals that Keene was a chief supplier of asbestos insulating products to the shipyard during this period and that these products were used on all the ships worked on. This evidence was more than sufficient to show plaintiff was exposed to Keene\u2019s products in the long-term course of his employment and that that exposure was of sufficient frequency, regularity and proximity to have been a substantial factor in causing his asbestos-related injuries to a percentage of 15%.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Thus Keene\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial was properly denied. Accepting as true all the evidence favoring plaintiff and the inferences therefrom, the jury could reasonably have concluded Keene\u2019s asbestos products had medically-proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>R. </em>4:40-2(b); <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). The motion for a new trial was properly denied because, in light of the evidence presented at trial, and \u201chaving given due regard to the opportunity of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d we cannot say there clearly and convincingly was a miscarriage of justice under the law when the jury imposed liability on Keene for 15% of the damages awarded to plaintiff. <em>R. </em>4:49-l(a); <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>Feldman v. Lederle Laboratories, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>429, 462-463, 479 A.2d 374 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Keene contends the trial judge erred when he refused to order a new trial on damages or, alternatively, a remittitur. It argues the evidence did not support the quantum of damages awarded by the jury on plaintiffs claims for his pain and suffering and for his fear of cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">At trial plaintiff presented medical testimony from two physicians: Drs. Pope and Morowitz. Concerning the pain and suffering claim, Dr. Pope testified plaintiff has \u201cextensive asbestos related pleural disease and he has asbestosis.\u201d Dr. Pope opined that his review of an x-ray of plaintiffs lungs revealed \u201c... a classic picture of asbestosis as well as a classic picture of extensive pleural plaqueing and thickening.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Morowitz testified that plaintiff had \u201c... bilateral pleural thickening and calcification\u201d from his exposure to asbestos. Dr. Morowitz opined plaintiff had asbestosis and extensive pleural scarring. According to them, plaintiffs conditions were untreatable and progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Concerning his fear of cancer claim, plaintiff testified to his anger and fright when he learned in the summer of 1985 that he had developed asbestosis and explained how his fright is magnified by the experience of his brother-in-law, who had physically wasted and died from cancer brought on by asbestosis. Moreover, plaintiff stated that his physicians had told him that his asbestos disease was both untreatable and progressive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>and that he had to be medically monitored in case cancer developed. Keene, on the other hand, presented testimony from Dr. Jack Hyman, who opined that while plaintiff had extensive pleural thickening, scarring, and asbestos-related calcification on his lungs, he had no real pulmonary impairment and did not suffer from asbestosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In denying Keene\u2019s motion for a new trial on damages or remittitur, the judge concluded that Keene\u2019s medical witness\u2014 Dr. Hyman \u2014 was \u201ctotally incredible,\u201d while Drs. Pope and Morowitz were \u201clogical and highly believable.\u201d Moreover, the judge found plaintiff\u2019s testimony about his fear of cancer to be both unexaggerated and \u201cbelievable,\u201d noting his perception that plaintiff \u201c... has a genuine, real believable fear of cancer.\u201d We cannot say the damage verdict here constitutes a \u201cmiscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-1. The evidence produced by plaintiff, which the jury plainly accepted, showed the existence of asbestosis which is unbeatable and progressive, as well as a well-founded fear of cancer, both of which resulted from his exposure to Keene\u2019s asbestos. The damages awarded for these injuries and that fear do not appear to be so high as to be unjust under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Finally, Keene argues the award of prejudgment interest in this case was an abuse of discretion, characterizing this litigation as an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d Pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-ll(b) prejudgment interest is assessed upon a damage award in a products liability action, \u201c... provided that in exceptional cases the court may suspend the running of such prejudgment interest.\u201d The court\u2019s power to suspend prejudgment interest <em>\u201c... </em>should, however, be most cautiously exercised, and always with consideration of the underlying purpose and philosophy of the rule \u2014 namely that prejudgment interest is not a penalty but is rather a payment for the use of money.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment 8, <em>R. </em>4:42-ll(b) (1992). Keene argues this case is exceptional because the asbestos industry is financially troubled. We disagree and note that our decision in <em>Dall\u2019Ava v. H.W. Porter Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 488 A.2d 1036 (App.Div.1985) upon which Keene relies, is not to the contrary. In <em>Dall\u2019Ava, </em>we did not suspend all prejudgment interest, but rather only suspended that interest accruing during a four-month period when the litigation was judicially stayed because of the bankruptcy of a co-defendant, Johns-Manville. 199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 131, 488 A.2d 1036. Because the defendant in <em>Dall\u2019Ava </em>had no part in delaying the litigation, we reasoned that this was an \u201cexceptional case\u201d under <em>R. </em>4:42-11(b), and that the award of prejudgment interest would be unfair. <em>Id. </em>We viewed the four-month stay of proceedings in the <em>Dall\u2019Ava </em>case as \u201cno different than if the filing of the complaint had been delayed four months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Significantly, at no point did we imply prejudgment interest was being suspended because of some claim of financial difficulties of the asbestos industry arising from mass tort litigation. Instead, it was the court-ordered stay of proceedings that made the <em>Dall\u2019Ava </em>case \u201cexceptional.\u201d Moreover, we note no judgment awarding prejudgment interest has yet been entered and thus this issue is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">. The judgment entered on the jury verdict is, thus, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-14\">Plaintiff initially sued numerous asbestos manufacturers whose products he claimed he was exposed to. All but two of the defendants settled prior to trial; Keene and Owens-Illinois remained. Owens has, apparently, paid its judgment against it and has not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">We note in this respect the only judgment thus far entered on the record is the clerk\u2019s entry of a judgment in the amount of $406,000 with costs. There is no judgment granting prejudgment interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">To the extent plaintiff suggests this burden of proof in asbestos cases has been removed by <em>Beshada </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>191, 447 <em>A.2d </em>539 (1982), we disagree. <em>Beshada </em>concerns solely theelement of proving asbestos products are defective. It has nothing to do with the issue of causation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> Where a defendant does present evidence which rebuts the presumption and where there thus is a jury issue on defect causation, an issue arises as to whether and what the jury should be instructed concerning the presumption. We express no view on that issue. <em>But see Butz </em>v. <em>Werner, </em>438 <em>N.W.</em>2d at 517-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\">For the purposes of this case, it was stipulated at trial that predecessor liability applied to Keene.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
