J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">Plaintiff, in an automobile negligence case involving property damages only, seeks to reverse a district court judgment entered against him in favor of defendant New Jersey State Highway Department on its counterclaim. The case was tried without a jury. It is presented to us on an agreed statement in lieu of record. <em>B. B. </em>1:6 \u2014 2; <em>B. B. </em>2:6. The accident, on which the action was based, involved a collision between plaintiff\u2019s automobile and one owned by defendant New Jersey State Highway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Department and operated by its employee-agent, also a defendant. The trial court found that the negligence of the drivers of both vehicles proximately caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The single question presented is the legality of the trial court\u2019s determination that, because of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity, the defense of contributory negligence was not available to plaintiff in bar of the Highway Department\u2019s counterclaim, by which it sought to be compensated for the damage to its truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The record reveals that at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the court granted the Highway Department\u2019s motion \u201cto strike the complaint against it\u201d on the ground of its sovereign immunity. At the close of the entire case, after announcing its finding that both drivers were negligent, the court struck plaintiff\u2019s defense of contributory negligence and entered judgment for the Highway Department' on its counterclaim. The court based its action on the case of <em>Miller v. Layton, 132 N. J. L. </em>426 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945), affirmed 133 <em>N. J. L. </em>323 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945), which it deemed controlling:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Initially, plaintiff seeks to distinguish the cited case from the one at bar because in <em>Miller </em>the State sought a judgment to reimburse it for damage to its <em>real </em>property while here <em>personal </em>property loss only is involved. The difference in the character of the property damaged cannot determine the applicability of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Plaintiff next questions whether such a defense (governmental immunity) is \u201c \u2018appropriate\u2019 to a factual set-up involving an automobile collision with resultant personal property loss.\u201d He asserts: \u201cThis question was not before the court in <em>Miller v. Layton; it is </em>accordingly within this court\u2019s province to determine the issue unfettered by <em>stare decisis </em>and without trespassing on the exact holding of <em>Miller v. Layton.\u201d </em>In <em>Miller </em>a state-owned bridge was damaged by the negligent action of a motorist, and the contributory negligence of the state-employed bridge tender was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>asserted. In the case at bar a collision between two automobiles is involved and the driver of the state car was found to be contributorily negligent. This factual variance in the type of accident cannot afford a basis for holding the doctrine inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Plaintiff next asserts in Ms brief: \u201c* * * the doctrine of immunity of a State Agency is based on principles developed in relation to municipal corporations; the legal basis for such immunity as set forth in <em>Miller v. Layton </em>* * * is that a state agency cannot ho liable because a municipality is not so accountable for its torts.\u201d He cites in support of this thesis the opinion of the former Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>(132 Ar. <em>J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>427) and the opinion of the Court of Errors and Appeals in the same case (133 <em>N. J. L.. </em>at <em>page </em>326). He then refers to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:51 \u2014 3. obligating a municipality to pay a judgment recovered against an authorized driver of a municipally-owned motor ear if the municipality fails to have the driver covered by public liability insurance. He concludes that \u201cthe foundation of <em>Miller v. Lay</em>ton, narrowed by court decision, has been obliterated by the legislature. Without this foundation, the holding in <em>Miller v. Layton </em>has no legal support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The fallacy in these contentions is (a) that the State\u2019s immunity is not based on that of the municipalities, <em>Stephens v. Commissioners of Palisades Inter. Park, </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>500, 501 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1919), and (b) <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :51-3 has hv its terms no application to a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> Finally we come to appellant\u2019s argument that we need not and should not perpetuate the result reached in <em>Miller, supra. </em>We recognize that the New Jersey rule, as expressed in <em>Miller, </em>has been characterized as a minority view, 1 <em>A. L. E. 2d </em>827, 828, and that the doctrine of governmental immunity in certain other instances of its application has been the subject of critical comment. See the analysis by Justice Jacobs in <em>Taylor v. New Jersey Highway Authority, 22 N. J. </em>454, 470 (1956); the observations by Judge Jayne in his concurring opinion in <em>Casale </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>v. Housing Authority of City of Newark, </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>52, 62 <em>(App. Div. 1956); the </em>dissenting opinion by Judge Francis (now Justice Francis) in the same case (42 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>66); the dissenting opinion by Justice Perskie in <em>Miller (133 N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>326), and the opinion in <em>United States v. Moscow-Idaho Seed Co., </em>92 <em>F. 2d </em>170 (9 <em>Cir. </em>1937). However, as <em>Miller </em>is precisely in point and was a decision by the Court of Errors and Appeals we are bound by it as was the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
