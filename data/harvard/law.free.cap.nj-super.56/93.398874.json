United States Trucking Corp., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>430, 435 (1958), and <em>Ricciardi v. Marcalus Mfg. Co., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>445, 448 (1958), we have analyzed the evidence in the ease at bar \u201cto determine the facts and evaluate them.\u201d In doing so we have given \u201cdue regard to the opportunity of the hearer of the evidence to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Decedent, 46 years of age, suffered a heart attack on June 11, 1957, from which he died on June 24, 1957. The basic question before the Division and the County Court and presented by this appeal is whether or not the fatal attack was work-connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Decedent had been employed as a laborer by respondent for over five years next preceding June 11, 1957. He worked eight hours a day, five and one-half days a week. His general duties were reading and installing water meters, repairing leaks in water-service lines which required him to make street excavations; cleaning street gutters; annually, with other, municipal employees, transporting calcium chloride from the railroad station and storing it in the municipal garage and thereafter with others spreading the chloride on borough streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Meter reading was done quarter-annually and occupied about one month of decedent\u2019s time each quarter. The meters which he installed had a maximum weight of 35 pounds per meter. The repair of the water service lines required the use of a pick and shovel by decedent. He had to use the pick to penetrate the hard street surfaces and then dig to a depth of three feet to reach the pipe lines. This type of work was performed by decedent several times each year. The street cleaning work was performed bi-weekly and decedent\u2019s part in it would consume from one-half day to a full day. The work involved in storing and spreading calcium chloride entailed the transportation of several hundred bags of the material from the railroad station in Keyport to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>municipal garage in Union Beach, a distance of one mile. In .1957 a total of 700 bags of 100 pounds each were so transported. With the aid of a handtruek the bags were removed from a railroad car to a motor truck, then transported to the garage and there unloaded and piled. This work had been done by four men of Avhom decedent was one, and had occupied one day. It had been completed a few days before June 11. Seven trips were required to accomplish the transfer of the shipment of chloride. The evidence justifies the conclusion reached by the Deputy Director that this Avas heavier and harder work than that which decedent had been doing in the forenoon of June 11 and harder than the work which he was undertaking just before he became ill on that day, as hereinafter related.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The work of spreading the chloride on the streets commenced June 11 and took three days to complete. The record reveals that in that operation the chloride is loaded on a municipal truck, and as the work of spreading the material on the streets goes forward, the bags on the truck are lifted to a hopper thereon and by a spreader the material is applied to the street surfaces. On June 11 decedent arrived at the municipal water plant at 7:30 A. 51., worked there during the forenoon, had lunch between <em>12 </em>noon and <em>12 </em>:30 p. 5i. and then swept the floor of the building. In the afternoon he with others was assigned the task of loading a truck with calcium chloride preparatory to spreading the material on the streets. Eor that purpose, about 1 p. 5r. he went to the municipal garage, where the chloride had been stored as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Certain of decedent\u2019s co-workers testified that it was a hot day; the temperature was estimated by them to be 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, or, as described by one of the witnesses, \u201cin the 90\u2019s\u201d and \u201csticky.\u201d Co-employees of decedent estimated that it Avas possibly 10\u00b0 warmer and was \u201cstickier\u201d inside than outside of the building when decedent arrived at about 1 P. 11. on the day in question. However, climatological data introduced by respondent showed that on June 11, 1957 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>t\u00e9mperature readings at <em>the two </em>weather stations nearest to Union Beach, <em>i. </em>e., at Long Branch and at Sandy Hook, were a minimum of 51\u00b0 and a maximum of 79\u00b0 at the former, and a minimum of 56\u00b0 and a maximum of 81\u00b0 at' the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The municipal garage was made of galvanized iron: It was approximately 80 feet long, 40 to 60 feet wide (reflecting divergent estimates by witnesses), and 30 feet high. There was a large opening in front of the building where doors, formerly rotted and not repaired, had once been located. There were holes in the roof large enough to admit rain. It had one window at the front. Testimony was presented that there was no \u201ccross ventilation.\u201d However, the County Court found that photographs of the building received in evidence showed that the effect of the passage of time and the action of the elements had \u201cso perforated the metal roofing and sides as to permit some passage of any existing breeze or movements of air if such existed.\u201d The Deputy Director, questioning the soundness of the lay evidence that it was \u201chotter and stickier\u201d inside the building than outside, emphasized the location of the large open area where the doors had formerly been placed and the existence of \u201cplenty of open spaces throughout the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Decedent, with other employees of defendant, commenced the work of loading the 100-pound bags from the stacked piles to the truck. Decedent had been in the garage only about 15 minutes before he became ill. The work in the garage had not been continuous. Part of the time the workmen, including decedent, had been standing and talking. It was customary for two men to join in lifting one bag at a time to the tailboard of the truck where they were handled for placement on the truck by a third employee. Eollowing this practice, on June 11 decedent and a co-worker had, during the aforesaid 15 minutes, lifted two bags from the pile to the truck. After lifting the second bag decedent complained of feeling ill. The co-worker, Richard Tremley, who was on the truck receiving the bags, testified that Loew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>then said: \u201cDick, I don\u2019t feel good.\u201d According to the same witness decedent said that \u201che had pain in his stomach.\u201d In response to an inquiry from Tremley as to tile nature of his illness decedent pointed to his stomach, lie perspired and \u201clooked a little white.\u201d He went outdoors and sat on a bench in response to a suggestion from one of the workmen. In a few moments he was assisted to the water-works building approximately 100 feet from the garage. He again complained of \u201cpains in his stomach\u201d and perspired \u201csomething awful.\u201d An ambulance was called and he was removed to a hospital at about 2:30 p. w., where he was seen in the emergencj^ room by Dr. Herbert W. Engel, a specialist in internal medicine and hematology, who had been licensed to practice in Hew Jersey in 1955. Dr. Engel bad been called in consultation by a Dr. George Cowling, who did not testify in the cause. Decedent at the time he was first examined by Dr. Engel was \u201cbreathing heavily, quite pale, sweating, cold and clammy.\u201d His blood pressure had \u201cdropped\u201d and he was \u201ccomplaining of pain in the left anterior chest.\u201d A tentative diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made. Emergency treatment was given, <em>i. e., </em>oxygen, the institution of anti-coagulant therapy, sedation and analgesics. Dr. Engel continued as the attending physician until the date of death. The final diagnosis was \u201cacute myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis, pulmonary embolus and congestive heart failure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Following a recitation of the facts in hypothetical form, which included a reference to the aforesaid diagnosis made by him, Dr. Engel was asked the following question and gave the following answer as reflected in the record before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201cAssuming those facts, would you have an opinion with reasonable medical certainty as to the causal relationship between the activity in which he was engaged in the lifting of the bags coupled with the weather; in addition, an opinion which you hold with reasonable medical certainty as to the causal relationship between his work and the weather and the diagnoses which yon made? A. Well, I think there must be certainly a causal relationship because of the direct time relationship of the epigastric and substernal pain to the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>when the patient complained of pain, as I understand it \u2014 and, of course, I wasn\u2019t here for the other testimony \u2014 when he had lifted these two bags. * <em>* </em>* The man complained of pain at the time. We have on other occasions \u2014 and certainly this is documented in the literature, that there is a relation in large numbers of cases to the occurrence of strain and coronary, the occurrence, especially after eating, of coronaries. The weather may have had some factor to do with it as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">On cross-examination the record reveals the following further testimony given by Dr. Engel bearing on the issue as to whether decedent suffered an accident which was work-connected :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u2018\u2022Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not your patient had any circulatory disability prior to June 11, 1957? A. I had never seen the patient prior to June 11th, and, therefore, one cannot say conclusively. There certainly is that possibility. However\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">Q. Let me ask you this, Doctor: Could he have had a coronary occlusion on June 11, 1957, without some pre-existing circulatory or pathological changes? A. Yes. * * s;s * \u00a3 :\u00a1\u00a1 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">Q. What do you think Mr. Loew had before June 11, 1957? A. I cannot say with certainty whether or not he had pre-existing coronary artery disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">Q. Would an autopsy have shown that? A. It may and may not have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">Q. You said, as I understood you, that you thought you would have to say there was causal relationship during this fifteen minute interval when the deceased was in the shed because of the complaints of pain came in point of time at the same time? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">Q. Is that the only thing on which you base your opinion? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">Q. What other reason do you give? A. And also the history that is given of the excessive lifting of the bags at the time that \u2014 in other words-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">Q. You mean the hypothetical question or some history that you got somewhere? A. In the hypothetical question that Mr. Joel gave me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-14\">Q. Is there any other reason for your basis for your opinion? A. Regarding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-15\">Q. Regarding causal relationship? A. No, I cannot think of any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-16\">Q. So that because you are assuming there was excessive lifting and becatise you are assuming that at that time there was a complaint of pain, you feel that that is enough and that is the only basis for your opinion that there is causal relationship between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>coronary occlusion and what happened, or what the man was doing, in that fifteen minute interval; is that right? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">Q. By the way, not long before this June 1.1, 1957 occurrence, your patient with four other men, instead of lifting two of these bags, we assume had lifted about 150 bags. A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">Q. Why didn\u2019t it happen then? A. I can\u2019t give you an answer to that question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The record before us further reveals that Mr. Brower, the water superintendent of the municipality, described the decedent as a \u201cpretty slow worker on account of his weight\u201d; that he was a \u201clittle over-weight\u201d; that the decedent \u201cnever did feel very good\u201d; that he \u201cwould puff and blow, * * * you could toll that he had a little too much weight onto him when he was working hard * *</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The testimony of petitioner, called as a witness on her own behalf, was limited to proof that she was decedent\u2019s wife at the time of his death. She was not interrogated by her attorney as to the condition of her husband\u2019s health prior to his fatal attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">It is also noted by us that an extract from the record at the hospital, to which decedent was taken after his attack, sets forth under a caption \u201cPhysical Examination,\u201d dated June 11, 1957, the following: \u201cabdomen distended * * <em>* </em>liver enlarged * * * constipation.\u201d The \u201cProgress Record\u201d under the same date reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">\u201cPt referred for medical care following acute attack of substernai epigastric pain Apparently pt not normal for a period of 4-5 mos c [with] precordial pain &amp; distress today at 1 30/PM sudden precordial &amp; epigastric pain nausea, sweating \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Dr. Jerome 0. Kaufman, a doctor of internal medicine specializing in cardiology, called as a witness by respondent, testified that he had been practicing his profession since 1927. A hypothetical question, reciting the proofs in the case in substantially the same general form as set forth in the question propounded to the physician appearing on be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>half of petitioner, was presented to Dr. Kaufman. \u25a0 In response to interrogation as to whether or not there was \u201cany causation between Mr. Loew\u2019s work on June 11th for the Boro of Union Beach, and his heart attack which occurred on June 11th at between 1:00 and 1:15 in-the afternoon\u201d he stated: \u201cIt is my opinion that there is no causal relationship. That is based upon the facts within the hypothetical question because I fail to find any stress incident which could be, in my opinion, sufficient to contribute to the onset of the coronary occlusion.\u201d He stated that the symptoms exhibited by decedent when Dr. Engel first saw decedent represented a \u201ctypical reaction to a coronary occlusion.\u201d , The witness expressed the view that on the day in question decedent \u201cdeveloped an attack of heart disease known as a coronary occlusion, which is based on a pre-existing arteriosclerosis of - the coronary arteries; and this resulted in a myocardial infarction; which means death of the tissues due to a lack of blood supply.\u201d Ho added: \u201cArteriosclerosis is a natural common condition of man to-day. This was the natural <em>sequela </em>of that condition.\u201d He stated that the majority \u201cof people who develop coronary occlusion with infarction do so at rest.\u201d He expressed as his general opinion that \u201cit is infrequent that effort plays a role in the onset of occlusion\u201d and that \u201cmedically speaking, almost no case of coronary thrombosis is related to strain or stress.\u201d He noted, however, that a study in which he had participated had been conducted at one of the hospitals in this State in which 900 cases of coronary occlusion were reviewed of which there were 12% \u201cin which there was any probable relationship\u201d between the heart attack and effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On cross-examination he was queried with reference to the effect of lifting a 100-pound bag of calcium chloride. He answered that the \u201cbag was lifted by two people and I fail to see how lifting 50 pounds in weight by a laborer is anything which is excessive or strain * <em>* * </em>there are a great number of us who aren\u2019t laborers, who can lift and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>carry fifty pounds. * * * I don\u2019t believe that is a heavy load for a laborer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">With reference to heat and humidity and its possible relation to a heart attack he said that under \u201ccertain circumstances heat and humidity may be a factor.\u201d He testified that such reference was to \u201cmarked humidity, heat and exposure over a long period of time * * * several hours to a man who is accustomed to doing this five or six years every day of his working days. And a man who has been doing this kind of work as a laborer for five or six years, and exposed to all kinds of weather.\u201d He further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u2018\u2022THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR: Doctor, if I understand your testimony, you do not say in fact that effort, and the heat, and the humidity, could not under given auspices, be a competent producing cause of a coronary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">THE WITNESS: I have testified for the past fifteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">I believe that under given circumstances, stress or strain incidents can be a contributing factor and can be causally related to the onset of a myocardial infarction. And I so also believe today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR: And the question of causal relationship depends upon the fact of the particular case at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">THE WITNESS: That is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">The determination by the Deputy Director was dated March 17, 1958. This was prior to the date of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <em>Ciuba, v. Irvington Varnish &amp; Insulator Co., </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>127, decided May 26, 1958. The Deputy determined that the evidence did not \u25a0justify the conclusion that the decedent\u2019s death was the result of a coronary occlusion due to \u201cwork effort.\u201d He held that the evidence established that \u201cthe decedent was accustomed to working and on the day in question he performed something that he was accustomed to doing\u201d; that \u201cthe working conditions while they may have been somewhat different than usual,\u201d were not of such a character \u201cas to place upon the petitioner\u2019s heart any greater burden than that which his work ordinarily required.\u201d He stated that petitioner failed to satisfy him <em>\u201cby </em>the greater weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>reliable and credible testimony that the decedent suffered his coronary disaster as and when he did and did by reason thereof due to his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The appeal from the Division was argued orally July 18, 1958 before the County Court and the aforesaid judgment of that court from which the present appeal is taken was entered September 4, 1958. The County Court determined that it was \u201cobvious from the evidence that the work decedent was performing was not unusual nor more strenuous or laborious than many of the other duties of his job.\u201d The court noted that, by virtue of <em>Ciuba, supra, </em>(which decision as above stated had been rendered subsequent to the dismissal of the petition by the Division in the case at bar) it was no longer the law that recovery cannot be had unless the evidence justifies a finding that the employee was subjected to \u201cunusual strain.\u201d Despite the County Court\u2019s recognition of the principle enunciated in <em>Ciuba, </em>it found that petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof that decedent\u2019s death was causally related to his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In making our own evaluation of the evidence we recognize that \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is the standard of persuasion, that is to say, evidence in quality sufficient to generate belief that the tendered hypothesis is in all human likelihood the fact. * * * The measure of the weight of the evidence is \u2018the feeling of probability which it engenders.\u2019 <em>Joseph v. Passaic Hospital Association, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>557 (1958).\u201d <em>Ciuba, supra, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>pages </em>139, 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">It is recognized that, in measuring the weight of the evidence in a ease of this tjrpe, it is \u201cto be presumed that injury or death from heart disease is the result of natural physiological causes, and the onus is upon the claimant to prove by a preponderance of the probabilities that the employment was a contributing cause of the injury or death.\u201d <em>Ciuba, </em>at <em>page </em>138; <em>Yeomans v. Jersey City, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>496, 509 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Mr. Justice Heher in <em>Ciuba, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>139, cites with approval <em>Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>38.10, 38.20, 38.30, that \u201c \u2018by accident\u2019 is now deemed satisfied in most jurisdictions \u2018either if the cause was of an accidental character or if the effect was the unexpected <em>result </em>of routine performance of the claimant\u2019s duties,\u2019 and accordingly, \u2018if the strain of claimant\u2019s usual exertions causes collapse from heart weakness, back weakness, hernia and the like, the injury is held accidental.\u201d Emphasis supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Guided by the principles enunciated in <em>Ciuba, Yeomans, </em>and <em>Bober v. Independent Plating Corp., </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>160, 168 (1958), we have from our independent study of the record assessed the evidence and determined that the petitioner has not established by \u201ca preponderance of the probabilities\u201d <em>(Giuba, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>139) that decedent\u2019s death was the result of a \u201cservice-induced injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Our analysis of the evidence reveals certain significant features which lead to the aforesaid conclusion. Our attention is initially directed to the decedent\u2019s general poor condition prior to June 11, 1957, as described aforesaid by the water superintendent. We note also the aforesaid significant entries in the hospital record, particularly the portion disclosing decedent\u2019s asserted condition for several mouths preceding June 11, 1957. It is significant that petitioner\u2019s attorney refrained from interrogating petitioner with reference to her knowledge of her husband\u2019s general health prior to June If, 1957. Apart from medical witnesses, we believe that no one would be in a better position than she to testify as to Mr. Loew\u2019s general health and condition prior to the date in question, particularly so in view of the prior history of precordial pain and distress disclosed by the hospital record.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">It is clear that decedent, a laborer, was not under any particular or significant strain at the time of the attack. This is of some significance in resolving the question of causal relationship, even though a finding of the. presence of \u201cunusual strain\u201d is no longer an absolute prerequisite for the determination that an injury is work-connected. Although under the <em>Giuba </em>rule the criterion for recovery is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>actual causal relationship between the work, whatever its nature, and the heart attack, it is nevertheless of some probative significance in resolving that issue to determine whether what the workman was doing at the time of the attack was something to which he was not accustomed or was of greater strain or burden than that to which he was accustomed. As a matter of fact, in the case at bar, aside from the suggestion of distress after assisting in lifting the second bag of chloride, there is no evidence that decedent was under any strain. It is significant that Dr. Engel, as above noted, specifically rested his conclusion of causal connection between decedent\u2019s work and his attack on the \u201cexcessive lifting of the bags\u201d and the timing of the complaint of pain. There is no proof that the lifting was <em>excessive. </em>In fact the proof is expressly to the contrary. The work was normal and routine. There was no haste or pressure as in <em>Aromando v. Rubin. Bros. Drug Sales </em>Co., 47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>286 (App. <em>Div. </em>1957), certification denied 26 <em>N. J. </em>244 (1958), -or in <em>Fink v. City of </em>Paterson, 44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>129 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). Erom all of the evidence the work was being performed in leisurely fashion. In fact, there is general agreement among petitioner\u2019s witnesses that decedent and other workmen were in the garage for a total of 15 minutes, during part of which time they were standing and chatting.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">It is noted that Dr. Engel placed very slight emphasis on the temperature and that respondent\u2019s doctor discounted its effect entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We note the importance which respondent\u2019s doctor attaches to the normal progression of arteriosclerosis and its fatal result apart from trauma or strain in hundreds of cases which have been the subject of study. We have given consideration to the Deputy Director\u2019s assignment of greater weight to the opinion of the respondent\u2019s medical witness than, to that of the doctor appearing for the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In reaching our decision in this case we have not considered the divergent opinions expressed by doctors in a variety of cases as to the general relationship of effort and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>trauma to coronary occlusion. This subject has been the basis of critical comment by the courts in <em>Aromando, supra, </em>4.7 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>290 ; in <em>Amend v. Amend, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>425, 440 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1950); and in <em>Weisenbach v. Borough of New Milford, </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>506 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">It is clear to us in the case at bar petitioner has not borne the onus of proving \u201cby a preponderance of the probabilities that the employment was a contributing cause of the * * * death.\u201d No episode of stress or strain has been established. Because thereof the suggested sequence of events which, as a dominant factor in many cases, bespeaks a causal connection, is not here present. Here we have no \u201cimmediacy of the attack in relation to the episode of stress,\u201d as in <em>Aromando, supra, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>page </em>293, or in relation to strain as in <em>Roma v. Associated Transport, Inc., </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>279, 281 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946). As noted above, we are not implying that an episode of stress or strain is a legal prerequisite for recovery; merely that its absence bears against the petitioner\u2019s case on the factual issue of probability of causal relationship between the work and the heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> To allow compensation under the facts of the case at bar would be, in our opinion, to render nugatory the fundamental concept that \u201can injury suffered during the course of work does not <em>per se </em>entitle one to the benefits of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act * * <em>Henderson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\"><em>v. Celanese Corp., </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>208, 212 (1954), and that \u201can injury, though fatal, suffered in the course of employment but arising solely from natural causes wholly unrelated to an industrial mishap, is not compensable.\u201d <em>Snoden v. Watchung Borough, </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>41, 45 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), affirmed 15 <em>N. J. </em>376 (1954); <em>cf. Bowen v. Olesky, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>520, 526 (1956). Mr. Justice Oliphant in the case of <em>Kream v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>432, 436, 437 (1957), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\u201cIn the ordinary course of events death normally ensues or results from natural causes. In many actions, both civil and criminal, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the question arises whether the death resulted from other than natural causes, the one who asserts such a proposition has the burden of proving it. Thus, we have held in compensation cases that there is a presumption that death from heart disease results from natural causes and the petitioner has the burden of proving that the death resulted from an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. In order for the death to be compensable the evidence must preponderate in favor of such tendered hypotheses. <em>Mergel v. New Jersey Conveyors Corp., </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>609, 613 (1954). :J\u00ed * * * * !\u00a1: \u00a3 \u00bbJe</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">We realize the difficulty of obtaining proofs in a situation such as this, but the Legislature has not decreed that every death occurring or injury sustained in employment must be compensated by the employer and until such time, the burden of proof established by the cases must be sustained by the petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
