J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEO\">In this case involving the California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 (Lab. Code, \u00a7 6300 et seq. (Cal/OSHA); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 330 et seq.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant Overaa Construction (also known as C. Overaa &amp; Co.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5), in which Overaa sought annulment of an administrative decision penalizing Overaa, as \u201ccontrolling employer\u201d at a multiemployer construction site (\u00a7 6400; tit. 8, \u00a7 336.10), for a violation of a Cal/OSHA safety regulation requiring a protective system for excavations deeper than five feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Respondents on appeal are (1) the California Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (the Board), which issued the challenged \u201cdecision after reconsideration,\u201d and (2) the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health (the Division), which cited Overaa for the Cal/OSHA violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Overaa contends the Board improperly concluded it was immaterial whether Overaa acted with reasonable diligence. Overaa contends Cal/OSHA requires only the exercise of reasonable diligence by general contractors for hazards created by subcontractors, and allowing the regulatory violation to stand would impose a strict liability standard upon a general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We shall conclude that Overaa fails to show grounds for reversal because (1) the Board properly held that the Division did not bear the burden of proving, as an element of a prima facie case of a \u201cgeneral violation,\u201d that the employer knew, or in exercising reasonable diligence should have known, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the violation; (2) the Board was not called upon to decide whether reasonable diligence could be raised as an affirmative defense to a general violation, because Overaa did not tender it (despite incentive and opportunity to do so in response to being cited for a \u201cserious violation\u201d); and (3) the record demonstrates a lack of reasonable diligence by Overaa.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Overaa entered a public works contract with Dublin San Ramon Services District to make improvements to a wastewater treatment plant. Overaa subcontracted the electrical work to Cra-Tek.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Overaa\u2019s contract with Dublin San Ramon Services District contained provisions making Overaa responsible for all work safety at the site, including work by subcontractors, and specifically for excavation safety.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Overaa designated its superintendent, Robert Burke, as the \u201ccompetent person\u201d (tit. 8, \u00a7 1504, subd. (a))<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to supervise work safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">After an inspection on February 13, 2001, Division inspector Clifton Cooper issued to Overaa a \u201cCitation and Notification of Penalty,\u201d alleging a serious violation of title 8, section 1541.1, which provides in part: \u201cProtection of employees in excavations, [ft] (1) Each employee in an excavation shall be protected from cave-ins by an adequate protective system designed in accordance with Section 1541.1(b) or (c) except when: [ft] (A) Excavations are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>made entirely in stable rock; or [j[] (B) Excavations are less than 5 feet in depth and examination of the ground by a competent person provides no indication of a potential cave-in.\u201d (Tit. 8, \u00a7 1541.1, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Division cited Overaa for the violation pursuant to title 8, section 336.10<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (\u00a7 6400),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which authorizes citation against a \u201ccontrolling employer\" who is responsible by contract or actual practice for safety on the worksite. The Division characterized the violation as \u201cserious\u201d (\u00a7 6432)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and sought a civil penalty of $2,475.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The citation and notification of penalty stated: \u201cThe controlling employer failed to exercise the authority needed to protect workers from possible cave-in while they were working in an excavation at Building D, located at Dublin San Ramon Wastewater Treatment Plant, [address]. The employees were observed working at a depth of 5'-6\" outside and a depth measured at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>6-feet inside, without any type of protective system.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] The controlling employer knew of the unprotected excavation for more than a week and took no action to direct the creating/correcting employer to provide a protective system for its exposed employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Overaa protested the citation by filing an \u201cappeal,\u201d which stated as specific grounds for the appeal that (1) the safety order was not violated, and (2) the \u201cserious\u201d classification was incorrect. Where the appeal form stated, \u201cExplain any other reasons for appeal or issues to be raised on appeal. Affirmative defenses must be specifically stated,\u201d Overaa responded, \u201cGeneral Contractor [Overaa] was not aware of the unprotected excavation.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">At the hearing before the ALJ, inspector Cooper testified he arrived for the inspection around 9:30 a.m. and observed a Cra-Tek employee working in the trench. Cooper measured the distance from the top of the concrete surface slab to the deepest part of the trench (several feet behind the worker) at five feet six inches. The soil was in poor condition because it rained for several days before the inspection. There was no protection against a cave-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Cooper testified to his opinion that Overaa should be cited as controlling employer \u201c[b]ecause they didn\u2019t exercise control and due diligence really in having the subcontractor protect its employees by, you know, putting in a protective (inaudible).\u201d Cooper added that Overaa had the responsibility to oversee the excavation and authority to direct subcontractors on safety matters, by contract and by actual practice, and a competent person would have checked the excavation daily, particularly because of the rainy weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Burke testified he was responsible for safety on the worksite, including work done by subcontractors, and would direct subcontractors to correct safety hazards. He was aware of the trench and checked it daily and believed it was less than five feet deep, but he did not check it on February 13, 2001, before the inspector arrived. Burke (and Cra-Tek foreman, Shayne Holderby) claimed the inspector did not actually measure the depth of the trench (the ALJ disbelieved Burke and Holderby on this point), and Burke further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201cQ. Do you know what the depth of the trench is in the area where this individual is standing in Exhibit Number 2 [a photograph taken by the inspector]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cA. Not exactly in feet and inches, it\u2019s less than the five feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201cQ. How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cA. Well, I was out there prior to him being in there, prior to that day, at that time it wasn\u2019t over five foot [szc],\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201cQ. All right. So\u2014go ahead</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201cA.\u2014and making an observation of the man standing in there, and where his shoulder height is and relation to the concrete edge, it wouldn\u2019t be over five foot [sic].[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">\u201cQ. All right. So is it your testimony that as best you can recall, prior to February 13th, you were aware of this trench or the area of this trench that\u2019s depicted in Exhibit 2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">\u201cQ. And prior to February 13th, you had drawn some conclusion regarding its depth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">\u201cA. Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">\u201cQ. And that was what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-14\">\u201cA. Less than the five foot [szc].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">Burke believed shoring was not required because the excavation was less than five feet deep.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">Holderby testified he measured the depth as less than five feet. However, he did not include the thickness of the concrete surface slab.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">In a written decision in August 2002, the ALJ rejected Overaa\u2019s appeal. The ALJ expressly found Cooper\u2019s testimony more credible than that of Burke and Holderby regarding Cooper\u2019s actions. The ALJ also noted Board precedent <em>(In re Dalton Construction Co. </em>(Feb. 21, 1986) No. 83-R1D5-717, 1986 Cal. OSHA App. Bd. Lexis 34) required depth to be measured from the top of the surface slab. However, the ALJ reduced the classification of Overaa\u2019s violation from \u201cserious\u201d to \u201cgeneral,\u201d because the Division failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>prove a substantial probability of serious physical harm or death. The ALJ assessed a civil penalty of $205.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Overaa filed with the Board a petition for reconsideration, arguing Overaa was not aware of the violation, did not create or subject its own employees to the hazard, was required as controlling employer merely to act reasonably, had acted reasonably by continuously evaluating Cra-Tek\u2019s operations and ensuring that Cra-Tek conducted daily inspections of the trench. Overaa also argued the trench was less than five feet deep.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On April 1, 2004, the Board issued a decision after reconsideration, affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Board decision stated in part;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201cEmployer maintains that the Division incorrectly cited Employer under section 336.10 [footnote 7, <em>ante] </em>because Employer\u2019s management representative did not have <em>knowledge </em>of the violation. Employer\u2019s position is that a controlling employer can only be held liable for violations it did not create where it is demonstrated by substantial evidence \u2018that a management representative of the general contractor had knowledge that an employee was exposed to a hazard in violation of any requirement enforceable by the Division.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cBy its terms, the applicability of section 336.10 is not conditioned upon a controlling employer\u2019s knowledge of the violative condition.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">\u201cEmployer next urges throughQout its petition that section 336.10 be . . . \u2018reasonably\u2019 interpreted and applied to require a showing that a controlling employer can only be liable if it failed to exercise due diligence in discovering the violative condition. Employer contends that federal law places the burden on the Division to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s failure to discover the violative condition was due to a lack of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">\u201cAlthough federal courts may require proof of due diligence in discovering the violative condition, California is entitled to promulgate and interpret its own law. Federal law does not preempt a state right to exercise its own sovereign powers over occupational safety and health provided that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>law is more stringent. The Appeals Board is not persuaded that the federal authority sufficiently [szc] cited by Employer addresses the purposes of the California Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cThe Board also rejects Employer\u2019s suggestion that section 336.10 must be interpreted as including a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard to ensure that strict or absolute liability is not imposed upon the controlling employer. [<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] A modification of the express substantive terms of the established regulation is not within the Board\u2019s authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201cThe Board has strictly construed section 336.10(c) in the past. The plain reading of section 336.10(c) compels an interpretation that an employer who has responsibility, by contract or actual practice^] for safety and health conditions at the worksite, is a \u2018controlling employer\u2019 subject to citation for violation of a safety order. The regulation does not include the word . . . \u2018reasonably\u2019 nor does it contain any adjective defining the standard expected of the controlling employer in detecting or correcting hazardous conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cThe Board fails to see how Employer\u2019s use of a due diligence standard ensures as safe a workplace under the Act as the Division\u2019s interpretation. Employer\u2019s interpretation would frustrate the affirmative duties of an employer under the Act. An employer could potentially escape liability by pleading it did not have knowledge of information available to it at the time the violation was discovered. Under this scenario, Employer\u2019s interpretation would bring about a defense which is deferential <em>[sic: </em>detrimental?] to the obligation mandated by the safety orders including the contractual safety responsibilities assigned to Employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201cSince the Act is aimed at promoting a safe working environment for all employees by holding the controlling employer liable for detecting work site violations, we decline to interpret the regulation in a way that contravenes the purposes of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201cBased on these findings, the Division does not need to establish that Employer knew of the violation or, in exercising reasonable diligence, could have known of the section 1541.1(a)(1) violation in order for Employer to be liable as a controlling employer under section 336.10.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision finding a general violation of title 8, section 1541.1, subdivision (a)(1) and assessing a civil penalty of $205.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Overaa filed in the trial court a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus. After consideration of briefs, declarations, and oral argument, the trial court initially indicated it would remand to the Board to clarify whether the Board decided the affirmative defense of due diligence. Thereafter, the court reexamined the Board\u2019s decision and concluded the Board\u2019s decision did not contain any determination precluding Overaa from raising an affirmative defense to a citation holding Overaa responsible as a controlling employer for a safety order violation. Therefore, concluded the trial court, remand was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On October 19, 2005, judgment was entered, denying Overaa\u2019s petition for writ of mandate. The judgment said substantial evidence supported the Board decision, and the Board acted within its authority and discretion. The judgment further stated: (1) the Board reasonably determined the Division did not have to demonstrate Overaa\u2019s lack of knowledge of the violation or lack of due diligence in discovering the violation in order to make a prima facie case; (2) the Board did not determine and had no occasion to determine whether diligence could be asserted as an affirmative defense, because Overaa did not properly raise it at the administrative level; (3) although the Board\u2019s decision was ambiguously worded in places, in context it merely addressed the Division\u2019s prima facie showing, not any affirmative defense; and (4) had Overaa raised the defense, it would have failed in light of the evidence in the administrative record establishing that Overaa should have known of the violation in the exercise of due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Overaa appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u201c \u2018Our function on appeal is the same as that of the trial court in ruling on the petition for the writ. We must determine whether based on the entire record the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether it is reasonable. [Citations.] Where the decision involves the interpretation and application of existing regulations, we must determine whether the administrative agency applied the proper legal standard. [Citation.] Since the interpretation of a regulation is a question of law, while the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation is entitled to great weight, the ultimate resolution of the legal question rests with the courts. ... An agency\u2019s expertise with regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to a statute or regulation it is charged with enforcing entitles its interpretation of the statute or regulation to be given great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized. [Citations.] The Board is one of those agencies whose expertise we must respect. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] However, \u2018[a]n administrative agency cannot alter or enlarge the legislation, and an erroneous administrative construction does not govern the court\u2019s interpretation of the statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rick\u2019s Electric, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1033-1034 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 847].)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Section 6629 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cThe review by the court shall not be extended further than to determine, based upon the entire record which shall be certified by the appeals board, whether:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201c(a) The appeals board acted without or in excess of its powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u201c(b) The order or decision was procured by fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201c(c) The order or decision was unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">\u201c(d) The order or decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\u201c(e) If findings of fact are made, such findings of fact support the order or decision under review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">\u201cNothing in this section shall permit the court to hold a trial de novo, to take evidence, or to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 6629.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Section 6630 provides: \u201cThe findings and conclusions of the appeals board on questions of fact are conclusive and final and are not subject to review. Such questions of fact shall include ultimate facts and the findings and conclusions of the appeals board. . . . Upon the hearing, the court shall enter judgment either affirming or annulling the order or decision, or the court may remand the case for further proceedings before the appeals board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">Section 6632 provides: \u201cNo court of this state, except the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal, and the superior court to the extent herein specified, has jurisdiction to review, reverse, correct, or annul any order or rule, or decision of the appeals board, or to suspend or delay the operation or execution thereof, or to restrain, enjoin, or interfere with the appeals board in the performance of its duties.\u201d (\u00a7 6632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>H. <em>No Legal Error in Board\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Overaa claims the issue on appeal is whether a general contractor, as a controlling employer, can be cited under Cal/OSHA for a general violation which was not created by and did not affect employees of the general contractor, regardless of and notwithstanding the general contractor\u2019s exercise of due diligence. Overaa claims the Board so held in this case, overturning its own past precedents,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and such a holding imposes strict liability on general contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">As we discuss <em>post, </em>the administrative record in this case clearly shows a <em>lack </em>of due diligence by Overaa. But setting that point aside for the moment, we shall explain that Overaa misstates the issue and reads too much into the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The only issue before the Board, hence the only issue decided by the Board, was whether the Division had the burden to prove lack of reasonable diligence by Overaa as an essential element of the Division\u2019s prima facie case in order to establish a general violation of Cal/OSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The Board correctly decided the Division did not have to prove lack of reasonable diligence by Overaa. When the Division alleges a \u201cserious\u201d violation (as it initially did in this case), section 6432 (fn. 9, <em>ante) </em>authorizes the employer to assert reasonable diligence as an affirmative defense. Thus, section 6432, subdivision (b), states that \u201ca serious violation shall not be deemed to exist if the employer can demonstrate that it did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.\u201d (\u00a7 6632, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">There would be no need for section 6432\u2019s statutory authorization (for employers to assert diligence as an affirmative defense) if lack of diligence were an element of the Division\u2019s prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>No parallel provision addresses employer diligence in the context of a <em>general </em>(as opposed to serious) violation. Overaa offers no reason as to why the Division should have a heavier burden in proving a general violation than it has in proving a serious violation. This case does not require us to decide whether diligence would constitute an affirmative defense to a general violation, because Overaa did not adequately raise the issue, Overaa had opportunity to produce evidence of diligence as a defense to being cited for a serious violation, and the evidence here clearly shows an absence of diligence, as we discuss <em>post.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Overaa notes section 6400 (fn. 8, <em>ante) </em>expressly states its codification of the Cal/OSHA regulation identifying citable employers (including controlling employer) is declaratory of existing law and should not be interpreted as changing the law. Overaa argues the 1999 legislation was not intended to abrogate the former policy, retained in the current legislation, that employers shall use practices \u201creasonably adequate\u201d to make the workplace safe and do everything \u201creasonably necessary to protect the life, safety, and health of employees.\u201d (\u00a7 6401.) Section 6403 similarly states no employer shall fail or neglect to do everything \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for employee safety. We have said, \u201c[tjhese general statutes do not require an employer to take all conceivable steps to ensure safety, nor forbid an employer from adopting practices or methods which might conceivably result in harm to an employee. Particularly given the employment at issue herein [prison workers], no guaranty of safety is possible.\u201d <em>(California Correctional Supervisors Organization, Inc. v. Department of Corrections </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 824, 831 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 585] [employee organization challenging employer\u2019s staffing practices failed to prove abuse of discretion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">However, none of the authorities cited by Overaa compels the conclusion that the Division has the burden of proving an employer\u2019s lack of reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Assuming for the sake of argument that the <em>federal </em>Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 et seq.) would place the burden on federal enforcement agencies to show an employer\u2019s lack of diligence, California is not precluded from establishing more stringent standards for Cal/OSHA. <em>(United Air Lines, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 762, 772-773 [187 Cal.Rptr. 387, 654 P.2d 157].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Overaa complains the Board should explain why the federal standard should not be followed. The reason is that the California statutes do not support the position advanced by Overaa.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">As indicated, Overaa did not assert reasonable diligence at the administrative hearing before the ALJ, though it had every opportunity and incentive to do so (because the citation was for a serious violation). By the time the case got to the Board, the ALJ reduced the severity from \u201cserious\u201d to a \u201cgeneral\u201d violation. No statute makes reasonable diligence an essential element or an affirmative defense to a general violation. It would be illogical to conclude that the Division must prove the employer\u2019s lack of diligence regarding a general violation, even though the Division has no such burden for a serious violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Overaa claims the Board imposed a strict liability standard by saying that title 8, section 336.10 (fn. 7, <em>ante) </em>should be strictly construed and is not conditioned upon a controlling employer\u2019s knowledge of the violative condition. However, title 8, section 336.10 merely identifies the types of employers who can be cited. The regulation does not operate in a vacuum but rather within the framework of the other relevant Cal/OSHA regulations and statutes. Thus, the fact that title 8, section 336.10 is not conditioned on the employer\u2019s knowledge does not mean that controlling employers are strictly liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">We recognize that portions of the Board\u2019s decision suggest the Board viewed the employer\u2019s reasonable diligence as immaterial to a general violation even if raised as an affirmative defense. Thus, the Board said: \u201cThe Board fails to see how Employer\u2019s use of a due diligence standard ensures as safe a workplace under the Act as the Division\u2019s interpretation. Employer\u2019s interpretation would frustrate the affirmative duties of an employer under the Act. An employer could potentially escape liability by <em>pleading </em>it did not have knowledge of information available to it at the time the violation was discovered. Under this scenario, Employer\u2019s interpretation would bring about a <em>defense </em>which is deferential <em>[sic: </em>detrimental] to the obligation mandated by the safety orders including the contractual safety responsibilities assigned to Employer. [][] Since the Act is aimed at promoting a safe working environment for all employees by holding the controlling employer liable for detecting work site violations, we decline to interpret the regulation in a way that contravenes the purposes of the Act. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">However, the Board continued: \u201cBased on these findings, the Division does not need to establish that Employer knew of the violation or, in exercising reasonable diligence, could have known of the section 1541.1(a)(1) violation in order for Employer to be liable as a controlling employer under section 336.10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The question of reasonable diligence as an affirmative defense rather than an essential element of the Division\u2019s prima facie case was not in issue before the Board. Therefore, any comments suggestive of affirmative defense were unnecessary to the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Since Overaa did not assert diligence as a defense in this case, we need not decide whether an employer\u2019s reasonable diligence constitutes an affirmative defense to a general violation of Cal/OSHA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Overaa and its amici curiae argue that subsequent Board decisions cite this precedential <em>Overaa </em>Board decision as broad authority for the proposition that the controlling employer\u2019s reasonable diligence is immaterial. However, no other case is before us in this appeal. Moreover, as the parties acknowledge, one of the cited Cal/OSHA cases is currently being litigated in court, and another was an ALJ decision for which the Board ordered reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In a footnote, Overaa suggests an irregularity in the membership of the Board when it heard this case. We disregard this point, made perfunctorily in a footnote without development. <em>(Placer Ranch Partners </em>v. <em>County of Placer </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1343, fn. 9 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 577].)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Our conclusions (that Overaa failed to assert diligence at the administrative level and overstates the Board\u2019s decision) render it unnecessary for us to address Overaa\u2019s arguments that the Board improperly imposes a strict liability standard on general contractors, which is contrary to the legislative intent and could result in a less safe workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">We conclude Overaa fails to show any error regarding any question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">HI. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Even though the Division was not required to prove lack of diligence and Overaa failed to raise diligence as a defense, Overaa in the \u201cCONCLUSION\u201d of its appellate brief asks this court either to find that Overaa acted with due diligence or to remand for additional factfinding by the Board. Even if we were to entertain an argument improperly presented in the conclusion of a brief (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204), Overaa\u2019s argument clearly lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">First, we observe the administrative record shows a lack of reasonable diligence by Overaa. The evidence at the administrative hearing showed Burke was aware of the excavation but did not measure it when work started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>on February 13, 2001, despite rainy weather, which obviously could affect the depth by loosening soil at the bottom of the trench. Burke apparently never measured the depth with a measuring device. Instead, he merely estimated its depth (prior to the day of the Cal/OSHA inspection).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">On appeal, Overaa does not dispute that the depth of the excavation was five feet six inches. Nor could Overaa legitimately do so, since substantial evidence supports this finding by the ALJ, and the ALJ\u2019s finding is conclusive (\u00a7 6630).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Burke\u2019s failure to measure the depth with a measuring device demonstrates a lack of due diligence, particularly since the depth was close to the five-foot cutoff imposed by title 8, section 1541.1. The regulation <em>requires </em>a protective system for excavations five feet or deeper, but gives the employer <em>discretion </em>as to whether a protective system is needed for excavations that are less than five feet deep.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">That the subcontractor (Cra-Tek) also believed the excavation was less than five feet does not help Overaa. Holderby testified he measured from the <em>bottom </em>of the concrete slab. The ALJ noted it has been established since at least 1986 by Board precedential decision that excavations are to be measured from the top of the surface to the bottom of the excavation. Moreover, Overaa could not reasonably rely on Cra-Tek\u2019s measurement, because the evidence showed Burke and Holderby frequently \u201cbutted heads\u201d over safety issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Overaa argues in a footnote in the conclusion of its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\u201cOveraa Construction submits that the substantial evidence in this case establishes that Mr. Burke had addressed the need for protection of excavations with Cra-Tek Company\u2019s general foreman on more than one occasion, that neither Mr. Burke nor Mr. Holderby, both of whom were experienced in such work and both of whom observed the excavation in question on a daily basis, concluded that particular excavation was in need of protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">\u201cOveraa Construction contends that the opinion of its project superintendent, Mr. Burke (as well as the similar opinion of Mr. Holderby), regarding the depth of the excavation in question is entitled to consideration. The fact that the [ALJ] concluded the depth of the trench was[] as stated by the Division\u2019s inspector, does not alter the fact Mr. Burke and Mr. Holderby had both repeatedly viewed the excavation in question on multiple occasions and considered it to be less than 5 feet in depth and, therefore, not in need of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>protective devices. As such, neither individual requested corrective measures due to their belief the excavation required no such measures.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201cOveraa Construction contends the actions and opinions of Mr. Burke, even if considered to be incorrect, were reasonable; that Mr. Burke exercised reasonable care in his evaluation of the excavation condition; that he acted \u2018as might reasonably be expected of a person of ordinary prudence who desired to obey the law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">This argument is improperly presented in the \u201cconclusion\u201d of the appellate brief (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204), ignores the limited scope of judicial review (\u00a7\u00a7 6629-6630), and ignores the above described evidence favorable to the Board\u2019s decision <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. v. Fallon </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362] [substantial evidence review is forfeited if appellant fails to cite evidence favorable to the judgment]).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Moreover, Overaa\u2019s argument is not persuasive. Depth is not a matter of opinion. Overaa\u2019s suggestion that it could rely on the measurement taken by the subcontractor suffers from several additional defects, e.g., there is no evidence that Burke relied upon Holderby\u2019s measurement, nor is there evidence such reliance would be reasonable. To the contrary, any such reliance would be unreasonable because Holderby testified that, throughout the course of the project, he and Burke had \u201cbutted heads\u201d numerous times over Cal/OSHA requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Overaa alternatively argues we should remand to the Board for further factfinding. However, Overaa is not entitled to a second chance after failing to avail itself of the opportunity to assert diligence as a defense to being cited for a \u201cserious\u201d violation (\u00a7 6432).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Overaa\u2019s reply brief argues that, because the Board excluded the existence of such a defense, there is no basis for any conclusion whether the evidence in this record would or would not support such a defense. However, as we have explained, Overaa overstates the Board\u2019s holding, and Overaa had the opportunity to put on any evidence it had of reasonable diligence, which would have been a statutory defense to the serious violation with which Overaa was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Substantial evidence supports the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The judgment is affirmed. The Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board and the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health shall recover their costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.276(a)(1)\u2014(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Davis, J., and Raye, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"> Undesignated section references are to the Labor Code.

Thus, Overaa had incentive and opportunity to assert reasonable diligence as a defense, but instead merely asserted it did not know of the violation.
