Here, the court clerk included in the minutes and the abstract of judgment some provisions that were not in the judge\u2019s pronouncement of sentence. This was error, which was compounded by the fact the judge erroneously sentenced defendant on a count for which he was not convicted. We also shall address the judge\u2019s remark, on the record and in open court, that, \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t offend the kangaroos up there in kangaroo court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">In the unpublished part of our opinion, we conclude that the question whether the judge coerced defendant into pleading guilty must be raised via a petition for writ of habeas corpus because the judge denied defendant\u2019s request for a certificate of probable cause. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237.5.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">For present purposes, this case began in this court when counsel appointed for defendant filed an opening brief that set forth the facts of the case, informed this court he found no arguable issues in favor of defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>requested this court to review the record and determine whether there were any arguable issues on appeal. (See <em>People v. Wende </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 436 [158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071].) As is required by <em>Wende, </em>this court reviewed the record and then asked the parties to brief the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">1. Did the trial court coerce defendant into entering the plea agreement and, if so, is the trial court so permitted?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">2. Must defendant obtain a certificate of probable cause (\u00a7 1237.5) in order to raise the issue of being coerced by the court into entering a plea agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">3. Assuming for the sake of argument the trial court coerced the plea, does defendant want to withdraw his plea or is he satisfied with the plea bargain reached with the trial court?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">4. Did the clerk err in recording that defendant entered a plea of no contest to count 3 (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) and/or that defendant admitted an enhancement pursuant to section 969?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">5. Did the trial court err in sentencing defendant on count 3 (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd.

Did the clerk err in preparing the abstract of judgment (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Mesa, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 466, 471 [rendition of the judgment is normally an oral pronouncement, and the abstract of judgment cannot add to, or modify, the judgment, but only purports to digest and summarize it]) in including the $200 restitution fine, the $200 parole revocation fine or the statement that defendant was placed on \u201c3 YEARS CONDITIONAL PROBATION; PAY $2,260.00 AS TO COUNT 3\u2014SERVE 76 DAYS IN CONCURRENT <em>[sic] </em>IN LIEU OF FINE\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">8. At the September 19, 2005, change of plea proceedings, the trial court stated, \u201cOh that\u2019s right. You can\u2019t offend the kangaroos up there in kangaroo court.\u201d What court was the \u201ckangaroo court\u201d referred to by the trial court?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">After reviewing the supplemental briefs, we conclude that the record is replete with errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Defendant Donald Louis Zackery was charged in count 1 with assault with a deadly weapon, to wit, a car, upon a police officer (\u00a7 245, subd. (c)), in count 2 with evading a pursuing police officer with damage to property (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (b)), and in count 3 with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)). The information also alleged defendant had two prior serious or violent felony convictions (strikes) within the meaning of section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and section 1170.12. Defendant initially pled not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">On September 19, 2005, defendant entered a negotiated plea of no contest to assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer and evading a pursuing police officer. He also admitted having sustained two prior strikes. As part of the plea agreement, it was understood that the trial court would dismiss one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>of his prior strikes and defendant would receive a term of six years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The trial court dismissed one of defendant\u2019s strikes and sentenced him to an aggregate term of six years in state prison. Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was permanently revoked (\u00a7 245, subd. (c)) and he was awarded 594 days of custody credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Defendant appealed, but his request for a certificate of probable cause was denied. (\u00a7 1237.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\n<em>Was There Judicial Coercion of the Plea?</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\n<em>Clerical Error in Minutes of Plea Change</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Where there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>(People v. Mitchell </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 181, 185-186 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 303, 26 P.3d 1040]; <em>People v. Mesa, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">Here, although defense counsel indicated defendant would be pleading no contest to all three counts, defendant pled no contest only to assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer (count 1) and evading a pursuing police officer (count 2). Defendant did not change his not guilty plea to the charge of driving under the influence (count 3), nor was he otherwise convicted on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">Nevertheless, the trial court clerk recorded in the minutes that \u201cDEFENDANT ENTERED A PLEA OF NOLO CONTENDERE TO COUNT 3.\u201d Likewise, defendant did not, as \u201crecorded\u201d by the clerk, admit an enhancement pursuant to section 969. Indeed, section 969 is a drafting and notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>provision, not an enhancement. Both of these notations must be stricken from the minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u201cThe reason for requiring a minute entry of the judgment in a criminal case is to furnish a concise record showing the crime of which the defendant has been convicted and the punishment imposed, which will protect him against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Blackman </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 303, 307 [35 Cal.Rptr. 761]; see also <em>People v. Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 521, 532 [136 Cal.Rptr. 693].) Here, the clerk\u2019s minutes do not reflect what occurred at the change of plea hearing. Accordingly, we order the minutes corrected to strike the statements that defendant entered a plea of no contest to count 3 (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) and that defendant admitted an enhancement pursuant to section 969. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 119, 123 [253 Cal.Rptr. 190] [appellate court has authority to correct such clerical errors]; see also <em>People v. Hartsell </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 8, 13 [109 Cal.Rptr. 627].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>Sentencing Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">At the October 3, 2005, sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed sentence on count 3, as follows: \u201cDefendant also having been convicted of [Vehicle Code section] 23152(a), the imposition of sentence is suspended for three years informal probation and on the condition he does not drive without a valid California driver\u2019s license after consuming alcoholic beverages or without insurance. [][] The fine of $2,200 is going to run concurrently] to the six-year sentence that\u2019s just been imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">However, defendant did not change his not guilty plea on count 3 for violation of Vehicle Code section 23152 and was not convicted on that count. As the parties agree, defendant\u2019s sentence on count 3 was unauthorized. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed on count 3. <em>(People v. Smith </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 849, 854 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 14 P.3d 942] [an unauthorized sentence may be corrected at any time whether or not there was an objection below].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\n<em>Clerical Errors in Minutes of Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">\u201cWith certain exceptions not applicable here [citations] judgment and sentence in felony cases may be imposed only in the presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>accused.\u201d <em>(In re Levi </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 41, 45 [244 P.2d 403].) Thus, section 1193 provides in pertinent part, \u201cJudgment upon persons convicted of commission of crime shall be pronounced as follows: [f] (a) If the conviction is for a felony, the defendant shall be personally present when judgment is pronounced against him or her, unless [certain exceptions apply] . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201c \u2018Rendition of judgment is an oral pronouncement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Mesa, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201cA judgment includes a fine. A restitution fine is a fine.\u201d <em>(People v. Hong </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1071, 1080 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 23], approved in <em>People v. Mitchell, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th 181, 185-186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In this case, the trial court clerk unlawfully included in the minutes of defendant\u2019s sentencing various matters, including a number of fines, that were never orally imposed by the trial judge in the presence of defendant. These matters are:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">A. \u201cCONDITIONAL SENTENCE GRANTED FOR 3 YRS; AS TO COUNT 3. [\u00dc OBEY ALL LAWS, <em>[f] </em>DO NOT COMMIT SAME OR SIMILAR OFFENSE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">B. \u201cDEFENDANT ORDERED TO PAY FINE OF $2,150.00 INCLUDING PENALTY ASSESSMENT, IF ANY, AS TO COUNT 3\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">C. \u201cDEFENDANT TO PAY $100.00 RESTITUTION FINE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">D. \u201cPLUS $10.00 ADMINISTRATIVE SURCHARGE FOR RESTITUTION FINE\u2014RESTITUTION FUND COLLECTION FEE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">E. \u201cDEFENDANT TO SERVE 76 DAYS IN CUSTODY CONCURRENT IN LIEU OF FINE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">F. \u201cDEFENDANT TO PAY RESTITUTION FINE OF $200.00 PURSUANT TO PC 1202.4 COLLECTED BY CDC\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">G. \u201cPURSUANT TO PC 1202.45, THE COURT IMPOSES AN ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION FINE OF $200.00 SAID FINE TO BE SUSPENDED UNLESS PAROLE IS REVOKED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">The clerk cannot supplement the judgment the court actually pronounced by adding a provision to the minute order and the abstract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>judgment. (See <em>People v. Hartsell, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d at pp. 13-14.) As explained above, the clerk\u2019s minutes must accurately reflect what occurred at the hearing. Of the above items, only the first two were pronounced orally by the trial court, although even those were not accurately recorded. This error is immaterial because we are vacating the sentence on count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Items \u201cC,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d and \u201cE\u201d above must be stricken from the minutes as they do not reflect the judgment the court pronounced. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rowland, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 123-124 [appellate court struck from clerk\u2019s minutes and abstract of judgment restitution orders not pronounced by the trial court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The People admit that the $200 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4) and the $200 parole revocation fine (\u00a7 1202.45) listed in items \u201cF\u201d and \u201cG\u201d were not included in the trial court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence on counts other than count 3. However, the People argue the fines are mandatory fines and, therefore, we may presume the trial court subsequently corrected its judgment pursuant to section 1202.46<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to impose the omitted fines and caused the clerk to correct the minutes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Assuming section 1202.46 authorizes a court, on its own motion, to request correction, at any time, of a sentence omitting a restitution fine, the statute does not speak to the procedure to be used in making the correction. That procedure is found in section 1193 and related case law, cited above, requiring that judgment be pronounced orally in the presence of the defendant. Nothing in section 1202.46 purports to alter this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">There is a practical reason for requiring that a restitution fine be imposed in the presence of the defendant. The trial court can decline to impose the section 1202.4 restitution fine, and the corresponding section 1202.45 fine, if it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so and states the reasons on the record. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b).) When a restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>fine is imposed in the absence of the defendant, the defendant has no opportunity to address the propriety of imposing the fine or its amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The restitution fines could not be simply added to the judgment later outside defendant\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">As the record stands now, the minute order of the sentencing hearing does not reflect the judgment as it was imposed. Items \u201cF\u201d and \u201cG\u201d above (the restitution fines) must be stricken from the minutes as they do not reflect the judgment the court pronounced and were not later lawfully imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">As we have mentioned, subdivision (b) of section 1202.4 requires imposition of a restitution fine \u201cunless [the trial court] finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, <em>and states those reasons on the </em>record.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b), italics added.) Here the trial court did not state any reasons on the record. We shall therefore remand the case to the trial court to determine whether to impose restitution fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\n<em>Clerical Error in Abstract of Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The trial court clerk also erred in preparing the abstract of judgment. Rendition of the judgment is normally an oral pronouncement, and the abstract of judgment cannot add to, or modify, the judgment, but only purports to digest and summarize it. <em>(People v. Mesa, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Here, the trial court clerk erred in including the $200 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4), the $200 parole revocation fine (\u00a7 1202.45) and the statement that defendant was placed on \u201c3 YEARS CONDITIONAL PROBATION; PAY $2,260.00 AS TO COUNT 3\u2014SERVE 76 DAYS IN CONCURRENT [szc] IN LIEU OF FINE.\u201d All of these items, except the three years\u2019 conditional probation, must be stricken as not comporting with the oral pronouncement of judgment. The conditional probation must also be stricken, however, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>unauthorized sentence since it was imposed on count 3, for which defendant was never convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\n<em>Trial Court\u2019s Kangaroo Court Remarks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In the course of our review of the record mandated by <em>People </em>v. <em>Wende, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 436, we came across the following proceedings in open court: During the change of plea hearing, after the court explained the \u201coffer\u201d that the court would dismiss one strike and impose the low term of three years, doubled, for assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, defendant\u2019s counsel indicated defendant was prepared to withdraw his not guilty pleas and enter no contest pleas as to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The trial court, Judge K. Peter Saiers presiding, then asked the prosecutor, \u201cYou\u2019re going to dismiss Count Two, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The prosecutor responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a strike case.\u201d To this, Judge Saiers replied, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You can\u2019t offend the kangaroos up there in kangaroo court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In our request for supplemental briefing, we asked the parties to address the following question:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAt the September 19, 2005, change of plea proceedings, the trial court stated, \u2018Oh that\u2019s right. You can\u2019t offend the kangaroos up there in kangaroo court.\u2019 What court was the \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 referred to by the trial court?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">In his supplemental brief, defendant\u2019s counsel said, \u201cAppellate counsel was not present at the hearing on September 19, 2005, and has no information which would allow him to interpret anything else into \u2018the cold black and white of a printed record.\u2019 <em>(United States v. Ah Kee Eng </em>(2[d] Cir. 1957) 241 F.2d 157, 16[1].) Therefore counsel is unable to answer this question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The Attorney General said (with a footnote omitted): \u201cRespondent speculates that the \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 referred to by the trial court includes all reviewing courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Like the Attorney General, we also thought Judge Saiers was referring to a reviewing court. In our original opinion we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201cThe kangaroos are described as being \u2018up there.\u2019 This implies a higher court than the trial court\u2014higher in the sense that the \u2018higher\u2019 court reviews the work of the trial court. As a practical matter, that leaves the Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District and the California Supreme Court. We will give Judge Saiers the benefit of the doubt and assume he was referring to this court, not the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We chastised Judge Saiers for having made pejorative remarks about the Court of Appeal in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Shortly after our original opinion was filed, we received the following letter from James P. Willett, the District Attorney of San Joaquin County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u201c[Salutation]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cThe above-referenced decision <em>[People v. Zackery </em>146 Cal.App.4th 122 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 736]], filed 12/27/06, contains a factual error which significantly impacts Part VI <em>(Trial Court\u2019s Kangaroo Court Remarks) </em>of the Court\u2019s opinion. At pages 14 and 15, the opinion states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u201c \u2018The trial court, Judge K. Peter Saiers presiding, then asked the prosecutor, \u201cYou\u2019re going to dismiss Count Two, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The prosecutor responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a strike case.\u201d To this, Judge Saiers replied, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You can\u2019t offend the kangaroos up there in kangaroo court.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">\u201cThe opinion then defines \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 and determines that it was a pejorative remark before asking, \u2018To what court was Judge Saiers referring?\u2019 The Court determined that by using the phrase \u2018up there in kangaroo court\u2019 Judge Saiers was referring to a \u2018higher\u2019 court, either the Third Appellate District or the California Supreme Court. The opinion graciously gives \u2018Judge Saiers the benefit of the doubt and assume[s] he was referring to this court, not the Supreme Court.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">\u201cHowever, that assumption is wrong. Judge Saiers\u2019 \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 remark was not referring to either the Third Appellate District nor the California Supreme Court. Judge Saiers was referring to me, or actually to the San Joaquin County District Attorney\u2019s \u2018strike committee.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cUpon passage of the \u2018strike\u2019 laws in 1994, my office implemented a process for handling strike cases whereby pre-trial settlement offers, if any, on cases alleging prior strikes are authorized by myself.

Accordingly, my deputy district attorneys commonly tell trial judges during pre-trial conferences, \u2018The strike committee authorized me to ... .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201cJudge Saiers settles a lot of cases, both criminal and civil, that were otherwise headed for trial. Like all good mediators, he has a knack for spotting the strengths and weaknesses of a case and discussing those factors, in plain talk, with the parties. I believe that since the enactment of the strike laws Judge Saiers has been frustrated at times when he has been unable to resolve a criminal case because of the presence of strikes and the reluctance of the deputy district attorney to move for their dismissal. On numerous occasions when the deputy district attorney and the \u2018strike committee\u2019 have balked at Judge Saiers\u2019 suggestion to dismiss strikes, Judge Saiers has referred to the district attorney\u2019s \u2018strike committee\u2019 as \u2018the Star Chamber,\u2019 the \u2018Grand Inquisitors,\u2019 or the \u2018Kangaroo Court.\u2019 It is typically said with a pointed, but jocular tone and certainly does not offend me or the prosecutors on the strike committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cJudge Saiers\u2019 courtroom is on the first floor of our courthouse. The District Attorney\u2019s offices are on the 2nd, 4th and 5th floors of the courthouse. In the case at bar, I am positive that my \u2018strike committee\u2019 members (and myself) are the \u2018kangaroos up there in kangaroo court\u2019 to whom Judge Saiers referred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\u201cVery truly yours, [\u00b6] . . .

(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204(e)(2)(C).) We sent the letter to counsel for the parties with the following request for supplemental briefing: \u201cIn light of District Attorney Willett\u2019s letter, should this court chastise trial Judge K. Peter Saiers for having made pejorative remarks about the Court of Appeal?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Having considered the supplemental briefing, we now conclude that we should take District Attorney Willett at his word. When Judge Saiers said, \u201cYou can\u2019t offend the kangaroos up there in kangaroo court,\u201d he was not referring to a court at all. Rather, he was referring to the \u201cstrike committee\u201d of the San Joaquin County District Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">End of story. (But see Cal. Code Jud.
