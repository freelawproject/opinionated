INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">This case presents the question whether a liability insurer providing coverage for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d is required to defend its insured in an action charging the insured with sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines in violation of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)), and with invasion of privacy caused by those faxed advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">Because we hold that the advertising injury and property damage provisions of the insurance policy did not provide coverage for liability for violations of the TCPA or for invasion of privacy caused by the sending of unsolicited faxed advertisements, we conclude that no potential for coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>existed and no duty to defend arose. The trial court correctly sustained a demurrer without leave to amend and entered a judgment of dismissal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">II. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">This appeal involves commercial package policies issued by St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company and by St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company. These companies will be referred to as \u201cSt. Paul.\u201d The policies insured Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, ACS Systems, Inc. (ACS), and others. Fidelity National Title Insurance Company is the parent corporation of Micro General Corporation, the successor in interest through merger of ACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\"><em>The Underlying Action, Kaufman </em>v. <em>ACS Systems, Inc.: </em>On January 3, 2000, ACS was named as a defendant in the Los Angeles County Superior Court action, <em>Kaufman v. ACS Systems, Inc. </em>(No. BC 222588). The <em>Kaufman </em>class action lawsuit alleged violations of the TCPA, which prohibits sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)), violations of California\u2019s unfair competition laws (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), negligence, and invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\"><em>St. Paul\u2019s Denial of Coverage for Defense and Indemnity: </em>On January 25, 2000, ACS notified St. Paul of the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint. On April 4, 2000, stating that the policy did not cover the type of invasion of privacy alleged in the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint, St. Paul informed ACS that it denied coverage for defense and indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\"><em>The ACS Complaint Against St. Paul: </em>On November 3, 2003, ACS filed a complaint for breach of contract, equitable subrogation, implied indemnity, and declaratory relief against St. Paul. After the trial court sustained St. Paul\u2019s demurrers with leave to amend, ACS filed a first amended complaint on August 4, 2004, which is the operative complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\"><em>Allegations of the ACS Complaint: </em>Pursuant to the applicable standard of review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the operative complaint sets forth the following facts. St. Paul issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>commercial package policy No. RP06649251 insuring ACS, among others. The policy included commercial general liability and umbrella liability insurance, and was in effect from February 1, 1998 to February 1, 1999, and from February 1, 1999 to April 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The commercial general liability policy included St. Paul\u2019s duty to defend any insured in suits alleging injury or damage resulting from property damage caused by an event, or caused by an advertising injury offense committed during the policy term.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>Provisions of the Policy Obligating St. Paul to Pay for Damages for Covered Advertising Injury or Property Damages: </em>The relevant portions of the St. Paul commercial general liability policy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> describe what the policy covers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cBodily injury and property damage liability. We\u2019ll pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered bodily injury, property damage, or premises damage that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201c\u2022 happens while this agreement is in effect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201c\u2022 is caused by an event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\u201cAdvertising injury liability. We\u2019ll pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered advertising injury that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">\u201c\u2022 results from the advertising of your products, work or completed work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">\u201c\u2022 is caused by an advertising injury offense committed while this agreement is in effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\"><em>\u201cAdvertising injury </em>means injury, other than bodily injury or personal injury, caused by an advertising injury offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\"><em>\u201cAdvertising injury offense </em>means any of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">\u201c\u2022 Libel or slander.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">\u201c\u2022 Making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that belittles the products, work or completed work of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u201c\u2022 Making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">\u201c\u2022 Unauthorized taking or use of any advertising idea, material, slogan, style or title of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\"><em>\u201cAdvertising </em>means attracting the attention of others by any means for the purpose of seeking customers or increasing sales or business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\"><em>\u201cProperty damage </em>means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201c\u2022 physical damage to tangible property of others, including all resulting loss of use of that property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u201c\u2022 loss of use of tangible property of others that isn\u2019t physically damaged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\"><em>\u201cEvent </em>means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">In the underlying lawsuit, the <em>Kaufman </em>plaintiffs alleged that ACS, a software company, used the services of DataMart Information Services Corporation (DataMart) to send 13,919 unsolicited faxes to 8,216 recipients in 1998 and 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\"><em>The ACS Complaint Alleges Three Breach of Contract Causes of </em>Action: The first cause of action for breach of contract alleged that the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint sued ACS for \u201cproperty damages,\u201d seeking damages for actual losses incurred by recipients of unwanted faxes, which included use of recipients\u2019 paper and loss of use of fax machines while they printed faxed advertisements. Because the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint alleged that ACS was liable for \u201cproperty damages\u201d under the policy, the ACS complaint alleged that St. Paul breached its contracts with ACS by refusing to defend ACS in the <em>Kaufman </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">The first cause of action alleged that ACS contracted with DataMart, an advertising agency, to promote the services of ACS, and that ACS itself did not send the faxes that are the subject of the <em>Kaufman </em>suit. The complaint alleged that ACS did not authorize DataMart to send faxes in violation of any law, and at most negligently failed to assure that DataMart sent faxes only to persons giving express or implied permission to receive them. The complaint alleged that ACS reasonably believed that recipients of faxes sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>by DataMart gave express or implied permission to receive them, and that whether the faxes caused damages depended on the perspective of those receiving them. The complaint also alleged that where the insured\u2019s conduct resulted in accidental damages from the fax recipient\u2019s perspective, it constituted an \u201cevent\u201d for purposes of the \u201caccident\u201d requirements of liability policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">A second breach of contract cause of action alleged that the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint sued ACS for damages for \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d Invasion of privacy causes of action in the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint alleged that unsolicited faxes from ACS invaded the <em>Kaufman </em>plaintiffs\u2019 solitude and violated their common law and California constitutional rights of privacy. The ACS complaint also alleged that ACS had an objectively reasonable expectation that coverage for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d in the St. Paul policies extended to all torts recognized as an \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d in California law. The ACS complaint alleged that St. Paul breached its contracts with ACS by claiming that \u201cadvertising injury offenses\u201d in the policies provided no coverage and by refusing to defend ACS in the <em>Kaufman </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The ACS complaint alleged a third cause of action for breach of contract for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d based on umbrella liability coverage, which included coverage for invasion of privacy torts alleged in the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint. This cause of action alleged that St. Paul\u2019s refusal to defend ACS in the <em>Kaufman </em>litigation breached St. Paul\u2019s umbrella liability policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The ACS complaint also brought causes of action for equitable subrogation and for indemnification, which alleged that St. Paul should pay ACS\u2019s attorney fees incurred in defending the <em>Kaufman </em>litigation, which attorney fees had been paid by Micro General Corporation and Fidelity National Information Solutions, Inc. A declaratory relief cause of action sought a declaration of the obligations of ACS, Micro General Corporation, and Fidelity National Information Solutions, Inc., which contended that ACS was entitled to a defense and indemnity in the <em>Kaufman </em>litigation, and of St. Paul, which denied those obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\"><em>St. Paul\u2019s Demurrer: </em>St. Paul demurred to the first amended complaint, arguing that (1) intended conduct is not an accident, whether or not the resulting damage was intended; (2) sending unsolicited faxes could not be \u201cmaking known . . . material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>because the content of faxed advertisements did not include private material about recipients of the faxes; and (3) no insured could have an objectively reasonable expectation that it could shift the consequences of such illegal activity to its insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">ACS\u2019s opposition argued that ACS had an objectively reasonable expectation of coverage for all types of invasion of privacy reasonably within the policies\u2019 advertising injury provisions, which did not restrict coverage to fewer than all four \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d torts; and ACS had a reasonable expectation of coverage for property damage, because the policies\u2019 insuring agreements for property damage liabilities, using \u201cevent\u201d rather than \u201coccurrence,\u201d included an occurrence, incident, consequence or result, and was not limited to unexpected or unintended conduct or damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Sustaining of the Demurrer and Appeal by ACS: </em>The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. After the court filed a judgment of dismissal, ACS timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">in. issues</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address plaintiffs\u2019 claims that:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">1. A duty to defend exists for advertising injury liabilities; and</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">2. A duty to defend exists for property damage liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">A. <em>The Insurer Owes a Duty to Defend Only if the Liability Policy Provides a Potential for Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">By this action ACS seeks to require St. Paul, based on the duty to defend contained in the insurance policies, to defend ACS against the <em>Kaufman </em>plaintiffs\u2019 claims. \u201c[A]n insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of, or if the third party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 19 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) The nature and kinds of risks covered by the insurance policy establish the scope of the duty to defend. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIt is the potential for coverage under a particular policy, and in light of the specific pleadings and known facts of the third party claim, which establishes the insurer\u2019s obligation to defend.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>(Mez Industries, Inc. v. Pacific Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 856, 877 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 721].) \u201c[I]f, as a matter of law, neither the complaint nor the known extrinsic facts indicate any basis for potential coverage, the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance.\u201d <em>(Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. MV Transportation </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 643, 655 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 147, 115 P.3d 460].) The interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1109, 1115 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 647, 988 P.2d 568].) We therefore examine the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d provisions to make a determination, as a question of law, whether the St. Paul policy provided a potential for coverage of claims in the <em>Kaufinan </em>litigation against the insured, ACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">B. <em>The Interpretation of Insurance Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The interpretation of an insurance policy corresponds to the interpretation of contracts generally. The parties\u2019 mutual intention when they form the contract governs interpretation; \u201c[t]he fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) \u201cIf possible, we infer this intent solely from the written provisions of the insurance policy. [Citation.] If the policy language \u2018is clear and explicit, it governs.\u2019 [Citation.] [f] When interpreting a policy provision, we must give its terms their \u2018 \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] We must also interpret these terms \u2018in context\u2019 [citation], and give effect \u2018to every part\u2019 of the policy with \u2018each clause helping to interpret the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1115.) \u201cA policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable. [Citation.] But language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, \u2018[i]f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain, it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed, at the time of making it, that the promisee understood it.\u2019 [Citations.] This rule, as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy, protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but, rather, \u2018the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.\u2019 [Citation.] Only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1264\u20141265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Thus in determining whether a policy provides coverage based on policy language that is claimed to be ambiguous, the court \u201cmust first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. In so doing, the court must interpret the language in context, with regard to its intended function in the policy. [Citation.] This is because <em>\u2018language in a contract </em>must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole, and in the circumstances of that case, and <em>cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.\u2019 \u201d (Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">C. <em>The \u201cAdvertising Injury\u201d Provision of the St. Paul Policy Does Not Provide Liability Coverage for TCPA Violations or for Invasion of Privacy Arising from Unsolicited Faxed Advertisements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">ACS claims that the <em>Kaufman </em>action alleges a particular invasion of privacy, the \u201c \u2018unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that this tort is included within the definition of \u201cadvertising injury offense\u201d in the St. Paul policy, and that the St. Paul policy therefore covered this liability and St. Paul owed ACS a duty to defend. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">As we have seen, the advertising injury liability provision obligated St. Paul to indemnify and to provide a defense for damages for covered advertising injury \u201ccaused by an advertising injury offense committed while this agreement is in effect.\u201d The policies define four advertising injury offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\u201cLibel or slander.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">\u201cMaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that belittles the products, work or completed work of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\n<em>\u201cMaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy.[</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>4</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em>]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cUnauthorized taking or use of any advertising idea, material, slogan, style or title of others.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">ACS argues that the italicized advertising injury offense provided liability coverage for the allegations in the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint. The <em>Kaufman </em>complaint alleged that defendants (ACS and DataMart) faxed thousands of unsolicited advertisements for ACS to facsimile machines of persons, businesses, and entities in California, which violated the TCPA and Business and Professions Code section 17200, negligently breached duties (owed to persons who received their advertisements) to advertise in a lawful manner that complies with these statutes, and invaded the plaintiffs\u2019 privacy in violation of common law and rights of privacy under the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The issue in this appeal is whether the conduct alleged in the <em>Kaufman </em>suit constitutes the \u201cadvertising injury offense\u201d of \u201c[mjaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d in the St. Paul policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We examine both the text\u2014the written advertising injury provision\u2014of the St. Paul insurance policy, and interpret this provision in context, giving effect to every part of the policy with each clause helping to interpret the others. <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 1115.) By interpreting the text of the advertising injury offense\u2014\u201c[mjaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d\u2014and by analyzing this provision in the context in which it appears in the St. Paul policy, we conclude that the policy does not provide liability coverage for the conduct alleged in the <em>Kaufman </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">1. <em>The \u201cRight of Privacy\u201d: Seclusion and Secrecy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The courts have found it analytically helpful to identify two meanings for \u201cthe right of privacy\u201d: \u201csecrecy\u201d and \u201cseclusion.\u201d <em>(Resource Bankshares v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(4th Cir. 2005) 407 F.3d 631, 640-641 <em>(Resource Bankshares); American St. Ins. v. Capital Assoc. Jackson Co. </em>(7th Cir. 2004) 392 F.3d 939, 941 <em>(American States).) </em>\u201cA person who wants to conceal a criminal conviction, bankruptcy, or love affair from friends or business relations asserts a claim to privacy in the sense of secrecy. A person who wants to stop solicitors from ringing his doorbell and peddling vacuum cleaners at 9 p.m. asserts a claim to privacy in the sense of seclusion.\u201d <em>(American States, </em>at p. 941.) Thus a person claiming the privacy right of seclusion asserts the right to be free, in a particular location, from disturbance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>by </em>others. A person claiming the privacy right of secrecy asserts the right to prevent disclosure of personal information <em>to </em>others. Invasion of the privacy right of seclusion involves the <em>means, manner, and method </em>of communication in a location (or at a time) which disturbs the recipient\u2019s seclusion. By contrast, invasion of the privacy right of secrecy involves the <em>content </em>of communication that occurs when someone\u2019s private, personal information is disclosed to a third person. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">St. Paul contends that its policy provision provides coverage for invasions of a person\u2019s secrecy privacy, which the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint did not allege against ACS. ACS contends that the St. Paul policy provision provides coverage for the invasions of a person\u2019s seclusion privacy which were alleged in the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint. We must decide which of these two mutually exclusive interpretations is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">By alleging violations of the TCPA, the <em>Kaufman </em>suit alleged the violation of \u201cseclusion\u201d privacy. <em>(Resource Bankshares, supra, </em>407 F.3d at p. 641; see also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227; Cong. Statement of Findings, Pub.L. No. 102-243, \u00a7 2 (Dec. 20, 1991) 105 Stat. 2394; <em>American States, supra, </em>392 F.3d at pp. 942-943.) Our task, however, is not to identify which privacy right is enforced by 47 United States Code section 227(b)(1)(C) of the TCPA. The issue is whether the \u201cadvertising injury offense\u201d provision of the St. Paul policy creates a potential for coverage of claims in the <em>Kaufman </em>suit brought under this TCPA statute. (See <em>American States, </em>at p. 942.) We find that both the text of the advertising injury offense at issue and the context in which that advertising injury offense appears in the St. Paul policy confirm that the policy did not provide liability coverage for claims in the <em>Kaufman </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">2. <em>Analysis of the Text</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The text of the advertising injury offense at issue is \u201cmaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d It is true that sending unsolicited faxed advertisements constitutes a \u201cmaking known\u201d of \u201cwritten . . . material\u201d to the recipient. Under the St. Paul policy, however, making known written material is not enough to trigger coverage. Coverage requires an additional element, the making known of \u201cmaterial\u201d that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy. That is, the <em>content </em>of the \u201cmaterial\u201d violates someone\u2019s right of privacy when that material is \u201cmade known.\u201d \u201c \u2018[M]aking known\u2019 implies telling, sharing or otherwise divulging, such that the injured party is the one whose private material is <em>made known, </em>not the one <em>to whom </em>the material is made known.\u201d <em>(Resource Bankshares, supra, </em>407 F.3d at p. 641, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Thus the coverage applies to liability for injury caused by the disclosure of private <em>content </em>to a third party\u2014to the invasion of \u201csecrecy privacy\u201d caused by \u201cmaking known\u201d to a third party \u201cmaterial that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d The coverage does not apply to injury caused by receipt of an unauthorized advertising fax, because in that case no disclosure of private facts to a third party has occurred: The recipient of an unauthorized advertising fax has no claim that \u201cmaterial that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d has been \u201cmade known\u201d to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The \u201clast antecedent rule\u201d underscores this interpretation. The last antecedent rule provides that \u201c \u2018 \u201cqualifying words, phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Renee J. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 735, 743 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 28 P.3d 876].) Ordinarily the last antecedent rule applies to statutory construction, but it has also been stated to apply to contracts <em>(People ex rel. Lockyer v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 516, 529 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 151]) and has been used specifically to interpret insurance policy language. <em>(Anderson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 346, 349 [75 Cal.Rptr. 739]; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Eastman </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 562, 569 [204 Cal.Rptr. 827].) Considered grammatically, the word \u201cthat\u201d in \u201c[m]aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d can reasonably be interpreted only to refer to \u201cmaterial.\u201d We find that \u201cmaterial\u201d is not only the last antecedent of \u201cthat\u201d but is also its only antecedent. \u201cThat\u201d does not refer to \u201cmaking known.\u201d Thus this particular advertising offense only refers to \u201cmaterial that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy,\u201d and does not refer to a \u201cmaking known that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Nothing in the <em>content </em>of the \u201cwritten or spoken material\u201d in unsolicited faxed advertisements violated the recipients\u2019 secrecy right of privacy. The faxes contained no facts about the recipients, and did not disclose or \u201cmake known\u201d any private information about the recipients to third parties. (See <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. v. Brunswick Corp. </em>(N.D.Ill. 2005) 405 F.Supp.2d 890, 895.) Analyzing the same St. Paul policy language as that in this appeal, <em>Resource Bankshares, supra, </em>407 F.3d 631, concluded: \u201cIt requires undue strain to believe that sending an unsolicited fax ad that has no private information or content (but rather simply advertised fairly the sender\u2019s wares) can reasonably be said to \u2018mak[e] known\u2019 material that violates a person\u2019s right to privacy. . . . [T]he plainest and most common reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>phrase indicates that \u2018making known\u2019 implies telling, sharing or otherwise divulging, such that the injured party is the one whose private material is <em>made known, </em>not the one <em>to whom </em>the material is made known.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 641, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Therefore the faxes did not violate the recipients\u2019 right of privacy so as to constitute an \u201cadvertising injury offense,\u201d and this provision of the St. Paul policy did not provide a potential for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">3. <em>Analysis of the Context</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We interpret an insurance policy provision by giving effect to every part of the policy, with each clause helping to interpret the other, so as to avoid finding ambiguity in the abstract and in order instead to construe language in the context of the contract as a whole. <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1118.) The St. Paul policy definitions of \u201cadvertising injury offenses\u201d provide a context that clarifies the meaning of the provision at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">As stated, the St. Paul policy defines four \u201cadvertising injury offenses.\u201d The first, \u201clibel or slander,\u201d involves a publication of defamatory content about someone to a third person. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 45, 46; <em>Live Oak Publishing Co. v. Cohagan </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1284 [286 Cal.Rptr. 198]; <em>Smith v. Maldonado </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 637, 645 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 397].) The second, \u201c[m]aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that belittles the products, work or completed work of others,\u201d likewise involves a publication to a third person of content that belittles someone\u2019s products, work or completed work. The fourth advertising injury offense involves the unauthorized taking or use of content\u2014of someone else\u2019s \u201cadvertising idea, material, slogan, style or title.\u201d These three advertising injury offenses therefore all involve the insured\u2019s making known or unauthorized taking or use of <em>content </em>which injures someone. Interpreting \u201c[m]aking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d in the context of the other three advertising injury offenses leads to the conclusion that it likewise involves not the mere communication or \u201cmaking known\u201d of written or spoken material. The covered advertising injury offense involves communication or making known of written or spoken material whose content injures someone else. Interpreting a St. Paul insurance policy containing these same four definitions of advertising injury, <em>Resource Bankshares, supra, </em>407 F.3d 631 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>stated: \u201c[T]hese four offenses all share the common thread of assuming that the victim of the advertising injury offense is harmed by the sharing of the <em>content </em>of the ad, not the mere <em>receipt </em>of the advertisement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 641, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Therefore the St. Paul advertising injury offense before us provides coverage only if the harmful content violates the secrecy right of privacy, and does not provide coverage for a violation of the seclusion right of privacy. The TCPA prohibits the faxing of unsolicited advertising rather than prohibiting or regulating advertising content itself. By focusing on the means, manner, and method\u2014the faxing\u2014of the advertising, the TCPA protects the seclusion right of privacy. <em>(Resource Bankshares, </em>supra, 407 F.3d at p. 642.) The three other advertising injury offenses in the St. Paul policy provide coverage for liability arising from injury to the secrecy privacy right caused by the publication or taking or use of content. Given this context, it would be unreasonable to give a different interpretation to the advertising injury offense at issue. It likewise does not cover liability for injury caused by the mere sending of unsolicited faxes; \u201c[mjaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d provides liability coverage only when the content of an unsolicited fax (or other spoken or written material) causes injury to someone else by violating that person\u2019s secrecy right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">All four advertising offenses involve violations of the \u201csecrecy\u201d right of privacy. None of them involves the \u201cseclusion\u201d right of privacy\u2014the right claimed to have been violated in the <em>Kaufman </em>litigation. The context of the other three advertising injury offenses indicates that the St. Paul policy did not provide coverage for liability caused by the transmission to a recipient of faxed advertisements whose content (1) contained no private information about the recipient and (2) was not communicated to a third party, and which for both these reasons did not violate the recipient\u2019s right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">4. <em>Other Case Authority Has Held That the Advertising Injury Offense at Issue Did Not Provide Coverage for TCPA Violations, and Case Authority Provided by ACS Is Distinguishable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Two federal cases have held that TCPA violations were not covered as an advertising injury offense. <em>American States, supra, </em>392 F.3d 939, also involved a class action suit brought by recipients of unsolicited faxed advertisements against the insured, the sender of the faxes, for violations of the TCPA. The insured tendered defense of the suit to the insurer, claiming coverage under an insurance policy that defined advertising injury as \u201c \u2018oral or written publication of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy.\u2019 \u201d (392 F.3d at p. 940.) <em>American States </em>held that this advertising-injury policy clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>provided coverage for injury arising from violation of secrecy privacy and did not provide liability coverage for the normal consequences of unsolicited faxed advertisements. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><em>Resource Bankshares, supra, </em>407 F.3d 631, also involved a class action suit brought by recipients of an insured\u2019s faxes claiming violations of the TCPA. The insured, Resource Bankshares Corporation, sought a declaration that the class action suit triggered coverage under St. Paul insurance policies containing an advertising injury offense identical to that in the St. Paul umbrella policy in this appeal, defining the advertising injury offense as \u201c[mjaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d (407 F.3d at p. 634, italics omitted.) <em>Resource Bankshares </em>followed the analysis of seclusion privacy and secrecy privacy in <em>American States, </em>and held that the St. Paul advertising injury offense did not provide coverage for injury caused to recipients of unsolicited faxed advertisements in violation of the TCPA. <em>(Resource Bankshares, </em>at p. 640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">ACS relies on cases which, it argues, found that, based on advertising injury policy provisions, insurers owe a duty to defend insureds sued in TCPA cases. These cases are distinguishable because they are based on policy language which differs from the advertising injury offense of \u201c[mjaking known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual\u2019s right of privacy\u201d in the St. Paul policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\"><em>Universal Underwriters v. Lou Fusz Automotive </em>(8th Cir. 2005) 401 F.3d 876 found that a complaint against an insured for violations of the TCPA alleged an \u201cinjury,\u201d defined by the insurance policy to include \u201c \u2018private nuisance (except pollution), [and] invasion of rights of privacy or possession of personal property,\u2019 \u201d without limiting, defining, or qualifying these terms in any way. (401 F.3d at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\"><em>Park Univer. Enter. </em>v. <em>Am. Cas. Co., Reading, PA. </em>(D.Kan. 2004) 314 F.Supp.2d 1094 found that an insurer owed a duty to defend an insured, which was sued for violations of the TCPA, based on policy language requiring the insurer to pay an insured\u2019s damages caused by an \u201c \u2018advertising injury,\u2019 \u201d defined as \u201c \u2018injury . . . arising out of . . . oral or written publication of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy,\u2019 \u201d where the policy did not define \u201cright of privacy\u201d or \u201c \u2018oral or written publication.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Park Univ. Enter., </em>at pp. 1099, 1106, 1108-1110, affd. (10th Cir. 2006) 442 F.3d 1239, 1248-1251.) The other cases reached the same result based on the same insurance policy language. <em>(Hooters of Augusta, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Global Ins. Co. </em>(S.D.Ga. 2003) 272 F.Supp.2d 1365, 1371-1374; <em>Western Rim Inv. Advisors, Inc. v. Gulf Ins. Co. </em>(N.D.Tex. 2003) 269 F.Supp.2d 836, 845-847; <em>Prime TV, LLC </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(M.D.N.C. 2002) 223 F.Supp.2d 744, 748, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>752-753; and <em>TIG Ins. Co. v. Dallas Basketball, Ltd. </em>(Tex.App. 2004) 129 S.W.3d 232, 237-239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">5. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Because the \u201cadvertising injury offense\u201d provision in the insurance policies did not cover ACS\u2019s conduct which was alleged in the <em>Kaufman </em>litigation, St. Paul had no duty to defend ACS under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">D. <em>The \u201cProperty Damage\u201d Provision of the St. Paul Policy Does Not Provide Liability Coverage for TCPA Violations or for Invasion of Privacy Arising from Unsolicited Faxed Advertisements, and the Policy Specifically Excludes Intentional Property Damage from Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The insurance policies obligate St. Paul to pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered property damage \u201cthat happens while this agreement is in effect; and is caused by an event.\u201d The policies define \u201cproperty damage\u201d to mean \u201cphysical damage to tangible property of others, including all resulting loss of use of that property; or loss of use of tangible property of others that isn\u2019t physically damaged.\u201d The commercial general liability policy further states: \u201cWe\u2019ll consider all loss of use of damaged tangible property to happen at the time of the physical damage which caused it. And we\u2019ll consider all loss of use of undamaged tangible property to happen at the time of the event which caused it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the policies, an \u201cevent\u201d means \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">ACS argues that facts alleged in the <em>Kaufman </em>action\u2014that faxing unsolicited ads consumes the recipients\u2019 ink and paper\u2014constitute \u201cphysical damage to tangible property of others,\u201d and also \u201closs of use of tangible property of others\u201d while a fax machine receives the unsolicited advertisement. ACS therefore claims that allegations in the <em>Kaufman </em>complaints implicate both definitions of \u201cproperty damage,\u201d that this property damage was alleged to have happened during the terms of the St. Paul policies, and that the trial court erroneously found that those facts did not constitute an \u201cevent\u201d necessary to trigger insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The <em>Kaufman </em>complaint did not specifically cite the consumption of ink and paper by unsolicited faxed advertisements, but instead referred to \u201ca shifting of advertisement costs from defendants onto the persons, businesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and entities who have received these faxes.\u201d The <em>Kaufman </em>complaint asserted statutory damages for TCPA violations under section 227(b)(3) of the TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Assuming without deciding that the <em>Kaufman </em>complaint alleged \u201cproperty damage,\u201d the St. Paul policy did not provide coverage, for two reasons. First, this property damage was not caused by an \u201cevent\u201d because the fax transmissions were not an \u201caccident.\u201d An \u201caccident\u201d requires unintentional acts or conduct. <em>(Ray v. Valley Forge Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1045 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 473].) ACS intended the fax transmissions to occur. \u201c[W]here the insured intended all of the acts that resulted in the victim\u2019s injury, the event may not be deemed an \u2018accident\u2019 merely because the insured did not intend to cause injury.\u201d <em>(Merced Mutual Ins. Co. v. Mendez </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 41, 50 [261 Cal.Rptr. 273]; see also <em>Quan v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 583, 598-599 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 134].)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Second, the St. Paul policy expressly excludes \u201c[i]ntentional bodily injury or property damage\u201d from coverage. A section of the policy captioned \u201cExclusions\u2014What This Agreement Won\u2019t Cover\u201d states, in relevant part: \u201cWe won\u2019t cover bodily injury or property damage that\u2019s expected or intended by the protected person.\u201d This exclusion reiterates the concept that the St. Paul policy does not cover property damage not caused by an \u201cevent\u201d\u2014that is, which is not accidental. \u201cBecause <em>every </em>junk fax invades the recipient\u2019s property interest in consumables, this normal outcome is not covered\u201d by the St. Paul policy. <em>(American States, supra, </em>392 F.3d at p. 943.) The sender of a fax necessarily anticipates and intends the consequence that printing the faxed document will use the recipient\u2019s ink and paper and will cause the recipient\u2019s loss of use of the fax machine during transmission. The exclusion for intentional property damage therefore forecloses coverage, because the fax recipient\u2019s loss is \u201c \u2018expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Resource Bankshares, supra, </em>407 F.3d at p. 639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">For these reasons, the property damage provision of the St. Paul policy provided no coverage, and therefore St. Paul had no duty to defend ACS in the <em>Kaufman </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">E. <em>The Trial Court Properly Denied Plaintiff\u2019s Untimely Motion for Judgment on the </em>Pleadings<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>V.

In reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, this court treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. This court also considers matters that may be judicially noticed. When a demurrer is sustained, this court determines whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. When a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, this court decides whether a reasonable possibility exists that amendment may cure the defect; if it can we reverse, but if not we affirm. <em>(Blank v.
