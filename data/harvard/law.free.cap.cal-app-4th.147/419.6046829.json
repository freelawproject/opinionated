(father), father of dependent daughter A.V., petitions for extraordinary writ review of orders setting a permanency planning hearing, terminating reunification services, and granting a Los <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) petition requesting that father\u2019s custody, pending the rehearing of a referee\u2019s order granting custody to father, be modified to allow monitored visits only. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 366.22, 366.26, &amp; 388;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.452 [former rule 38.1] (hereafter Rule).) We deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude that a referee\u2019s order is not automatically vacated when a party\u2019s request for rehearing before a judge is granted. Pursuant to section 250, that order remains in force until a new order is made after rehearing of the original order or pursuant to other procedures authorizing the court to modify an existing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we hold that if any error resulted from the dependency court\u2019s alternate reading of section 250, such error was harmless, that at any rate father failed to preserve this issue by not raising it in the trial court, and that substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">On July 12, 2006, a dependency court referee ordered that A.V. be placed permanently in father\u2019s home. After A.V.\u2019s counsel timely sought a rehearing before a judge, which was granted on August 7, on August 21, 2006, the dependency court judge set a rehearing date of August 31 and stated that upon the grant of a rehearing, the case\u2019s status reverted back to where it stood before the referee\u2019s order, thus reviving the earlier suitable placement order that placed A.V. with her caregivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Father contends that the dependency judge erred in vacating, on August 21, 2006, the referee\u2019s July 12, 2006 order pending rehearing, because section 250 prohibits a judge from vacating or modifying the referee\u2019s order until after a rehearing. (\u00a7 250 \u201c[Subject to limitations in sections 249 &amp; 251,] all orders of a referee . . . shall become immediately effective . . . , and shall continue in full force and effect until vacated or modified upon rehearing by order of the judge of the juvenile court.\u201d].) DCFS, in response, contends that this statutory language should be read to mean that a referee\u2019s order may be vacated by a judge\u2019s order at any point after a rehearing is granted, even before the actual rehearing occurs, and that the dependency court\u2019s declaration that the case reverted to its status before the July 2006 hearing was such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">There is some legitimate confusion in the law on this point. It is true that certain dated court opinions indicate that a referee\u2019s order like those in this case becomes a nullity upon grant of rehearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(In re Anthony M. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 464, 468 [134 Cal.Rptr. 540]; <em>In re Dale S. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 952, 957 [89 Cal.Rptr. 499].) The Advisory Committee comment to the later rule 1318, a closely similar predecessor to the current rule 5.540 that was also associated with section 250, however, noted that rule 1318 did not \u201cfollow the concept stated in In re Dale S. . . . , that the order of the referee becomes a \u2018nullity\u2019 upon the mere granting of a rehearing\u201d and indicated that the referee\u2019s order should remain in effect until the dependency judge has reviewed it. (Deering\u2019s Cal. Codes Ann., Rules of Court (1980) p. 329.) Although father offers no authority to support his interpretation aside from the plain language of section 250 itself, based on that language and the comment on rule 1318 it appears that section 250 and rule 5.540 should be read straightforwardly to give force and effect to a referee\u2019s rehearable order until the matter covered by the order actually has been reheard.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The petition for an extraordinary writ is denied.
