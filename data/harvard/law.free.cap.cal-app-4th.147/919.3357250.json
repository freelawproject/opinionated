Hatfield after Luckett\u2019s complaint was dismissed for failure to post a vexatious litigant\u2019s bond. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 391.7.) Because attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable under that statute when a complaint is dismissed solely for the failure to post the required bond, we hold that the trial court erred by awarding fees on that basis. The order is therefore reversed to the extent it awarded defendants their attorney\u2019s fees, but is affirmed as to the award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">In 1991, John Luckett was declared a vexatious litigant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(In re Luckett </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 107, 110 [283 Cal.Rptr. 312] <em>(Luckett).) </em>As required by subdivision (a) of section 391.7, Luckett, acting in propria persona, sought leave of court in March 2005 to file an action against John Peter Lee, John Peter Lee, Ltd., and Trevor J. Hatfield (respondents).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proposed complaint alleged that respondents, who are Nevada lawyers, improperly sought to enforce a Nevada state court judgment against Luckett. Because the trial court believed that documents attached as exhibits to Luckett\u2019s complaint did not show that Luckett was in fact affected by the Nevada judgment and enforcement proceedings, the trial court concluded Luckett\u2019s action lacked merit, and ordered Luckett to post a $25,000 bond, as authorized by the vexatious litigant statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>After the court denied Luckett\u2019s motion for reconsideration, he petitioned this court for a writ of mandate, contending there were documents showing he had been targeted by the Nevada judgment enforcement proceedings. Based on documents supporting that contention, we ruled that the trial court erred by denying the motion for reconsideration and issued a <em>Palma</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>notice that we would issue a peremptory writ unless the trial court granted Luckett\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Because our ruling was based solely on the trial court\u2019s mistaken factual assumption, we made clear that when reconsidering the motion, the trial court was free to determine for itself whether Luckett\u2019s proposed complaint lacked merit and was filed for purposes of harassment or delay. If the trial court proceeded as suggested within 13 days, we would not issue a peremptory writ, and a stay of any bond order would be lifted at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">In response to our <em>Palma </em>notice, the trial court reconsidered whether Luckett should post a vexatious litigant\u2019s bond. The court concluded there might be merit to some but not all of Luckett\u2019s claims. It also noted that the 1991 <em>Luckett </em>decision, which determined that Luckett was a vexatious litigant, was based in part on his plethora of frivolous motions. The trial court in this action said Luckett was repeating that conduct: \u201cIn the instant case, in a matter of three weeks, plaintiff has again shown indicators of precisely this same conduct. Indeed, this court and specially appearing defendants have received repetitive and duplicate filings and motions on almost a daily basis. More than one of these purported motions are of questionable validity, running the gamut from a lack of standing (attacking the timing of defendants\u2019 payment of filing fees for their special appearance), seeking sanctions in sums totaling $500,000 for the \u2018stress\u2019 allegedly inflicted upon him by defendants\u2019 special appearance, and because a second pending case filed by plaintiff has, apparently, now been dismissed by a Nevada court.\u201d As a result, defendants were required to respond to these motions, justifying an order to post security. Taking Luckett\u2019s claimed indigency into account, the court ordered him to post security of $3,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Luckett never posted the bond. Instead, he filed and served his complaint and entered respondents\u2019 defaults. Respondents moved to vacate the defaults because the bond had never been posted, and the complaint should therefore never have been filed. The trial court agreed, vacated the defaults, and dismissed Luckett\u2019s complaint based on his failure to post the required bond. Respondents later sought to recover their costs and attorney\u2019s fees based on the dismissal of Luckett\u2019s complaint, pursuant to section 391.7. Even though respondents sought attorney\u2019s fees of nearly $26,000, the court limited respondents\u2019 fee recovery to the amount of the $3,500 bond that Luckett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>failed to post. The court also awarded respondents more than $1,400 in costs. Luckett appealed, contending the trial court erred by ordering him to pay attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of the bond he should have posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The vexatious litigant statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 391-391.7) were enacted in 1963 to restrain misuse of the legal system by self-represented parties who continually relitigate the same issues. <em>(Singh v. Lipworth </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 40, 44 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 178] <em>(Singh).) </em>A vexatious litigant is someone who, while representing himself, either brought and lost at least five actions in the preceding seven years, attempted to relitigate an action he had lost, repeatedly filed meritless motions, pleadings, or papers, or had previously been declared a vexatious litigant by another court. (\u00a7 391, subd. (b)(1)-(4).) Upon motion by a defendant in a pending action, and a showing that there is no reasonable probability a vexatious litigant will prevail in an action, the court may order the plaintiff to post security to cover the defendant\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees. If the security is not posted, the action will be dismissed. (\u00a7\u00a7 391.1-391.4; <em>Singh, supra, </em>at pp. 44-45, 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Section 391.7 permits a court, acting on its own motion or that of a party, to enter a <em>prefiling </em>order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing a new action without first obtaining leave of court. (\u00a7 391.7, subd. (a).) The new action may be filed only if it appears to have merit and was not brought for the purposes of harassment or delay. Such an action may still be subject to an order to post security pursuant to section 391.3. (\u00a7 391.7, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When such a prefiling order has been issued, the clerk may not file the action without an order from the court allowing the plaintiff to file his complaint. If the clerk mistakenly permits the filing of an action without such an order, upon filing of a proper notice by any party, the action may be stayed for 10 days until permission to file is granted. If the plaintiff does not then obtain the order, the action will be dismissed. (\u00a7 391.7, subd. (c).) A vexatious litigant who disobeys a prefiling order may be punished for contempt of court. (\u00a7 391.7, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The <em>Singh </em>court considered an appeal from a vexatious litigant whose action had been dismissed because he failed to post the required security under section 391.3. The plaintiff argued that he could not be required to post security for the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees unless some independent statutory or contractual basis for awarding such fees existed. The <em>Singh </em>court disagreed, interpreting the vexatious litigant statutes as an independent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>self-executing basis for awarding fees from previously posted security whenever a vexatious litigant pursued and lost an action that had been found to lack merit under sections 391 through 391.4. <em>(Singh, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 45-47.) According to the <em>Singh </em>court, the liability and the remedy were created by the vexatious litigant statutes, which authorized an attorney\u2019s fees award in favor of a successful defendant from the security posted by a vexatious litigant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 47.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">After finding that some portions of Luckett\u2019s complaint had merit, the trial court ordered Luckett to post security of $3,500 pursuant to section 391.7. When it dismissed Luckett\u2019s complaint for failing to do so, the court ordered him to pay respondents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of the unposted bond. Because <em>Singh </em>interpreted the vexatious litigant statutes to authorize an attorney\u2019s fees award from the plaintiff\u2019s security, the trial court reasoned that Luckett should be liable for respondents\u2019 fees in the amount of the bond he failed to post. Luckett contends the statute does not authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees where an action is dismissed for the failure to post security for such fees in the first instance. He is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Because we are interpreting a statute, the rules of statutory construction apply. \u201c \u2018The fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law. . . . In doing so, we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual, ordinary import of the language, at the same time not rendering any language mere surplusage. The words must be construed in context and in light of the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear. . . . The statute \u201c \u2018must be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the Legislature, practical rather than technical in nature, and which, when applied, will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity. If the language of a statute is clear, we should not add to or alter it to accomplish a purpose which does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.\u2019 [Citation.] Statutes must be harmonized, both internally and with each other. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pang v. Beverly Hospital, Inc. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 994 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 643].) When interpreting a statute based on another that covers a similar subject and uses similar language, we presume the Legislature intended that both be similarly construed unless a contrary intention clearly appears. <em>(Singh, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>The vexatious litigant statutes were modeled after former section 834 (now \u00a7 800) of the Corporations Code, which permitted defendants in shareholder derivative actions to move for an order requiring the plaintiff to post a bond as security for costs and attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that there was no reasonable probability the action would benefit the corporation. <em>(Singh, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 45-46.) Although Corporations Code former section 834 provided that the defendant could have recourse to the plaintiff\u2019s security to cover its reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees, the statute did not provide for attorney\u2019s fees where the bond was not posted and the action was dismissed on that basis. <em>(Singh, supra, </em>at p. 47, citing <em>Freeman v. Goldberg </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 622, 626 [12 Cal.Rptr. 668, 361 P.2d 244].) In short, even though <em>Singh </em>held that attorney\u2019s fees could be paid from the unsuccessful vexatious litigant\u2019s bond at the conclusion of the litigation, it said, albeit by way of dicta, that such fees were not available when a vexatious litigant\u2019s action was dismissed for failing to post any bond at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Nothing in section 391.7 or the rest of the vexatious litigant statutes authorizes payment of a defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees when the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed for his failure to post security. Instead, the statutes authorize dismissal of the action (\u00a7\u00a7 391.4, 391.7, subd. (c)), and the possibility of a civil contempt proceeding for filing an action in disobedience of a prefiling order. (\u00a7 391.7, subd. (a).) A party found in contempt for disobeying a court order may be fined up to $1,000 and ordered to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of a party who brings a contempt motion, <em>with the fees limited to those incurred in connection with the contempt motion. </em>(\u00a7 1218, subd. (a); <em>Trans-Action Commercial Investors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Firmaterr, Inc. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 352, 366, 371 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 449].) Full compensation of attorney\u2019s fees incurred due to frivolous or meritless pleadings and motions is provided by section 128.7. (60 Cal.App.4th at p. 367 [noting that sanctions under \u00a7 128.5, and later under section 128.7, were intended to address a Supreme Court decision holding that attorney\u2019s fees were not recoverable in civil contempt proceedings].) Respondents did ask the trial court to consider a civil contempt proceeding, but the court did not do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They do not contend, and the record does not show, that they ever moved for sanctions under section 128.7.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Given the similarity between section 391.7 and Corporations Code former section 834, and the absence of any language in the vexatious litigant statutes authorizing an award of attorney\u2019s fees when a complaint is dismissed because the plaintiff failed to post security, we decline to add such language to its provisions. <em>(Singh, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 45-47; <em>Pang </em>v. <em>Beverly Hospital, Inc., supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the order to the extent it awarded respondents their attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the action was dismissed in respondents\u2019 favor, however, they were the prevailing parties and were entitled to their costs. (\u00a7 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b) [prevailing party is entitled to costs as a matter of right, and a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered is a prevailing party].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the order awarding respondents their costs and attorney\u2019s fees is reversed as to only the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The costs award is affirmed. Each party to bear its own costs on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Cooper, P. J., and Flier, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 28, 2007, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 25, 2007, S151164.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\"> All further undesignated section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure. Although we discuss the vexatious litigant statutes in detail <em>post, </em>in general terms they apply to self-represented plaintiffs who relitigate the merits of actions they lost, or who continually file meritless motions or pleadings. When such plaintiffs bring a new action, the court may require them to post security for the defendant\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees. (\u00a7\u00a7 391-391.7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-12\"> Also named as proposed defendants were John Keylee and Eddie Gulbenkian.

U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 180 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b808-9\"> Section 391.3 provides that after the court hears the evidence and determines that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant whose action has no reasonable probability of success, the court shall order the plaintiff to furnish security for the defendant\u2019s benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\"> <em>Singh </em>reached this result by interpreting the vexatious litigant statutes in light of section 996.460, governing liabilities on bonds, which was enacted to replace former section 391.5. Former section 391.5 read, in relevant part, that \u201c \u2018[u]pon the termination of the litigation the defendant shall have recourse to the security in such amount as the court shall determine.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Singh, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 46-47, &amp; fn. 6.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b810-5\"> Respondents ask us to salvage their attorney\u2019s fees award under the contempt provisions of section 391.7. Because the procedural requirements for a contempt order were never followed (see \u00a7\u00a7 1211, subd. (b), 1211.5, 1217, 1218, subd. (a)), we cannot do so. However, our decision does not preclude respondents from seeking a contempt order upon remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\"> Given the safe harbor provisions of section 128.7, which require giving the party to be sanctioned 21 days\u2019 notice to withdraw the offending pleading or motion before moving for sanctions (\u00a7 128.7, subd. (c)(1)), and the fact that the offending complaint has already been dismissed, respondents may be precluded from obtaining sanctions under that provision. Section 128.7 has its own set of unique procedural features, and we do not address their applicability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>in the context of vexatious litigants. Nor do we express any opinion as to whether contempt was, or still is, available for the conduct that occurred in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\"> We acknowledge the anomaly created by our interpretation of section 397.1: Attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable under the statute from those vexatious litigants who comply with the trial court\u2019s order to post security, but not from those litigants, like Luckett, who flout the court\u2019s order. Proceeding under section 128.7 or by way of contempt is likely to involve even more attorney time and effort, and we recognize we have contributed to the increased cost by our opinion today. Including a provision for a direct award of attorney\u2019s fees within section 391.7 would streamline the process, and the Legislature may wish to consider whether an amendment to that effect might be warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\"> Because we reverse the fee award on this ground, we need not reach the other issues raised in Luckett\u2019s brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\"> Luckett contends, without citation to authority, that the cost award was improper because respondents were not the prevailing parties. Citing to <em>Hon v. Marshall </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 470 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 11], Luckett contends respondents cannot recover their costs because the dismissal of his complaint was not on the merits. <em>Hon </em>concerned the definition of a prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees in a job discrimination claim brought under the Fair Employment and Housing Act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12965, subd. (b).) Looking to federal civil rights cases, the <em>Hon </em>court held that a defendant who obtained a dismissal for jurisdictional defects was not entitled to fees as a prevailing party. That body of law has no application here. As mentioned above, section 1032, subdivision (a)(4) defines \u201cprevailing party\u201d as including a defendant who has obtained a dismissal in his favor, and such costs have been affirmed when a dismissal was entered for reasons unrelated to the merits of an action. (See <em>McMahan\u2019s v. McMahan Serv. Corp. </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 607, 609 [302 P.2d 847] [costs awarded to defendant when complaint was dismissed for failure to prosecute].) Luckett also contends that respondents are not entitled to recover their costs because they only specially appeared in the action. We reject that proposition both on the merits and because it was not supported by citation to authority. <em>(Landry v. Berryessa Union School Dist. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 691, 699-700 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 119].) Finally, Luckett contended at oral argument that costs were not proper because the dismissal of his complaint meant there had never been a complaint at all. We reject that notion as well. To the extent Luckett might contend he has raised any other issues in his appellate brief, we treat them waived based on his failure to cite to applicable portions of the record, to make intelligible legal arguments, or to cite applicable authorities. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> Luckett\u2019s request that we judicially notice the record of his two previous writ proceedings (B186681 and B188606) is granted. His motion to allow review of other issues raised by other notices of appeal, which were dismissed by this court on January 17, 2006, is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
