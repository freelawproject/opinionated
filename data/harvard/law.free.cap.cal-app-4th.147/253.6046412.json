In administrative proceedings conducted by Monterey County officials and later by the California Coastal Commission, the real parties in interest won approval to construct a large single-family dwelling on the Big Sur Coast. In judicial proceedings below, real parties in interest and defendants successfully demurred to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, which was then dismissed. On appeal, plaintiff contends that the dismissal was improper procedurally, because the demurrer was unauthorized and untimely. He also argues that the dismissal was improper substantively because he has a valid cause of action against the county based on jurisdictional grounds and based on the county\u2019s violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.; CEQA).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">As we explain, we find no merit in plaintiff\u2019s contentions. Procedurally, the trial court acted within its discretion in entertaining a second demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint after the conclusion of Coastal Commission proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Substantively, there is no merit in plaintiff\u2019s jurisdictional claims that Monterey County\u2019s action was a legal nullity, since those allegations both conflict with judicially noticed documents and represent bare legal conclusions. Nor can plaintiff state a valid cause of action against the county under CEQA, because its determinations were superseded by the Coastal Commission\u2019s environmental review. Treating the trial court\u2019s order as a judgment of dismissal, we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\n<em>The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Appellant is Dr. Hugh McAllister (McAllister). McAllister chairs the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s marine leadership committee. He also owns property along the Big Sur Coast within view of the challenged project.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Respondents are the County of Monterey and the Monterey County Board of Supervisors (collectively, the County). The County passed the resolution challenged here, which approved the coastal development proposed by real parties in interest. Real parties in interest are Sheldon J. Laube and Dr. Nancy J. Engel (Laube &amp; Engel or real parties in interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\n<em>The Proposed Development</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">In 2001, Laube &amp; Engel sought permission to develop their property, which is located on Easier Point, north of Rocky Point, at 36240 Highway 1, Big Sur. The property then consisted of two contiguous lots, each approximately two acres in size. Real parties in interests\u2019 proposal was for a large single-family home with a subterranean garage complex, measuring just over 10,000 square feet in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Many years before, the prior owner of the property, Donald Sorenson, had taken steps to build a house there. In 1977, the California Coastal Commission (Coastal Commission) granted Sorenson a development permit for a smaller home on the site, subject to certain conditions. One condition was that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>two lots would be consolidated into a single parcel prior to the commencement of any grading or construction. Despite this condition, Sorenson began grading and construction without merging the two lots. After putting in a driveway, foundation, water connections, a septic system, and certain other improvements, Sorenson abandoned the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<em>The County\u2019s Coastal Ordinances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Monterey County has a local coastal plan (LCP), which is codified in chapter 20.90 of the Monterey County Code (Chapter 20.90). The LCP includes the Big Sur land use plan; it also includes a coastal implementation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">One pertinent provision of Chapter 20.90\u2014a linchpin of McAllister\u2019s opposition to the project\u2014provides that any permit, \u201cif issued in conflict with the provisions of this title, shall be null and void.\u201d (Monterey County Code, \u00a7 20.90.010.) Another relevant provision of Chapter 20.90 prohibits the approval of permits \u201cwhere there is an outstanding violation of this Title or the remaining portions of the Monterey County Coastal Implementation Plan involving the property upon which there is a pending application for such permit, . . . unless such permit ... is the, or part of the, administrative remedy for the violation.\u201d (Monterey County Code, \u00a7 20.90.120.) That provision continues: \u201cAfter recordation of a Notice of Violation by the enforcing officer, all departments, commissions, and public employees shall refuse to issue permits or licenses or entitlements involving the property except those necessary to abate the violation . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Chapter 20.90 authorizes the County\u2019s director of planning and building inspection to establish violations of the title. (Monterey County Code, \u00a7 20.90.20.) It also provides an array of alternatives for correcting violations. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 20.90.060-20.90.090.) Among them are retroactive permits and restoration orders. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 20.90.130, 20.90.140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\n<em>Administrative Proceedings at the County</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">In early March 2001, Laube &amp; Engel applied to the County for a development permit to construct a residence on their coastal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Later that same month, real parties in interests\u2019 application was reviewed for the first time by the Big Sur Land Use Advisory Committee. The advisory committee approved the project, on condition that no outside floodlighting would be used and that the invasive ice plant on the property would be eradicated. Thereafter, based on McAllister\u2019s objections and pursuant to his requests, real parties in interest relocated the proposed home. In March 2003, the committee reviewed the proposal as modified. Despite McAllister\u2019s continued opposition, the committee voted unanimously to approve the modified project as proposed, with an additional requirement that stone be used as the building material for the walls in order to minimize view impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In October 2003, after a number of continuances, the project proceeded to the County\u2019s planning commission for a hearing. Over McAllister\u2019s opposition, the planning commission voted unanimously to approve both the proposed home and the parcel merger and to certify a mitigated negative declaration under CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In November 2003, McAllister filed an administrative appeal of the planning commission\u2019s decision, seeking review from the County\u2019s board of supervisors. In his appeal, McAllister asserted that the proposed project violated the 1977 coastal development permit obtained by real parties in interests\u2019 predecessor, that it conflicted with numerous policies in the local coastal program, that the planning commission\u2019s approval was based on misleading information, and that the project violated CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In January 2004, the board of supervisors conducted a public hearing on McAllister\u2019s appeal. Speakers at the hearing included real parties in interests\u2019 counsel; McAllister\u2019s counsel plus one witness; and the assigned land use planner for the County. The County\u2019s staff recommended denial of McAllister\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of supervisors unanimously adopted resolution No. 04-028, thereby denying McAllister\u2019s appeal. The resolution contains a number of findings, including this: \u201cThe subject property is in compliance with all rules and regulations pertaining to the use of the property; no violations exist on the property. . . .\u201d In addition to denying McAllister\u2019s appeal, resolution No. 04-028 explicitly affirmed the mitigated negative declaration prepared for the project and specifically upheld the planning commission\u2019s earlier decision to approve the application by Laube &amp; Engel for a combined coastal development permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The following month, McAllister appealed the County\u2019s decision to the Coastal Commission, \u201cas a precautionary measure to protect [his] rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\n<em>Proceedings in the Trial Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On February 18, 2004, simultaneously with his appeal to the Coastal Commission, McAllister filed this action. In his combined petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, McAllister asserted three causes of action. The first cause of action alleged an administrative mandamus claim against the County. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) That cause of action incorporated these assertions: that the County\u2019s approval was null and void under its own code provisions and thus was made without jurisdiction; that the County failed to give McAllister a fair hearing; and that the County abused its discretion by not requiring an environmental impact report. McAllister\u2019s second cause of action, also against the County, sought a judicial declaration that the County\u2019s approval of the project was null and void. His third cause of action sought injunctive relief against the Coastal Commission, to prevent it from assuming jurisdiction over the project. In addition to the relief requested in the third cause of action of his complaint, McAllister also sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Coastal Commission, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In March 2004, Laube &amp; Engel demurred to the complaint. As to the first cause of action, real parties in interest asserted, McAllister failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Laube &amp; Engel challenged the other two causes of action on the ground that the relief sought was improper. In the event that it declined to sustain the demurrer and dismiss the action, real parties in interest argued, the court should stay the litigation pending the outcome of the Coastal Commission appeal. The County joined real parties in interests\u2019 demurrer. The Coastal Commission separately demurred to the third cause of action against it. McAllister opposed the demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The court conducted a hearing on the demurrers in May 2004, taking them under submission. It issued a written ruling several days later, which included these provisions: (1) As to the first cause of action, the court stayed proceedings on McAllister\u2019s \u201cclaim under the California Environmental Quality Act.. . pending the Commission\u2019s final decision.\u201d (2) With respect to the second cause of action, the court sustained the demurrers of the County and real parties in interest, with leave to amend. (3) As to the third cause of action, the court sustained the Coastal Commission\u2019s demurrer, without leave to amend. Thereafter, in June 2004, the court issued a formal order concerning the demurrers, which reiterated the court\u2019s earlier rulings in all respects. In addition, it ordered dismissal of the action with prejudice as against the Coastal Commission and the entry of a separate judgment in the commission\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\n<em>Coastal Commission Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In September 2004, the Coastal Commission took the first substantive step in the administrative appeal, by concluding that the project in fact raised a substantial issue on various grounds and that it would therefore assume jurisdiction. (See Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30625, subd. (b)(1).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">According to the Coastal Commission staff report, by then, \u201cas a result of the appeal,\u201d Laube &amp; Engel had modified the project. Under their revised plans as submitted, \u201cthe residence [was] relocated slightly north .. ., the base elevation of the northern portion of the house [was] lowered so that it is not visible within the critical viewshed, and the size of the residence [was] reduced\u201d slightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">After a de novo hearing in December 2004, the Coastal Commission granted Laube &amp; Engel a coastal development permit, with conditions, for the modified project.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\n<em>Further Trial Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">In January 2005, Laube &amp; Engel filed a second demurrer to the complaint, entitled \u201cNotice of Motion of Demurrer and Motion to Dismiss.\u201d In it, Laube &amp; Engel argued that McAllister\u2019s complaint failed to state a cause of action against the County, in that the Coastal Commission was the agency taking the final administrative action. As before, the County joined real parties in interests\u2019 demurrer. McAllister opposed the second demurrer on procedural and substantive grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Following a hearing held in February 2005, the court sustained the second demurrer without leave to amend. The court issued a formal order several days later, in which (1) it found that McAllister \u201cfailed to state a cause of action,\u201d (2) it sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, and (3) it ordered \u201cthe case dismissed in its entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">\n<em>Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">McAllister brought this timely appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">On appeal, McAllister attacks the trial court\u2019s decision to sustain the second demurrer on three grounds. First, he asserts procedural deficiencies in the demurrer, including untimeliness. Second, McAllister argues, the demurrer lacks substantive merit, since his petition states a valid cause of action. Third, he contends, the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. Both the County and Laube &amp; Engel refute those contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">To establish the proper framework for our analysis of McAllister\u2019s contentions, we begin by describing the relevant statutes. Next, we summarize pertinent procedural principles, specifically the doctrine of exhaustion and the standards that govern appellate review of demurrers. Finally, against that backdrop, we address the specific issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">STATUTORY FRAMEWORK: GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Two statutes have particular relevance here, CEQA and the California Coastal Act of 1976 (\u00a7 30000 et seq.). Both are codified in the Public Resources Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">I. <em>CEQA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">CEQA appears at division 13 of the Public Resources Code, beginning with section 21000. As an aid to carrying out the statute, the state Resources Agency has issued a set of regulations, called Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Guidelines).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">A. <em>Statutory Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">CEQA embodies our state\u2019s policy that \u201cthe long-term protection of the environment. . . shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.\u201d (\u00a7 21001, subd. (d); see <em>Davidon Homes </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>112 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 612].) As this court has observed, \u201cthe overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give primary consideration to preventing environmental damage.\u201d <em>(Save Our Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 117 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 326].) Together, the statute and accompanying regulatory guidelines protect a variety of environmental values. The \u201cenjoyment of aesthetic, natural, [and] scenic . . . qualities\u201d is among them. (\u00a7 21001, subd. (b).) So, too, is the protection of wildlife and other species. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">B. <em>The CEQA Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Consistent with California\u2019s strong environmental policy, whenever the approval of a project is at issue, the statute and regulations \u201chave established a three-tiered process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.\u201d <em>(Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 112; see Guidelines, \u00a7 15002, subd. (k).)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">1. <em>Threshold determination of CEQA\u2019s applicability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u201cThe first tier is jurisdictional, requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review in order to determine whether CEQA applies to a proposed activity. (Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15060, 15061.)\u201d <em>(Davidon Homes </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">CEQA applies if the activity is a \u201cproject\u201d under the statutory definition, unless the project is exempt. (See \u00a7\u00a7 21065, 21080.) \u201cIf the agency finds the project is exempt from CEQA under any of the stated exemptions, no further environmental review is necessary.\u201d <em>(Davidon Homes </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th p. 113.) \u201cOnly those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review.\u201d <em>(Salmon Protection &amp; Watershed Network </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1107 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 321].) \u201cSingle-family homes are categorically exempt from CEQA, except (1) when they \u2018may impact on an environmental resource of . . . critical concern\u2019; (2) \u2018when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant\u2019; or \u2018where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1106, quoting Guidelines, \u00a7 15300.2, subds. (a)-(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">If the project is not exempt\u2014either because it does not fall within an exempt category or because an exception makes the exemption unavailable\u2014 then the agency must proceed to the second tier and conduct an initial study. <em>(Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 786, 792 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 731]; see Guidelines, \u00a7 15063.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>2. <em>Initial study</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The second tier of the process, the initial study, serves several purposes. One purpose is to inform the choice between a negative declaration and an environmental impact report (EIR). (Guidelines, \u00a7 15063, subd. (c)(1); <em>Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1180 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 901].) Another purpose of the initial study is to eliminate unnecessary EIR\u2019s. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15063, subd. (c)(7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u201cCEQA excuses the preparation of an EIR and allows the use of a negative declaration when an initial study shows that there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d <em>(San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Water Dist. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 382, 389-390 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 836], citing Guidelines, \u00a7 15070; see also \u00a7 21064; \u00a7 21080, subd. (c).) In certain situations where a straightforward negative declaration is not appropriate, the agency may permit use of a mitigated negative declaration. (See \u00a7 21064.5; Guidelines, \u00a7 15064, subd. (f)(2); <em>San Bernardino, </em>at p. 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">3. <em>Environmental impact report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">If the project does not qualify for a negative declaration, \u201cthe third step in the process is to prepare a full environmental impact report . . . .\u201d <em>(Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 113, citing \u00a7\u00a7 21100, 21151 &amp; Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15063, subd. (b)(1), 15080.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The California Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly recognized that the EIR is the \u2018heart of CEQA.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 231, 864 P.2d 502].) As the court observed more than three decades ago, \u201csince the preparation of an EIR is the key to environmental protection under CEQA, accomplishment of the high objectives of that act requires the preparation of an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.\u201d <em>(No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66].) Other cases have since confirmed the statutory preference for resolving doubts in favor of an EIR. (See, e.g., <em>Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group v. City of San Jose </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 689, 703 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 868]; <em>League for Protection of Oakland\u2019s etc. Historic Resources v. City of Oakland </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896, 905 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>II. <em>The California Coastal Act of 1976</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act) is codified at Public Resources Code, section 30000 et seq. It replaced the California Coastal Zone Conservation Act, which had been enacted by initiative measure in 1972. (See Historical and Statutory Notes, 56B West\u2019s Ann. Pub. Resources Code (1996 ed.), foll. \u00a7 30000, p. 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">A. <em>Statutory Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The Coastal Act \u201cwas enacted by the Legislature as a comprehensive scheme to govern land use planning for the entire coastal zone of California.\u201d <em>(Yost v.

Civil Practice: Environmental Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8:67-8:68, pp. 102-104.) In order to certify the LCP, the commission must find that it satisfies the requirements and policies set forth in chapter 3 of the Coastal Act. (\u00a7\u00a7 30200, subd. (a), 30512, subd. (c), 30513; see <em>Santa Barbara County Flower &amp; Nursery Growers Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 864, 871-872 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 489]; Robie, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8:69-8:70, pp. 104-105.) Those \u201cChapter 3 policies\u201d thus represent the standards for judging the adequacy of an LCP. (\u00a7 30200, subd. (a); <em>Yost v. Thomas, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 566; Robie, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8:71, pp. 105-106.) These policies are designed to protect certain identified resources, including recreation, sensitive habitat, and scenic resources.

Civil Practice: Environmental Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8:73, p. 106; see \u00a7 30600, subd. (a).) Development is broadly defined for these purposes. (Robie, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 106-107; see \u00a7 30106.) Thus, for example, a lot line adjustment may constitute a development requiring a coastal development permit (CDP). <em>(La Fe, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 231, 239 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 217].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The Coastal Act\u2019s chapter 3 policies constitute the general standards for judging the permissibility of specific developments within the coastal zone.

(\u00a7 30603.) \u201cIf . . . the local government approves an application for a CDP, its action may be appealed to the commission by the applicant, any aggrieved person, or any two members of the commission. [Citations.] The commission has limited jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u201d <em>(City of Half Moon Bay </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 804.) As relevant here, the governing statute provides: \u201c(a) After certification of its local coastal program, an action taken by a local government on a coastal development permit application may be appealed to the commission for only the following types of developments: [f] (1) Developments approved by the local government between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea or within 300 feet of the inland extent of any beach or of the mean high tideline of the sea where there is no beach, whichever is the greater distance.\u201d (\u00a7 30603, subd. (a)(1).) The grounds for such an appeal are \u201climited to an allegation that the development does not conform to the standards set forth in the certified local coastal program or the public access policies set forth in this division.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b)(1) [referring to div. 20, the Coastal Act]; see <em>Kaczorowski </em>v. <em>Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 569; see generally Robie et al., Cal.

(\u00a7 30625, subd. (b)(2).)\u201d <em>(City of Half Moon Bay v. Superior Court, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 804.) The hearing must be set within 49 days. (\u00a7 30621.) \u201cThis short time limit is \u2018designed to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Encinitas Country Day School, Inc. v. California Coastal Com. </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 575, 584 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 551].) The Coastal Commission thus \u201cis required, at a minimum, to make the determination whether a substantial issue exists, i.e., whether the appeal raises a substantial issue meriting an appellate hearing, within the 49-day limitation period.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 585.) \u201cOn appeal, the commission reviews the matter de novo, and may take additional evidence not received by the local government.\u201d <em>(City of Half Moon Bay, </em>at p. 804.) Thus, \u201cin effect, the Commission hears the application as if no local governmental unit was previously involved, deciding for itself whether the proposed project satisfies legal standards and requirements.\u201d <em>(Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 569.) The resulting decision \u201c \u2018takes the place of and completely nullifies the former determination of the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">PROCEDURAL FRAMEWORK; GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In addition to the substantive statutes described above, this appeal also involves the application of other legal principles, which arise from procedural aspects of the case. One such principle is the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Others relate to the procedural posture of this appeal, which follows the sustention of a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">I. <em>Exhaustion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Under the doctrine of administrative exhaustion, the long-standing general rule is this: \u201cwhere an adequate administrative remedy is provided by statute, resort to that forum is a \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 prerequisite to judicial consideration of the claim.\u201d <em>(Styne v. Stevens </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 42, 56 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 14, 26 P.3d 343]; cf. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 386 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 826 P.2d 730] [discussing the closely related doctrine of primary jurisdiction]; see generally 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Administrative Proceedings, \u00a7\u00a7 108-109, pp. 1153-1155; Curtin, Cal. Land Use and Planning Law, <em>supra, </em>ch. 21, pp. 526-532.) Put another way: \u201cIn the context of administrative proceedings, a controversy is not ripe for adjudication until the administrative process is completed and the agency makes a final decision that results in a direct and immediate impact on the parties.\u201d <em>(Santa Barbara County Flower &amp; Nursery Growers Assn. v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>p. 875.)  \u201cThe doctrine has been specifically applied to review of coastal commission actions.\u201d <em>(Walter H. Leimert Co. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 222, 232 [196 Cal.Rptr. 739].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">A. <em>Underpinnings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary).\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 391.) \u201c \u2018Even where the administrative remedy may not resolve all issues or provide the precise relief requested by a plaintiff, the exhaustion doctrine is still viewed with favor \u201cbecause it facilitates the development of a complete record that draws on administrative expertise and promotes judicial efficiency.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Sierra Club v. San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 489, 501 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 981 P.2d 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The doctrine \u201cis not a matter of judicial discretion, but is a fundamental rule of procedure . . . binding upon all courts.\u201d <em>(Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 293 [109 P.2d 942].) Until an available \u201cadministrative procedure has been invoked and completed, there is nothing that the . . . court may review; it cannot interfere in the intermediate stages of the proceeding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 291.) For that reason, \u201cthe failure to exhaust administrative remedies prevents appellant from seeking relief through administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5), which provides judicial review of <em>final </em>administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>(Unnamed Physician v. Board of Trustees </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 607, 619 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 309].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">B. <em>Exceptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">\u201cThere are exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine.\u201d <em>(Unnamed Physician v. Board of Trustees, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 620.) Exceptions are commonly recognized when the administrative remedy is unavailable, when it is inadequate, or when it would be futile to pursue it. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Other exceptions include \u201csituations where the agency indulges in unreasonable delay . . . , when the subject matter lies outside the administrative agency\u2019s jurisdiction, [or] when pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm . . . .\u201d <em>(Green v. City of Oceanside </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 212, 222 [239 Cal.Rptr. 470], citation omitted; accord, <em>Public Employment </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1816, 1827 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 323].) \u201cTo this list must be added exceptions where important questions of constitutional law or public policy governing agency authority are tendered.\u201d <em>(Public Employment Relations Bd., </em>at p. 1827.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">C. <em>Application to Questions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Notwithstanding the foregoing exceptions, exhaustion is not excused merely \u201cbecause the ultimate legal issues ... are better suited for determination by the courts.\u201d <em>(Department of Personnel Administration v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 155, 169 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].) For example, \u201cconstitutional challenges are frequently raised to the application of an administrative statutory scheme, yet the courts typically require such issues be presented to the administrative agency in the first instance.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As the California Supreme Court explained in another context, \u201cthe mere fact that the concept of vested rights is rooted in the Constitution does not deprive the [Coastal] Commission of the power to make the initial determination whether a developer qualifies for an exemption, so long as appropriate judicial review of the Commission\u2019s determination is provided.\u201d <em>(State of California v.

Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1828.) \u201cOne of the principal policy concerns of the exhaustion doctrine is judicial efficiency [citation], which cannot be served if the issue of statutory jurisdiction must be fully plumbed in order to determine whether it should be left to the agency in the <em>first </em>instance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1831-1832.) As our state\u2019s high court put it long ago, \u201cit lies within the power of the administrative agency to determine in the first instance, and before judicial relief may be obtained, whether a given controversy falls within the statutory grant of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(United States v. Superior Court </em>(1941) 19 Cal.2d 189, 195 [120 P.2d 26].) However, as the court recognized in a later case, \u201cthese rules are inapplicable where ... the agency is given no jurisdiction to make a judicial determination of the type involved.\u201d (Co<em>unty of Alpine </em>v. <em>County of Tuolumne </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 787, 798 [322 P.2d 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>II. <em>Demurrers: Appellate Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On appeal, \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court erred\u201d in sustaining the demurrer. <em>(Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].) \u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules. \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.\u201d <em>(Blank v.

Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 810.) \u201cNevertheless, where the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is clear, and under substantive law no liability exists, a court should deny leave to amend because no amendment could change the result.\u201d <em>(City of Atascadero, </em>at pp. 459-460.) In such cases, \u201cwe exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Montclair Parkowners Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Montclair </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 784, 790 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 598].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Here, McAllister\u2019s appeal follows (1) an initial demurrer, interposed principally on the ground of failure to exhaust administrative remedies; (2) an administrative appeal to the Coastal Commission, which resulted in the approval of a modified project; and (3) a second demurrer, interposed principally on the ground of failure to state a cause of action, which the trial court sustained without leave to amend in February 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">On appeal, McAllister makes a three-pronged attack on the trial court\u2019s decision to sustain the second demurrer. First, he attacks the demurrer on procedural grounds, including untimeliness. Second, McAllister challenges the demurrer on substantive grounds, arguing that his petition states a valid cause of action on at least two theories. Third, McAllister contends that the trial court abused its discretion by not granting him leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Before analyzing those specific contentions, we first discuss two threshold appellate issues: appealability and the scope of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">I. <em>Threshold Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">A. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">This appeal was taken from the trial court\u2019s February 2005 order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and ordering \u201cthe case dismissed in its entirety.\u201d The appellate record contains no judgment of dismissal, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Generally speaking, an order sustaining a demurrer \u201cis neither appealable per se nor as a final judgment.\u201d <em>(Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 916, 920 [167 Cal.Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813].) But \u201can appellate court may deem an order sustaining a demurrer to incorporate a judgment of dismissal.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Furthermore, an \u201corder dismissing a complaint with prejudice constitutes an appealable judgment.... (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 581d, 904.1, subd. (a)(1).)\u201d <em>(City of Morgan Hill v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 861, 867, fn. 3 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In this case, the matter is fully briefed and no party has raised an objection to consideration of the appeal on its merits. To the contrary, the County points out that \u201call parties have treated the subject Order as the final act of the Trial Court and therefore appealable.\u201d Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to treat the February 2005 order as an appealable judgment of dismissal. \u201cIn the interest of justice and to prevent further delay, we will deem the order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer to incorporate a judgment of dismissal and thus interpret plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal as applying to such dismissal.\u201d <em>(Bellah v. Greenson </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 614, 618, fn. 1 [146 Cal.Rptr. 535].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">B. <em>Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">This appeal involves only the first cause of action of McAllister\u2019s complaint, for administrative mandamus. Two of the claims asserted there are presented in this appeal: first, that the County\u2019s action was null and void, which divested it of jurisdiction, and second, that the County violated CEQA. In addition to those two claims, the first cause of action also alleges that the County denied McAllister a fair hearing, and that the County failed to comply with various substantive provisions of its LCP. But those latter contentions are deemed abandoned for lack of appellate argument. (See, e.g., <em>Schoendorf v. U.D. Registry, Inc. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 227, 237-238 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>We are not concerned here with the second cause of action of McAllister\u2019s complaint, which sought declaratory relief against the County, or with the third cause of action, which sought injunctive relief against the Coastal Commission. As McAllister offers no argument concerning either cause of action, we treat both as abandoned. (Schoendorf v. <em>U.D. Registry, Inc., supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at pp. 237-238.) Moreover, as to the third cause of action, the trial court ordered judgment in the commission\u2019s favor in June 2004. That action is not part of this appeal, which challenges only the court\u2019s later order of February 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">II. <em>Propriety of the Challenged Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We turn now to McAllister\u2019s first avenue of attack on the challenged portion of the trial court\u2019s order, which rests on his claim of procedural defects. As we explain, we find no merit in that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">A. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Rejecting McAllister\u2019s Procedural Challenges to the Second Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">McAllister argues that the demurrer was not timely and that it was not an authorized pleading. Like the trial court, we reject those procedural challenges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">1. <em>Timeliness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The second demurrer was filed by Laube &amp; Engel on January 18, 2005, and joined by the County the same day. By McAllister\u2019s reckoning, not only does that date fall some 11 months after service of the initial complaint, but it was 40 days after completion of the Coastal Commission proceedings, an event that operated to lift the May 2004 stay. Under either timeframe, he claims, the second demurrer was filed too late. McAllister states that a demurrer <em>must </em>be filed and served within 30 days after service of the complaint, citing several statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure section 430.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Despite McAllister\u2019s insistence to the contrary, we are not persuaded that the challenged demurrer was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>At the outset, we disagree with McAllister\u2019s characterization of section 430.40 of the Code of Civil Procedure as mandatory. That statute reads in relevant part: \u201cA person against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed <em>may, </em>within 30 days after service of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.40, italics added.) The cited provision thus uses the permissive expression \u201cmay,\u201d not the mandatory term \u201cmust.\u201d (Cf. <em>Garrison v. Rourke </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 430, 435-436 [196 P.2d 884] [\u201ctime limitation for the court\u2019s action in a matter subject to its determination is not mandatory (regardless of the mandatory nature of the language), unless a consequence or penalty is provided for failure to do the act within the time commanded\u201d], overruled on another ground in <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d. 932, 939 [95 Cal.Rptr. 197, 485 P.2d 261].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Furthermore, the quoted provision nominally applies only to a first round of demurrers. As one commentator observes: \u201cNo statute or rule specifically provides a time limit for demurring to an <em>amended </em>complaint.\u201d (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2006) \u00b6 7:139, p. 7-53.) In a similar vein, we are aware of no statute or rule that specifically governs situations such as that presented here, where no amended pleading is filed after dissolution of a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Moreover, it is not clear precisely when the May 2004 stay was lifted, a point that was disputed below. The record contains no order explicitly lifting the stay or otherwise setting a specific time for further pleading. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 472b [\u201cWhen a demurrer to any pleading is sustained or overruled, and time to amend or answer is given, the time so given runs from the service of notice of the decision or order, unless the notice is waived in open court, and the waiver entered in the minutes\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The stay order itself contemplates an amendment of the complaint following completion of the Coastal Commission proceedings, followed by a response, at which point the stay would lift.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of course, that did not happen here, since McAllister never amended his original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The May 2004 stay order further provides that the judicial proceedings would remain stayed \u201cpending the Coastal Commission\u2019s final decision on the merits.\u201d But the order does not incorporate a mechanism for determining the date of that event\u2019s occurrence. And the record reflects a factual dispute on that point. According to McAllister\u2019s argument below, the stay lifted on December 9, 2004, when the Coastal Commission took action on the appeal. But Laube &amp; Engel took a different view in the trial court. First, they raised questions about the finality of the administrative proceedings, noting that the Coastal Commission had not adopted its revised findings. Furthermore, they argued, their demurrer was filed within 30 days of notification to the trial court of the Coastal Commission\u2019s action. Finally, real parties in interest urged, they were entitled to further time to respond, since the administrative record was being augmented and thus was not complete. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1089.5.) To the extent that the trial court resolved these factual issues adversely to McAllister, we defer to its decision on that point. (See, e.g., <em>Jones v. Moers </em>(1928) 91 Cal.App. 65, 68 [266 P. 821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Finally, as McAllister acknowledges, the parties to an action may stipulate to an extension of time to respond. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1054, subd. (b).) In this case, by letter addressed to real parties in interests\u2019 counsel, McAllister\u2019s attorneys confirmed their earlier offer \u201cto extend the date within which the answers must be served and filed to January 10, 2005. [Deputy County Counsel] Mr. Iglesia thereafter requested an additional one-week extension, which we granted, and Mr. Iglesia has advised us that he will be filing the County\u2019s answer to the Petition by January 18, 2005. We are willing to provide your client with the same additional extension, if you so request.\u201d Notwithstanding McAllister\u2019s insistence that \u201canswer\u201d does not mean \u201cdemurrer,\u201d a contrary interpretation would not be unreasonable. (Cf. Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:34.1, p. 7-16 [\u201cword \u2018answer\u2019 in \u00a7 471.5 presumably means \u2018respond\u2019 and thus includes the possibility for another demurrer\u201d].) That point represents a factual dispute concerning McAllister\u2019s \u201calleged promise to extend [defendant\u2019s] time to answer\u201d and \u201cthe trial court necessarily passed upon this question adversely to [McAllister]. Under such circumstances the decision is controlling.\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Moers, supra, </em>91 Cal.App. at p. 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">For all these reasons, we conclude, the trial court was warranted in treating the second demurrer as timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Even assuming for argument\u2019s sake that the demurrer was filed late, the trial court nevertheless had discretion to entertain it. \u201cThere is no absolute right to have a pleading stricken for lack of timeliness in filing where no question of jurisdiction is involved, and where, as here, the late filing was a mere irregularity [citation]; the granting or denial of the motion is a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>which lies within the discretion of the court.\u201d <em>(Tuck v. Thuesen </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 193, 196 [88 Cal.Rptr. 759], disapproved on another ground in <em>Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart &amp; Gelfand </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 190, fn. 29 [98 Cal.Rptr. 837, 491 P.2d 421]; cf. <em>Johnson v. Sun Realty Co. </em>(1934) 138 Cal.App. 296, 299 [32 P.2d 393] [court had discretion to hear a demurrer, notwithstanding violation of procedural rules].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">As provided by statute: \u201cThe court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, . . . enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 473, subd. (a)(1).) The trial court may exercise this discretion so long as its action does \u201cnot affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>(Harlan v. Department of Transportation </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 868, 873 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 912] [affirming trial court\u2019s decision to permit plaintiff to file late amendment following demurrer]; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Here, we conclude, the trial court\u2019s decision to entertain the second demurrer did not affect McAllister\u2019s substantial rights. \u201cPrior to the filing of respondent\u2019s demurrer to the amended complaint, appellant had not taken any steps to have judgment by default entered under Code of Civil Procedure section 432, nor did he endeavor to show that he was in any way prejudiced by the delay.\u201d <em>(Tuck v. Thuesen, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d at p. 196.) The same is true in this case. The trial court thus acted within its broad discretion in allowing respondents to file the second demurrer, notwithstanding McAllister\u2019s protestations that it was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">2. <em>Propriety</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Apart from its timeliness, McAllister also challenges the validity of using a demurrer in these circumstances. As he puts it: \u201cNo legal authority allows Real Parties or the County to file the Second Demurrer in the absence of an amended pleading having first been filed by Dr. McAllister.\u201d Characterizing the demurrer as \u201cprocedurally improper\u201d for that reason, McAllister argues that he was \u201cclearly prejudiced by such error, which resulted in the dismissal of his Complaint in its entirety, thereby depriving him of an opportunity to seek judicial review of the County\u2019s violations of CEQA, including the failure to prepare an EIR for the Project, and judicial enforcement of Chapter 20.90 as to the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We reject McAllister\u2019s claim of error. While it is true that no statute specifically authorizes the procedure undertaken here, neither does any statute forbid it. \u201cCourts, of course, also have \u2018 \u201cinherent supervisory and administrative powers which enable them to carry out their duties, and which exist apart from any statutory authority.\u201d The inherent powers may be exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>only if the procedure or practice of the court is not in conflict with a specified statutory procedure.\u201d <em>(Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund Hospital v. Superior Court (2001) 88 </em>Cal.App.4th 488, 492 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 872], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Significantly, the pleading at issue here is a general demurrer, which attacks the fundamental validity of the cause of action\u2014a challenge that may be raised at any time. \u201cThe objection that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action may be raised at any stage of the proceedings and, even for the first time upon appeal.\u201d <em>(Horacek v. Smith </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 186, 191 [199 P.2d 929]; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.40, subd. (b).) For these reasons, we are not persuaded that the procedure used in this case was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Even assuming that the trial court erred in allowing the second demurrer in these circumstances, it nevertheless is bound to ignore any \u201cdefect ... in the pleadings or proceedings which, in the opinion of said court, does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475.) In our view, the trial court\u2019s decision to consider the second demurrer did not prejudice McAllister by affecting his substantial rights. McAllister\u2019s contention that the perceived irregularity caused the dismissal of his complaint and the attendant loss of his right to judicial review of his claims against the County misses the point. Those claims were not lost because of the procedures employed; rather, they were rejected because they lack substantive merit, a point we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">B. <em>McAllister Did Not State a Cause of Action Based on Voidness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">In McAllister\u2019s view, the trial court erred in dismissing his petition since it states a valid cause of action on two theories, the first being that the County\u2019s action was void <em>ab initio. </em>As we explain, we reject McAllister\u2019s voidness theory. Our analysis of this question proceeds in two separate steps: (1) a discussion of the exhaustion requirement in the context of this claim, and (2) an assessment of whether McAllister has stated a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">1. <em>McAllister\u2019s claim that the County\u2019s action was null and void does not excuse the exhaustion requirement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">We begin with an analysis of the administrative exhaustion doctrine as it relates to McAllister\u2019s voidness claim. We do so in light of the allegation in McAllister\u2019s complaint that he was \u201crelieved of and exempt from any exhaustion of administrative remedies by virtue of the lack of jurisdiction of the County to approve the Project based on . . . Chapter 20.90 . . . and the existing violation of the Project Site of Condition 3 of the 1977 Permit.\u201d As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>noted above, exhaustion was primarily at issue in the first demurrer, which was interposed before the matter proceeded to the Coastal Commission. Nevertheless, the parties continued to dispute the exhaustion requirement in connection with the second demurrer. Real parties in interest thus argued: \u201cThe only final administrative decision on the issuance of a Coastal Development Permit ... is the one which the Coastal Commission made on December 9, 2004. . . . [f] Accordingly, Petitioner failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. ...\u201d In response, McAllister reiterated that his \u201ccentral argument is that the County\u2019s action in proceeding on the Project application was illegal under Chapter 20.90 and therefore not one that legally could be appealed to the Coastal Commission.\u201d Arguing against the \u201cstrict finality requirement\u201d urged by real parties in interest, McAllister contended \u201cthat the County remains an appropriate party\u201d under \u201cthe exception to the exhaustion doctrine\u201d that is applicable \u201cwhere the action challenges the very jurisdiction of an administrative agency to consider the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">McAllister continues to press his exhaustion arguments on appeal. He contends: \u201cChapter 20.90 and its declaration that permits issued in conflict with the provisions of Title 20 of the LCP \u2018shall be null and void\u2019 changes the analysis ordinarily applicable in the context of a claim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d He adds: \u201cCentral to Dr. McAllister\u2019s Complaint is the allegation that the County\u2019s action was a legal nullity and therefore there was no valid final County action from which an appeal to the Coastal Commission could be properly taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The County and real parties in interest refute McAllister\u2019s contentions, though each takes a different analytic path.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we now explain, our own assessment in this first step in the analysis leads us to the same conclusion: McAllister is mistaken, and exhaustion was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">a. <em>Exhaustion of all available remedies is generally required.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">As discussed above, exhaustion of administrative remedies is generally required before resort to judicial remedies. <em>(Styne v. Stevens, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 56.) \u201cThe petitioner . . . must obtain a final decision on the merits at the highest available administrative level before seeking judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>review. If an appeal can be taken to a higher administrative body . . . that appeal must be pursued and the issues must be presented to the final decisionmaker before they can be presented in court.\u201d (Curtin, Cal. Land Use and Planning Law, <em>supra, </em>ch. 21, p. 528.) Where an administrative appeal is available but \u201cno appeal is taken, there is a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and mandamus will not lie.\u201d <em>(Grant </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 606, 609 [145 Cal.Rptr. 699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">b. <em>Exhaustion is required even though voidness is asserted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Even where an ordinance is challenged on the ground that it is void as applied to a particular property, the challenger generally must first exhaust all available administrative remedies before asserting his claim in court. Our high court endorsed that principle more than 60 years ago in the <em>Metcalf </em>case. <em>(Metcalf v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 267, 270-273 [148 P.2d 645].) In <em>Metcalf, </em>the court squarely rejected an argument by the plaintiffs \u201cthat the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not require them to follow the procedure prescribed by an ordinance which they allege is void as to their property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 270; accord, <em>Pan Pacific Properties, Inc. v. County of Santa Cruz </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 244, 249 [146 Cal.Rptr. 428]; see also <em>United States v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d at pp. 194\u2014195.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Applying <em>Metcalf </em>to the circumstances presented here, McAllister was required to apply for all available administrative relief\u2014including appeal to the Coastal Commission\u2014notwithstanding his claim that the County\u2019s action was a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">We find no basis for a contrary result in the Supreme Court\u2019s later decision in <em>County of Alpine </em>v. <em>County of Tuolumne, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 787. In that case, the dispute concerned Alpine County\u2019s geographic boundaries, which were described in ambiguous statutory language. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 791.) The high court concluded that the courts\u2014not the agency\u2014had primary jurisdiction to interpret the legislative language. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 792, 798.) As the court observed: \u201cAn administrative agency can act only as to those matters which are within the scope of the powers delegated to it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 797.) Furthermore, the court stated, the rules requiring exhaustion \u201care inapplicable where, as here, the agency is given no jurisdiction to make a judicial determination of the type involved.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 798.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The situation described in <em>Alpine </em>does not apply to our case. In this case, unlike that one, the agency had fundamental and primary jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dispute. That conclusion proceeds manifestly from the relevant statutes, which recognize the Coastal Commission\u2019s authority to make determinations of the type involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>By statute, the Coastal Commission\u2019s jurisdiction extends to \u201cany permit action, . . . appeal, ... or any other quasi-judicial matter requiring commission action, for which an application has been submitted to the commission.\u201d (\u00a7 30321; see <em>Buckley v. California Coastal Com. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 178, 190 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 562].) With respect to appeals, under the Coastal Act, \u201can action taken by a local government on a coastal development permit application may be appealed to the commission for . . . [][]... [developments ... approved by the local government between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 30603, subd. (a)(1).) The Coastal Act thus incorporates a \u201cchain of responsibility\u201d for considering coastal developments such as that challenged here. <em>(REA Enterprises v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 596, 605 [125 Cal.Rptr. 201] [construing the former administrative scheme, which gave regional commissions, rather than local governments, the authority \u201cto adjudicate the propriety of granting or denying a permit\u201d in the first instance, followed by an appeal to the state commission which \u201ctakes a new, unlimited look at the same request for a permit by a de novo public hearing\u201d]; see also, e.g., <em>Kaczorowski </em>v. <em>Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at pp. 569-570.) For such projects, the County makes the initial decision on the CDP, and the Coastal Commission hears any appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The Coastal Commission\u2019s appellate jurisdiction is limited to determining whether the development conforms \u201cto the standards set forth in the certified local coastal program or the public access policies set forth in this division.\u201d (\u00a7 30603, subd. (b)(1); see <em>Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 569.) The County\u2019s local coastal program standards\u2014previously certified by the Coastal Commission\u2014include those set forth in Chapter 20.90. By logical inference, it is within the Coastal Commission\u2019s appellate jurisdiction to review the County\u2019s action vis-a-vis those standards\u2014including an assessment of the underlying validity of the local government action. That very question was before the Coastal Commission here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In undertaking to answer it, the Coastal Commission was acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201cwithin the scope of the powers delegated to it.\u201d <em>(County of Alpine v. County of Tuolumne, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The recognition of this authority on the Coastal Commission\u2019s part is consistent with the policy reasons that underpin the exhaustion requirement. As has been said, where litigants fail to proceed with available administrative remedies, they \u201chave in effect deprived the [agency] of an opportunity to correct the alleged constitutional infirmity.\u201d <em>(Pan Pacific Properties, Inc., v. County of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.3d at p. 249; cf. <em>Sierra Club v. San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Com., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 502.) In this case, the agency charged with correcting the asserted defect (the Coastal Commission) is not the same one that took the challenged action (the County). But in our view, that circumstance is irrelevant, given the chain of responsibility established by the Coastal Act. Where the claimed deficiency can be corrected administratively\u2014including via appeal to another agency\u2014 the beneficial purposes of the exhaustion doctrine are advanced. \u201cThe doctrine\u2019s purpose is fully served when parties raise all issues before the administrative body with <em>ultimate or final responsibility </em>to approve or disapprove the project . . . .\u201d <em>(Tahoe Vista Concerned Citizens v. County of Placer </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 577, 594 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 880], italics added.) In this case, that body is the Coastal Commission. (See <em>Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 569.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">To sum up, in cases where \u201cthe subject matter lies outside the administrative agency\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d the exhaustion requirement is excused. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>City of Oceanside, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 222; see <em>County of Alpine v. County of Tuolumne, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 798.) This is not such a case, however. Here, by express legislative grant, the Coastal Commission had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>fundamental subject matter jurisdiction to decide the administrative appeal of real parties in interests\u2019 CDP. (\u00a7 30603, subd. (a)(1).) McAllister\u2019s claim that the County\u2019s action is null and void does not operate to excuse the exhaustion requirement in these circumstances. <em>(Metcalf </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at p. 271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">c. <em>Cognizable jurisdictional claims will not escape review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Contrary to McAllister\u2019s dire assertions, the exhaustion requirement does not place reviewable administrative decisions <em>\u201cforever beyond judicial </em>scrutiny.\u201d It is well established that an administrative agency \u201cmay constitutionally hold hearings, determine facts, apply the law, and impose certain types of monetary relief so long as (i) these activities are \u2018authorized by statute or legislation and are <em>reasonably necessary </em>to effectuate the administrative agency\u2019s <em>primary, legitimate regulatory purposes, </em>and (ii) the <em>\u201cessential\u201d judicial power </em>(i.e., the power to make enforceable, binding judgments) <em>remains ultimately in the courts, through review of. agency </em>determinations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bradshaw v. Park </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1267, 1275 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 872], quoting <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 348, 372 [261 Cal.Rptr. 318, <em>777 </em>P.2d 91]; see also, e.g., <em>State of California v. Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 250; <em>Halaco Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>South Central Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Judicial review thus remains obtainable\u2014once available administrative remedies have been exhausted\u2014for any claims that survive that process. <em>(Grant </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.3d at p. 609; \u00a7 30801; cf. \u00a7 30802 [judicial review where there is no right of appeal to the Coastal Commission].) For example, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>Metcalf, </em>had the plaintiffs there exhausted the administrative process available to them, \u201cthey would not have been barred from asserting in appropriate judicial proceedings that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as to their property.\u201d <em>(Metcalf v. County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at p. 272.) The same is true here. To the extent that McAllister\u2019s claims retained vitality following the Coastal Commission proceedings (a point we discuss below), they were subject to judicial review in his mandamus action in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Having concluded that McAllister\u2019s voidness claim did not operate to excuse him from exhausting available administrative remedies, including an appeal to the Coastal Commission, we now proceed to the remaining step in our analysis of this theory of the complaint: an assessment of whether McAllister has stated a cause of action on voidness grounds. The second demurrer not only, challenged the allegations in McAllister\u2019s complaint that he was excused from exhausting administrative remedies, it also attacked the very existence of a cause of action based on voidness. In this second part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the analysis, we therefore consider the sufficiency of McAllister\u2019s allegations that the County\u2019s action was void <em>ab initio </em>as a discrete issue, distinct from the question of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">2. <em>Liberally construed, McAllister\u2019s pleading does not state a claim that the County\u2019s action is void </em>ab initio.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">As McAllister puts it, if he \u201ccan allege any facts under which the provisions of Chapter 20.90 would prohibit County consideration and approval of the Project or under which those provisions would mandate a conclusion that the County\u2019s approval of the Project is \u2018null and void,\u2019 then the granting of the Second Demurrer without leave to amend must be reversed.\u201d That is an accurate recitation of the general <em>legal </em>principle concerning demurrers. McAllister\u2019s petition presents no <em>factual </em>basis for relief, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Under the governing legal principles, \u201cwe take as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>(Construction Protective Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>TIG Specialty Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 193 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 57 P.3d 372].) We construe the \u201ccomplaint liberally to attain substantial justice among the parties.\u201d <em>(Long Beach Equities, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Ventura, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1024.) Nevertheless, we \u201cmay not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation or allegations which are contrary either to law or to judicially noticed facts.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We thus disregard any allegations of McAllister\u2019s complaint that conflict with judicially noticed documents as well as those that represent bare legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In a succinct summary of his position on this point, McAllister asserts that he \u201chas stated a cause of action [a] that the County\u2019s consideration of the Project violated Chapter 20.90, [b] that its approval of the Project was \u2018null and void,\u2019 and [c] that therefore both the County and the Coastal Commission were without jurisdiction to take any action on the Project.\u201d Each of those three points follows in logical progression, with the last one depending on the first two. We examine each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">a. <em>Violation of Chapter 20.90</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">McAllister starts with the assertion that the County\u2019s consideration of the project violated Chapter 20.90, which embodies part of the County\u2019s LCP. That assertion relies on these two factual allegations: (1) that real parties in interests\u2019 predecessor, Sorenson, did grading and construction work on the property that violated condition 3 of the 1977 Coastal Commission permit since the two lots had not yet been merged; and (2) that the \u201csaid grading and construction work was illegal and constituted a violation of permit conditions under Chapter 20.90____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>We accept as true the first factual allegation summarized above\u2014that Sorenson\u2019s grading and construction work was done in violation of his 1977 CDP. Indeed, there appears to be no dispute as to that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As to the second premise, however, we conclude that it conflicts with judicially noticed documents, which show that there was no record of any violation of Chapter 20.90, as distinguished from violations of the 1977 permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The documents before us include both a transcript of the January 2004 hearing by the County\u2019s board of supervisors and the resolution passed at the close of that hearing. As reflected in the transcript, the County\u2019s assigned planner said this: \u201cAs far as our County records, there is no recorded violation at the site. We did turn it over to the Coastal Commission staff to investigate. We have heard nothing from them yet. But we hopefully, will treat [sic] that this project will correct any violation that there may be by making that site useable.\u201d Similarly, in a section devoted to findings supporting denial of the appeal, resolution No. 04-428 notes McAllister\u2019s contention that \u201cviolations on the project site exist and must be fully investigated and remedied prior to project approval.\u201d The resolution includes this response to that contention: \u201cStaff finds that no violation has been recorded for the property under County jurisdiction. Any violation associated with the property would be related to the original, abandoned, 1977 CC [Coastal Commission] permit. CC staff has been notified so as to recommend any remedial actions required at the site to correct a purported violation. At the receipt of this report, CC staff is expected to respond to the proposal during the appeal period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In short, McAllister\u2019s assertion that there was an existing violation of Chapter 20.90 conflicts with judicially noticed documents, which unequivocally refute the existence of any such local code violation. \u201cThe courts . . . will not close their eyes to situations where a complaint contains allegations of fact inconsistent with attached documents, or allegations contrary to facts which are judicially noticed.\u201d <em>(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [176 Cal.Rptr. 824].) \u201cThus, a pleading valid on its face may nevertheless be subject to demurrer when matters judicially noticed by the court render the complaint meritless.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In any event, even assuming that McAllister\u2019s pleading had cleared this first hurdle, the remaining allegations in support of his voidness claim cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>b. <em>Approval as \u201cnull and void\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">As the next link in the analytic chain, McAllister argues that the existing violation renders the County\u2019s action on the project null and void under Chapter 20.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Quite apart from its lack of a factual premise, this allegation must be disregarded as a bare legal conclusion. As the California Supreme Court has said in the context of complaints against administrative agencies: \u201cAllegations that the acts of a commission or board were \u2018arbitrary, capricious, fraudulent, wrongful and unlawful,\u2019 like other adjectival descriptions of such proceedings, constitute mere conclusions of law which are not to be deemed admitted by a demurrer.\u201d <em>(Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 317, 329 [253 P.2d 659].) McAllister\u2019s characterization of the County\u2019s action as \u201clegally null and void\u201d suffers from the same defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Urging against that conclusion, McAllister cites the venerable case of <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 463 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313]. In that case, the California Supreme Court said this: \u201cThe sustaining of the demurrer to the second cause of action cannot be justified on the ground that the allegation that the housing accommodations were \u2018publicly assisted\u2019 was merely a conclusion of law. The distinction between conclusions of law and ultimate facts is not at all clear and involves at most a matter of degree.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 473.) The court further explained: \u201cIn permitting allegations to be made in general terms the courts have said that the particularity of pleading required depends upon the extent to which the defendant in fairness needs detailed information that can be conveniently provided by the plaintiff, and that less particularity is required where the defendant may be assumed to possess knowledge of the facts at least equal, if not superior, to that possessed by the plaintiff. [Citations.] In accordance with these principles it may be alleged generally, <em>in the terms of the </em>statute, that housing accommodations are \u2018publicly assisted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 474, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">A critical distinction exists between that case and this one. The key term in the pleading at issue in Burks\u2014\u201cpublicly assisted\u201d housing accommodation\u2014 came clothed in a detailed statutory definition. <em>(Burks v. Poppy Construction Co., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 471; see <em>id. </em>at p. 472, citing Health &amp; Saf. Code, former \u00a7 35710, subd. 3.) The same is not true here. The pivotal allegation here\u2014that the action was \u201cnull and void\u201d\u2014does not enjoy an accepted meaning, under either statutory or decisional law, which would serve to give it a concrete factual dimension and thus to elevate it from the status of bare legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Moreover, even as a conclusion of law, the claim is fallacious. As noted above, Chapter 20.90 provides that any permit, \u201cif issued in conflict with the provisions of <em>this title, </em>shall be null and void.\u201d (Monterey County Code, \u00a7 20.90.010, italics added.) As the judicially noticed documents demonstrate, however, there is no violation of \u201cthis title\u201d in this case, only a decades-old violation of a prior permit, which was issued more than a decade before the Coastal Commission\u2019s 1988 certification of the County\u2019s LCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">For all these reasons, we need not accept as true McAllister\u2019s contention that the County\u2019s action was a legal nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">c. <em>Lack of jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The third and final link in McAllister\u2019s progression of arguments is his contention that both \u201cthe County and the Coastal Commission were without jurisdiction to take any action on the Project\u201d since the County\u2019s approval was a legal nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Once again, this assertion is nothing more than an unvarnished legal conclusion. In order \u201cto state a cause of action warranting judicial interference with the official acts of [agency] defendants, [plaintiffs] must allege much more than mere conclusions of law; they must aver the specific facts from which the conclusions entitling them to relief would follow.\u201d <em>(Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority, supra, </em>40 Cal.2d at p. 330.) Here no such facts have been stated that are supportable in light of the judicially noticed documents before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Moreover, as with his second argument, the conclusion of law that McAllister draws on this point is itself erroneous. As legal authority for his claim that voidness necessarily divests jurisdiction, McAllister relies on the case of <em>City of Cupertino v. City of San Jose </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 29 [8 Cal.Rptr. 525]. That case involved competing annexation proceedings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 30.) In such situations, the court explained, \u201cit has been made clear that \u2018the first proceeding in point of time excludes the jurisdiction of the later one\u2019 [citation] and that the second proceeding is, in such situation \u2018an absolute nullity and [is] void\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 32.) \u201cSince an annexation proceeding which is \u2018null and void\u2019 is so from the very beginning, and is generally ineffectual for all purposes, it does not bar a second proceeding by the same annexing city [citation].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Patently, the situation presented in <em>City of Cupertino </em>bears no relation to our case. In this case, unlike that one, no competing proceeding barred the County\u2019s jurisdiction. (Cf. <em>City of Cupertino </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.2d at pp. 31-32; <em>Andrisani v. Saugus Colony Limited </em>(1992) 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Cal.App.4th 517, 524 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 444] [\u201ctrial court clearly had jurisdiction to vacate its void orders, made without jurisdiction, while the appeal was still pending\u201d].) Nor was there a lack of fundamental jurisdiction to approve the project. (Cf. <em>County of Alpine v. County of Tuolumne, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 798; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p.190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">As stated above in connection with McAllister\u2019s second argument, we need not accept his characterization of the County\u2019s action as \u201cnull and void.\u201d But even if we were to concede that premise, it would not follow ipso facto that the County lacked fundamental jurisdiction to act. One example of the impact of \u201cvoidness\u201d on jurisdiction, offered by way of analogy, is when a trial judge has been disqualified. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 170, 170.6.) In such cases, it has been argued, \u201cthe challenged judge is without jurisdiction to conduct any further proceedings in the cause, and his subsequent orders are null and void.\u201d <em>(Andrisani v. Saugus Colony Limited, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 525 [stating the party\u2019s contention].) \u201cAlthough the cases frequently refer to the subsequent orders or judgment of a disqualified judge as absolutely void for lack of jurisdiction . . . , it is clear that... the actions of a disqualified judge are not void in any fundamental sense but at most voidable if properly raised by an interested party.\u201d <em>(In re Christian J. </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 276, 280 [202 Cal.Rptr. 54], citations omitted.) Thus, even a claim of underlying \u201cvoidness\u201d does not inexorably rob an adjudicatory body of its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">To sum up, McAllister has not stated a cause of action with respect to his voidness claim. His allegation that the County\u2019s consideration of real parties in interests\u2019 application violated Chapter 20.90 is directly contradicted by facts subject to judicial notice. <em>(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co., supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 604.) His other two assertions\u2014that the County\u2019s action was null and void and that the County and the Coastal Commission therefore lacked fundamental jurisdiction to act\u2014must be disregarded as baseless and erroneous legal conclusions. <em>(Long Beach Equities, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Ventura, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">C. <em>McAllister\u2019s Pleading Did Not State a Cause of Action Under CEQA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">McAllister\u2019s remaining theory in support of the validity of his first cause of action relies on CEQA. He asserts; \u201cThe County Defendants failed to comply with CEQA\u201d in various respects, including failure to prepare an EIR for the project, reliance on a flawed initial study, and adoption of inadequate mitigation measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">As we now explain, in the procedural context of this case, those allegations do not support a claim against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>1. <em>The County\u2019s CEQA determinations have been superseded by the Coastal Commission\u2019s review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">With the Coastal Commission\u2019s decision to accept the administrative appeal, the County\u2019s CEQA determinations were converted into intermediate decisions, lacking in finality. \u201cWhen, in the course of hearing that appeal, the Commission found a \u2018substantial issue,\u2019 it then heard the entire permit application de novo. The scope of that hearing decisively affects the status of the [County] and the Commission: \u2018A hearing <em>de novo </em>literally means a new hearing, or a hearing the second time. [Citation.] Such a hearing contemplates an entire trial of the controversial matter in the same manner in which the same was originally heard. It is in no sense a review of the hearing previously held, but is a complete trial of the controversy, the same as if no previous hearing had ever been held. . . . The decision therein . . . takes the place of and completely nullifies the former determination of the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 569, quoting <em>Collier &amp; Wallis, Ltd. v. Astor </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 202, 205 [70 P.2d 171].) \u201cOnce the Commission conducted its de novo examination, there was no longer a decision by the [County] to review.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The County\u2019s CEQA decisions thus have been superseded by the Coastal Commission\u2019s environmental review. \u201cThe Commission\u2019s findings that the [project] complied with CEQA superseded equivalent findings by the [county board of supervisors] [citations] in precisely the same manner that the Board\u2019s decision superseded that of the planning commission.\u201d <em>(Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 570.) As a result, McAllister no longer has any CEQA claims against the County, which is \u201cno longer plaintiff\u2019s adversarial opponent.\u201d (88 Cal.App.4th at p. 570.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">2. <em>The County\u2019s CEQA determinations are no longer subject to judicial review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">As McAllister correctly observes, for purposes of environmental review of the project challenged here, the County is the lead agency under CEQA, while the Coastal Commission is a responsible agency. (See Guidelines, \u00a7 15050, subds. (b)(1), (c).) As he also points out, \u201cCEQA mandates a lead agency to conduct a thorough review of the project in question even though additional review might later be undertaken by other agencies with jurisdiction over specific resources.\u201d <em>(Save San Francisco Bay Assn. v. San Francisco Bay Conservation etc. Com. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 908, 921 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 117] <em>(Save San Francisco Bay).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>From that premise, McAllister argues: \u201cAs a lead agency, the County\u2019s failure to comply with CEQA ... is subject to challenge under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We cannot agree. True, the County was the lead agency here. As explained above, however, its CEQA determination was not final for purposes of administrative mandamus. That fact is one of several that distinguish our case from <em>Save San Francisco Bay. </em>(See <em>Save San Francisco Bay, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 918.) A second distinction, which proceeds from the first, is that the agencies involved in <em>Save San Francisco Bay </em>undertook environmental review under different statutory schemes, each with a slightly different focus, rather than engaging in sequential review in a vertical process under CEQA. (10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 917, 918.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">As the <em>San Francisco Bay </em>court explained: \u201cThe administrative review of the aquarium project took over four years and was conducted by many agencies, including the City\u2019s planning commission, planning department, port commission, art commission and board of supervisors, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the Bay Area Quality Management District, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and BCDC [San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission]. The project raised numerous complex issues and generated strong public interest. Nevertheless, approval was eventually forthcoming from every agency involved, each having a slightly different mission and each being subject to its own rules and regulations.\u201d <em>(Save San Francisco Bay, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 917.) \u201cAfter the planning commission certified the final EIR and approved the project, BCDC formally accepted the project for review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 918, fn. omitted.) However, that agency\u2019s review was not pursuant to CEQA; rather, it was under an entirely different statutory scheme, the McAteer-Petris Act or MPA. (10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 915, 918; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 66600 et seq.) \u201cAlthough it had participated in the preparation of the EIR, BCDC\u2019s central role in the review process was to review the project for conformity with the provisions of the MPA\u201d and specific area plans. <em>(Save San Francisco Bay, </em>at p. 918.) As the court pointed out, those two statutory schemes\u2014 CEQA and the MPA\u2014\u201cdiffer in many significant respects.\u201d (10 Cal.App.4th at p. 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In this case, by contrast, the Coastal Commission did not undertake its environmental review pursuant to an entirely separate statutory scheme with a distinct focus. To the contrary, as CEQA and its accompanying Guidelines recognize, Coastal Commission review is a <em>substitute </em>for an EIR. (See \u00a7 21080.5, subds. (a), (e)(1); Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15002, subd. (l), 15251, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>subds. (c), (f).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Its review is \u201cthe functional equivalent of the EIR process.\u201d <em>(Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 569.) In this case, Coastal Commission review was the final step in a sequential process of CEQA proceedings, which started with the County\u2019s planning commission. That final step is the only one appropriate for judicial review. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) Under the circumstances presented here, the CEQA determination made by the County\u2019s board of supervisors is no more final than that made earlier by its planning commission. Both are merely intermediate determinations, and neither is a proper subject for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In short, nothing in <em>Save San Francisco Bay </em>or in the County\u2019s status as lead CEQA agency offers any basis for judicial review of the County\u2019s intermediate environmental decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">3. <em>Policy considerations do not dictate a different result.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Arguing against that conclusion based on policy considerations, McAllister contends that \u201cthe County\u2019s compliance with CEQA with respect to projects in the most sensitive coastal areas would be forever beyond judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We reject that argument. As provided by the Legislature, aggrieved parties may seek judicial review of a <em>final </em>environmental decision only. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) In this case, that decision is entrusted to the Coastal Commission. (See \u00a7\u00a7 21080.5, subd. (a), 30603.) We do not share McAllister\u2019s apparent apprehension over the Legislature\u2019s decision to give the Coastal Commission the final administrative say on sensitive coastal developments such as the one at issue here. In our view, that legislative choice is consistent with the commission\u2019s statutory charge to protect the \u201cquality of the coastal zone environment. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 30001.5, subd. (a).) Nor do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>we agree with McAllister that shielding the local CEQA decision from judicial review when an appeal is taken to the Coastal Commission \u201cwould provide the County with a disincentive to rigorously comply with CEQA and would leave the County unaccountable to the public for its CEQA violations in this context.\u201d In the first place, as a factual matter, nothing in the record before us suggests that the County fails to rigorously comply with its obligations under CEQA. Furthermore, a cursory examination of the administrative appeal process demonstrates the fallacy of that contention as a legal argument. The Coastal Commission does not have appellate jurisdiction unless someone takes an appeal. (\u00a7 30603.) Had no appeal been taken here, the County\u2019s CEQA determination would have been final and subject to immediate judicial review. In any given case, the County cannot know in advance whether its decision will be subject to a direct court challenge. For that reason alone, it has every incentive to comply with CEQA.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">To sum up, McAllister\u2019s policy arguments are unpersuasive in the face of the legislative dictates that govern us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">D. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Failing to Grant Leave to Amend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">McAllister\u2019s final appellate contention is that the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. He argues that the trial court did not give him \u201ca fair prior opportunity to correct any substantive defect in the complaint,\u201d and thus abused its discretion. (See <em>Larwin-Southern California, Inc. </em>v. <em>JGB Investment Co. </em>(1979) 101 Cal.App.3d 626, 635 [162 Cal.Rptr. 52].) He asserts: \u201cIf given a fair opportunity, Dr. McAllister would be able to amend the Complaint to allege, if necessary, more facts to support a violation of CEQA, Chapter 20.90 and his legal theory that the County\u2019s approval of the Project is null and void based on the violations of the 1977 Permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">1. <em>Policy favoring amendments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u201cThe trial court has discretion to allow amendments to the pleadings \u2018in [the] furtherance of justice.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 473, subd. (a)(1).) \u2018This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lincoln Property Co., N.C., Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 905, 916 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 39].) Furthermore, \u201ca plaintiff need not request leave to amend in order to preserve on appeal the issue of whether the court abused its discretion in sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 472c) . . . .\u201d <em>(Palm Springs Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Rangel </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1, 7 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>2. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s burden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">As the California Supreme Court explained long ago in the leading case of <em>Blank v. Kirwan, </em>when a demurrer \u201cis sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment .... The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Blank v. Kirwan, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 318, citations omitted.) In that case, the court found that the plaintiff failed to \u201ccarry his burden of proving a reasonable possibility that the defects can be cured by amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In order to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of curing the defect in the complaint, the plaintiff must show how the complaint can be amended and how the amendment will change the pleading\u2019s legal effect. <em>(Palm Springs Tennis Club v. Rangel, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at pp. 7-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">3. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">McAllister failed to carry his burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">As to his voidness claim, McAllister does not indicate what specific facts he could assert that might breathe life into that claim. He \u201chas never suggested what facts [he] is prepared to allege that would cure the defect in [his] complaint.\u201d <em>(Lincoln Property Co., N.C., Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity Co., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at p. 916.) Furthermore, there is \u201cnothing in the record that suggests\u201d a reasonable possibility of cure, particularly given the judicially noticed documents in this record. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In this case, it is not enough to offer \u201cessentially the same allegations but with greater specificity.\u201d <em>(Blank v.

The proper defendant is the Coastal Commission. But due to the passage of time, it cannot now be joined as a party-defendant on McAllister\u2019s CEQA claim. <em>(Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 570 [the plaintiff offered no \u201csuggestion how the Commission could be joined 13 months after it had issued the permit to real parties\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. <em>(Blank v.

We granted that request. In addition, Laube &amp; Engel filed a request for judicial notice of five documents. Two of those documents relate to proceedings in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>matter at the Coastal Commission; the others reflect proceedings in a separate superior court case involving the same parties.

As they see it, McAllister cannot challenge the County\u2019s action because that action was never final\u2014a prerequisite for administrative mandamus\u2014since an appeal was taken to the Coastal Commission. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) \u201cThe purpose of section 1094.5 is to inquire into the validity of any <em>final </em>administrative order.\u201d <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 245.)

In a summary of the contentions raised in the Coastal Commission appeal, the report states: \u201cThe County\u2019s approval of this application presents a number of unresolved jurisdictional and procedural issues.\u201d As described in the report, they included (a) what effect the work done by Sorenson in violation of the 1977 permit would have on \u201cthe proper procedure that the Coastal Commission should follow in considering this item\u201d; (b) whether \u201cthe current plans approved by the County would ... be consistent with the CDP issued by the Coastal Commission and would violate the terms of approval that were adopted in 1977\u201d; and (c) whether \u201cpending grading and construction violations [exist] that, under the County\u2019s LCP procedural rules, should have precluded action on the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In its recommended findings and declarations, the August 2004 Coastal Commission staff report continues: \u201cWith regards to the procedural issues, the Coastal Commission granted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>earlier permit for a single family dwelling in 1977 to Sorenson (Permit # A-174-77). ...[]\u25a1 During review of this current proposal, Commission staff recommended to the County staff that the applicants]\u2019] request for a new residence should be considered an amendment to the original 1977 Sorenson CCC permit, based on staff\u2019s belief that the original permittee had exercised the permit, as evidenced by partial development on site. . . . However, it has since been determined that Sorenson never combined the two lots as required by the Commission\u2019s permit, and so the work done was in violation of permit conditions.... Work done in violation of permit conditions is illegal and cannot be used to assert that the permit has been exercised. Since no extension of the 1977 permit occurred (or was requested) the Sorenson CDP appears to have expired in 1979. Eventually, the property was sold to Laube/Engel . . . whose application for development in the same general building site is the subject of this appeal, [f] . . . Since Commission approval of the Sorenson project was granted for a period of two years, and permit conditions were never fully complied with during that time, the permit appears to have expired, and the development on the site is a violation. The County now has a certified LCP, and as such has been granted the authority to regulate development in the coastal zone, with the Commission retaining appeal jurisdiction in the Big Sur Coast. Thus the Commission finds that the County was correct to have processed a coastal development permit application for the project. As a result of carrying out their permit authority, the County has approved a project, which has been appealed to the Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> As the relevant portion of the statute provides, \u201cwhen the regulatory program of a state agency requires a plan or other written documentation containing environmental information\u201d that complies with the statute, \u201cthe plan or other written documentation may be submitted in lieu of die environmental impact report required by this division if the Secretary of the Resources Agency has certified the regulatory program pursuant to this section.\u201d (\u00a7 21080.5, subd. (a).) The Coastal Commission\u2019s regulatory program has been so certified. According to the Guidelines: \u201cThe following programs of state regulatory agencies have been certified by the Secretary for Resources as meeting the requirements of Section 21080.5: [I] . . .[][] . . . The regulatory program of the California Coastal Commission and the regional coastal commissions dealing with the consideration and granting of coastal development permits under the California Coastal Act of 1976, Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15251, subd. (c).) Coastal Commission environmental review thus is among the programs that \u201chave been certified by the Secretary of the Resources Agency as involving essentially the same consideration of environmental issues as is provided by use of EIRs and negative declarations. Certified programs are exempt from preparing EIRs and negative declarations but use other documents instead.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15002, subd. (l).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
