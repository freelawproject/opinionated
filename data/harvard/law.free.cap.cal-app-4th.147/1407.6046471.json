Mother contends the trial court erred: (1) in calculating child support payments; (2) in failing to order father to pay one-half of the children\u2019s uninsured medical expenses; and (3) in failing to make the child support payments retroactive to the filing of mother\u2019s initial order to show cause. We conclude that the trial court properly refused to make child support payments retroactive to the filing of the initial order to show cause, but reverse and remand with instructions to recalculate the child support payments and to make an order concerning payment of the children\u2019s uninsured medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">According to the original petition for dissolution of marriage, mother and father were married on June 18, 1994, and had two children: Addis, bom in November 1994; and Mikias, bom in November 1996. The couple legally separated on March 5, 1999, and mother filed the petition for dissolution on May 26, 1999. On July 7, 1999, father filed a response and request for (1) dissolution of marriage based on irreconcilable differences, and (2) nullity of marriage based on prior existing marriage. On August 24, 1999, the court made various custody and support orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">The following years were contentious. A bifurcated trial commenced on August 27, 2004, and on that date a judgment of nullity was granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Evidence was completed on October 8, 2004. In a judgment filed November 4th, the trial court awarded parents joint legal and physical custody of the children with mother\u2019s home being the children\u2019s primary residence and mother having sole responsibility for decisions regarding medical and psychological treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">On November 23d, the trial court filed a memorandum of intended decision regarding child support. Adopting the dissomaster printout as its findings, the trial court ordered father to pay monthly child support, retroactive to September 1, 2004, in the amount of $882.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">Mother requested a statement of decision regarding, in pertinent part, father\u2019s actual gross income from the apartments he owns, father\u2019s actual business expenses attributable to the apartments, father\u2019s income from all sources available for child support and father\u2019s net income, after taxes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>available for child support. Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s order, father prepared a proposed statement of decision. Mother objected to the proposed statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">In a statement of decision filed February 1, 2005, the court found, in pertinent part, as follows: (1) father\u2019s gross income from the apartments was $384,000 in 2003; (2) father\u2019s business expenses for 2003 attributable to those apartments was $357,000; (3) father owns only 50 percent of one of the apartments; (4) father\u2019s \u201cactual gross annual income\u201d from a parking lot he operated was $30,000 ($2,500 per month); (5) father\u2019s lease of the parking lot is a valid transaction; (6) gross income from the parking lot is attributable to father for purposes of calculating child support; (7) father\u2019s business expenses attributable to the parking lot are $1,400 per month ($16,800 annually); (8) the business expenses listed by father on attachment 2 to his June 26, 2004, income and expense declaration were legitimate; (9) the monies father received from selling or refinancing real properties held in his name were paid to buy out the interests of others who held an interest in the properties and so there were no funds the court could consider as income available to pay child support; (10) father\u2019s monthly sources of income from which to pay child support were: (a) $1,100 net profits from the parking lot; and (b) $2,250 income from apartment rentals; and (11) father\u2019s net monthly income was $2,685.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">In a judgment filed that same day, the court found: (1) father\u2019s time with the two minor children is 20 percent; (2) father has gross monthly income of $3,350; (3) mother has gross monthly income of $3,771; and (4) mother has monthly child care expenses of $350. Based on those findings, the court ordered (1) father to pay child support in the amount of $882 per month; (2) mother and father to each pay one-half of the children\u2019s private school tuition for the 2004-2005 school year; and (3) father to pay mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">Mother filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">1. <em>Child Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-10\">Mother contends the trial court erred in calculating child support. She argues: (1) depreciation of father\u2019s rental properties should not have been used to reduce father\u2019s business income, and (2) the evidence was otherwise insufficient to support the finding that father\u2019s gross monthly income was only $3,350. We agree that depreciation is not properly deductible under the relevant Family Code provisions\u2014section 4058 (\u201cannual gross income\u201d) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>section 4059 (\u201cannual net disposable income\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of incorrect treatment of depreciation and for other reasons, the trial court\u2019s findings regarding father\u2019s gross monthly income are not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>a. <em>Depreciation of Rental Property in Calculating Child Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">In an attachment to his income and expense declaration filed June 26, 2004, father averred that the income derived from his rental properties was $384,000. (Judicial Council Forms, form FL-150.) From that sum, he subtracted $357,000 in expenses, including \u201cdepreciation\u201d of $57,000. He thus claimed $27,000 of net income derived from his rental holdings ($384,000 - $357,000 = $27,000). The trial court (1) found the declared \u201cbusiness expenses,\u201d including the depreciation allocation, were \u201clegitimate and appropriate business expenses\u201d of father, and (2) calculated child support based on father\u2019s net income as reduced by those expenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">We have found no reported California opinion that addresses the propriety of deducting depreciation from annual gross income under these circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our analysis of the statutory language, the stated California policies attendant to a parent\u2019s child support obligations, and the available authorities on the subject, causes us to conclude that depreciation is not deductible, and that the trial court erred in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">(i) <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">As in the trial court, we must determine whether depreciation is allowable under the statutory framework by which child support is calculated in California. Typically, an appellate court\u2019s review of child support orders is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion. (See, e.g., <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number><em>Marriage of Chandler </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 124, 128 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 109].) However, when an issue on appeal is strictly the interpretation of a statute, we traditionally exercise de novo review. <em>(Sonoma State University v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 500, 503 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 330].) In the context of child support orders, the rule is no different. (See <em>In re Marriage of Pearlstein </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1371-1372 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 910] [interpretation of definition of income]; <em>In re Marriage of Cheriton </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 269, 282-283 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 755] <em>(Cheriton).) </em>Hence, we review independently the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">(ii) <em>The Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">Court-ordered child support in California is, for the most part, a creature of statute. (See <em>Cheriton, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 282-283 [child support is \u201ca highly regulated area of the law\u201d].) Sections 4058 and 4059 at issue here are part of division 9, part 2, article 2 of the Family Code. (See Statewide Uniform Guideline, 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code (2004 ed.) foll. \u00a7 4050 et seq., p. 103.) The Legislature\u2019s expressed intent is that the uniform guidelines are necessary to ensure that state law \u201cremains in compliance with federal regulations for child support guidelines.\u201d (\u00a7 4050.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Courts have the power to depart from the guidelines only in \u201cthe special circumstances\u201d set forth in article 2. (\u00a7 4052.) In implementing the statutory scheme, the Legislature declared that \u201cthe courts shall adhere to\u201d the principles enumerated in the Family Code. (\u00a7 4053.) Even where the Legislature has expressly afforded the courts discretion, \u201cthe only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Butler &amp; Gill </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 462, 465 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 781]; see <em>In re Marriage of Leonard </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 546, 555 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 482] [\u201ctrial court\u2019s discretion is not so broad that it \u2018may ignore or contravene the purposes\u2019 \u201d of the child support law]; <em>In re Marriage of Muldrow </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 327, 332 [132 Cal.Rptr. 48].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">The actual amount of child support to be paid by the higher earning parent is determined by a formula, the components of which require the computation of each parent\u2019s <em>annual gross income </em>and <em>annual net disposable income. (Mejia v. Reed </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 657, 669 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 390, 74 P.3d 166] <em>(Mejia).) Annual gross income </em>is generally defined in section 4058 as \u201cincome from whatever source derived.\u201d (See <em>In re Marriage of Henry </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 111, 118 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 707].) <em>Net disposable income, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>turn, is computed by deducting from <em>annual gross income </em>amounts actually attributable to certain specified expenses. (\u00a7 4059.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">Fueling our interpretation of the statutory guidelines are various policies which the Legislature has identified. In its broadest formulation, \u201cCalifornia has a strong public policy in favor of adequate child support.\u201d <em>(Cheriton, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 283.) More specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-6\">\u2014 \u201cThe guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state\u2019s top priority.\u201d (\u00a7 4053, subd. (e).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-7\">\u2014 \u201cA parent\u2019s first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent\u2019s circumstances and station in life.\u201d (\u00a7 4053, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-8\">\u2014\u2022 \u201cEach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability.\u201d (\u00a7 4053, subd. (d).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-9\">\u2014 \u201cChildren should share in the standard of living of both parents. Child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children.\u201d (\u00a7 4053, subd. (f).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">(iii) <em>Sections 40508 and 40509</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">Whether depreciation is deductible in calculating net disposable income under the statutory scheme implicates essentially an income statute (\u00a7 4058), and an expense statute (\u00a7 4059). In interpreting these sections we must, of course, ascertain the intent of the Legislature, preferably from the statutory language itself. <em>(Garcia v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 342, 348 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 902].) If the words are clear and unambiguous, we need look no further. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-12\">We start our inquiry with section 4059 since its \u201cnet disposable income\u201d is an element of the actual child support formula. (\u00a7 4055.) As we will explain, our time with that provision is brief. Section 4059 lists a number of items that are to be deducted from annual gross income in determining net disposable income: tax payments, FICA contributions, union dues and retirement benefits, health insurance premiums, other child support, job-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>expenses, and hardship deductions. Neither party suggests that depreciation expense falls within any of these categories.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, if statutory support for the deduction of depreciation is to be found, it must come from that part of section 4059 which refers to \u201cannual gross income.\u201d We turn to section 4058, for it is there that \u201cannual gross income\u201d is given meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">With one exception not relevant here, section 4058 defines \u201cannual gross income\u201d as \u201cincome from whatever source derived.\u201d It identifies \u201crents\u201d as one of 16 examples of covered income. (\u00a7 4058, subd. (a)(1).) Also relevant is subdivision (a)(2) which states that income includes: \u201cIncome from the proprietorship of a business, such as gross receipts from the business reduced by expenditures required for the operation of the business.\u201d (\u00a7 4058, subd. (a)(2).) There is no mention of depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">Since rental income is expressly included as \u201cannual gross income\u201d under section 4058, subdivision (a)(1), and business operating expenditures are deductible under (a)(2), the question before us is: Does depreciation of rental property constitute an \u201cexpenditureQ required for the operation of [husband\u2019s] business[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">Father\u2019s answer is succinctly put in his reply brief, and it comes with a concession that the statutory language is not particularly helpful: \u201cIt would appear, without specifics from the Legislature as to what to do with depreciation, there is ample support for the allowance of deductions of a depreciation expense in <em>Family Code </em>\u00a7 4058.\u201d Mother contends that gross income may not be reduced by depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">As the relevant statutes are silent on the treatment of depreciation, we must look elsewhere to ascertain legislative meaning. (See <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>County of Stanislaus </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1143, 1152 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 329, 947 P.2d 291] [where statute is ambiguous courts may look to other indicia of legislative intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-9\">(iv) <em>Legislative History of Sections 4058 and 4059</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-10\">Where the literal language of a statute is not dispositive, we consider its legislative history to see if that process informs our interpretation. \u201c \u2018Both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 659 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Section 4058, added in 1993, is derived from former Civil Code section 4721 (\u00a7 4721), which was enacted in 1984. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1605, \u00a7 4, p. 5664.) \u201cSection 4058 continues former Civil Code Section 4721(f) without substantive change.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code, foll. \u00a7 4058, p. 145.) We, therefore, review the legislative history of section 4721.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">On March 3, 1983, Assembly Bill No. 1527 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.), was introduced to \u201cestablish a uniform standard for the establishment of the minimum amount of child support that shall be awarded, based on a specified formula.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1527 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.).) As originally proposed, Assembly Bill No. 1527 would have added as <em>section 4722 </em>to the Civil Code the following: \u201cIn determining the ability of parents to pay the minimum award and to calculate the actual payments to be made by each parent, all of the following provisions shall apply: [f] (a) The <em>total gross annual income </em>of each parent shall be determined. This <em>shall include income from all sources </em>except child support payments actually received and public assistance payments issued on the basis of a needs determination test. [][] (b) The <em>net disposable income </em>of each parent shall then be <em>computed by deducting </em>from his or her total gross income the <em>actual amounts attributable to only </em>the following items: [][] (1) State and [fjederal income taxes. [][] (2) Deductions under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. [][] (3) Union dues. [][] (4) Health insurance premiums, limited solely to those insurance plans providing coverage to the children for whom the support payments are being computed, [f] (5) Prior child support payments, based on proof of the amount actually paid.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1527 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.), italics added.) Assembly Bill No. 1527 was later amended three times in the Assembly in ways not relevant to the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">In comments before the California State Senate Judiciary Committee on December 15, 1983, George A. Magid, a member of the board of directors of the organization Equal Rights for Fathers, criticized proposed Civil Code section 4722, subdivision (a) for vagueness: \u201cTotal gross income needs to be defined. Is it the Committee\u2019s intent to equate the gross receipts of a person who operates a business as a sole proprietor with \u2018gross income\u2019 or only the net income from the business? I suggest it should be the net income, as that is the only appropriate amount to measure a sole proprietor\u2019s income and co-ordinate it with someone else on a salary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>An undated document that appears to be staff recommendations for amendments to section 4722 stated as follows: \u201cCurrent Status: [ft] Section 4722 in the current version of AB 1527 describes the procedures for computing the mandatory minimum award from the parent\u2019s gross income... . Amendment VI deals with more technical problems in this section, [ft] Problems: [ft] A. Gross annual income as it is currently defined would include all receipts from a business but would not allow for justifiable deductions for the expenses of this business such as for inventory or rent, [ft] . . . [ft] Solution: [ft] Staff proposes the following amendment to Section 4722. [ft] Section 4722 (as amended) [ft] . . . (b) The annual net disposable income of each parent shall then be computed by deducting from his or her annual gross income the actual amounts attributable only to the following items, after which the remainder is adjusted to reflect the monthly net disposable income of each parent: [ft] . . . [ft] (2) <em>Expenses directly incurred in carrying on a trade or business ... as defined in the California Revenue and Tax Code Section 17072. </em>[ft] (3) <em>Deductions for property held for the production of rents and royalties as defined in California Revenue and Tax Code Section 17072.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">In 1983, at the time Assembly Bill No. 1527 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) was wending its way through the legislative process, California Revenue and Taxation Code section 17072, the statute cited in the staff report, provided: \u201cAdjusted gross income shall be defined by Section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code . . . .\u201d In tom, Internal Revenue Code section 62 provided: \u201c \u2018adjusted gross income\u2019 \u201d of an individual is gross income reduced by various deductions, including those attributable to \u201cproperty held for the production of rents or royalties.\u201d Revenue and Tax Code section 17072, subdivision (b) expressly referred to Internal Revenue Code section 167(a). That section allowed \u201cas a depreciation deduction a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear (including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence)\u2014[1] (1) of property used in the trade or business, or [ft] (2) of property held for the production of income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">If the staff recommendations had been enacted, section 4722 would have included a deduction for depreciation in determining annual \u201cnet disposable income\u201d given the express references to the tax code definitions of adjusted gross income. But the staff recommendations were not adopted into law. Instead, later amendments to Assembly Bill No. 1527 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) completely reorganized sections 4721 and 4722. Part of the reorganization moved \u201cannual gross income\u201d from section 4722 to section 4721 which then read, in relevant part: \u201c4721 (a) The annual gross income of each parent shall be determined and then adjusted to obtain the annual net disposable income. . . . The annual gross income means income from whatever source derived, except as specified in subdivision (b), and includes, but is not limited to, all of the following: [ft] ... [ft] (2) Income from a private business, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>as <em>gross receipts from the business reduced by expenditures required for the operation of the </em>business.\u201d (Italics added.) It is the italicized language which remains operative today.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">We conclude that the legislative history, although not dispositive, tends to point toward disallowing depreciation as a deduction from income in calculating child support. First, the Legislature earlier had before it language which by express mention of Revenue and Taxation Code section 17072 and indirect references to Internal Revenue Code sections 62 and 167(a) would have allowed depreciation of \u201cproperty used in the trade or business\u201d and \u201cproperty held for production of income.\u201d If enacted, this rule would have applied to the depreciation claimed by father here. The proposed language, however, was rejected in favor of a provision which makes no reference to either depreciation or the tax code sections dealing with the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">Second, section 4721 as found in the earlier versions of Assembly Bill No. 1527 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) used the phrase \u201cexpenses directly incurred in carrying on a trade or business.\u201d In its final enactment the statute read: \u201cexpenditures required for the operation of the business.\u201d This change suggests a limiting of broad language from the earlier draft. Although a review of the dictionary definitions of \u201cexpenditure\u201d and \u201cexpense\u201d reveals some commonality and overlap, \u201cexpenditure\u201d is derived from \u201cto expend\u201d which means \u201cto pay out or distribute: spend; ... to consume by use.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 799.) An expense, in an accounting sense, means \u201can item of outlay incurred in the operation of a business enterprise allocable to and chargeable against revenue for a specific period.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 800.) As the Fourth District distinguished the terms in a different context: \u201cThe word \u2018disbursement\u2019 means funds paid out, and the word \u2018disburse\u2019 means to expend or pay out. (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 644.) The word \u2018expense\u2019 is defined as cost or the financial burden involved typically in a course of action. (Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at p. 800.)\u201d <em>(Ferrell v. County of San Diego </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 537, 543 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 681], fn. omitted.) Using these definitions, an expenditure involves the paying out of something, usually cash, for, by way of example, rent, equipment or inventory. By contrast, an expense is the cost of doing business and may or may not involve an actual payment of money. An expenditure of money obviously reduces the amount of money available to pay child support; not necessarily so for an expense. Here, father does not contend that his depreciation deduction reflected an actual payment of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>Although we find the legislative history helpful, it is not conclusive.

This exercise is designed to allow statutes to \u201cbe harmonized, both internally and with each other.\u201d <em>(Pang v. Beverly Hospital, Inc. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 994 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 643].) Statutes in one code may be considered with those in another code. <em>(Estate of Burden v.

Code interpreted in light of Welf. &amp; Inst. Code].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Our review of certain provisions in the Welfare and Institutions Code and the California Code of Regulations assists us in our understanding of section 4058. Parents of disabled children who receive certain state services are required to pay a portion of the costs of those services according to the parents\u2019 income. (See, e.g., Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a74782 [parents of minor children receiving 24-hour out-of-home care or who reside in a state hospital], 4783, subd. (b)(1) [parents of developmentally disabled children who reside in the home].) California Code of Regulations, title 17, sections 50207 and 50251 prescribe the procedures for determining the amount parents are required to contribute under the respective Welfare and Institutions Code programs. In calculating a parent\u2019s share, no deduction from income is allowed for depreciation. Thus, California Code of Regulations section 50207 states: \u201c[I]ncludible income from the operation of a business or from self-employment is the net income after deducting business expenses. However, depreciation, amortization, and depletion shall not be allowed as business expense deductions.\u201d California Code of Regulations section 50251 uses nearly identical language: \u201cIncome from the operation of a business or from self-employment is the net income after deducting business expenses. Depreciation, amortization, and depletion shall not be allowed as business expense deductions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">There are no reported cases on these provisions, but the regulations reflect a legislative determination that depreciation should not be taken into account in deciding the amount a parent must pay for these programs. Admittedly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>state\u2019s interest in reducing its participation in public assistance programs is not necessarily coextensive with its interest in ensuring fairness in child support payments under the Family Code. Nevertheless, the essential question raised in both situations is whether it is appropriate to reduce income by amounts attributable to the depreciation of certain assets. In the former, the answer is an express \u201cno,\u201d and that assists us in our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">(vi) <em>Treatment of Depreciation in Calculating Child Support in Other States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Although apparently one of first impression in our state, other jurisdictions have grappled with whether depreciation is to be taken into account in child support awards. (See Annot., Treatment Of Depreciation Expenses Claimed For Tax Or Accounting Purposes In Determining Ability To Pay Child Or Spousal Support (1995) 28 A.L.R.5th 46, and cases cited.) In some states the question is largely answered by statute. (See, e.g., Ohio Rev. Code Ann., \u00a7 3119.01, subd. (C); Alaska Rules Civ. Proc., rule 90.3, com. III(B).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other states where the statutory scheme is silent or incomplete, the courts necessarily have made the determination. (See, e.g., <em>Labar v. Labar </em>(1999) 557 Pa. 54 [731 A.2d 1252, 1255]; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(Ariz.Ct.App. 1995) 183 Ariz. 70 [900 P.2d 764]; <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Stoner </em>(1972) 163 Conn. 345 [307 A.2d 146, 151-152].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">In <em>Stoner v. Stoner, </em>the Connecticut Supreme Court surveyed case law in other jurisdictions and observed \u201cthree different basic approaches to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>problem, namely, that (1) depreciation is a book figure which does not involve any cash outlay nor reduce actual dollar income and, therefore, should not be allowed as a deduction; that (2) depreciation diminishes income-producing capacity and leads to the eventual replacement of the asset involved thereby warranting its deduction; and that (3) depreciation should not categorically either be deducted as an expense or treated as income, but rather that the extent of its inclusion, if any, should depend on the particular circumstances of each case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Stoner v. Stoner, supra, </em>307 A.2d at p. 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">Irrespective of which of the three approaches are utilized, appellate decisions on the subject generally recognize that (1) depreciation is an accepted business expense for tax and other purposes, and (2) any reduction in the income factor of the support equation necessarily reduces the amount available for support of a child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Cases denying depreciation tend to focus on the realities of depreciation in the context of cash available for child support. For example, the Connecticut Supreme Court ultimately concluded that its trial courts maintained discretion to consider depreciation. In <em>Stoner v. Stoner, </em>the court affirmed a trial court\u2019s order denying a downward adjustment to income for depreciation expense. In distinguishing depreciation from out-of-pocket expenses, the court explained: \u201cDepreciation is a mere book figure which does not either reduce the actual dollar income of the [parent] or involve an actual cash expenditure when taken. On the contrary, it represents additional cash available to the [parent] by permitting substantial tax deductions and, ultimately, tax savings.\u201d <em>(Stoner v. Stoner, supra, </em>307 A.2d at p. 152.) Similarly, the Pennsylvania court in <em>McAuliffe v. McAuliffe </em>(1992) 418 Pa.Super. 39 [613 A.2d 20, 22], observed that calculation of a party\u2019s income in the context of determining support payments \u201cmust reflect actual available financial resources and not the oft-times fictional financial picture which develops as the result of depreciation deductions taken against. . . income as permitted by the federal income tax laws.\u201d (See also <em>Cunningham v. Cunningham </em>(1988) 378 Pa.Super. 280 [548 A.2d 611, 612-613].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">The general test in New York is that in \u201cdetermining the amount of support payments a party is capable of paying, it is the party\u2019s net income adjusted for business expenses that should form the basis of the calculations.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number><em>(Cannan </em>v. <em>Cannan </em>(1981) 79 A.D.2d 1085 [436 N.Y.S.2d 133, 134].) But in defining income and expenses: \u201cPaper losses and expenses not actually incurred should not be taken into account.\u201d <em>(Dobbins </em>v. <em>Dobbins </em>(1977) 59 A.D.2d 548 [397 N.Y.S.2d 412, 414] [child and spousal support under separation agreement].) Finally in Ohio, the Court of Appeals acknowledged the economic underpinnings of its child support statute which limits allowable depreciation to only business equipment. (Ohio Rev. Code Ann., \u00a7 3.119.01(C)(9)(a).) \u201cThe exclusion of other types of depreciation \u2018is designed to ensure that a parent\u2019s gross income is not reduced by any sum that was not actually expended in the year used for computing child support.\u2019 <em>(Baus </em>v. <em>Baus </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 781, 784, 596 N.E.2d 509.)\u201d <em>(Foster v. Foster </em>(2002) 150 OhioApp.3d 298 [2002 Ohio 6390, 780 N.E.2d 1041, 1044].) Deduction for building depreciation was disallowed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">In contrast, courts that have allowed income to be reduced by depreciation expense have often relied on the traditional treatment of depreciation for tax purposes. Thus, in <em>Spotts v. Spotts </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1978) 355 So.2d 228, 229, Florida\u2019s District Court of Appeal referred to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code authorizing depreciation deduction as its basis for reducing a lump sum support payment. \u201cThe Congress of the United States has recognized that before a net income figure can be reached, depreciation of the property used to produce income must be deducted. Depreciation, therefore, is not income. It is a cost of producing income.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">In <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(Del. 1991) 586 A.2d 1182, the Delaware Supreme Court also considered the traditional role of depreciation in the determination of business income. \u201cThis Court has acknowledged that since depreciation is considered by generally accepted accounting principles to be an expense in determining net taxable income, it <em>may </em>also be a legitimate business expense for the purpose of computing the amount of net income which is available for child support, pursuant to [Delaware\u2019s support formula]. [Citation.] The concept of depreciation, as an expense, is a recognition of the fact that certain fixed assets, which are used in a business, wear out gradually and will eventually need to be replaced. [Citation.] The simplest form of this concept is known as straight fine depreciation. If straight line depreciation is used, the difference between the original cost of an asset and its scrap value is divided by the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. The quotient is treated as the annual depreciation \u2018expense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>586 A.2d at p. 1187.) The court allowed straight-line but not accelerated depreciation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1189; but see <em>Emsley v. Emsley </em>(Del.Fam.Ct. 1983) 467 A.2d 700, 704 [\u201cpurposes and policies of the Internal Revenue Code are far different from\u201d the Delaware child support law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>Given the varied treatment of depreciation in states, that case law is of only marginal assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">(vii) <em>Depreciation of Rental Property May Not Be Deducted from \u201cAnnual Gross Income\u201d in Calculating Child Support in California</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Based on our review of the statutory language and other extrinsic aids, we hold that depreciation of rental property is not deductible in calculating child support under sections 4058 and 4059.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">First, although \u201cincome\u201d is broadly defined in the statutory child support scheme <em>(Cheriton, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 285), deduction provisions are specific and narrowly construed <em>(Stewart v. Gomez, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at p. 1755). We find the Legislature\u2019s choice of the words \u201cexpendituref],\u201d \u201crequired,\u201d and \u201coperation of the business\u201d in section 4058 are words of limitation. \u201cExpenditure\u201d suggests an actual outlay of cash or other consideration. Depreciating an asset does not involve a reduction of cash available for child support. Nor is depreciation \u201crequired\u201d for the operation of a business. A proprietor cannot operate a business without inventory, without employees, without paying taxes, and so forth. A business can be conducted without a deduction for depreciation. We conclude that \u201coperation of the business\u201d means ordinary and necessary business expenditures directly related to or associated with the active, day-to-day conduct of a business. (See, e.g., <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 531, 543 [174 Cal.Rptr. 841, 629 P.2d 935] [Budget Act defines \u201c \u2018operating expenses and equipment\u2019 \u201d in terms of expenditures required \u201c \u2018for purchase of materials, supplies, equipment, services . . . .\u2019 \u201d]); c.f. <em>Keller v.

Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 5), the court noted \u201cmaintenance and operation expenses\u201d means the cost of rent, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, fuel, power, electrical current, care and supervision necessary to properly operate and maintain a permanent public improvement]; <em>Kirkpatrick v. City of Oceanside </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 267, 281 [283 Cal.Rptr. 191] [discussing an earlier unpublished opinion in which the appellate court found land lease costs were \u201c \u2018debt service expenses\u2019 \u201d specifically excluded by ordinance from the definition of \u201cnormal operating expenses\u201d].) Depreciation of a business asset, by its very nature, is not essential to the day-to-day running of the business, but is intended to promote the continuity of the business over a longer term.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>Second, as recognized by several other jurisdictions, depreciation is a fictional loss that, in the real world represents tax savings and, therefore, additional cash available to the parent to meet child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Third, the policies identified by our statutes favor the construction we place on sections 4058 and 4059. The overriding policy of the statutory formula is to place the interests of children \u201cas the state\u2019s top priority.\u201d (\u00a7 4053, subd. (e).) Thus, a parent\u2019s principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to his or her circumstances and ability to pay in order to improve the lives of the children. (\u00a7 4053, subds. (a), (d), (f); see <em>Cheriton, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 283.) Simply put, these policies are at odds with a child\u2019s receiving less financial support from a parent who is permitted under tax laws and accounting principles to take a deduction that does not reduce funds available for support.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Here, the trial court erred in allowing father a $57,000 deduction from rental income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Accordingly, we remand to the trial court for recalculation of father\u2019s annual gross income and annual net disposable income without reduction for depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">b., c.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">2. <em>The Trial Court Was Required to Make Findings on Uninsured Medical Expenses*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded.

(See <em>In re Sullivan </em>(2006) 167 OhioApp.3d 458 [2006 Ohio 3206, 855 N.E.2d 554, 558-559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">Alaska, by contrast, distinguishes between straight-line and accelerated depreciation. According to the commentary to rule 90.3 of the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure: \u201cIncome from self-employment, rent, royalties, or joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation includes the gross receipts minus the ordinary and necessary expenses required to produce the income. Ordinary and necessary expenses do not include amounts allowable by the IRS for the accelerated component of depreciation expenses ... or any other business expenses determined by the court to be inappropriate.\u201d In <em>Eagley v. Eagley </em>(Alaska 1993) 849 P.2d <em>777, </em>781, the court held that a deduction for straight-line depreciation of business real estate is allowable as an ordinary and necessary business expense, in light of the commentary\u2019s statement that accelerated depreciation should not be allowed. (See also <em>Neilson v. Neilson </em>(Alaska 1996) 914 P.2d 1268, 1273; <em>Ogard v. Ogard </em>(Alaska 1991) 808 P.2d 815.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1199-7\"> <em>Stoner v. Stoner </em>addressed depreciation in the context of both spousal and child support. <em>(Stoner v. Stoner, supra, </em>307 A.2d at pp. 151-152.) Whether depreciation should be treated the same for both types of support is likely to be a function of a particular state\u2019s statutory scheme. In California, child support and spousal support are found in different parts of the Family Code. (See \u00a7\u00a7 3900 et seq. [child support], 4300 et seq. [spousal support].) As the parties do not raise any issue of spousal support, we do not address the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1201-8\"> We do not suggest that promotion of the long-term health of a business is unimportant; only that the Legislature did not allow a deduction for it in calculating child support. (Cf. <em>Mejia, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 671 [assets at the time of dissolution \u201cplay little part\u201d in calculating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>child support]; <em>In re Marriage of Henry, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 119 [generally unrealized increase of value of assets not considered in determining child support].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1202-12\"> Our opinion addresses only depreciation deductions from rental income. The parties do not raise, and we have not considered, other types of depreciation, such as for equipment, nor do we address the treatment of actual reserve accounts (see <em>City of Los Angeles v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 680, 685 [125 Cal.Rptr. 779, 542 P.2d 1371]; <em>Oceanside Mobilehome Park Owners\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Oceanside </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 887, 895 [204 Cal.Rptr. 239].) Nor do we consider whether increased value of assets or depreciation can be considered \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d under sections 4052 and 4057, subdivision (b)(5).
