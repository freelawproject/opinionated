The issue on this appeal is whether NSMIA\u2019s savings clause is sufficiently broad to permit the Attorney General of California to pursue injunctive relief and penalties against a covered security\u2019s investment advisor and wholesale broker-dealer who allegedly made inaccurate or inadequate representations to purchasers. We conclude that the savings clause applies, and therefore reverse a judgment based on a finding that this action is preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">A. <em>The Declaratory Relief Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Capital Research and Management Company (CRMC, an investment advisor) and American Funds Distributors, Inc. (AFD, a registered broker-dealer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>and wholesale distributor), sued the Attorney General of the State of California for injunctive and declaratory relief concerning the legality of certain commissions and fees paid to broker-dealers selling shares in American Funds (AF Fund).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> CRMC manages AF Fund\u2019s 29 mutual funds (with combined assets of about $600 billion), and AFD distributes AF Fund\u2019s shares through \u201cselling group agreements\u201d with more than 2,000 unaffiliated broker-dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">According to AFD, its broker-dealers are paid \u201cprincipally through receipt of dealer commissions and . . . service fees\u201d but about 100 of its top selling dealers are paid an additional amount \u201cto defray the costs of training the dealers\u2019 registered representatives . . . who help dealers match appropriate investments to their clients\u2019 long term investment needs.\u201d The terms of the brokers\u2019 compensation are disclosed in AF Fund\u2019s prospectuses and other offering documents, including statements of additional information (SAI\u2019s), issued by AF Fund and disseminated to prospective investors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CRMC and AFD allege that AF Fund complies with its disclosure obligations by stating in its prospectus that AFD \u201cmay pay[] or sponsor informational meetings for[] dealers as described in the [SAI],\u201d and by stating in its SAI that AFD \u201cat its expense (from a designated percentage of its income), currently provides additional compensation to dealers. Currently, these payments are limited to the top 100 dealers who have sold shares of [AF Fund]. . . . These payments are based principally on a pro rata share of a qualifying dealer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>sales. [AFD] will, on an annual basis, determine the advisability of continuing these payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">According to CRMC and AFD, they sought declaratory relief because the Attorney General claims the compensation disclosures are inadequate and \u201cmaterially false and misleading\u201d in violation of Corporations Code sections 25401 and 25216, notwithstanding that (according to CRMC and AFD) the additional compensation payments to their broker-dealers are \u201cperfectly lawful\u201d because \u201cno state or federal law, rule or regulation . . . bans or otherwise regulates the practice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The declaratory relief complaint alleges that any effort by the Attorney General to stop the payments would be \u201cexpressly preempted under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996\u201d (see NSMIA, Pub.L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (1996) (codified in part at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>77r)) </em>or, if not preempted, would be entirely \u201cwithout legal or factual merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">B. <em>The Enforcement Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On the same day the declaratory relief action was filed, the Attorney General filed an enforcement action against CRMC and AFD (\u00a7\u00a7 25000 et seq., 12658, 12660), alleging that CRMC and AFD were participating in undisclosed \u201cshelf-space agreements,\u201d thereby increasing AF Fund\u2019s shareholders\u2019 costs and creating conflicts of interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Attorney General alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>that undisclosed shelf-space agreements adversely affect the relationship between broker-dealers and mutual funds on the one hand, and their customers on the other, and that the secrecy of these agreements prevents prospective mutual fund investors from recognizing this potential conflict of interest, and prevents mutual fund directors from effectively regulating their funds\u2019 distribution practices to protect shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">More specifically, the Attorney General alleges that, between January 2000 and the present, AFD maintained approximately 100 shelf-space agreements with broker-dealers, the majority of which were undisclosed \u201coral agreements entered into between AFD and the shelf-space brokers with express, reciprocal terms that were understood by both parties to the agreements.\u201d Pursuant to the formula stated in these agreements, AFD (subsidized by CRMC) paid cash and directed brokerage to the shelf-space brokers who sold AF Fund\u2019s shares and, in turn, received preferred access to the shelf-space brokers\u2019 registered sales representatives. The shelf-space agreements are not accurately or fully disclosed in AF Fund\u2019s disclosure documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Based on the facts summarized above, the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement action pleads two causes of action against AFD and CRMC, one for violations of section 25401, the other for violations of section 25216, subdivision (a), alleging that in selling AF Fund\u2019s shares, AFD (with the connivance of CRMC) violated these statutes by failing to disclose to purchasers and prospective purchasers of AF Fund\u2019s shares the facts about the shelf-space agreements that would allow them to understand the import of the statements made by AF Fund in its disclosure documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s complaint seeks injunctions enjoining AFD and CRMC from engaging in any conduct in violation of sections 25401 and 25216, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, and restitution to the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">C. <em>The Trial Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The declaratory relief and enforcement actions were consolidated and discovery was stayed pending a determination of the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">CRMC and AFD demurred to the enforcement complaint, contending NSMIA expressly or impliedly preempts any action challenging the adequacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of AF Fund\u2019s disclosures. The Attorney General filed opposition, pointing out that it had sued CRMC and AFD, not AF Fund, and that its complaint challenged the broker-dealers\u2019 alleged fraud, not AF Fund\u2019s disclosures. For its part, the trial court overruled the demurrer based on express preemption\u2014 but authorized a second demurrer on the implied preemption theory, and CRMC and AFD demurred again. The trial court accepted the implied preemption argument, found the savings clause did not salvage the enforcement action, and on that basis sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. CRMC and AFD then dismissed their declaratory relief action, and the court entered a final judgment in their favor, from which the Attorney General now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Attorney General contends his enforcement action is not preempted. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Preemption occurs three ways: (1) where federal law states expressly that state law is preempted; (2) where federal law is so comprehensive that it leaves no room in the covered field for supplementary state regulation; and (3) where there is an actual conflict between state and federal law. <em>(California Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Guerra </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 272, 280-281 [93 L.Ed.2d 613, 107 S.Ct. 683].) The issue is one of congressional intent <em>(Jevne v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 935, 949 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 685, 111 P.3d 954]; <em>County of Los Angeles v. Smith </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 500, 507 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 159]), and our task is to divine that intent by examining NSMIA\u2019s language as well as its structure and purpose <em>(Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 133, 137-138 [112 L.Ed.2d 474, 111 S.Ct. 478]).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u201cThe primary purpose of NSMIA was to preempt state \u2018Blue Sky\u2019 laws which required <em>issuers </em>to register many securities with state authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>prior to marketing in the state. . . . Congress recognized the redundancy and inefficiencies inherent in such a system and passed NSMIA to preclude states from requiring <em>issuers </em>to register or qualify certain securities with state authorities.\u201d <em>(Lander v. Hartford Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 2001) 251 F.3d 101, 108, italics added.) To that end, NSMIA provides for exclusive federal registration of nationally traded securities (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77f, 77r(b)), including the mutual fund shares at issue in this case (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77b(a)(1), 77r(b)), and provides (as relevant): <em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, </em>no law, rule, regulation, or order, or other administrative action of any State ... [1] (1) requiring, or with respect to, registration or qualification of securities, or registration or qualification of securities transactions, shall directly or indirectly apply to a security that . . . [][] ... is a covered security; ... [f] ... [f] (2) <em>shall directly or indirectly prohibit, limit, or impose any conditions upon the use off,) </em>[f] . . . <em>with respect to a covered security . . . , any offering document that is prepared by or on behalf of the issuer, </em>or [][]... [f] (3) shall directly or indirectly prohibit, limit, or impose conditions, based on the merits of such offering or issuer, upon the offer or sale of any [covered] security . . . .\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(a), italics added; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 77r(d).) At least indirectly, the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement action seeks relief that would impose conditions on the use of AF Fund\u2019s offering documents by its investment adviser and broker-dealers\u2014and it is thus indisputably covered by this express preemption provision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">But the enforcement action just as plainly comes within NSMIA\u2019s savings clause, which provides: \u201cConsistent with this section, <em>the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State shall retain jurisdiction under the laws of such State to investigate and bring enforcement actions with respect to fraud or deceit, or unlawful conduct by a broker or dealer, in connection with securities or securities transactions.\u201d </em>(15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(c)(1), italics added.) The plain language of the savings clause and its legislative history persuade us that Congress intended to preserve the states\u2019 antifraud authority to control the conduct of brokers and dealers, notwithstanding that the exercise of such controls might prospectively influence the disclosures made by a covered security. Put another way, the Attorney General\u2019s action has all of the attributes necessary to bring it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>squarely within the ambit of the savings clause. It is (1) an enforcement action (2) brought by a state officer performing the functions of a securities commission, (3) under California law (4) with regard to fraud and deceit (5) in connection with covered securities transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The trial court found an ambiguity where none exists (the court said the \u201cexpress preemption provision, when read in conjunction with the savings clause, is ambiguous on its face as to what state claims are permitted\u201d). We see no ambiguity in the preemption provision or the savings clause. Although the preemption provision expressly prohibits any state from imposing conditions on the use of a covered security\u2019s offering documents, the savings clause gives the Attorney General authority to \u201cbring enforcement actions with respect to fraud or deceit, or unlawful conduct by a broker or dealer, in connection with securities or securities transactions.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(c)(1).) What this means is that the Attorney General cannot sue AF Fund to force it to change its disclosure documents, but it can sue AFD and CRMC to force <em>them </em>to disclose their oral agreements with the shelf-space brokers. The savings clause is sufficiently broad to permit this action (cf. <em>Dowhal v. SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 910, 925 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 88 P.3d 1]), and as applied to this case is entirely consistent with the purpose of NSMIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">It is the wholesale distributor\u2019s conduct that is at issue in this case (and the enabling conduct of the adviser), not the sufficiency of the disclosures made by AF Fund. In fact, the complaint alleges that AFD\u2019s and CRMC\u2019s disclosures were affirmatively false and misleading because the practice of entering shelf-space agreements was intentionally concealed from investors and also from AF Fund\u2019s directors. It is the conduct of the adviser and the distributor that (according to the Attorney General) violates sections 25401 and 25216, subdivision (a)\u2014because the purchasers are being induced to purchase AF Fund shares by means of manipulative, deceptive, and otherwise fraudulent contrivances. (See <em>S. E. C. v. Capital Gains Bureau. </em>(1963) 375 U.S. 180 [11 L.Ed.2d 237, 84 S.Ct. 275] [failure to disclose financial incentives in investment recommendation is actionable fraud]; <em>Siemers v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. </em>(N.D.Cal., Aug. 14, 2006, No. C 05-04518 WHA) [2006 WL 2355411 at pp. *4\u2014*7] [failure to disclose details of shelf-space agreements is a material omission].) The fact that this action, if successful, might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>indirectly encourage AF Fund to alter its disclosure documents does not affect the application of the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Our conclusion is supported by the clear statement of congressional intent expressed at the time the savings clause was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">By way of example, a Senate Report explained that the statute preserved the states\u2019 authority to \u201ccontinue their role in <em>regulating broker-dealer conduct </em>whether or not the offering is subject to state review. The [Senate] Committee believes that allowing the states to oversee broker-dealer conduct in connection with preempted offerings will ensure continued investor protection. As long as states continue to police fraud in these offerings, compliance at the federal level will adequately protect investors. In preserving this authority, however, the Committee expects the states only to police conduct\u2014 not to use this authority as justification to continue reviewing exempted registration statements or prospectuses. The Committee clearly does not intend for the \u2018policing\u2019 authority to provide states with a means to undo the state registration preemptions.\u201d (Sen. Rep. No. 104-293, 2d Sess. (1996) [1996 WL 367191 at p. *15], italics added.) The Attorney General\u2019s enforcement action, which challenges broker-dealer conduct, cannot reasonably be construed as an effort to regulate a nonparty issuer.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The Joint Conference Report of both houses offers a similar insight into the purpose of the savings clause. <em>\u201cThe [statute </em>preserves] <em>the authority of the states to protect investors through application of state antifraud laws. This preservation of authority is intended to permit state securities regulators to continue to exercise their police power to prevent fraud and broker-dealer sales practice abuses, such as churning accounts or misleading customers. </em>It does not preserve the authority of state securities regulators to regulate the securities registration and offering process through commenting on and/or imposing requirements on the contents of prospectuses or other offering documents, whether prior to their use in a state or after such use.\u201d (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-864, 2d Sess., at p. 40 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 3921, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">So too does the House Committee on Commerce Report: \u201cState governments generally retain authority to . . . bring actions pursuant to State laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and deceit, including broker-dealer sales practices abuses, [f] . . . [][] [After noting that Congress did intend to prevent the states from indirectly circumventing the preemption clause, the Commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tee explains that it] does not intend . . . that the extension of the prohibition to indirect actions by State regulators restrict or limit their ability to investigate, bring actions, or enforce orders, injunctions, judgments or remedies based on alleged violations of State laws that prohibit fraud and deceit or that govern broker-dealer sales practices in connection with securities or securities transactions, [f] . . . [f]</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u201c. . . The Committee intends to preserve the ability of the States to investigate and bring enforcement actions under the laws of their own State with respect to fraud and deceit (including broker-dealer sales practices) in connection with any securities or any securities transactions, whether or not such securities or transactions are otherwise preempted from State regulation by [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r]. It is the Committee\u2019s intent that the limitations on State law established by [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r] apply to State law registration and regulation of securities offerings, and do not affect existing State laws governing broker-dealers, including broker-dealer sales practices. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u201cIf ... a State had undertaken an enforcement action that alleged, for example, that the prospectus contained fraudulent financial data or failed to disclose that principals in the offering had previously been convicted of securities fraud, it is conceivable that State laws regarding fraud and deceit could serve as the basis of a judgment or remedial order that could include a restriction or prohibition on the use of the prospectus or other offering document or advertisement within that State. The Committee does not intend [the preemption provision] to be interpreted in a manner that would prohibit such judgments or remedial orders. [][] It is also the Committee\u2019s intention not to alter, limit, expand, or otherwise affect in any way any State statutory or common law with respect to fraud or deceit, including broker-dealer sales practices, in connection with securities or securities transactions.\u201d (H.R.Rep. No. 104-622, 2d Sess., pp. 16, 30, 33-34 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 3878, 3892, 3896-3897.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We agree with CRMC and AFD that NSMIA must not be construed so as to render any of its provisions superfluous <em>(Kanter v. Warner-Lambert Co. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 780, 791 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 72]), but observe that it is their construction that would do precisely that by rendering the savings clause superfluous. Noticeably absent from their brief is any suggestion about what it is the savings clause might permit if construed to prohibit a challenge to a distributor\u2019s failure to disclose the existence and effect of its own oral shelf-space agreements and the conflicts allegedly created by such agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ments. The accepted purpose of NSMIA is to prevent the states from subjecting covered securities to registration requirements, whereas the purpose of the savings clause is to allow the states, in an exercise of their historic police function, to take such action as is necessary to prevent fraud in the sale of covered securities. (See <em>Zuri-Invest AG v. Natwest Finance Inc., supra, 177 </em>F.Supp.2d 189; <em>Gabriel Capital, L.P. v. Natwest Finance, Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2000) 94 F.Supp.2d 491, 499; and see <em>Patterman v. Travelers, Inc. </em>(S.D.Ga. 1997) 11 F.Supp.2d 1382.) Accordingly, there is nothing about our holding that defeats the purpose of NSMIA (cf. <em>Etcheverry v. Tri-Ag Service, Inc. </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 316, 328 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 36, 993 P.2d 366], overruled in part by <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC </em>(2005) 544 U.S. 431, 436, 452-454 [161 L.Ed.2d 687, 125 S.Ct. 1788]).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Viewed from this perspective, we conclude that Congress had not one but two objectives when it enacted NSMIA\u2014the primary intent to promote national uniformity in the securities registration process by preempting state Blue Sky laws, and the secondary but equally important intent to encourage the continued participation of the states in preventing fraud in securities transactions, particularly with regard to broker-dealers.

Each fund contracts with an investment adviser who provides management, portfolio selection, and administrative services to the fund, for which the adviser is usually compensated based on a percentage of the fund\u2019s total assets. A mutual fund\u2019s shares are sold through various channels, one of which is through third party broker-dealers and their sales representatives. A mutual fund compensates its selling broker-dealers by levying a sales charge (a load) on the investors based on a percentage of the amount invested. Typically, an investor pays when making the investment (a front-end load) or later when selling or redeeming the shares (a back-end load). Investors may also pay their third party professionals an annual fee based on the total amount of assets invested, and mutual funds may also charge investors ongoing fees as compensation for costs expended in marketing the fund or for servicing the investor\u2019s account.

According to the Attorney General, shelf-space agreements \u201care typically created when a mutual fund\u2019s distributor enters into an oral agreement with a broker-dealer to exchange a combination of hard dollars and directed brokerage for a valuable privilege: preferred or exclusive access to the broker-dealer\u2019s sales force and heightened visibility within a broker-dealer\u2019s distribution or sales systems.

(NASAA, an association of state agencies responsible for administering state securities laws), all shelf-space agreements create a \u201cfundamental conflict of interest between what\u2019s best for investors and what\u2019s best for the advisors, distributors, and broker-dealers that are involved in marketing mutual funds,\u201d but directed brokerage shelf-space agreements are particularly onerous because the conflicts they create are unmanageable and so fraught with potential abuse that the SEC has banned the practice altogether, regardless of whether it is disclosed. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Prohibition on the Use of Brokerage Commissions to Finance Distribution, S.E.C. Release No. IC-26591, 2004 WL 1969665 (Sept. 2, 2004).) The legality of the shelf-space agreements is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\"> The Attorney General contends there is a presumption against preemption in this case because his enforcement action is an exercise of the state\u2019s police powers. <em>(Bronco Wine Co. </em>v. <em>Jolly </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 943, 989 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 180, 95 P.3d 422].) CRMC and AFD disagree, claiming there is no presumption here because there is a significant history of federal presence in the field of securities regulation. <em>(Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1303, 1312 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 435]; <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2003) 258 F.Supp.2d 1097, 1108.) We need not resolve this conflict because, in either event, we would reach the same result based on the \u201cclear or manifest intent on the part of Congress\u201d shown by the language of the statute itself as well as its congressional history. <em>(Bronco Wine Co. </em>v. <em>Jolly, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 989.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b88-5\"> In <em>Zuri-Invest AG v. NatWest Finance Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2001) 177 F.Supp.2d 189, 194, an action by one private company against another, a New York court found NSMIA\u2019s preemption provision does not expressly preempt state common law fraud claims. <em>Zuri-Invest </em>did not consider an enforcement action asserting claims arising under state securities statutes, and thus is not inconsistent with our finding of express preemption. It is worth noting that <em>Zuri-Invest </em>also rejected claims of implied and conflict preemption and thus refused to dismiss the fraud claims. In any event, the real issue in our case is whether the savings clause applies, not whether we are dealing with express or implied preemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> Our conclusion is supported by a number of unpublished opinions from other states. (E.g., <em>Target Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky </em>(Ky.Ct.App., May 26, 2006, No. 2004-CA-001947-MR) 2006 WL 1443980; <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Gillette Co. </em>(Mass.Super.Ct., Apr. 28, 2005, No. 051453BLS) 2005 WL 1155253.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\"> We summarily reject the trial court\u2019s finding that the savings clause preserved only common law fraud claims (which require an intent to deceive), not those arising under sections 25401 and 25216, subdivision (a). <em>(S. E. C. v. Capital Gains Bureau., supra, </em>375 U.S. at p. 192; <em>Kubik v. Goldfield </em>(3d Cir. 1973) 479 F.2d 472, 476, fn. 6 [under the securities statutes, fraud is not limited to the common law elements of deceit].) We also reject CRMC\u2019s and AFD\u2019s contention that the savings clause does not preserve the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement action on the ground that the relief sought conflicts with federal law <em>(Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 517 [120 L.Ed.2d 407, 112 S.Ct. 2608]). CRMC and AFD have not pointed to a specific federal law, standard, or policy that conflicts with the relief sought against CRMC and AFD and we know of none. <em>(Chamberlan v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2004) 314 F.Supp.2d 953, 963; and see <em>Zuri-Invest AG v. Natwest Finance Inc., supra, 177 </em>F.Supp.2d at pp. 195-197 [finding no conflict between NSMIA and New York\u2019s antifraud laws because conflict preemption occurs only when it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\"> Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Four, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
