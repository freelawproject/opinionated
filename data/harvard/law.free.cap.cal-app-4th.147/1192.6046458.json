Lexington contends the trial court erred because the bail was exonerated when Due\u00f1as was placed \u201cin custody\u201d by an order of the court. We conclude that Due\u00f1as was not \u201cin custody\u201d and the bail was not exonerated. We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Alj\">1. <em>Factual background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Due\u00f1as was charged with being a felon or addict in possession of a weapon and with possession of marijuana or hashish for sale. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1); Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">On November 15, 2004, defendant and appellant Lexington posted a bail bond for Due\u00f1as\u2019s release from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">On November 24, 2004, Due\u00f1as appeared for arraignment. The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-8\">\u201cThe Court: Case Number BA273742, People versus Julio Due\u00f1as. [][] Good morning.

Due\u00f1as could not be found. At the request of the People, the bond was forfeited and a bench warrant issued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">2. <em>Procedural background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">A notice of forfeiture was mailed to Lexington. Summary judgment was entered against Lexington on the forfeited bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Lexington moved to vacate the forfeiture, exonerate bail, and set aside the summary judgment. The trial court denied the motion. Lexington appeals from the denial order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The County of Los Angeles appears on appeal as plaintiff and respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">\n<em>Due\u00f1as was not in custody for purposes of exonerating his bail.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Lexington presents only one argument on appeal. It contends that the bail was exonerated because Due\u00f1as was \u201cin custody\u201d before he left the courtroom. This contention is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">\u201c \u2018The object of bail and its forfeiture is to insure the attendance of the accused and his obedience to the orders and judgment of the court.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018In matters of this kind there should be no element of revenue to the state nor punishment of the surety.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>American Contractors Indemnity Co. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 653, 657 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 76, 93 P.3d 1020].)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">\u201c \u2018A bail bond is in the nature of a contract between the government and the surety, in which the surety acts as a guarantor of the defendant\u2019s appearance under risk of forfeiture of the bond. [Citation.] \u201cIn general the state and surety agree that if the state will release the defendant from custody, the surety will undertake that the defendant will appear personally and <em>at a specified time and place </em>.... If the defendant fails to appear at the proper time and place, the surety becomes the absolute debtor of the state for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>amount of the bond.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(People v. Amwest Surety Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 351, 356 [280 Cal.Rptr. 58].) [\u00b6] In other words, \u2018[i]t is the obligation of the sureties on a bail bond to produce the principal at the time and the place <em>specified in the bond. </em>[Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Amwest Surety Ins. Co. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 69, 71 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 282], italics added.) When there is a breach of the contract between the government and the surety, the bond is enforced. <em>(People </em>v. <em>American Contractors Indemnity Co., supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at pp. 657-658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">\u201cWhen bail is given, the principal is regarded as delivered to the custody of his sureties. Their dominion is a continuance of the original imprisonment.\u201d <em>(Taylor v. Taintor </em>(1872) 83 U.S. 366, 371 [21 L.Ed. 287]; cf. <em>Kiperman </em>v. <em>Klenshetyn </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 934, 939 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 178].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">\u201cWhen the bail has served its purpose, the surety will be \u2018exonerated,\u2019 i.e., released from the obligation. Exoneration normally occurs on termination of the proceedings in some manner or on return of the defendant to custody .... [Citations.]\u201d (4 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Pretrial Proceedings, \u00a7 95, p. 294.) Thus, for example, bail will be exonerated when the action is dismissed against the defendant (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1384), when the trial court grants a motion to set aside the indictment or information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 997), when a defendant is committed after being convicted (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1166), and when a defendant appears for sentencing (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1195; e.g., <em>People v. Allied Fidelity Ins. Co. </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 242 [147 Cal.Rptr. 245]).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">The bail is also exonerated when the surety, fearful that a defendant will not appear as required, surrenders the defendant to the court, or when the defendant surrenders himself or herself to the court. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1300, subd. (a) [\u201cAt any time before the forfeiture of their undertaking, ... the bail or the depositor may surrender the defendant in their exoneration, or he may surrender himself, to the officer to whose custody he was committed at the time of giving bail . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The same result occurs when the court recommits the defendant despite the admission to bail. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>McReynolds </em>(1894) 102 Cal. 308 [36 P. 590] (McReynolds) the defendant appeared, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 311.) On motion of the district attorney, \u201cthe court . . . made an order that [the defendant] \u2018. . . is hereby committed to the custody of the sheriff. . . , pending the trial of the above-entitled matter\u2019; and under said order the . . . sheriff took [the defendant] into his custody.\u201d Afterwards, on motion of the district attorney, the trial court vacated its prior order. Pursuant to the vacating order, the sheriff then released the defendant. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>trial. . . was continued until the next day, at which time [the defendant] was <em>not </em>present; ... the court made an order forfeiting the bond.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In subsequent trial court proceedings, the sureties were unsuccessful in their action to recover the amount of the bond. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>McReynolds </em>held that the sureties\u2019 liabilities ceased when the defendant was taken into custody of the sheriff by order of the court. <em>(McReynolds, supra, </em>102 Cal. at p. 311.) The Supreme Court reasoned, \u201cUpon the release of a person on bail he is in the custody of the sureties; and the consideration of the bond, accruing to the sureties, is his freedom from any other custody. The responsibility of the sureties is based upon their custody of the person bailed, and their rights and powers under such custody. If they are at any time fearful that he may not appear, they can have him arrested and surrendered; or he may surrender himself; and, in either event, they are exonerated. (Pen. Code, sec. 1300.) When the court orders him into the custody of the sheriff, and the latter takes him, the same result follows. Vacating the order did not by operation of law restore him to [the sureties\u2019] custody. The fact that in the case at bar the sheriff had [the defendant] in his custody under the order, for only a short time, is immaterial. It makes no difference whether the time was ten minutes or ten months. The theory upon which the case seems to have been decided, that [the sureties] should have shown affirmatively that the custody of the sheriff actually prevented them from afterwards producing [the defendant], is not sound. When he was taken into the sheriff\u2019s custody [the sureties] were released from any further care as to his whereabouts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 311-312.) <em>McReynolds </em>\u201creasoned that since a surety may, at any time it is fearful that a defendant may not appear, surrender him and be exonerated (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1300), exoneration must also result when the court itself places the defendant in the custody of the sheriff.\u201d <em>(People v. Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 51, 58 [132 Cal.Rptr. 19].)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">However, in similar circumstances, if statements of the trial court are not intended to submit a defendant to the custody of the sheriff, but rather are mere directives or colloquy, then the defendant has not been placed into \u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of bail exoneration. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 792 [7 Cal.Rptr. 755] [no formality is required but there must be some submission to custody or control to exonerate bail].)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Lexington argues that when the trial court directed Due\u00f1as \u201cnot to leave the courtroom,\u201d Due\u00f1as was taken into custody and the bail was exonerated, as in <em>McReynolds. </em>However, the facts before us differ from <em>McReynolds </em>in significant ways. Here, the trial court never issued a formal directive indicating that Due\u00f1as was being transferred to the custody of the sheriff. Rather, when Due\u00f1as appeared for purposes of arraignment, the court first had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>address the People\u2019s motion to have Due\u00f1as remanded into custody. The court informed Due\u00f1as, \u201c[the People] are seeking to have you remanded into custody today. So would you like to have an attorney represent you for today so that that issue can be addressed?\u201d The trial court directed Due\u00f1as to stay in the courtroom so that the issue of custody could be addressed. It would be incongruous to conclude that Due\u00f1as was in custody when that was the very issue to be determined and when the trial court never made any express statements or gestures to that effect. Further, the sheriff never restrained Due\u00f1as, even for a moment. Thus, the trial court\u2019s order to Due\u00f1as not to leave the courtroom was not an order to the sheriff to take Due\u00f1as into \u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of bail exoneration, but rather a directive given prior to the issue of Due\u00f1as\u2019s remand into custody being addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Lexington points to another situation in which \u201ccustody\u201d has been discussed in criminal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lexington notes that courts use this term to determine if an extrajudicial statement is admissible for purposes of <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the context of <em>Miranda, </em>a suspect is in \u201ccustody\u201d if he or she is \u201cphysically deprived of his [or her] freedom of action in any significant way\u201d or is led to believe, as a reasonable person, that he or she is so deprived. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 444; <em>People v. Mayfield </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 732 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 928 P.2d 485].) For purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>\u201cthe term \u2018custody\u2019 generally does not include \u2018a temporary detention for investigation\u2019 where an officer detains a person to ask a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer\u2019s suspicions. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Farnam </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 180 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 47 P.3d 988].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>It is apparent that in both situations (exoneration of bail when the trial court recommits a defendant and <em>Miranda </em>rulings), the concept of restricting a person\u2019s freedom is involved. However, for our purposes, it is sufficient to say that to determine whether a trial court has recommitted a defendant such that bail is exonerated, the trial court must indicate in some clear or formal way that custody of the defendant is being transferred to the control of the sheriff. Unequivocal pronouncements may be sufficient, however, other circumstances may also be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">This is demonstrated by <em>McReynolds </em>where the trial court articulated precisely what it intended by stating that the defendant \u201c \u2018is hereby committed to the custody of the sheriff . . . pending the trial\u2019 \u201d and additionally, the sheriff physically took the defendant into custody. <em>(McReynolds, supra, </em>102 Cal. at p. 311.) In <em>McReynolds, </em>the trial court made explicit statements of its intent to take the defendant into custody in circumstances in which that result was expected to occur. It was clear that the defendant in <em>McReynolds </em>was being surrendered to the custody of the sheriff. (Cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 1300, subd. (a)(1) [permitting the surety to surrender the defendant into custody].)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">We recognize that because \u201c \u2018equity abhors a forfeiture,\u2019 . . . \u2018statutes imposing them are to be strictly construed . . .\u2019 [and that t]his rule applies to the forfeiture of surety bonds. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Far West Ins. Co. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 791, 795 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 448].) However, we must also give a commonsense interpretation to events.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Here, the trial court directed Due\u00f1as to stay in the courtroom so that the trial court could determine <em>if </em>he should be remanded into custody. There was no express statement by the trial court that Due\u00f1as was being taken into custody. Thus, even though Due\u00f1as disobeyed a court order and might have been guilty of contempt, at the time he fled the courtroom he was not \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of exonerating his bail. The trial court properly ordered the bail forfeited and properly denied the motion to set aside the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The order is affirmed.

The issue in <em>Handley </em>was whether the defendant was guilty of escape within the meaning of Penal Code section 4532. <em>Handley </em>concluded that the defendant had committed the crime of escape because his dash out of the courtroom followed sentencing and the trial court\u2019s words, \u201c \u2018You are in custody.
