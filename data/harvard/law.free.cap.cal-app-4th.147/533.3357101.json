Walker </em>(Nov. 10, 1992, B058840) [nonpub. opn.] <em>(Walker I).) </em>Accordingly, we held Walker, who was serving a state prison term of 19 years to life for second degree murder, had not demonstrated her trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient or, assuming Walker had in fact been subjected to intimate partner battering, there was a reasonable probability introduction of expert testimony on that subject would have resulted in a more favorable outcome at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Three years after our decision in <em>Walker I, </em>in <em>People </em>v. <em>Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531] <em>(Barton), </em>the Supreme Court disapproved its earlier decision in <em>People v. Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 329 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311], and held imperfect or unreasonable self-defense \u201cis not a defense but a crime; more precisely, it is a lesser offense included in the crime of murder.\u201d <em>(Barton, </em>at pp. 200-201.) However inconsistent the defendant\u2019s version of the crime and whatever the arguments of the prosecutor and defense counsel, after <em>Barton </em>to obtain a guilty verdict on a charge of murder, the trial court must instruct the jury the People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant was not acting in imperfect self-defense whenever the record contains substantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude the defendant was guilty only of voluntary manslaughter. (See <em>Barton, </em>at pp. 201-202 [although defendant claimed gun discharged accidentally, jury could reasonably discount this self-serving testimony in light of other evidence concerning defendant\u2019s conduct and conclude killing occurred either in unreasonable but good faith belief that defendant had to defend himself or as an intentional act satisfying the elements of murder].) The following year in <em>People v. Humphrey, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pages 1086-1087 <em>(Humphrey), </em>the Supreme Court held expert testimony concerning intimate partner battering and its effects, expressly made admissible in criminal actions by Evidence Code section 1107 as of January 1, 1992, was relevant in a murder case to the determination of both the subjective existence and objective reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s belief in the need to defend herself or himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In her petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Penal Code section 1473.5 (section 1473.5), enacted by the Legislature in 2001 for the benefit of individuals like Walker who were convicted of murdering their abusive partners prior to the effective date of Evidence Code section 1107 and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Humphrey, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 1073, Walker asks us to reconsider our decision in <em>Walker I </em>and to find the failure of her trial counsel to introduce expert testimony regarding intimate partner battering and its effects (whether or not a reasonable tactical decision) substantially prejudiced her defense. In light of the developments in the law since our initial decision in this case, we agree there is a reasonable probability, sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict, that the result of Walker\u2019s trial would have been different (that is, she may have been convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather than second degree murder) had such evidence been presented. Accordingly, we grant the relief requested, vacate the 1991 judgment of conviction and remand Walker to the Los Angeles Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">1. <em>Walker\u2019s Murder Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"AtX\">a. <em>Trial testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In 1990 Walker, then 48 years old, was charged with the first degree murder of her husband Thomas (Tommy) Walker.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence of the events preceding Walker\u2019s shooting of Thomas was largely undisputed: On May 13, 1990, after Walker and Thomas returned home from drinking at a local bar, Thomas pointed a shotgun at Walker and told her, \u201c[Tjoday will be your last goddamned day on this Earth.\u201d Walker fled the house and reported her husband\u2019s threat to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. After trying unsuccessfully to speak to Thomas, Deputy Sheriff Dennis Miller told Walker to stay away from the house until her husband had sobered up and settled down. He handed her a business card and instructed her to call the number on the card if there were any more problems. If Walker needed anything from the house, Miller advised her to get it when her husband was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Walker waited several hours until Thomas had left the house. After she confirmed Thomas had again gone to a bar, Walker returned to the house to get her clothes, money and blood pressure medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>According to the People\u2019s case, after Walker returned home on the evening of May 13, 1990, she called the number listed on Deputy Miller\u2019s business card. Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Joseph Hartshome answered the telephone. Hartshome testified that Walker calmly identified herself, gave her address and then said, \u201cI need help. I\u2019m going to kill my husband.\u201d Hartshome heard no urgency in Walker\u2019s voice. Walker told Hartshome she \u201cwas tired of it\u201d; she had a \u201c.25 or something\u201d gun; and, as soon as her husband came through the door, she intended to shoot him. While he was trying to determine the nature of Walker\u2019s problem, Hartshome heard Walker say, in a comparatively mshed tone but without any hint of panic, \u201cHe\u2019s coming through the door.\u201d Two or three seconds later, Hartshome heard a single gunshot. Other than the gunshot, Hartshome did not hear any loud noise, a plea for help or arguing. After the gunshot Walker returned to the phone and in a more \u201chyper\u201d tone told Hartshome, \u201cThere, I did it. I shot him\u201d and will \u201cshoot him again\u201d if he gets up. She also requested Hartshome call the paramedics. When the police arrived at the home, they found a .25-caliber automatic pistol on the floor along with an instruction manual for the gun.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Teresa Armstrong, a friend of Walker\u2019s daughter, testified that in April 1990 Walker had revealed \u201cher problems with Thomas\u201d and explained she could not leave him because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of money involved.\u201d According to Armstrong, Walker had said if there were any way she could kill her husband she would.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Walker testified in her own defense and insisted the shooting was an accident. She explained that, as Deputy Miller had instructed, she waited for Thomas to leave the house, then returned to retrieve her blood pressure medicine, intending to stay with her adult daughter at the daughter\u2019s home. When she heard her husband arrive home, Walker, recalling Thomas\u2019s earlier threat, was afraid and called the number listed on Deputy Miller\u2019s card. Detective Hartshome told her Deputy Miller was not there. Walker informed Hartshome of her husband\u2019s earlier threats and told him, \u201cI am afraid. Please get somebody here. I know he is going to kill me and I can\u2019t get away. He knows I am here.\u201d In response to Hartshome\u2019s inquiry whether she had a gun, Walker told him she had a \u201c.25 gauge shotgun that I hid in the closet,\u201d referring to the weapon Thomas had pointed at her earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">According to Walker, Hartshome did not seem to understand the urgency of her telephone call; at times it appeared he was preoccupied and not listening to her. When her husband came in the house, she began to cry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>said, \u201cTommy, I have the police on the phone.\u201d Thomas responded, \u201cThat will be your last fucking phone call, bitch.\u201d Before she knew it, Thomas had thrown a box on the table. When the lid popped up and Walker saw the box contained a small handgun, she reached for it, not to use the gun herself but to prevent Thomas from getting it. Thomas grabbed her hand at the same time, and the gun discharged. Walker repeatedly insisted she did not intend to shoot Thomas. After the gun fired, she tried to get Thomas to stand up, but he did not move. Walker then returned to the telephone, told Hartshome she had shot her husband and asked him to please call the paramedics.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Walker also described in her trial testimony the years of physical and emotional abuse she had suffered during her marriage, explaining that Thomas would become physically and verbally abusive whenever he drank alcohol. Walker detailed several episodes of domestic violence she had endured and testified she had left Thomas several times, but always returned to him after he promised things would be better and he would curtail his alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">b. <em>The trial court\u2019s instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The trial court fully instructed the jury on first degree and second degree murder and\u2014notwithstanding the People\u2019s argument the killing could only be a premeditated, first degree murder and the defense theory it was accidental, justifiable homicide\u2014also instructed on voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter and true (or complete) self-defense, as well as excusable homicide caused by accident and misfortune. (See CALJIC No. 5.00.) The court\u2019s general instruction defining voluntary manslaughter included a reference to both sudden quarrel/heat of passion and imperfect self-defense (see CALJIC No. 8.40 [distinguishing murder and voluntary manslaughter]),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it provided several additional instructions regarding sudden quarrel, heat of passion and provocation (see CALJIC Nos. 8.42, 8.43, 8.44), as well as explaining the imperfect-self-defense theory of voluntary manslaughter. In particular, the court properly instructed the jury that fear alone is not sufficient to constitute the heat of passion referred to in the law of manslaughter (see CALJIC No. 8.44), and further advised the jury that an actual, subjective belief in the need to defend oneself negates malice even if a reasonable person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the same situation seeing and knowing the same facts would not have believed there existed any imminent peril to life.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">c. <em>Closing argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Consistent with their theories of the case, neither the prosecutor nor Walker\u2019s counsel addressed at any length the lesser included offenses described in the court\u2019s instructions. The prosecutor dismissed the possibility of a guilty verdict on voluntary manslaughter by telling the jury, \u201cThis case is not about manslaughter .... It is about first degree murder or excusable homicide. . . . The reason it is that, ladies and gentlemen, is because manslaughter doesn\u2019t apply. Voluntary manslaughter doesn\u2019t apply. Certainly, under the People\u2019s version, which you\u2019re aware of, but even under the defense version because Mrs. Walker at no time does she\u2014is it her claim that she intended to kill Mr. Walker, that she intended to pull that trigger in fear of imminent peril or self-defense or anything else. Her claim is that she struggled with him over that gun in that fear but that the gun went off accidentally so that\u2019s excusable homicide. At no time are you being told even by the defense that she intended to kill Mr. Walker. Therefore, voluntary manslaughter even under the defense version is not present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">For his part defense counsel focused exclusively on Walker\u2019s claim the shooting was accidental, insisting Walker \u201cis not guilty of any crime ... no lesser includeds. She\u2019s not guilty.\u201d Defense counsel did not discuss the possibility of the jury finding Walker guilty of voluntary manslaughter because, even accepting the People\u2019s theory that Walker had waited for Thomas to come into the house and intentionally shot him, the People had failed to prove she was not acting in the honest, albeit unreasonable, belief Thomas intended to kill her. Indeed, Walker\u2019s trial counsel actually argued her defense of accident (justification) was factually inconsistent with any claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">d. <em>The jury\u2019s verdict and sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">On February 11, 1991, after four days of deliberation, the jury found Walker guilty of second degree murder. The jury also found true the special allegation Walker had personally used a firearm in the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>offense. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a).) A supplemental probation report prepared for sentencing stated, \u201cThe victim [Thomas Walker] appears to have been an initiator, willing participant, aggressor or provoker of the incident,\u201d and the offense does not appear to be \u201ccharacteristic of the defendant\u2019s [Walker\u2019s] behavior. Indeed, it appears to have been the tragic result of the victim\u2019s abusive use of alcohol, and the defendant\u2019s inability to get immediate and lasting assistance to enable her to deal with her husband\u2019s angry, volatile, hostile and threatening behavior.\u201d The report concluded, \u201cThe court might well find this to be an unusual case, and determine that state prison is not warranted.\u201d The trial court at sentencing stated Walker was ineligible for probation but observed it would not grant probation even if it had the statutory authority to do so. The court then imposed an aggregate state prison term of 19 years to life, 15 years to life for the murder plus the middle term of four years for the firearm-use enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">2. <em>Walker\u2019s Prior Habeas Corpus Petitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">a. <em>The 1992 state court petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In her direct appeal to this court from the judgment of conviction for second degree murder, Walker argued she was denied the effective assistance of counsel \u201cdue to her counsel\u2019s failure to develop and present battered wife syndrome evidence to support her self defense.\u201d At the time Walker filed her reply brief she also filed in this court a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which reiterated her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and which included a declaration from her trial counsel asserting he had been wrong not to present expert testimony on intimate partner battering and now believed it was relevant to her claim she had grabbed for the gun in self-defense. Trial counsel explained he had been suffering from a serious abdominal infection during the trial and his mind had been primarily on his illness. The petition also included a psychological report, prepared in May 1992, from Dr. Lenore Walker, a leading expert on the psychological effects of intimate partner battering (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 892, 899 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 447, 94 P.3d 574]), who had interviewed Walker for 12 hours following her conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">We considered Walker\u2019s petition together with her appeal and, in an opinion authored by Presiding Justice Mildred Lillie, affirmed the judgment and denied the petition, concluding Walker\u2019s counsel had not been constitutionally ineffective under the standard articulated by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052]. <em>(Walker I, supra, </em>B058840.) Presiding Justice Lillie explained the decision to forgo expert testimony on the psychological effects of intimate partner battering was an inherently tactical one, prompted by Walker\u2019s claim the shooting had been an accident. Recognizing expert testimony would have assisted Walker had she claimed she intentionally shot Thomas because she believed he would kill her, and acknowledging such expert testimony may have bolstered Walker\u2019s assertions as to her subjective fear of her husband, we held the testimony was not relevant to Walker\u2019s claim the shooting was an accident and, as counsel feared, would have undermined Walker\u2019s own testimony as to how the shooting had transpired by suggesting Walker had a motive to murder her husband. Alternatively, we held that reversal on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel was not required because, having disbelieved Walker and rejected her claim of accident, there was no reasonable probability the jury would have reached a more favorable result had it heard expert testimony concerning intimate partner battering and its effects. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. 668.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">b. <em>Walker\u2019s federal court petitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On November 23, 1993 Walker filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in propria persona in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, challenging her conviction on the ground her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony on the psychological effects of intimate partner battering. On July 19, 1994 the petition was denied without prejudice because it was in improper form. An amended petition was denied in August 1994 on the ground it was filed after the 20-day period authorized by the July 19, 1994 order. A new petition filed later that month was denied in May 1996 for failure to exhaust state court remedies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Walker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>subsequent petition for writ of habeas corpus to the California Supreme Court was denied on January 28, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">On March 10, 1997 Walker filed a new petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel for, among other things, failure to provide expert testimony on intimate partner battering. On June 30, 1999 the federal district court denied the petition, adopting the findings and recommendations of the federal magistrate, whose reasoning echoed the analysis in our 1992 opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">3. <em>The Initial Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to Section 1473.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On September 23, 2003 Walker filed a new petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Los Angeles Superior Court based on section 1473.5, which authorizes the prosecution of a writ of habeas corpus on the ground expert testimony as to intimate partner battering and its effects was not introduced into evidence at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial and, had it been received, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability, sufficient to undermine confidence in the judgment of conviction, that the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">On April 1, 2004 the superior court (Hon. David S. Wesley) denied the petition on two grounds: First, the court cited section 1473.5, subdivision (c), which provides the denial of a prior habeas corpus petition because the omission of expert testimony relating to intimate partner battering and its effects was not prejudicial is a ground for denial of a section 1473.5 petition. Second, the court concluded, as had we in 1992 and the federal district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>more recently, the \u201cevidence is irrelevant in light of petitioner\u2019s claims at trial that she accidentally shot and killed her husband during a struggle for the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">4. <em>The Instant Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Based on Section 1473.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On April 28, 2006 Walker filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus contending the failure to provide expert testimony as to the psychological effects of intimate partner battering prejudiced her defense and entitles her to a new trial under section 1473.5. As she did in all of her prior petitions, Walker attached to the instant petition the psychological report (prepared in 1992) of Dr. Lenore Walker. Dr. Walker had administered several psychological tests to Walker following her conviction and concluded from those results and her extended interview with Walker that Walker was a \u201cbattered woman\u201d who lived for years in an abusive relationship and suffered from \u201c \u2018battered woman syndrome\u2019... a subcategory of post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d Dr. Walker stated that, had she been called as an expert witness at Walker\u2019s murder trial, she would have testified that women like Walker either are or perceive themselves to be in imminent danger in circumstances like those Walker described.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Walker also attached her own declaration relating her history of being victimized by Thomas, as well as other men in her fife, and asserting, consistent with her trial testimony, she had reached for the gun in self-defense because she feared Thomas was going to use it to kill her and that, when she did, the gun accidentally discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">After requesting and receiving informal briefing from the People on the matter, on September 28, 2006 we issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted. The People filed their return, and Walker filed her traverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">1. <em>The Admissibility of Expert Testimony on the Effects of Intimate Partner Battering and Section 1473.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">a. <em>The nature and effects of intimate partner battering</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The effects of intimate partner battering, frequently, albeit inartfully, referred to as \u201cbattered women\u2019s syndrome,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> have been defined as \u201c \u2018 \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>series of common characteristics that appear in women [or men] who are abused physically and psychologically over an extended period of time by the dominant male [or female] figure in their lives.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Humphrey, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 1083-1084; see also <em>People v. Romero </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 728, 735, fn. 1 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 270, 883 P.2d 388] [the effects of intimate partner battering manifest as \u201c \u2018a \u201cpattern of responses and perceptions presumed to be characteristic of women who have been subjected to continuous physical abuse by their mate[s],\u201d \u2019 \u201d quoting Note, <em>Battered Women Who Kill Their Abusers </em>(1993) 106 Harv. L.Rev. 1574)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">From a legal perspective, evidence of intimate partner battering and its psychological effects can reduce an intentional killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter by negating the element of malice. <em>(Humphrey, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 1086 [expert testimony on effects of intimate battering is relevant to support imperfect self-defense\u2014that defendant genuinely but unreasonably believed she was in imminent danger of serious bodily injury].) Such expert testimony can also support a defendant\u2019s theory of justifiable homicide or true self-defense by enabling the jury to find the battered woman or man \u201c \u2018is particularly able to predict accurately the likely extent of violence in any attack,\u2019 \u201d information that could \u201c \u2018significantly affect the jury\u2019s evaluation of the <em>reasonableness </em>of defendant\u2019s fear for her[or his] life. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also Judicial Council of Cal. Crim. Jury Instns. (2006) CALCRIM No. 851.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">b. <em>Evidence Code section 1107</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">For many years criminal defendants accused of committing violent crimes against their batterers were either denied the ability to use, or did not fully perceive the persuasive force of, expert testimony to assist the trier of fact in understanding the psychological effects of intimate partner battering to negate the malice element of murder. To address that ongoing problem, the Legislature added section 1107 to the Evidence Code, effective January 1, 1992, expressly authorizing the admission of expert testimony regarding intimate partner battering and its effects. (See Stats. 1991, ch. 812, \u00a7 1, pp. 3612-3613; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 902 [\u201ctrial courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>often continued to exclude\u201d expert evidence on intimate partner battering and its effects; accordingly, \u201cthe Legislature in 1991 enacted [Evidence Code] section 1107 to ensure the admissibility of expert evidence on domestic violence\u201d].) As one of the authors of the legislation to add Evidence Code section 1107 explained, \u201cThis bill is necessary to ensure that all relevant evidence is admitted in a criminal case. Although there is case law that suggests that this testimony should be admissible, the great majority of judges exclude it. The measure is merely intended to allow a jury to consider all the evidence in a particular case.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 785 (1991-1992 Reg.

Nonetheless, courts ordinarily will not reconsider the merits of issues raised and determined in prior habeas corpus proceedings absent a change in the facts or law substantially affecting the petitioner\u2019s rights. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 769 [\u201c \u2018It is the policy of this court to deny an application for habeas corpus which is based upon grounds urged in a prior petition which has been denied, where there is shown no change in the facts or the law substantially affecting the rights of the petitioner.

This general principle is incorporated in section 1473.5, subdivision (c), which provides \u201cit is grounds for denial\u201d of a new petition under this section if a prior habeas corpus petition has been denied because omission at trial of expert testimony on intimate partner battering and its effects \u201cwas not prejudicial and did not entitle the petitioner to the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">As the superior court found in denying Walker\u2019s section 1473.5 petition, our 1992 decision affirming Walker\u2019s conviction on direct appeal and denying her concurrently filed petition for writ of habeas corpus asserting ineffective assistance of counsel held not only that the decision of Walker\u2019s trial counsel to forgo expert testimony on intimate partner battering was inherently tactical\u2014to avoid putting on an inconsistent defense that would have undermined Walker\u2019s claim the shooting was an accident\u2014but also that counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tactical decision was not prejudicial. Ordinarily, under section 1473.5, subdivision (c), that finding of lack of prejudice would be a sufficient ground to deny the instant petition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">However, as the Attorney General recognizes, the legislative authorization to deny a section 1473.5 petition on the ground a prior habeas corpus petition was denied for lack of prejudice is permissive, not mandatory. Section 1473.5, subdivision (c), does not state the new petition shall or must be denied on that basis. (See <em>People v. Loeun </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 1, 9 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 947 P.2d 1313] [\u201c \u2018In interpreting statutes, we follow the Legislature\u2019s intent, as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law\u2019 \u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Farell </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 381, 386 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 603, 48 P.3d 1155] [best indication of legislative intent appears in the language of the enactment]; <em>People v.

(See <em>Day v.

For example, in introducing the legislation that would become section 1473.5, Senator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Kamette stated the statute was purposefully directed to those whose prior habeas corpus petitions based on ineffective assistance of counsel were denied in an atmosphere when intimate partner battering and its implications were not well understood: \u201cThere is simply no reason to penalize women who had a good defense to killing their abusive spouses simply because at the time their convictions became final, the factual basis for the defense was so little understood that the courts are not willing to fault trial counsel for not presenting it.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 799 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 23, 2001.) In addition, when section 1473.5 was amended in 2004 to change \u201cbattered women\u2019s syndrome\u201d to \u201cintimate partner battering and its effects,\u201d the legislative counsel observed, \u201cExisting law makes it a ground[] for denial of a new petition that a court determined on the merits of a prior petition for a writ of habeas corpus that the omission of evidence relating to battered wom[e]n\u2019s syndrome at trial was not prejudicial and did not entitle the petitioner to the writ of habeas corpus, [f] This bill would <em>permit </em>this denial if the court found that the omission of expert testimony relating to battered women\u2019s syndrome or battering and its effects at trial was not prejudicial and did not entitle the petitioner to the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d (Legis.

In <em>Barton </em>the defendant fatally shot the victim during a confrontation in a parking lot after the victim had threatened to run the defendant\u2019s daughter\u2019s automobile off the road. The defendant claimed he had seen a knife in the victim\u2019s hand, displayed his own semiautomatic pistol (which he was legally carrying) to hold the victim for the police, but then fired reflexively (that is, accidentally) while stepping backward to avoid the victim\u2019s threatening movement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 192-193.) On appeal from his conviction for voluntary manslaughter, the defendant argued the trial court had erred in instructing the jury, sua sponte and over his objection, with the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter based on evidence in the People\u2019s case that a heated argument had preceded the shooting and that he had intentionally shot the victim to defend himself. Disapproving <em>People v. Wickersham, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at page 329 (because unreasonable self-defense is a defense and not a lesser included offense, trial court has no obligation to instruct sua sponte on imperfect self-defense), and reaffirming its earlier pronouncements in <em>People v. Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913],<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the court held that, so long as there is evidence, whether in the People\u2019s case or in the defense case or both, from which a jury could infer the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, whether based on heat of passion or imperfect self-defense, the voluntary manslaughter instruction must be given, even when it is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s own theory of the case, and the defendant asks, as a matter of trial strategy, the instruction not be given. <em>(Barton, </em>at pp. 201, 202-204.) In reaching this conclusion, the court made clear that imperfect self-defense is not a defense at all, but rather a lesser included offense to murder. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Barton, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 186, thus establishes that, so long as there is substantial evidence from which a jury can find imperfect self-defense and thereby reduce a murder to voluntary manslaughter, the jury must be given that opportunity, even if imperfect self-defense is inconsistent with a defendant\u2019s theory of the case and directly at odds with the defendant\u2019s testimony describing how the crime occurred. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 201-202 [jury could reasonably discount defendant\u2019s self-serving testimony that gun had accidentally discharged and conclude killing occurred in unreasonable but good faith belief that defendant had to defend himself];<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> see also <em>People v. Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 163, fn. 10 [\u201csubstantial evidence of heat of passion and unreasonable self-defense may exist, and the duty to instruct sua sponte may therefore arise, even when the defendant claims that the killing was accidental, or that the states of mind on which these theories depend were absent\u201d].) Accordingly, if the People have charged the defendant with murder, whatever the defendant\u2019s theory of the case and whatever her testimony, evidence that the defendant may have acted in the actual belief in the need for self-defense is relevant; and, if such evidence has been presented, it is the People\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant committed murder rather than voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The foundation for our 1992 denial of Walker\u2019s habeas corpus petition on the ground of no prejudice was further eroded the year after <em>Barton </em>by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Humphrey, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pages 1086 through 1087, which construed Evidence Code section 1107 and held expert testimony concerning intimate partner battering and its effects is relevant not only to the defendant\u2019s credibility but also to the determination of both the subjective existence and objective reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s belief in the need to defend herself or himself. Thus, even though Walker testified the gun fired accidentally, she also testified that, because of prior beatings by her husband and his threat to kill her earlier that day, she feared for her life when he reentered their home on the evening of May 13, 1990. Under <em>Humphrey </em>expert testimony concerning \u201cthe nature and effect of physical, emotional, or mental abuse on the beliefs, perceptions, or behavior of victims of domestic violence\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1107, subd. (a)) would have assisted the jury in assessing the nature and extent of that fear and permitted it to properly apply the trial court\u2019s instructions on murder and voluntary manslaughter, including its instructions on imperfect self-defense, to the testimony not only of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Walker herself but also of Detective Hartshome concerning the telephone conversation he had with Walker when the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">c. <em>A reasonable probability exists that, if presented with the expert testimony on intimate partner battering and its effects, the jury would have found Walker guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">As discussed, the People\u2019s case against Walker rested on its theory, supported primarily by Detective Hartshome\u2019s testimony, that Walker armed herself with a handgun, waited for Thomas to reenter the home and then intentionally shot him. In convicting Walker of second degree murder, the jury disbelieved Walker\u2019s defense that the shooting was an accident. However, the jury also rejected the People\u2019s assertion\u2014fully supported by the evidence\u2014that, if the shooting was not an accident, it had to be premeditated murder. Had the jury heard not only Walker\u2019s own description of her years of domestic abuse at the hands of Thomas but also expert testimony as to the effects of intimate partner battering, it may well have found that, while the shooting was intentional, it was the result of a genuine (if not reasonable) fear for her imminent safety. Dr. Walker\u2019s report explains she would have testified that persons battered by their intimate partners suffer from something akin to posttraumatic stress disorder, which escalates after each beating, such that, whether or not in imminent danger, the battered partner genuinely feels he or she must kill the batterer in order to save his or her own life.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Faced with expert testimony that would have directly rebutted the People\u2019s theory that Walker did not kill Thomas out of fear and would not have stayed with him had she actually feared him,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> there is a reasonable probability, notwithstanding the jury\u2019s rejection of Walker\u2019s accident theory, the jury would have found her guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The 1991 judgment of conviction is vacated, and Hudie Joyce Walker is remanded to the superior court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Johnson, J., and Woods, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">On March 6, 2007, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\"> Although often referred to as \u201cbattered women\u2019s syndrome,\u201d \u201cintimate partner battering and its effects\u201d is the more accurate and now preferred term.
