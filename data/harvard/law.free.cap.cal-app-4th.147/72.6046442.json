J.</author>\n<p id=\"An\">The question on this appeal is whether a lawsuit challenging a federal savings and loan association\u2019s prepayment penalty formula is preempted by the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act (HOLA) and the regulations promulgated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 et seq.; 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 560.2, 560.34 (2007)). Our answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">In July 2003, Mitchell Weiss (and others included in our references to Weiss) borrowed about $4 million from Washington Mutual Bank and signed two 10-year promissory notes\u2014one for $1.175 million plus interest at 5.33 percent per annum and with monthly payments of $6,546.74 (secured by real property in Los Angeles), the other for $2.85 million plus interest at 5.33 percent per annum and with monthly payments of $15,879.32 (secured by real property in Beverly Hills). A prepayment addendum to each note set forth a formula for calculating the \u201cprepayment premium\u201d due in the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Weiss prepaid his obligations under the notes. Weiss negotiated the loans with Jeffrey Monahan, a Washington Mutual loan officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">When Weiss read the prepayment addenda, he believed the prepayment penalty would be \u201cbelow two percent\u201d of the unpaid balance or, if higher than 2 percent, only by a \u201csmall margin.\u201d In fact, the addenda provided for a prepayment penalty of up to 10 percent of the unpaid balance (depending on the time of prepayment). In October and November 2004, Weiss prepaid both notes, including prepayment penalties of roughly 10 percent of the unpaid balances ($286,740.35 on the $2.85 million loan, and $116,509.98 on the $1,175 million loan).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In January 2005, Weiss sued Washington Mutual and Monahan for fraud, unlawful restraint on alienation of real property, unfair and deceptive business practices, and unjust enrichment, alleging that Washington Mutual had not disclosed that the prepayment penalty formula could yield a penalty rate as high as 10 percent of the unpaid balance of the loan, that he would not have borrowed from Washington Mutual had he not been misled, and that the prepayment penalty placed an exorbitant burden on the property used to secure the loans and constituted an unfair business practice. Weiss sought damages, restitution, reformation, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Washington Mutual and Monahan answered, then moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that Weiss\u2019s complaint is preempted by federal law, HOLA and the regulations promulgated by the OTS. (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 et seq.; 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 560.2, 560.34 (2007).) Over Weiss\u2019s opposition, the motion was granted without leave to amend, and Weiss now appeals from the judgment thereafter entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Weiss contends his claims are not preempted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">OTS has the exclusive authority to regulate the operations of federal savings associations such as Washington Mutual (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2 (2007); <em>Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. De La Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 144-145 [73 L.Ed.2d 664, 102 S.Ct. 3014]) and with Congress\u2019s authoriza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tion (12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1463(a), 1464(a)) has preempted any state law that even incidentally affects prepayment penalties (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(b)(5) (2007) [\u201cthe types of state laws preempted . . . include . . . state laws purporting to impose requirements regarding ...[!]... [f] [l]oan-related fees, including . . . prepayment penalties\u201d]; 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.34 (2007) [authorizing prepayment fees]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Because all of Weiss\u2019s claims against Washington Mutual seek relief that if granted would necessarily impose requirements on Washington Mutual\u2019s prepayment penalty provisions, all of those claims are preempted. <em>(Meyers v. Beverly Hills Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 499 F.2d 1145, 1147 [in a class action challenging prepayment provisions as invalid liquidated damage clauses, holding that federal law preempts the field of prepayments of real estate loans \u201cso that any California law in the area is inapplicable to federal savings and loan associations operating within California\u201d]; see also <em>Washington Mutual Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 606, 610 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 765]; <em>Stoneking v. Bank of America, N.A. </em>(2002) 2002 NMCA 42 [132 N.M. 79, 43 P.3d 1089, 1091]; <em>Silvas </em>v. <em>E*Trade Mortg. Corp. </em>(S.D.Cal. 2006) 421 F.Supp.2d 1315, 1321; <em>National Home Equity Mortg. Ass\u2019n v. Face </em>(E.D.Va. 1999) 64 F.Supp.2d 584, 590, affd. (4th Cir. 2001) 239 F.3d 633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">To avoid this conclusion, Weiss contends his claims against Washington Mutual and, in particular, his fraud claim against Monahan are exempt from HOLA\u2019s preemption because they \u201conly incidentally affect [Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Mutual\u2019s] lending operations ... or are otherwise consistent with the purposes\u201d of HOLA. (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(c) (2007).) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Although 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2(c) (2007) exempts state tort laws that only incidentally affect the lending operations of federally regulated institutions, the \u201cincidentally affect\u201d analysis is triggered only when dealing with an activity that is not listed in 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2(b) (2007). According to the OTS, \u201c[w]hen analyzing the status of state laws under \u00a7 560.2, the first step will be to determine whether the type of law in question is listed [among the illustrative examples of preempted state laws] in paragraph (b) [of 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2 (2007)]. <em>If so, the analysis will end there; the law is preempted. . . . Any doubt should be resolved in favor of </em>preemption.\u201d (61 Fed.Reg. 50951, 50966-50967 (Sept. 30, 1996), italics added.) It is only if the law is not covered by paragraph (b) that the inquiry continues to determine whether the particular state law affects lending. (61 Fed.Reg. at pp. 50966-50967.) As noted above and in footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>prepayment penalty provisions are listed among the illustrations in 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2(b) (2007). For this reason, our inquiry ends here (and we thus do not discuss Weiss\u2019s contention that the relief he seeks would not affect Washington Mutual\u2019s \u201coperations\u201d or \u201clending activities\u201d). (See <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Washington Mut. Bank </em>(2004) 369 N.J. Super. 456 [849 A.2d 566, 572] [tort action preempted because it sought injunctive relief and money damages that would have inserted a form of state regulation by compelling a different type of billing statement disclosure].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>We reject Weiss\u2019s suggestion that his claim against Monahan is unaffected by the preemption doctrine. Weiss\u2019s complaint expressly alleges that Monahan was at all relevant times acting solely within the course and scope of his employment by Washington Mutual and not for any personal purpose. He thus cannot be personally liable to Weiss <em>(Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund v. ESIS, Inc. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1148, 1163 [251 Cal.Rptr. 693]), and stands in the same shoes as his employer <em>(Shoemaker v. Myers </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 25 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054]; <em>Black v. Bank of America </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1, 6 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 725]; <em>Shaw v. Hughes Aircraft Co. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1347 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 446]). In short, claims preempted as against the employer are necessarily preempted against the employee who acted within the course and scope of his employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We summarily reject Weiss\u2019s contention that the trial court should have granted him leave to amend his complaint. He did not tell the trial court, and he has not told us, what allegations he could add that would possibly salvage his complaint from Washington Mutual\u2019s claim of preemption. Under these circumstances, leave to amend would not accomplish anything.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The judgment is affirmed.

OTS intends to give federal savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their lending powers in accordance with a uniform federal scheme of regulation. Accordingly, federal savings associations may extend credit as authorized under federal law . . . without regard to state laws purporting to regulate or otherwise affect their credit activities, except to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this section or \u00a7 560.110 of this part.

The opinion is irrelevant because it is based on the assumption that the allegedly fraudulent conduct is not covered by the illustrations in 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2(b) (2007). It is only when the conduct is unrelated to a subdivision (b) illustration that the OTS or a court will consider whether a state statute\u2019s prohibition on deception has a measurable effect on lending operations. (See <em>Fenning v. Glenfed, Inc. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1289-1290 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 715] [where the gravamen of the complaint was a challenge to Glenfed\u2019s general advertising and sales practices]; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>World Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1294, 1303 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 19] [where the lawsuit challenged World\u2019s \u201cforced order insurance\u201d practices, which the court said were not listed in subd.

There are at least two problems with the Attorney General\u2019s position. First, the case relied on by the Attorney General, <em>McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1484 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 227], does not consider the express preemptions found in subdivision (b) of 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2 (2007) <em>(McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 1496, fn. 4, (dis. opn. of Vogel, J.)) and thus offers no authority for the conclusion proposed by the Attorney General in this case. <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1182, 1195 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 969 P.2d 613] [a case is not authority for a proposition not considered].) The case that <em>is </em>on point is <em>Washington Mutual Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 95 </em>Cal.App.4th at pages 620-621, in which Division Two of our court held that an action under the UCL challenging pre-closing interest charges on home loans was expressly preempted by 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2(b) (2007). (See also <em>Silvas v. E*Trade Mortg. Corp., supra, </em>421 F.Supp.2d at p. 1321.) Second, the presumption against preemptive intent relied on by the Attorney General is irrelevant in light of the express statement of preemptive intent found in 12 Code of Federal Regulations part \u00a7 560.2(b) (2007). <em>(Cipollone v.
