That part of section 2759, of the Revised Statutes, regulating returns for taxation of unincorporated banks and bankers, which provides that from the aggregate sum of the first five items therein enumerated, the county auditor shall deduct the aggregate sum of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and such portions of the eighth items as are by law exempt from taxation, is not repugnant to either section 2, or section 3, of article 12, of the constitution, except to the extent of including the entire third item among those from which the deduction is to be made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>2.

That part of section 2759, Revised Statutes, which assumes to require county auditors, in levying taxes, yearly, upon unincorporated banks and bankers, to deduct the aggregate sum of (1) the amount of their deposits, (2) the average amount of their accounts, exclusive of current deposit accounts, and (3) the amount of their real estate at its assessed value, <em>from the aggregate sum of </em>(1) the average amount; of notes and bills receivable, discounted, or purchased, in the course of business, by such unincorporated banks or bankers, and considered good and collectible, (2) the average amount of their accounts receivable, (3) the average amount of their cash and cash items in possession or in transit, (4) the average amount of all kinds of stock, bonds,, or evidences of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>debtedness, held by them as an investment, or in any way representing their assets, and (5) the amount of their real estate at its assessed value, \u2014 contravenes the 3d section of Article XII. of the constitution of this state, and is, therefore, void. <em>Ellis &amp; Morton </em>v. <em>Linck &amp; </em>Thomas, 3 Ohio St. 66; <em>Exchange Bank of Columbus </em>v.

That part of section 2759, Revised Statutes, which assumes to permit and provide for deductions in levying taxes, annually, upon the notes and bills discounted or purchased, moneys loaned, and all other property, effects, or dues, of every description, of banks and bankers, (Art. XII., sec. 3,) may be treated as void, without affecting the validity of the remainder of the section. <em>Exchange Bank of Columbus </em>v. <em>Hines, Treasurer, Ellis &amp; Morton </em>v. <em>Linck &amp; Thomas; </em>before cited, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>2 Blackf.; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McBirr, </em>1 Gray 1, 21; <em>Steele </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 Blackf. 110; <em>Tillman </em>v. <em>Cocke, </em>9 Baxter 429; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>27 Kan. 314; <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>119 Ill. 118. The grounds and reasons upon which the tax law of April 13, 1852, was held to be valid in all its parts excepting the 10th section, are exactly applicable to this case, and must govern it. <em>Shotwell </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>45 Ohio St. 632, 645, 646; <em>Ellis Morton </em>v. <em>Linck &amp; Thomas, </em>3 Ohio St. 66; <em>Champaign County Bank </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>7 Ohio St. 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\">3. If it should be held that the county auditor ought to have deducted the amount of the 8th item of the return of the property of the defendant in error for taxation, his failure to do so does not render the entire levy void, nor prevent a recovery by the treasurer for that part of the taxes assessed against the defendant in error which is legal. In an action to recover a judgment for taxes, a recovery may be had of a part which is found to be legal, if the court can ascertain, by computation, how much is legal. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Peoria R. R. Co., </em>44 Ill. 85; <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>103 U. S. 732; <em>State, Railroad Tax Cases, </em>92 U. S. 575.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>4. The county auditor had authority, and it was his duty, under section 1038 of the Revised Statutes, to correct the error in the amount of taxes assessed against the defendant in error upon the then current duplicate, resulting from the erroneous deduction from the taxable property of the defendant in error, as shown by their return of their taxable property to him for taxation, every fact necessary to enable him to make the correction appearing on the face of the return. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. Cappellar, 38 Ohio St. 560; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>31 Ohio St. 271; Section 1038 Revised Statutes. <em>The Stark County Bank </em>v. <em>McGregor, auditor, etc., </em>6 Ohio St. 45; <em>Latimer et al. </em>v. <em>Morgan et al., </em>Id., 279, 280; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>7 Ohio St. 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\">5. The determination of this cause involves only the question whether unincorporated banks and bankers are entitled, under the third section of article XII., of the constitution of this state, to make deductions from any of their property in returning the same for taxation. No question is presented as to the taxation of persons who are not bankers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-6\"><em>J. J. Harper, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-7\">1. The contention of the plaintiff is, that that part of section 2759 of the Revised Statutes which requires the auditor to deduct certain items therein named from the aggregate sum of the first five items therein named, is unconstitutional and void; and that the auditor at his pleasure can so declare. This position, it is claimed, is. supported by the cases in the 3d Ohio State, of the <em>Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>and <em>Ellis &amp; Morton </em>v. <em>Linck. </em>We do not think' those cases support the position taken. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>37 Ohio St. 125. In both the cases, relied upon by counsel for plaintiff, the attempt was made to deduct debts and liabilities from moneys and credits, under the authority of the 10th section of the act of 1852. The court in both cases decided that as the law then stood this could not be done. Property employed in the business of banking was to bear a burden ot taxation equal to that imposed upon other property \u2014 not less and certainly not more. If individuals may deduct their debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>and liabilities from tbeir credits so may the banks. That is equality, and the constitution and the law undertake to provide for equality of taxation. <em>Hines Case, </em>8 Ohio St. 21, 22, 23; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>13 Ohio St. 296; <em>Stark County Bank </em>v. <em>McGregor, </em>6 Ohio St. 46. The legislature has passed a law for ascertaining the value of property employed in banking. It is the scheme set forth in section 2759 of the Revised Statutes, as amended and supplemented in Yol. 79, Ohio Laws, page 109. Why is it not competent for the legislature to so enact ? Who shall question its power to ascertain the value of property employed in banking in this way ? We therefore submit that the objection made to section 2759 is not well taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-5\">2. But if it were objectionable, as claimed, don\u2019t the whole scheme fail ? Who can say that the legislature would have adopted the scheme in part only \u2014 such as the auditor thinks is valid \u2014 if the balance of the section is to be rejected? To hold as the auditor claims, would be, it seems to me, to hold that the auditor, or the court shall do what is clearly remitted to the legislature by the constitution \u2014 that is, to determine the method of ascertaining the value of property employed in banking. Section 10 of the tax law of 1852 did not interfere with the law in Section XIX. and XX. for ascertaining the value of property employed in banking. It stood as an independent section, in no way interfering with, the scheme for finding value. For the reasons above stated the supreme court held that section to be invalid. That could be done and yet leave as a consistent whole, the law for fixing value, as found in Sections XIX. and XX. But we think that the last clause of 2759 cannot be declared invalid and be stricken out without destroying the whole section, and thus leave us without any law for the taxation of unincorporated banks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-6\">3. Admitting the invalidity of the last clause of section 2759, it leaves for determination the question as to the power of the auditor to correct the difficulty. Can he do it ? Is it the correction of a mere clerical error or mistake ? Is it not rather a fundamental infirmity that courts only correct when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>clearly constrained to that course of action ? As to the power of the auditor in such matters, see section 1038, Revised Statutes, <em>State </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>31 Ohio St. 271; <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Cappellar, </em>38 Ohio St. 273.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-5\">4. The constitution and the laws undertake to tax banks, only on the money and property employed in the business of banking. Const., art. 12, sec. 3; <em>Hines Case, </em>3 State 3; <em>Stark County Bank </em>v. <em>McGregor, </em>6 Ohio St. 47, 48; <em>Robinson et. al. </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>13 Ohio St. 294; <em>Wagoner </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>37 Ohio St. 571; The Tax Law of 1852, Swan\u2019s Statutes 905; Vol. 55 Ohio Law, 129; Vol. 56 Ohio Law, 201, 2, 3; Vol. 58 Ohio Law, 59; Vol. 64 Ohio Law, 205; Vol. 79 Ohio Law, 109 . The constitution prescribes the rule of taxation, and that rule is the value. But the mode or rule for ascertaining the value, is regulated by law; in other words, is left to the discretion of the legislature. See authorities cited above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-6\">5. Section 2759, complained of, is the method adopted by the legislature, for ascertaining and fixing the value of property emplqyed by banks like the defendant in error. When the value is so ascertained, there is no authority in the law for deductions of any kind; and none have been attempted to be made by the bank in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-7\">6. If a mistake was made by the bank in the return complained of, the matter should have been corrected by the board of equalization. Revised Statutes 2804-8; <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Safe Dep. Co., </em>29 Ohio St. 608; <em>Wagoner </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>37 Ohio St. 571.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-9\">7. If parts of the section complained of are unconstitutional, the whole section fails, because it is one entire scheme; and if the statute is unconstitutional, then there is no law for taxing banks like the defendant in error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hipp, </em>38 Ohio St. 230; <em>State </em>v. <em>Frame, </em>39 Ohio St. 412; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinks, </em>42 Ohio St. 346; <em>Butzman </em>v. <em>Whitbeck, </em>42 Ohio St. 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-10\">8. The power of taxation is included in the legislative power. Neither section 2 nor 3 of art. 12, contains a grant of power, but a regulation of power already granted in first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>section of the second article of the Constitution of Ohio. <em>Baker </em>v. Cincinnati, 11 Ohio St. 541, 2, 8; Const., Art. 2, sec. 1.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-5\"><em>Ace Gregg, </em>also, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-6\">1. In this case the constitutionality of a part of sec. 2759, as amended, Ohio Law, 1882, page 109, is drawn in question. It is claimed that the part of the 9th subdivision authorizing deductions is in conflict with sec. 8 of article 12, Const. The constitutionality of an act is to be determined by its operation, and not by the form it is made to assume. <em>State ex rel. Att\u2019y Gen\u2019l. </em>v. <em>The </em>Judges, 21 Ohio St. 1-11. An act of the legislature should never be declared unconstitutional if the case can be disposed of upon any other tenable grounds. <em>Irland </em>v. <em>Turnpike Co., </em>19 Ohio St. 369; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>20 Ohio St. 18-33.

The power to tax unincorporated banks is especially provided for in Revised Statutes, sec. 2758 to sec. 2761, inclusive. There being special provisions governing the taxing of this class, they are thereby withdrawn from the operation of other provisions of statute applying to other classes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-9\">4. If the subdivision of see. 2759 complained of is declared void, then I claim there is no authority conferred on auditors to place taxes against banks of this class. The constitution will not execute itself. It merely prescribes the character of law that may be passed, and until the laws are passed, the taxes cannot belevied. Fora<em>zier </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>16 Ohio St. 615-623, 624; 13 Ohio St., 293; Cooley on Taxation, page 513, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>5. In this case tbe returns were made upon blanks furnished by the auditor, and in conformity thereto. The law required the auditor to furnish blanks for that purpose. The returns were full and complete, and it has never been claimed that they were false, and the proceeding or act of the auditor in making the addition does not come within sections 2781 and 2782. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Cappeller, </em>38 Ohio St. 560.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-5\">6. The act of the auditor was not the correction of an error discovered in the tax list and duplicate. No error was claimed to exist in the tax list. The duplicate was properly made up as the law directed it should be. On this state of case the act of the auditor was something more than merely clerical. Both the cases in 31 Ohio St., 271, and 38 Ohio St., 560, limit the corrections which auditors can make under sec. 1038, to those merely clerical.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-6\"><em>Mills Gfardner, </em>also, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-7\">1. Taxation exists only as is provided by law, and without the legislation there can be no taxation. Taxes must be imposed only by the mode provided by law, and if no means have been provided, no taxes can be imposed. The law must provide for what shall be taxed, and, as well, the mode and manner. Sec. 2 of art. 12 of the constitution only declares the duty of the general assembly to provide the mode and manner of taxation, and what shall be taxed. If the general assembly does not make the necessary provisions, by law, to carry into effect this constitutional provision, it is clear no tax can be collected. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>11 Ohio St. <em>534; Bank of Toledo </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>1 Ohio St. 623. The general assembly has provided the means and manner of taxation, by Title 13 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-8\">2. The county auditor cannot place upon the duplicate, or charge taxes on \u201c credits,\u201d other than defined by law, which is the excess of dues over debts. Whether or not the term \u201c credits,\u201d as used in the constitution, means more or less than this, can make no difference. The law provides for the taxation of credits, as defined by the tax law, and no other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-9\">3. Sec. 2734, which imposes the duty on all persons to list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201c all credits due and owing them,\u201d is to list credits as defined by sec. 2730. There is no law for the listing of personal property, except as is provided in chapter 2 of the tax law. Sec. 2734 applies to individuals only, or as trustee, etc., and has no application to corporations, merchants, bankers, etc., and the manner provided by this section is very different from that provided for the listing of merchants\u2019 stocks or banks. Sec. 2740 applies only to merchants as therein defined. They are not taxed on the capital invested, but upon the average monthly value of their stock of goods for the year preceding, to be ascertained in the manner therein prescribed. The auditor cannot charge them with any other amount than is found in this manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-5\">4. Secs. 2758, 2759, 2760 and 2761 contain all the provisions of law for the taxation of incorporated banks, defines what they are, and the means and mode of taxation. The court cannot impose a duty on a bank that is not provided for in these sections. The eight several items of section 2759, which constitutes the statement a bank is required to make, ascertain just what of the bank shall be charged for taxation. The general assembly intended this as the plan or scheme of banks of this class for taxation. Changing in any manner either one of the items, or striking it out, destroys the whole scheme, and renders it impossible to carry out the legislative intent, so that the whole section must stand or fall together. If this scheme, or this means, is not in accord with the constitution, then there is no provision of law whatever for the taxation of this class of banks, and the auditor has no power or right in the matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-6\">5. Sec. 3810 confers no legislative powers upon the auditor. It only authorizes him to make corrections of error which he discovers-; not to correct errors of deficient or imperfect legislation, nor errors made by the general assembly. The evident purpose of the tax law was, as to banks, to tax rather their business than their capital, in a manner similar to the business of merchants. To allow in its full force the defined meaning of the word credit, as it exists in their business, and as applied to others. If this is not right, then an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>must be made to tbe general assembly, not to tbe courts, or io the county auditor.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b540-5\">Dickman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdH\">Tbe main question for our consideration grows out of a provision in section 2759, of tbe Revised Statutes, which, it is contended, is in contravention of tbe constitution of this state. That section is as follows: \u201cAll unincorporated banks and bankers shall annually, between the first and second Mondays of May, make out and return to the auditor of the proper county, under oath of the owner or principal officer or manager thereof, a statement setting forth: <em>First, </em>\u2014 The average amount of notes and bills receivable, discounted or purchased in the course of business, by such unincorporated bank, banker or bankers, and considered good and \u25a0 collectible. <em>Second, </em>\u2014 The average amount of accounts receivable. <em>Third, </em>\u2014 The average amount of cash and cash items in possession or in transit. <em>Fourth, </em>\u2014 The average amount of all kinds of stocks, bonds, including United States government bonds, or evidences of indebtedness, held as an investment, or in any way representing assets. <em>Fifth, </em>\u2014 The amount of real estate at its assessed value. <em>Sixth, </em>\u2014 The average amount of all deposits. <em>Seventh, </em>\u2014 The average amount of accounts payable, exclusive of current deposit accounts. <em>Fighth, </em>\u2014 The average amount of United States government and other securities that are exempt from taxation. <em>Ninth, </em>\u2014 The true value in money of all furniture and other property not otherwise herein enumerated. From the aggregate sum of the first five items above enumerated, the said auditor shall deduct the aggregate sum of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and such portions of the eighth items as are by law exempt from taxation, and the remainder thus obtained added to the amount of item nine, shall be entered on the duplicate of the county in the name of such bank, banker, or bankers, and taxes thereon shall be assessed and paid the same as provided for other personal property assessed and taxed in the same city, ward, or township.\u201d The proposition sought to be established in behalf of the plaintiff in error is, that the part of section 2759 which requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>county auditors, in levying taxes, yearly, upon unincorporated banks and bankers, shall deduct the aggregate sum of the fifth, sixth and seventh items, from the aggregate sum of the first five items of the section, is repugnant to section 3, of article 12, of the constitution, and is, therefore, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The real estate returned by the defendant in its statement of assets, was already taxed on the duplicate as real property, and its deduction, at its asssessed value for taxation, cannot be deemed unauthorized. The average amount of the United States government and other securities exempt from taxation, were obviously proper subjects of deduction from the fourth item of the bank\u2019s return, embracing the average amount of all kinds of stocks, bonds, including United States government bonds, or evidences of indebtedness, held as an investment, or in any way representing assets. And, in our judgment, in determining from the bank\u2019s return the amount of assets to be placed upon the duplicate for taxation, the bank was entitled to have deducted from the average amount of all its notes and bills receivable, discounted or purchased, and considered good and collectible, the average amount of all deposits, and the average amount of accounts payable, exclusive of current deposit accounts; but the deduction of the average amount of such deposits and accounts payable, from the average amount of the bank\u2019s cash or cash items in possession, may well be held unallowable on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">By the repeated decisions of this court, the second section of article 12, of the constitution, furnishes the governing principle for all laws levying taxes for general revenue, whether for state, county, township or municipal purposes. That section provides as follows: \u201c Laws shall be passed, taxing by a uniform rule, all moneys, credits, investments in bonds, stocks, joint stock companies, or otherwise; and also all real and personal property, according to its true value in money; but burying grounds, public school houses, houses used exclusively for public worship, institutions of purely public charity, public property used exclusively for any public purpose, and personal property, to an amount not exceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>in value two hundred dollars, for each individual, may, by general laws,, be exempted from taxation; but, all such laws shall be subject to alteration or repeal; and the value of all property, so exempted, shall, from time to time, be ascertained and published, as may be directed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Under the comprehensive requirement of this section, property of every description, except the kinds specially exempted, whether owned by individuals or corporations, is made to bear an equal and just proportion of.the public burdens, by way of taxation, in return for the protection and advantages afforded by the government. The object of the section was to devise a system of taxation, that would approximate to the standard of perfect equality and uniformity. Hence, the provision requiring <em>all </em>property in the state to be taxed by a uniform rule, according to its true value in money. It might, however, be inquired, what need was there of section 8, of article 12, of the constitution, if it was not intended to establish a rule as to banks and bankers different from the rule respecting individuals. Section 3 reads as follows: \u201c The general assembly shall provide, by law, for taxing the notes and bills discounted or purchased, moneys loaned, and all other property, effects, or dues, of every description, (without deduction), of all banks, now existing, or hereafter created, and of all bankers, so that all property enqsloyed in banking, shall always bear a burden of taxation, equal to that imposed on the property of individuals.\u201d Barring the two hundred dollars exemption for each individual, here is a plain indication that, as between banks and individuals, the property of each respectively should bear equal burdens of taxation. And, by section 4, of article 13, of the constitution, \u201c The property of corporations, now existing or hereafter created, shall forever be subject to taxation, the same as the property of individuals.\u201d It is said in <em>Exchange Bank of Columbus </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>3 Ohio St. 1, that there was no absolute necessity for section 4, for without it, section 2, of article 12, would have embraced existing and future corporations. \u201cIt was inserted,\u201d says Teojbman, J., \u201cout of abundant caution, that there might be no doubt either as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>existing or future corporations, what' would be the rule of taxation. So, section 8, of article 12, was inserted, that there might be no doubt how existing, as well as future banks and bankers, whether incorporated or unincorporated, were to be taxed; that there might be no doubt what property of theirs was to be the object of taxation; and further, to deprive them of even the two hundred dollars exemption, which may be permitted to individuals under section two. And hence it is that we find in it the words \u201c without deduction.\u201d Such caution would naturally be induced by the fact, that for many years, the legislature had been accustomed to pass acts for the incorporation of turnpike, plankroad, canal, and probably railroad companies, that contained provisions exempting them from taxation. Bartley, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court in the same case said: \u201c The third section requires all property employed in banking to be taxed \u2018without deduction.\u2019 The deduction here inhibited amounts simply to an express denial to the banks of the deduction allowed in the preceding section by the exemption in favor of individuals, and has reference to it.\u201d But the standard of equality and uniformity in taxation has been established by the constitution, for corporations and individuals alike, and excepting the special exemptions from taxation mentioned in the constitution, the rule for taxation as to banks and bankers is not different from the rule as to individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In <em>Exchange Bank of Columbus </em>v. Hines, supra, it was decided, that the tenth section of the tax law of April 13,1852, which allowed individuals and certain, corporations, in giving their tax lists, to deduct their liabilities from the amount of their moneys and credits, was repugnant to the constitution \u2014 inasmuch as taxes are required to be assessed on all property \u2014 and was consequently void; and that the constitution permitted no deduction of liabilities from moneys and credits. If the nineteenth section of the same law, which made it the duty of every bank to make out and return annually for the purpose of taxation, to the auditor of the county, a written statement of the average amount of notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>and bills by it discounted or purchased, had authorized the bank to deduct from such amount the amount of all legal <em>Iona fide </em>debts by it owing to any person, company or corporation, for a consideration received, it might, for the same reason, have been declared to be opposed to the constitution, for it would have permitted a deduction of the bank\u2019s liabilities from the amount of its credits, according to the acceptation of that term as then adopted by the court. Notes and bills discounted or purchased by a bank were then treated as credits, and, in that sense, if the bank had been permitted to make such deduction while individuals were not, it could not have been said that, within the meaning of the constitutional provision, the property employed in the bank bore \u201ca burden of taxation equal to that imposed on the property of individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Section 2, of article 12, in specifying the subjects of taxation, is as applicable to banks and banking companies as to individuals, and such applicability is as broad in regard to the species of property to be taxed, as in respect to the rule of taxation prescribed by the constitution. The section contemplates the taxing of the moneys and credits of banks and banking companies, as well as the moneys and credits of individuals. Section 3, of article 12, designates no form of property, and no kind of corporation, which, for the purpose of taxation, is not comprehended in the preceding section.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Recognizing the principle that credits, like all other kinds of property of banks, are to be taxed according to the standard fixed by the constitution, we come to the consideration of the question, what are credits within the meaning of our tax law? We do not propose to review the discussion on that subject in <em>Exchange Bank of Columbus </em>v. <em>Hines. </em>Brief citations will suffice. Thubman, J., in his concurring opinion, says: \u201cNor is it true that in legal signification, or in popular parlance, the term \u2018 credits \u2019 means\u2019 what is due to a man after deducting his liabilities.\u201d, Ranney, J., in his dissenting opinion, uses the language: \u201c Credits are, by the constitution, to be taxed, and from the gross amount, each individual is, by the tenth section of the act of April 13. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>1852, entitled to deduct his <em>bona fide </em>debts, and return the balance. The language of the law may not be strictly accurate. The evident meaning, however, is, that debts may be deducted from the gross amount of notes, accounts, and other choses in action, belonging to the individual. If the balance thus ascertained, is not the precise amount and value of the credits of the party against the world, both in legal and popular sense, I confess myself unable to understand the meaning of words or force of language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">But more than thirty years ago, the term received a legislative exposition which has ever since remained undisturbed. Much deference is certainly due to legislative construction\u2014 if deliberatively given \u2014 as to the meaning of the language used in the constitution, and although it may not be conclusive upon the judicial tribunal, it is nevertheless entitled to great weight. In section 5, of the act of April 1, 1856, (53 Ohio L. 52,) it was enacted: \u201c The term \u2018 credits,\u2019 shall be held to mean the excess of the sum of all legal claims and demands, whether for money or other valuable thing, or for labor or service due or to become due to the person liable to pay taxes thereon,.....when added together, (estimating every such claim or demand at its true value in money,) over and above the sum of the legal <em>bona, fide </em>debts owing by such person.\u201d The same provision is continued in section 2730 of the Revised Statutes. This statutory definition was the basis of the decision in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Waterson, </em>37 Ohio St. 121; it also entered into the decision in <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Capellar, </em>38 Ohio St. 560, and until changed by the legislature, we are not inclined to say that it should not be followed. Acquiescing in the meaning of the term as thus settled by statute, the amount of the credits of the defendant to be placed upon the duplicate for taxation, will be the excess of all its legal claims and demands over and above its <em>bona fide </em>debts; in other words, its credits will be estimated by deducting such debts from its legal claims and demands. What were the legal claims and demands of the defendant as set forth in the return made to the county auditor ? They are embraced in the first item of the bank\u2019s statement, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>are denominated the average amount of all notes and bills receivable, discounted or purchased. From this amount is to be deducted the sum of the legal <em>bona fide </em>debts owing by the bank, which as appear in its return, are specified in the sixth and seventh items, and include the average amount of all deposits, and the average amount of accounts payable, exclusive of current deposit accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">As regards general deposits, the relation of banker and customer is that of debtor and creditor. 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 93. A bank is accountable for the deposits it receives, as a debtor, and agrees to discharge those debts by honoring the checks which the depositors shall from time to time draw on it. The contract between the parties is purely a legal one, and has nothing of the nature of a trust in it. The bank is not bound to keep the money placed in-its custody, or deal with it as the property of its principal, but is, of course, answerable for the amount, because it has contracted, having received the money, to repay to the principal, when demanded, a sum equivalent to that paid into its hands. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>2 H. of L. Cas. 28; <em>Bank of the Republic </em>v. <em>Millard, </em>10 Wall. (U. S.) 152. The average amount of all deposits, and of accounts payable, returned by the defendant in the sixth and seventh items of its statement, should, therefore, be deducted from the average amount of all its notes and bills receivable, discounted or purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">But this deduction should not be made from the average amount of cash and cash items in possession. Money or cash, for the most part, is regarded and treated as property in possession, having intrinsic value, and not the mere evidence of claims upon others. As property in hand, of a tangible nature, distinctive in itself, and determinable as to value without the uncertainty of mere choses in action, it cannot be reduced or diminished on the tax duplicate by deducting from it the liabilities of the owner \u2014 whether individual or corporation \u2014 without an infringement of the constitutional requirement that <em>all </em>property shall be taxed by a uniform rule. And that portion of section 2759 of the Revised Statutes, which directs the auditor to make the enumerated de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ductions, so far as it includes in the aggregate from which the deductions are to be made, the average amount of cash and cash items in possession, is, in our view, repugnant to the constitution and void, but is not otherwise objectionable on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The question arises, however, whether, if that portion of the section is declared wholly or in part unconstitutional and void, it may not result in invalidating the. entire section. As one section of a statute may be repugnant to the constitution without rendering the whole act void, so, one provision of a section may be invalid by reason of its not conforming to the constitution, while all the other provisions may be subject to no constitutional infirmity. One part may stand, while another will fall, unless the two are so connected, or dependent on each other in subject-matter, meaning or purpose, that the good cannot remain without the bad. The point is, not whether the parts are contained in the same section, for, the distribution into sections is purely artificial; but whether they are essentially and inseparably connected in substance \u2014whether the provisions are so interdependent that one cannot operate without the other. As said by Waite, C. J., in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>103 U. S. 80, 84, \u201c the point to be determined is whether the unconstitutional provisions are so connected with the general scope of the law as to make it impossible, if they are stricken out, to give effect to what appears to have been the intent of the legislature.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hitchings, </em>5 Gray 482; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>24 Pick 362; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>96 N. Y. 294; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>22 Cal. 379; <em>Hagerstown </em>v. <em>Dechert, </em>32 Md. 369; <em>Exchange Bank of Columbus </em>v. <em>Hines, supra; Railroad </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>31 Ohio St. 338; <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Catholic Institute, </em>34 Ohio St. 289; <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>State, </em>37 Ohio St. 35; Cooley on Const. Lim. (6th ed.), 211. The several items enumerated in section 2759, are separate and distinct in their character. Their respective average amounts are obtained by independent computations, and the full amount of the third item, when entered on the duplicate, could not interfere with the proper deductions authorized to be made from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>others. There may be an assessment of taxes at the annual rate upon the average amount of cash and cash items, while the amount of all the other taxable assets of the bank may be easily obtained from its tax return, by the method prescribed in the section, and thereupon placed on the duplicate for taxation. In the face of the constitutional provision, that laws shall be passed' taxing by a uniform rule all moneys, it could not be assumed that the general assembly would not have required unincorporated banks and bankers to return in the list of their taxable property the average amount of cash and cash items, if they had known that the clause directing the auditor to make a deduction from the amount so returned, was opposed to the organic law. And furthermore, the elimination of the right to make deduction from the average amount of cash and cash items in possession, would only leave the bank on a footing of that equality with individuals contemplated in the constitution \u2014 clothed with the right of deducting the sum of its legal <em>Iona fide </em>debts, from the sum of its legal claims and demands, and of being taxed on the excess as credits. The fact that the auditor could derive no authority under the statute to make any deduction from the average amount of the bank\u2019s cash and cash items in possession, would not make it any the less his duty under other provisions of the tax law, to place upon the tax duplicate the bank\u2019s taxable property, nor affect the method prescribed by law for enforcing the collection of the taxes assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Was the auditor empowered, under section 1088, of the Revised Statutes, to correct the error in the amount of taxes for the year 1885, assessed against the defendant upon the then current duplicate, so far as it resulted from the erroneous deduction from the average amount of cash and cash items in possession, shown by the defendant\u2019s return of its taxable property to the auditor for taxation ? That section provides: \u201c The auditor shall from time to time, correct all errors which he discovers in the tax-list and duplicate, either in the name of the person charged with taxes or assessments, the description of lands or other property, or when property exempt from taxation has been charged with tax, or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>amount of sucb taxes or assessments.\u201d It is not claimed that tbe return of the defendant was false within the meaning of the statute. On its face it contained all the facts necessary to making the correction. The action of the auditor was essentially clerical, and it only devolved upon him to enter on the duplicate for taxation the amount of cash returned in the defendant\u2019s own figures. The correction, we think, was allowable under the decision in <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Cappellar, </em>supra, a case, in which, the item of \u201c reinsurance,\u201d under the head of a legal bona fide debt, was erroneously deducted by the auditor from the amount of claims and demands due the company.</p>\n<p id=\"Aid\">For error in holding that, the auditor was not authorized by law to enter upon the duplicate for taxation, the average amount of cash and cash items in possession returned by the defendant for taxation, without deduction therefrom, the judgments of the circuit court and of the court of common pleas should be reversed, and the cause remanded to the court of common pleas for the rendition of judgment against the defendant for taxes, at the proper rate, for the year 1885, on such average amount of cash and cash items in possession, without any penalty thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-7\">Williams, J., not sitting in the case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
