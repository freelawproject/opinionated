Thereafter, the town of Norwich laid a tax of twenty and one-half mills on the property at that valuation. The tax amounted to $1317.13. The plaintiff applied to the Court of Common Pleas for relief, alleging that the tax was laid upon property which was not taxable and that the property should be stricken from the tax list. General Statutes \u00a7 1801; see amendment, Public Acts 1957, No. 673, \u00a7 1. The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the application, and the plaintiff has appealed from the judgment. Similarly, the plaintiff has appealed from judgments dismissing its applications for relief from taxes assessed in the three years following.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The plaintiff is a Maine corporation with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>principal place of business in Newton, Massachusetts. It is engaged in the manufacture of woolen textiles and from time to time employed Yantic Woolen Mills, Inc., a Connecticut corporation located in Norwich, to process wools and yarns. This work was performed by Yantic Woolen Mills at its plant in Norwich, and the goods were returned to the plaintiff at Newton or to other places as directed by it. None of the wools or yams remained in Norwich for a period of more than seven months. The plaintiff was not carrying on a trading, mercantile, manufacturing or mechanical business in Norwich.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">It is a rule of general application that personal property can be taxed only at the residence of the owner or at a place where the property has acquired a situs. <em>Bridgeport Projectile Co. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>92 Conn. 316, 319, 102 A. 644. The crucial question in this case is whether the plaintiff\u2019s property, while it was in the hands of Yantic Woolen Mills, acquired a situs under our law so that it became subject to assessment and taxation by Norwich. The legislature has the power, within constitutional limitations not here involved, to \u201cchoose the subject matter of taxation and to fix the method and extent of a tax.\u201d <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>142 Conn. 483, 490, 115 A.2d 455, and cases cited therein. Municipalities have no powers of taxation except those expressly given to them by the legislature. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>88 Conn. 480, 490, 91 A. 380, and cases cited therein. Their powers of taxation can be lawfully exercised only in strict conformity to the terms by which they were given. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Poindexter, </em>84 Conn. 121, 132, 79 A. 79; <em>Thames Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>7 Conn. 550, 556. When a taxing statute is being considered, ambiguities are resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Connelly </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Waterbury National Bank, </em>136 Conn. 503, 510, 72 A.2d 645; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>93 Conn. 648, 656, 107 A. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">By stipulation of the parties, the plaintiff was not carrying on, in the town of Norwich, \u201ca trading, mercantile, manufacturing or mechanical business.\u201d If it had been, it might be claimed that its property came within the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 1750 (now Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 1049d). Nor do the provisions of General Statutes <em>% </em>1720, which relates to the taxation of property of nonresidents, apply, because it is conceded by the stipulation that the plaintiff\u2019s wools and yarns were not in the town of Norwich more than seven months in any year. If they are taxable at all, the plaintiff\u2019s wools and yarns must be brought within the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 1751.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute is headed \u201cProperty of Corporation, Where Listed. Stockholders Exempt.\u201d It states, among other things, that \u201call of the personal estate of [a foreign] corporation which is permanently located or stationed in any town shall be set in the list of the town in which such property is located, and all other personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of such corporation shall be set in the list\u201d of the town where such corporation has its principal place of business or exercises its corporate powers. Personal property is \u201cpermanently located\u201d in any town, by the definition contained in the statute, when it has been there for seven or more of the twelve months preceding the assessment day, which in the case at bar was October 1 in each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Describing the property of the plaintiff as \u201ca list of personal property, consisting of the average amount of goods . . . kept on hand during the year in the custody\u201d of Yantic Woolen Mills, fails to meet the requirements of \u00a7 1751 in two essential particulars. First, the statute makes no provision for assessing an \u201caverage amount of goods,\u201d as does \u00a7 1750. Second, there is no assertion in the assessment list, nor does the town claim to have shown, that the plaintiff exercised its corporate powers in Norwich or that any specific amount of these wools and yarns or any particular items of them were there for seven months or more preceding the assessment date and so might be considered as \u201cpermanently located\u201d in the town. For these reasons the assessments were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">There is error in all four eases, the judgments are set aside and the cases are remanded with direction to render judgment in each case sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s application for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\"> \u201cSee. 1751. property op corporation, where listed, stockholders exempt.
