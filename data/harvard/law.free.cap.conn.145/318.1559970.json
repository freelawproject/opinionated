J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6B\">This action for a declaratory judgment has been reserved for the advice of this court. The following facts have been stipulated: On April 23, 1951, Wire Rope Corporation of America, Inc., hereinafter called Wire Rope, was the owner of a large tract of land, with a number of buildings on it, in the city of New Haven. On that day it leased to the defendant by written instrument certain parts of the land and buildings, referred to hereinafter as the \u201cleased premises.\u201d The portions which were not leased to the defendant are referred to in the lease as the \u201cadditional premises.\u201d The lease was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>corded in the land records of the town of New Haven on May 18,1951. It was amended by a supplemental indenture between Wire Rope and the defendant which was dated April 16,1954, and was recorded on May 14, 1954. The lease and the supplemental indenture, which are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \u201cdefendant\u2019s lease,\u201d were drawn by the attorneys for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On February 9,1955, the plaintiff, under the name of The 341 Trumbull Street Corporation, which has since been changed to Congress and Daggett, Inc., entered into a written agreement with Wire Rope whereby the plaintiff agreed to purchase the latter\u2019s land and buildings. Before selling the property to the plaintiff, Wire Rope duly offered to sell it to the defendant, as required by paragraph 14 of the defendant\u2019s lease,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for $515,000 upon the same terms and conditions. The defendant did not exercise its option and privilege, as set forth in paragraph 14, to purchase the property. By deed dated June 15, 1955, Wire Rope conveyed the premises to the plaintiff, and the deed was recorded on June 15,1955. The written agreement of sale and the deed from Wire Rope to the plaintiff were expressly made subject to the defendant\u2019s lease. The purchase price paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the plaintiff to Wire Eope for the property was $515,000, the same price at which the property had been listed for sale with a real estate broker from January 15,1954, until February 9,1955, the date of the written agreement executed by the plaintiff and Wire Eope. The broker had, in the meantime, shown the property to other prospective purchasers. At and before the time of the purchase on June 15,1955, the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the defendant\u2019s lease and took title subject to it. The defendant is still occupying the \u201cleased premises\u201d under and by virtue of the lease. Parts of the \u201cadditional premises\u201d are at present occupied by third parties under several short-term leases, and parts are vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The term of the defendant\u2019s lease is ten years beginning September 1,1951. It contains an option and privilege on the part of the lessee to extend the term \u201cat the same rate of rental and upon the same other terms and provisions as are herein contained, for each of nine . . . additional periods of ten . . . years each, except the last period which shall be of nine . . . years only.\u201d By the lease, the defendant is given the option and privilege of canceling and terminating it as of the last day of any month during the last five years of the original term or during the last five years of any extended term. All exhibits referred to in the stipulation are made parts of it. The plaintiff desires to enter into negotiations with third parties for the renewal of existing leases, or the making of new leases, of parts of the \u201cadditional premises\u201d and to enter into negotiations with third parties for the sale of all or part or parts of the \u201cleased premises\u201d and the \u201cadditional premises.\u201d The existence of the defendant\u2019s lease affects the salability and market value of all or any part or parts of the \u201cleased premises\u201d and the \u201cadditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>premises,\u201d but all or part can be sold, at a reduced price.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The questions reserved for the advice of this court are six in number and are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By questions (c), (d) and (f), we are asked to determine the rights of a purchaser of the property or part of it. Neither the complaint nor the stipulation indicates that there is a purchaser. The only parties to the action are the plaintiff, which is the owner of the property, and the defendant. It is fundamental that upon a reservation we will not answer a question which affects the rights of anyone not a party. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 677, 103 A.2d 535. Questions (c), (d) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>(f) are not answered. By questions (a) and (b), we are asked to determine whether the plaintiff has a right to sell to a third party or parties all or any part of the \u201cleased premises\u201d or all or any part of the \u201cadditional premises\u201d without first offering to sell to the defendant as provided in paragraph 14 of the defendant\u2019s lease. It does not appear that the plaintiff now intends to sell the property or any part of it or that there are any \u201cterms and provisions of any such intended sale or other disposition.\u201d Consequently, questions (a) and (b) can only be construed as asking whether, if in the future the plaintiff should intend to sell to a third party or third parties all or any part of the \u201cleased premises\u201d or all or any part of the \u201cadditional premises,\u201d the plaintiff would first be required to offer to sell to the defendant. On a reservation, this court will not answer questions that are academic. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>141 Conn. 401, 406, 106 A.2d 759. It would not be in accord with the policy of this court to answer questions (a) and (b) at this time. <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>140 Conn. 332, 353, 99 A.2d 224. For this reason they are not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The parties have stipulated that parts of the \u201cadditional premises\u201d are vacant. By question (e) we are asked whether the plaintiff has \u201cthe right to lease or renew or extend the term of any existing lease or enter into any new lease of all or any part or parts of the \u2018additional premises\u2019 without affording to the defendant the option and privilege referred to\u201d in paragraph 13 of the defendant\u2019s lease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Under a provision of the written agreement of February 9, 1955, between the plaintiff and-Wire Rope,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff agreed to assume and perform any and all of Wire Rope\u2019s obligations under the provisions of the defendant\u2019s lease. The defendant maintains that therefore it is a third party beneficiary of that agreement. The plaintiff contends that this question is not before us, asserting that this issue was raised for the first time in the defendant\u2019s brief. This question is before us, since the parties stipulated that all of the exhibits referred to were made parts of the stipulation of facts. The agreement of purchase entered into by the plaintiff and Wire Rope on February 9,1955, was one of the exhibits referred to and was made a part of the stipulation of facts. The test to be applied to the provision contained in that agreement is whether the intent of the parties was to create a direct obligation from the plaintiff to the defendant. <em>Colonial Discount Co. </em>v. <em>Avon Motors, Inc., </em>137 Conn. 196, 202, 75 A.2d 507. The provision clearly indicates that it was the intent of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tiff and Wire Rope to create the direct obligation from the plaintiff to the defendant of assuming and performing the agreement contained in paragraph 13 of the defendant\u2019s lease. The answer to question (e) is \u201cNo.\u201d Our answer to this question is based upon the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to give to the defendant written notice of its intention to \u201clease or renew or extend the term of any existing lease of or enter into any new lease of all or any part of said additional premises,\u201d and to afford the defendant an opportunity to exercise its option to lease. Consequently, we have no occasion to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s claims that the covenants run with the land, that they violate the rule against perpetuities, and that they create a restraint upon alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We answer \u201cNo\u201d to question (e); the other questions are not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\"> \u201c14.
