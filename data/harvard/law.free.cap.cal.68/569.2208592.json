At a certain point on said land the stream having, as it were, slowly eaten into and carried off a portion of its bank on defendant\u2019s front, was threatening to cut a new channel through his land, which would have eventuated in the carrying off of some acres thereof. To prevent this, the defendant built a bulkhead on his own land, which was carried away, in the main, by a flood. He then, in October, 1880, constructed another slightly nearer the river, and again this was partially destroyed by the floods of the succeeding winter, and in the washing out caused thereby, quite a pool of water was formed in and upon the defendant\u2019s land, almost as deep as the bottom of the river, which at low stages thereof remains full of still water. Upon the subsidence of the floods, the river returned to its former channel, a pool of water remaining at the place where the bank and the spiling of the bulkhead had been washed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In October, 1881, the defendant again built a bulkhead of the same character as the one previously erected, commencing it with the upper end of the part of the old one still remaining, and running it in such a way as to carry it through the pond above mentioned, and some fifteen or twenty feet back of the former bulkhead, and continued by running it through an excavation of his high bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The last bulkhead is not quite so high as the former, and is somewhat lower than his original bank (now washed off) as it stood in 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s bank does not appear to have been lowered in any way, and a sand bank on his side has risen higher than the bulkhead on the defendant\u2019s side. At high water the defendant\u2019s bulkhead does not prevent the waters from overflowing it, and has no more injurious effect on the plaintiff\u2019s land than had the bank of the river as it stood in 1880; and the land of defendant, notwithstanding the bulkhead, is overflowed at high water as it was before its construction. By removing the bulkhead, the stream would probably cut a channel through defendant\u2019s land, and thereby, perhaps, relieve the plaintiff of apprehended danger. He, however, had suffered no damage up to the institution of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">It therefore appears that the contention of plaintiff is, that the defendant cannot reconstruct his bank, washed off by the river, to such a height as the bank formerly stood, and thereby prevent the river from running through his land, which last, if permitted, would, by shortening the stream, take the water off of plaintiff\u2019s bank, and render his land less liable to overflow. And he claims that the river must be permitted, without obstruction, to change its current, even if thereby it cut a new channel through and over the defendant\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">This position is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The defendant had a right to protect his land from the threatened change of the river\u2019s channel, by building a bulkhead as high as was his original bank before it washed off. He thereby took no right from the plaintiff; he simply attempted to maintain his own. (Angel\u00ed on Watercourses, sec. 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\u201cA riparian proprietor may in fact legally erect any work to prevent his lands from being overflowed by any change in the natural state of the river, and to prevent the old course of the river from being altered.\u201d <em>(Farquaharson </em>v. <em>Farquaharson, </em>3 Bligh Pr., N. S., 421, 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>According to the findings, the pond left from the high water on defendant\u2019s land was not a channel of the river, hut only threatened to become so, \u2014 which the defendant was seeking to prevent. And this he had a right to do, if he did not thereby interfere with the ancient channel of the stream. (Angel\u00ed on Watercourses, sec. 108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">There is no error in the record, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Belcher, C. G., and Searls, 0., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The Court. \u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
