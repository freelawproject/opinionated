Dewel the following words, to wit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The effect of this is, that according to the information and belief of the plaintiff the defendant did in fact speak the words set out in the complaint at the time and place and under the circumstances stated. The allegation is sufficient, although it might and should have been made more definite and certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Section 46 of the Civil Code declares:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\u201cSlander is a false and unprivileged publication other than libel, which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">\u201c1.
