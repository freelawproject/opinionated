From that part of the judgment providing for the wife\u2019s maintenance the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The court found that while defendant was not guilty of anything amounting to legal cruelty, \u2014 which was the ground relied on for a divorce, \u2014 nevertheless his conduct as a husband was cold, harsh, and disagreeable, making it unpleasant for the plaintiff to live with him; that the wife\u2019s conduct was not free from blame; that the marriage had been unhappy from the beginning; that the wife was a good many years older than her husband, and love or affection no longer existed between them; that at the time of their marriage the woman was hard-working, and had accumulated, from saving her wages, about five hundred dollars; that the man was possessed of about a similar sum of money; that putting their acquisitions together they purchased a farm, which is their homestead, and stocked it; that the husband afterward inherited about fifteen hundred dollars in money; that he rented land with a crop growing on it, and made some money out of it; that of the ten thousand dollars\u2019 worth of property of which the husband was in possession the greater part in value was community property; that there was no probability of the parties ever living together as husband and wife; that the wife was growing old, and would soon be incapacitated from making a living by her work; that twenty-five dollars was a reasonable sum per month to be paid her by the defendant, to provide for her maintenance, she having no children.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">It is argued for the defendant that his wife\u2019s allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>against him as a cruel husband being disproved, and her application for a divorce from him disallowed, she ought not to have maintenance at his hands unless she returns to his home, from which she is now absent through no fault of his.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">It is our opinion that the section of the Civil Code, No. 136, under which the judgment complained of was rendered, allows in such a case as the one under consideration the exercise of a sound discretion to the trial court. We observe no abuse of that discretion in the matter when before that tribunal, and are therefore satisfied that its judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Belcher, C. C., and Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The Court. \u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Ross, J., and McKinstry, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
