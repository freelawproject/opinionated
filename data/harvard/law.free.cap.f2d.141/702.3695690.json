Appellee\u2019s device is \u201cused for medical treatment\u201d and not as a \u201ccatamenial device.\u201d It is used in the treatment of \u201cgynecologic conditions,\u201d and is, therefore, for the prevention, cure, or alleviation of disease. The medication consists of either metaph\u00e9n or merthiolate. In appellee\u2019s device the cotton tampon to which the medicated suppository is attached is designed to hold the medicament in the area of infection or inflammation and to absorb ex-udates.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">It further appears from the record that appellee\u2019s goods are \u201cethical\u201d products; that they are sold at $1 per package of six by druggists on physicians\u2019 prescriptions, although they may be purchased without such prescriptions; that appellee has expended approximately $15,000 in advertising its goods and its trade-mark; that they are advertised in medical journals, by contact with physicians, by exhibits at medical conventions, and, as stated by appellee\u2019s witness E. A. Griswold, vice president of the opposer company, through a physician in the employ of the appellee company \u201cwhose only duty is to interest hospitals and clinics as well as members of the medical profession in the use of Medipax Brand Vaginal Tampon-Suppositories. His duties also include the organization of clinical research at such institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">Appellee\u2019s goods are not advertised for sale to the general public through magazines and newspapers as are appellant\u2019s catamenial tampons.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">The witness Griswold testified on direct examination that the appellee company was incorporated on December 24, 1938; that he had been vice president of the company since January 27, 1939; and that he had been engaged in the manufacture of drug and pharmaceutical products for more than ten years. We quote from the testimony of the witness as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-19\">\u201cQ46. What does the word \u2018Med\u2019 mean to you? * * * A. The word \u2018Med\u2019 appears in the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary, in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary and in the New Century Dictionary as an abbreviation for medical or medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-20\">\u201cQ49. Is that what the word means to you ? A. I think that is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-21\">The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that the goods of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>parties possessed the same descriptive properties; that the marks were confusingly similar; and that appellant was not entitled to the registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">In his decision holding the marks to be confusingly similar, the commissioner stated, among other things, that, although the goods of the respective parties are not competitive, they \u201care very closely associated in use, and may reasonably be assumed to be produced by the same manufacturer. I doubt that one would be mistaken for the other, but if sold under similar trade-marks I am convinced that there is at least some likelihood of confusion as to origin. In reaching this conclusion I have not overlooked existing differences in price and in methods of sale. Both are subject to change. Nor is it material that there is no evidence of actual confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Although it is stated in appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal that the goods of the parties do not possess the same descriptive properties, that issue is not discussed in appellant\u2019s brief. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to discuss it here. It is sufficient to say that we are in agreement with the views expressed by the tribunals of the Patent Office that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">It is contended here by counsel for appellant that, considering the differences in the trade-marks of the parties and the goods to which they are applied, the marks are not confusingly similar; that ap- \u25a0 pellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cMeds\u201d is a coined, arbitrary mark, and, as applied to appellant\u2019s goods, has no descriptive significance; that apart from the syllable \u201cMed\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark, there is no similarity between the marks of the parties; that as the syllable \u201cMed\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark is an abbreviation of the terms \u201cmedical\u201d or \u201cmedicine,\u201d as used in appellee\u2019s mark, it is descriptive of the character and quality of appellee\u2019s goods and, therefore, is not the dominant feature of appellee\u2019s trade-mark; that appellee is not entitled to its exclusive use; and that appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cMeds\u201d was \u201cadopted as a contraction of appellant\u2019s well-known trade-mark \u2018Modess\u2019, extensively used as applied to catamenial napkins, a competitive product then and now sold on an extensive scale.\u201d (It may be said at this point that, although it appears from the record that appellant manufactures and sells catamenial napkins under the term \u201cModess,\u201d is does not appear that \u2022 the term \u201cMeds\u201d was adopted as a contraction of the term \u201cModess.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The record discloses that prior to the adoption of the trade-mark \u201cMeds\u201d for use on tampons, appellant caused a search to be made in the United States Patent Office for the purpose of ascertaining whether there were any registered trade-marks similar to the term \u201cMeds\u201d and that such search disclosed, among other registered trademarks, appellee\u2019s mark \u201cMed-I-Pax,\u201d hereinbefore referred to; the trade-mark \u201cMedo,\u201d registered October 14, 1919, for use on sanitary bloomers; the trade-mark \u201cMedpaks,\u201d registered December 29, 1925, for use on sanitary napkins; the trademark \u201cMedix,\u201d registered August 2, 1927, for use on sanitary napkins; the trademark \u201cMed,\u201d registered July 30, 1929, for use on pharmaceutical preparations, compounds, or mixtures for coughs, whooping cough, colds, and similar infections of the throat and lungs; the trade-mark \u201cMed,\u201d registered September 11, 1928, for use on preparations for the treatment of boils, sties, carbuncles, feruncles, felons, and pimples due to staphylococcus infection; the trade-mark \u201cEm-Dee,\u201d registered December 6, 1927, for use on surgical pads, surgical mattresses, surgical sheets, surgical beds, and maternity packs; also the trademark \u201cMD,\u201d enclosed within a fanciful design, registered August 15, 1911 (renewed), for use on medicinal plasters.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Counsel for appellant also contends that appellee\u2019s \u201cparent company, Tampax, Inc.,' does market an unmedicated cotton tampon used for the identical purpose for which applicant\u2019s tampon is employed and sold in direct competition therewith. But, this product bears the name \u2018Tampax\u2019, a mark more nearly 'like \u2018Med-I-Pax\u2019 than applicant\u2019s coined and arbitrary mark \u2018Meds\u2019 * * (Appellee\u2019s witness Griswold testified on cross-examination that prior to his becoming vice president of the appellee company, he was employed by \u201cTampax, Incorporated,\u201d and that the Tampax company manufactured and sold a device for \u201ccatamenial protection\u201d known as \u201cTampax.\u201d However, there is nothing in the record to indicate how long the Tampax company had been selling its product under its trade-mark \u201cTampax,\u201d or that that company is related either directly or indirectly to the appellee company. Furthermore, priority of use and of confusing similarity of the terms \u201cMed-I-Pax\u201d and \u201cTampax\u201d are not issues in this case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">The prefix \u201cMed\u201d in appellee\u2019s trade-mark is, as stated by appellee\u2019s witness Griswold, defined by the lexicograph<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ers as an abbreviation of the terms \u201cmedical\u201d and \u201cmedicine.\u201d See Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary, Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, and The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia. Furthermore, it was conceded by that witness, who, at the time of the taking of his testimony, had been engaged in the manufacture of drugs and pharmaceutical products for more than ten years, that he understood the prefix \u201cMed\u201d to be an abbreviation of \u201cmedical\u201d or \u201cmedicine.\u201d Accordingly, the prefix \u201cMed,\u201d as used in appellee\u2019s mark, is descriptive of\u201e the character or quality of appellee\u2019s goods, and, therefore, is not the dominant feature of the mark. See Younghusband v. Kurlash Company, Inc., 94 F.2d 230, 25 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 886; American Brewing Co. v. Delatour Beverage Corp., 100 F.2d 253, 26 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 778; Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. Pepsodent Co., 104 F.2d 205, 26 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1272; Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., v. Kasko Distillers Products Corporation, 111 F.2d 481, 27 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1189; Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. United Drug Co., 112 F.2d 814, 27 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1273. However, the term \u201cMeds,\u201d as applied to appellant\u2019s product, is not descriptive of the character or quality of appellant\u2019s goods. Whether it is registrable as a trade-mark for use on appellant\u2019s goods in view of the registered marks hereinbefore referred to, such as, for example, \u201cMedo\u201d for use on sanitary bloomers and \u201cMedix\u201d for use on sanitary napkins, is not an issue before us, there having been no ex parte rejection of appellant\u2019s application for the registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The sole issue in the case is whether, considering the differences in the marks of the respective parties and the differences in the goods to which the marks are applied, concurrent use of the marks would be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">It is unnecessary that we further analyze the marks of the parties, or that we again explain the differences in structure of the devices on which they are used.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">After careful consideration of the issues in the case, we are constrained to disagree with the views expressed by the tribunals of the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Considering the fact that appellee\u2019s \u201cMedicated Vaginal Suppositories\u201d are used for medical treatment and for the prevention, cure, or alleviation of disease, whereas appellant\u2019s <em>unmedicated </em>tampons are devices used solely for catamenial protection, and considering the differences in the marks of the parties, we are of opinion that the concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the parties would not be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers. Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b769-11\">BLAND, Associate Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">I am not in agreement with the majority, either in the conclusion or the reasons assigned for arriving at the same. The goods of the respective parties are not only of the same descriptive properties but they are so nearly identical in many respects that I cannot escape the conclusion that the use of \u201cMeds\u201d on appellant\u2019s goods will lead to the character of confusion which the trade-mark law sought to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">The mark \u201cMeds\u201d is suggestive that the goods upon which it is used are medicinal in character, whereas they are not in any respect used for medicinal purposes. The adoption of the mark alone would suggest to me a desire on the part of its user to reap where it has not sown and to profit by the confusion with such marks as \u201cMed-IPax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">The majority, in stating the case, have emphasized the difference in the uses and the manner of selling the goods of the parties. Advertising practices and manner of sale, as we have said many times, are always subject to change and should ordinarily not influence us in our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">I disagree with the manner in which the majority have dissected the appellee\u2019s trademark and the conclusion that \u201cmed,\u201d being descriptive, is not the dominant portion of the mark. The mark as a whole is not descriptive, and I cannot concur in a line of reasoning which permits the whittling away of a valid mark and thus promotes confusion in the purchasing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">Some of the best and most favorably known trade-marks have syllables which, if considered alone, are descriptive; and the descriptive syllable may be the main feature of the mark, yet the mark as a whole may unquestionably be a valid and valuable one. If the reasoning of the majority in this case had been applied in numerous decisions heretofore handed down by this court, we should have arrived at different conclusions. For instance, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Celotex Company v. Millington, 49 F.2d 1053, 18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1484, the marks \u201cCelotex\u201d and \u201cFir-Tex\u201d were compared. We there held that \u201cFir-Tex\u201d could not be registered over \u201cCelotex\u201d notwithstanding the claim that the term \u201ctex\u201d was common property. There was no similarity between the terms \u201ccelo\u201d and \u201cfir.\u201d Nevertheless, we held, as we have in numerous other cases, that the marks should be regarded as a whole and not dissected, and that the registration of \u201cFir-Tex\u201d would mislead the public in view of the well-known mark \u201cCelotex.\u201d I need not cite a long list of cases to the same effect which I think are, in effect though not expressly, overruled by the reasoning which the majority have applied to the instant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">If the conclusion of the majority is right and the appellant may register a mark containing the descriptive term \u201cmed\u201d on goods that have no medicinal qualities, it would seem to follow that the appellee, in the natural extension of its business, would have an equal right to use its term \u201cMed-I-Pax\u201d on goods identical with those of appellant. The goods are substantially identical in construction and mode of use. When appellant\u2019s mark is registered, appellee, according to the majority, could not use its mark on its tampon if it dispensed with the medicinal element of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">I think the tribunals of the Patent Office correctly decided the issue, and I would affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
