halogen substituent is bromine, rather than chlorine. Bromine and chlorine are members of the same family and as a general proposition, compounds otherwise similar and differing only with respect to the halogen substituent are closely related in properties,\u201d and that \u201cIt is not shown that the instant case is an exception.\u201d The examiner further stated, in which statement the Board of Appeals concurred, that \u201cordinarily a compound is not patentable over its isomer or over its next adjacent homologue. Organic chemistry is a systematic science, and it is well recognized that in a series of organic chemical compounds the properties of the individual members change by degrees in ascending or descending the series, or in passing from one form to a structural isomeric form. The Examiner recognizes that in certain instances, where the difference in properties is unexpected, the new isomer or new homologue may be patentable; but applicants have demonstrated no reason for excepting the instant case from the operation of the general rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">Subsequent to the examiner\u2019s statement to the Board of Appeals, appellants filed an affidavit of one Arthur W. Campbell, a chemist employed in the Chemical Research Department of Commercial Solvents Corporation, wherein it is stated that the affiant was engaged in rubber research including \u201cthe compounding of rubber, rubber cement formulation, and various\u201d processes \u201cfor the treatment of latex\u201d; and that the affiant discovered the compound 1-chloro-l-nitrobutane, the compound of the appealed claim, \u201cto possess valuable properties both as a heat-sensitizing agent for latex, and as a gel inhibitor for heat-vulcanizing rubber cements.\u201d Certain experiments performed by the affiant, and the results obtained therefrom, are also set forth in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-20\">Thereafter, the case was remanded to the examiner for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-21\">In his supplemental statement to the board, the examiner stated that the appealed claim \u201crelates to a single compound 1 chloro-l-nitrobutane\u201d; that the compound of the appealed claim was not patentable over the related compounds hereinbefore referred to, due to the absence of properties or qualities distinguishing it from the class to which it belongs; and that, although the affidavit purports to show that the claimed compound possessed utility, the claim was not rejected for lack of utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-22\">The Board of Appeals concurred in the views expressed by the Primary Examiner in his original statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-23\">No reference is made in the board\u2019s decision to the affidavit of record, or to the examiner\u2019s statement with regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-24\">No question is raised here as to the disclosures in the references, or as to their relationship to the compound of the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>pealed claim, except as to the scope of the claim, as hereinbefore stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">It is contended here by counsel for appellants, as it was in the cases of In re Henry B. Hass and Alfred G. Susie (Patent Appeal No. 4819), 31 C. C. P. A. (Patents) -, 141 F.2d 122, and In re Henry B. Hass and Alfred G. Susie (Patent Appeal No. 4820), 31 C. C. P. A. (Patents)--, 141 F.2d 127 (companion appeals, decided concurrently herewith), that novelty alone is sufficient to lend patentability to claims for new chemical compounds, and it is stated in the brief of counsel that decisions of the tribunals of the Patent Office requiring an applicant for a patent for a new chemical compound or for a novel series of chemical compounds to prove that such compounds possess some unexpected properties or utility not possessed by prior art isomers or prior art adjacent homologues are unfair. As an example of such unfairness, counsel states that, subsequent to the filing of the application in the instant case, appellants discovered that, in addition to being useful as an organic solvent and as a valuable intermediate for use in organic synthesis as stated in their application, the claimed compound also had utility as a heat-sensitizing agent for latex and as an anti-gelling agent for latex as appears from the affidavit of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">It is stated in appellants\u2019 application that the compound of the appealed claim is useful as an organic solvent and as a valuable intermediate for use in organic synthesis; that \u201cOther uses of this compound will be apparent to those skilled in the art\u201d; that the data disclosed in the application \u201cwere obtained from a single preparation\u201d of the claimed compound; and that appellants do not wish to limit their application \u201cto a compound having the exact properties listed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">With regard to the facts set forth in the affidavit, and the claims of counsel for appellants relative thereto, it is sufficient to say that there is nothing of record to indicate that the prior art compounds do not possess the same properties as the compound here involved, or that they would not be useful for the same purposes as the involved compound.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Appellants having failed to establish that the involved compound has any unexpected or unobvious beneficial properties not possessed by the homologous compound disclosed in the Henry reference, we are of opinion, for the reasons stated in our decisions in the Hass and Susie cases, supra, that, on the record presented, the appealed claim was properly rejected by the tribunals of the Patent Office. It is unnecessary, therefore, that we discuss the closely related compounds disclosed in the Zublin and Shaw references.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
