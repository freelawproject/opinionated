J., instructed the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-11\">Gentlemen of the jury,\u2014The plaintiff claims that the defendant was guilty of negligence in failing to furnish a reasonably safe place for him to work. There was nothing in the construction or location of the passageway which made it unsafe, and the defendant had provided f\u00f3r the safety of those who used it by directing that when bales were thrown down there should be danger signs put up as a caution, or that a man should be stationed in the passageway to prevent the use of it during such time. It appears from the evidence that Killian threw down seven bales and Mealey stood them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>up to be trucked away, and that he then went back and threw down the other three, but there were no danger signs put up, although the defendant had proper signs prepared for just such an occasion, and it was the duty of employees who threw down bales to put up the signs. It was Mealey who was negligent in not performing the duty of warning the plaintiff as he approached the passageway; and Killian who neglected to put up the danger signs. The negligence which caused the injury to the plaintiff was that of his fellow servants, and he has failed to show any negligence oil the part of the defendant, or of anyone acting as vice-principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-4\">The point submitted by the defendant is affirmed, and I direct you to find a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in directing a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-6\"><em>George J.
