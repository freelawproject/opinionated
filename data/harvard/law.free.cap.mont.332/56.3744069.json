(Somont) sought to quiet its leasehold and/or mineral interest in twenty-eight oil and gas leases located in the Kevin/Sunburst field, occupied by defendants (C-W), in Toole County, Montana. Somont argued that its leases were valid and enforceable to the exclusion of any leasehold interest by C-W because, under the agreement terms, C-W\u2019s interest terminated due to cessation of production. The District Court entered judgment pursuant to a jury trial, and Somont appealed to this Court. We reversed and remanded for a new trial. Subsequent to the second trial, the jury returned a verdict favorable to Somont as to three of the leases and favorable to C-W as to five of the leases, and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>entered judgment accordingly. Somont now appeals, and C-W cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b62 We state the issues presented by Somont on direct appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">1. Did the District Court err in concluding that C-W met its burden of proving that cessation of production was temporary and denying Somont\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">2. Did the District Court err in not awarding Somont its costs and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 82-1-201, MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b63 We state C-W\u2019s issues on cross-appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">1. Did the District Court err in concluding as a matter of law that the leases at issue had failed to produce in paying quantities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">2. Did the District Court err in limiting the time frame for which evidence could be presented regarding the restoration of production to the leases?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">\u00b64 We reverse in part, affirm in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">\u00b65 In 1991 C-W purchased a number of oil and gas leases in the Kevin-Sunburst oil field in Toole County, Montana. (For a complete discussion of this case\u2019s history, <em>see Somont Oil Co. v. A &amp; G Drilling, Inc., </em>2002 MT 141, \u00b6\u00b6 5-12, 310 Mont. 221, \u00b6\u00b6 5-12, 49 P.3d 598, \u00b6\u00b6 5-12 <em>(Somont D-) </em>C-W held these leasehold properties pursuant to the contingencies of various habendum clauses, which permitted C-W a viable leasehold interest as long as C-W produced oil and gas in paying quantities from said leaseholds. Asserting that C-W\u2019s leases had terminated due to lack of production, Somont informed C-W on April 10, 1998, that Somont had acquired the leases from the Kevin-Sunburst lessors. Accordingly, Somont demanded that C-W execute lease releases on the twenty-eight properties; C-W refused. Somont consequently filed suit in the Ninth Judicial District Court on May 20, 1998. C-W eventually executed releases on twenty of its Kevin-Sunburst leases, but refused to tender releases on the other eight. The parties therefore proceeded to trial on whether C-W\u2019s eight remaining leases had terminated due to a cessation of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">\u00b66 After the close of evidence, the court denied Somont\u2019s motion for a judgment as a matter of law and instructed the jury to consider \u201call surrounding circumstances\u201d-oil prices, economic considerations and CWs financial condition-in determining whether C-W\u2019s leases had terminated for a lack of production. Having considered such evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of C-W, finding that none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>eight leases terminated due to a lack of production. Somont renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law, and in the alternative, moved for a new trial. The District Court denied both requests. In its final judgment, the court ordered both parties to pay attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">\u00b67 Somont appealed the judgment and the court\u2019s order denying its motion for a judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the District Court erred in allowing the jury to consider oil prices, economic considerations and C-W\u2019s financial condition in determining whether the leases terminated due to a lack of production. We agreed with Somont on this issue. We further concluded that Somont established that the leases failed to produce in paying quantities and remanded for retrial on the question of whether cessation was permanent or temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b68 This Court noted in <em>Somont I, </em>that Montana is an \u201cownership-in-place state with regard to oil, gas and other minerals,... [which] means oil and gas leases transfer to the lessee a fee simple determinable estate with the lessor retaining a possibility of reverter.\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 26. Automatic termination takes place when paying quantities cease to occur. <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 26. We reiterated that \u201cpaying quantities\u201d is defined as the \u201camount of production which would pay a small profit over the cost of operation of the well, excluding from consideration the initial cost of bringing the well into production.\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 27. In order to mitigate the harshness of automatic termination, we adopted the <em>temporary cessation of production doctrine. </em>\u201cPursuant to this doctrine, once a plaintiff establishes that an oil and gas lease has halted production, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the cessation was temporary and not permanent. A temporary cessation in production will not trigger an automatic termination of the lease as contemplated in the habendum clause.\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b69 In determining a judicial test for the temporary cessation doctrine, we looked to Texas-also an ownership-in-place jurisdiction-for guidance, and held that \u201cactions commenced to terminate oil and gas leases invoke two distinct inquiries: (1) Is the lease producing in paying quantities?; and (2) If not, was the cessation in production permanent or temporary?\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 33. With regard to the first inquiry, we concluded that \u201cSomont established at trial that the leases failed to produce in paying quantities during the accounting period prescribed by the District Court.\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 30. As to the second question, we determined that \u201ccessation in production will only be deemed temporary when it is caused by a <em>sudden stoppage of the well </em>or a <em>mechanical breakdown of the equipment </em>used in connection with the well, or the like.\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 33 (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Consequently, we held that the District Court abused its discretion by allowing the jury to consider oil prices, economic considerations, and C-W\u2019s financial condition in determining whether C-W\u2019s cessation was justified as temporary. <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 36. We ordered a new trial, noting that C-W deserved \u201can opportunity to present its evidence in accordance with the temporary cessation of production factors adopted herein.\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 38. We also noted that the District Court would have to reconsider the attorney fee issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b610 During the second trial in June 2004, the court granted Somont\u2019s motion to preclude C-W from offering evidence not previously produced at the Rule 30(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., deposition of the corporate designees. Consequently, the court limited C-W\u2019s evidence to its Exhibit 538 and the explanations provided by C-W designees, John Walls (Walls) and Karie Frydenlund. Although Joe Walls (Joe) also testified, the court specifically precluded C-W from offering any testimony from Joe that contradicted its Rule 30(b)(6) designees. The trial resulted in a 459-page transcript of fact-intensive testimony regarding the eight leases at issue and their wells: Leach Lease (one well); A. Lorenzen Lease (twenty-three wells); Hurley Lease (three wells); Haugen-Fee Lease (six wells); Bluhm Lease (twenty-three wells); Allen 3 &amp; 17 Lease (twenty-seven wells); Rice-Bluhm Lease (seventeen wells); and Caine Lease (thirty-seven wells).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While Exhibit 538 and the accompanying testimony from Walls and Frydenlund explained the reason some wells stopped operating and whether repairs were undertaken, the jury was provided no information regarding the majority of down wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b611 C-W designees acknowledged throughout trial that even though C-W had the capabilities to repair down wells, it often did not undertake such repairs. Walls further testified that C-W chose to let frozen gun barrels thaw in the spring, rather than warm them in the winter. Cumulatively, the evidence before the jury showed that the majority of wells on each lease were down during the period in question, January 1, 1996, through April 10, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b612 Following the close of evidence at trial, Somont moved the court to enter judgment as a matter of law, arguing that C-W failed to meet its burden of proving that the production temporarily ceased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">Your honor, we would like to make a Motion for a Directed Verdict, pursuant to Rule 50 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. I think it has been quite clear that the burden of proof in this matter, as the Court has already ruled, has been upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Defendants to prove that the cessation of production, as established by the Court, was not temporary in nature, as the Court has indicated in its rulings. In order to establish whether or not it was temporary it\u2019s necessary that you show: why the lease shut down, whether it was due to a sudden stoppage of the well, mechanical breakdown, or the like. On a vast majority of each and everyone [sic] of the leases, Your Honor, there\u2019s no information, whatsoever, as to why any of those wells shut down or why they were shut down. And on that basis, with regards to each lease, Your Honor, there\u2019s just no evidence for this jury to determine that the lease shut down, not any particular one well, but that the lease shut down due to a sudden stoppage of the well, mechanical breakdown, or the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b613 The court denied Somont\u2019s motion, stating that \u201cthere\u2019s sufficient evidence to prohibit... granting [the] motion, and to allow this matter to go to the jury.\u201d The jury returned a verdict favorable to C-W on five of the leases (A. Lorenzen Lease, Bluhm Lease, Allen Lease, RiceBluhm Lease, and Caine Lease) and favorable to Somont on the remaining three. Somont renewed its motion for a judgment as a matter of law with regard to the five leases on which it did not prevail; it also requested attorney fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 82-1-202(1), MCA. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"AMd\">DISCUSSION APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b614 1. Diet the District Court err in concluding that C-W met its burden of proving that cessation of production was temporary and denying Somont\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b615 This Court\u2019s standard of review of appeals from district court orders granting or denying motions for judgment as a matter of law is identical to that of the district court. Judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. All such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from that evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Williams v. Union Fidelity Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 273, \u00b6 19, 329 Mont. 158, \u00b6 19, 123 P.3d 213, \u00b6 19. We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for judgment as a matter of law to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Glacier Tennis Club v. Treweek Const. Co., </em>2004 MT 70, \u00b6 46, 320 Mont. 351, \u00b6 46, 87 P.3d 431, \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u00b616 At the close of evidence, Somont moved the court to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>judgment as a matter of law, arguing that C-W failed to meet its burden of proving that the cessation of production was temporary. We agree with Somont and therefore hold that the District Court should have entered judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b617 \u201cA cessation in production will only be deemed temporary when it is caused by a sudden stoppage of the well or a mechanical breakdown of the equipment used in connection with the well, or the like.\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 33. \u201cThe diligent lessee who takes immediate steps to rectify a sudden halt in production will not lose his or her investment,\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 32, during such a temporary stoppage.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b618  C-W bore the burden of proving that the cessation of production on all eight leases at issue was temporary. <em>See Somont I, </em>\u00b6 28 (\u201conce a plaintiff establishes that an oil and gas lease has halted production, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the cessation was temporary and not permanent\u201d). In other words, C-W had to prove at trial that all cessations in production were caused by sudden involuntary stoppages or mechanical breakdown of the wells on the leases, and that C-W engaged in diligent efforts to immediately restore production.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b619 Somont argues that \u201cC-W failed, totally and completely, to meet its burden. ... C-W\u2019s evidence was limited to information contained in its Exhibit 538, which showed neither the reason(s) that wells were down nor any effort(s) to restore production from those wells.\u201d According to Somont, \u201cC-W failed to even begin establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b620 In response, C-W argues that it presented substantial evidence during trial, both testimonial and documentary, demonstrating that all down wells were caused by involuntary sudden stoppage, mechanical breakdown, or the like. In support of this assertion, C-W cites Joe\u2019s testimony that the devastating November 1996 ice storm \u201caffected all of the leases.\u201d C-W also quotes Joe as stating that C-W \u201cnever\u201d shut the wells down. Walls, C-W\u2019s designee, however, testified that the November 1996 ice storm had no affect on the majority of wells (and therefore leases) and that he did not know why the majority of wells were not operating. Given that the District Court specifically precluded any testimony from Joe that contradicted Walls, C-W\u2019s reliance on Joe\u2019s testimony is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b621 By utilizing C-W\u2019s evidence and witnesses, Somont established at trial that each lease had one or more periods of consecutive months of no production from January 1, 1996, to April 10, 1998.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">Leach Lease: The 1 well down August 1996 through April 1998; no information why it stopped operating or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>A. Lorenzen Lease: All 23 wells down, except for 2 that operated for ten days in May 1997; except for 1 well, no information why the wells failed to operate or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">Hurley Lease: Of the 3 wells, 2 operated periodically; no information why the wells failed to operate or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoi\">Haugen-Fee Lease: All 6 wells down, except 1 well that operated for five days in 1997; no information why the majority of wells failed to operate or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">Bluhm-Lease: All 23 wells down, except 1 well that operated for a few months; no information why the majority of wells failed to operated or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">Allen Lease (Allen 3 &amp; Allen 17): Of the 27 wells, 3 operated intermittently and for only days at a time; no information why the majority of wells failed to operate or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">Rice-Bluhm Lease: Of the 17 wells, only 4 operated intermittently for brief periods; no information why the majority of wells failed to operate or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">Caine Lease: Of the 37 wells, 13 operated sporadically and for very brief periods; no information why the majority of wells failed to operate or of repair efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b622 In light of the fact that the evidence failed to account for why the majority of wells on the eight leases failed to operate and/or whether repair efforts were undertaken, C-W failed in its burden to establish that production ceased because of a sudden stoppage of the well or a mechanical breakdown of the equipment used in connection with the well, or the like. Moreover, C-W failed to show that it diligently took immediate steps to rectify the halt in production since it provided no information whether it undertook repair efforts on the majority of wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u00b623  Given the complete lack of evidence as to why the majority of wells failed to operate and whether repairs were undertaken, there was no basis for submitting the question of whether cessation was temporary to the jury. Considering all of the evidence and the legitimate inferences in a light most favorable to C-W, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Somont\u2019s motion for a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\u00b624 2. Did the District Court err in not awarding Somont its costs and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 82-1-201(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">\u00b625 Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees and costs is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Gullet v. Van Dyke Const. Co., </em>2005 MT 105, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 30, \u00b6 12, 111 P.3d 220, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u00b626 Somont moved the District Court to include in its final judgment an award of costs and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 82-1-202(1), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">If the lessee or assignee thereof neglects or <em>refuses to execute a release </em>as provided by this part, the owner of the leased premises may sue in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain the release, and in such action he also may recover from the lessee, his successor, or assigns the sum of $100 as damages, all costs, together with a <em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for preparing and prosecuting the suit, </em>and any additional damages that the evidence in the case warrants. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b627 Following the second trial, the District Court denied both parties any attorney fees or costs, rationalizing that no \u201cprevailing party\u201d existed, as \u201cboth Somont and C-W gained and both Somont and C-W lost in this litigation in relation to the original complaint.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b628  Somont originally filed suit to compel C-W to execute releases on twenty-eight leases at issue. Although C-W initially refused, it eventually executed releases on twenty of the leases, leaving eight for the jury to address in the first trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, prior to the initial trial, Somont had prevailed on twenty of the twenty-eight leases at issue. At the second trial, Somont prevailed on three more leases. Even before our decision to reverse on the five other leases, Somont was the prevailing party on twenty-three leases when the District Court issued its order and therefore, we hold that it abused its discretion in not granting Somont reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b629 Reversed and remanded for determination of reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\u00b630 1. Did the District Court err in concluding as a matter of law that the leases at issue had failed to produce in paying quantities?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">\u00b631 Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is <em>de novo. </em>Therefore, we apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria as applied by the district court. Pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>56, M.R.Civ.P., the movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred. <em>Howard v. St. James Community Hospital, </em>2006 MT 23, \u00b6 14, 331 Mont. 60, \u00b6 14, 129 P.3d 126, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b632 Prior to trial, Somont sought summary judgment on the theory that C-W had forfeited and terminated all eight leases based upon evidence produced at the first trial and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Somont I. </em>The District Court granted the motion in part, concluding that \u201c[sjummary judgment that the leases in question failed to produce in paying quantities is appropriate as is an order limiting the scope of the evidentiary inquiry at the second trial in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b633 As previously noted, we established in <em>Somont I </em>that \u201cactions commenced to terminate oil and gas leases invoke two distinct inquiries: (1) Is the lease producing in paying quantities?; and (2) If not, was the cessation in production permanent or temporary?\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 33. C-W argues that the District Court incorrectly interpreted our holding in <em>Somont I </em>when it limited retrial to the second inquiry. According to C-W, this Court specifically did <em>not </em>limit the new trial issues to consideration of the second prong of the <em>Somont I </em>test. Therefore, C-W contends, the District Court should have denied summary judgment altogether and allowed the jury to address both prongs of the test. We disagree with C-W\u2019s assertion that this Court did not answer the first inquiry of the two-part test established in <em>Somont I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b634 In <em>Somont I, </em>we concluded that the District Court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to consider oil prices, economic considerations, and C-W\u2019s financial condition in determining whether oil and gas leases had terminated due to a lack of production. <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 23. In reaching this conclusion, we \u201cadopt[ed] the temporary cessation of production doctrine as it applies to the oil and gas arena,\u201d <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6 28, thereby expanding upon our earlier decision in <em>Christianson v. A.A. Oil Corp. and Byrne </em>(1973), 161 Mont. 420, 506 P.2d 1369. <em>Somont I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30 and 35 (\u201c[t]he equitable notions contemplated [in Christianson] remain valid considerations but apply only to the \u2018producing in paying quantities\u2019 prong of the two-part test\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In adopting the second inquiry and thus instituting a two-part test, we specifically concluded that Somont answered the first inquiry when we stated that <em>\u201cSomont established at trial that the leases failed to produce in paying quantities ...\u201d Somont I, </em>\u00b6 30 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b635 In addition to concluding that Somont satisfied the first inquiry in the initial trial, we noted in our summary to the second issue that \u201cC-W has not yet had an opportunity to present its evidence in accordance with the temporary cessation of production factors adopted herein.\u201d <em>Somont </em>I, \u00b6 36. Given that we had previously adopted the first inquiry of the two-part test in <em>Christianson, </em>the factors adopted in <em>Somont I </em>related to the second inquiry and the way in which we deemed that question should be answered-that is, whether cessation of production was caused by sudden involuntary stoppages or mechanical breakdown of the wells on the leases, and whether C-W engaged in diligent efforts to immediately restore production.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b636  In light of the above holdings, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it granted partial summary judgment, limiting retrial to the second inquiry articulated in <em>Somont I </em>(whether the cessation in production was temporary or permanent).</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b637 2. Did the District Court err in limiting the time frame for which evidence could be presented regarding the restoration of production to the leases?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b638 When reviewing a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, our standard of review is whether the court abused its discretion. The district court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence. We will not reverse the district court unless the error is of such character to have affected the result. <em>Payne v. Knutson, </em>2004 MT 271, \u00b6 20, 323 Mont. 165, \u00b6 20, 99 P.3d 200, \u00b6 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b639 At retrial, the District Court chose January 1, 1996, to April 10, 1998, as the examination period for determining whether the non-producing leases resumed production. The court selected April 10, 1998. as the final date because it was the day Somont wrote C-W a letter stating that five of the eight leases had terminated. C-W argues that the court abused its discretion in selecting this period of examination because C-W should have been allowed to submit evidence that some of the leases resumed production after April 10, 1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u00b640  In light of our conclusion on Issue I of Somont\u2019s appeal-that C-W failed to meet its burden of proving that the majority of leases failed to operate due to a sudden stoppage of the wells or a mechanical breakdown of the equipment-we do not need to reach the question of whether the District Court erred in limiting the time frame for which evidence could be presented regarding the restoration of production to the leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b91-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Period 1996-April 10, 1998</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b91-30\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> See Appendix 1 for a chart summary of Exhibit 538.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-11\"> The District Court stated in its October 26, 2004, judgment that the parties initially disputed twenty-five leases, resolving seventeen before the first trial. Because <em>Somont I </em>and the parties\u2019 briefs state that Somont commenced litigation on twenty-eight leases and C-W released twenty prior to the first trial, we have chosen to apply these latter figures. In any event, the result would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\"> Notably, while the District Court chose April 10,1998, as the end date, the court still permitted C-W to introduce evidence of any efforts it made to restore production after that date, so long as C-W showed that the effort resulted from a course of action taken prior to April 10,1998. C-W offered no such evidence at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
