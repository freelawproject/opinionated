Angela appeals. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in affirming the HRC\u2019s reversal of the Final Agency Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\u00b63 On January 29, 2001, Angela filed three Complaints with the HRC. In her Complaints, Angela alleged that Fred and Janet, doing business as the R&amp;R Lounge and Casino; Good Time Charlie\u2019s Restaurant; and Cody Bill\u2019s Steakhouse (collectively referred to hereinafter as \u201cRespondents\u201d), discriminated against Angela in her employment on the basis of sex when she was subjected to a sexually hostile and offensive work environment. Janet owned all three businesses and Fred managed some or all of the businesses for Janet. Angela alleged in her Complaints that Fred sexually harassed her and that when she objected to this hostile work environment, Janet forced her to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\u00b64 Angela worked from 6:00 p.m. until 2:00 a.m. as a bartender for Respondents. She claimed that she specifically requested this evening shift when she was hired because she is a single mother and the daycare and kindergarten schedule for her daughter required continuity of care and transportation. Angela alleged in her Complaint that after she complained to Janet about Fred\u2019s conduct, Janet changed the work schedule and switched Angela to day shifts. According to Angela, when she called Janet to protest the change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>shifts and to inform Janet that she could not work those shifts because of her child, Janet told her that if she couldn\u2019t work the day shifts she would have to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b65 On July 30, 2001, after investigating Angela\u2019s Complaints, the HRC issued a finding of reasonable cause to believe that the Complaints had merit. The HRC consolidated the three cases and a contested case hearing was conducted by a Hearing Examiner on April 8-11, 2002. The Hearing Examiner issued a Final Agency Decision on July 19, 2002, wherein he found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">9. In 1990, ten years before [Angela] came to work for [Janet], three former employees of the business filed Human Rights Act complaints of sex discrimination, alleging that [Fred] had subjected them to harassment and hostile treatment because of their sex (female). After a 1991 consolidated contested case hearing on all three complaints, the hearing officer issued a proposed commission decision finding against two of the charging parties and in favor of the third.... The cases settled before the Commission acted upon the proposed decision....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">11. In the course of his work in the business, [Fred] frequently would visit with customers and employees in the bar. He often embarked upon sexual flirtations with women, sometimes touching them. He made suggestive comments about individuals\u2019 attire or bodies. He sometimes used sexually explicit words to describe individuals. He sometimes displayed sexually suggestive objects (such as thong underwear with the business\u2019 name on it) in the workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">13. In December of2000, [Fred] told [Angela] she was required to wear an elf costume to work for Christmas. [Angela] resisted, because she thought the costume was unflattering and humiliating. [Fred] insisted that she not only wear it, but try it on for him. After continued resistance, she agreed to try on the costume, because he was one of her supervisors. Because she was already wary of [Fred], she agreed with a fellow employee, Rochelle Johnson Spencer, that if Spencer did not see [Angela] within five minutes after [Angela] went downstairs with [Fred], [Spencer] should come looking for her. [Fred] took [Angela] downstairs, and gave her a costume to try on in the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom, he stayed outside the door asking her how it fit, and asking her to come out. Very uncomfortable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>[Angela] finally emerged from the bathroom. At that point, [Fred] began touching and feeling the costume, getting down on his knees and stroking first the outside of [Angela\u2019s] legs in the costume (tightly fitting tights) and then the insides of [Angela\u2019s] legs. [Angela] was \u201cfrozen\u201d and did not know what to do. At that point, Spencer came downstairs and [Fred] stopped touching [Angela] and got to his feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">20. [Janet] redid the work schedule and changed [Angela] to day shifts. [Janet] rationalized this change as necessary because [Angela\u2019s] family was too frequently in the bar and casino when [Angela] was working, because [Angela] was not performing acceptably, because [Angela\u2019s] family included \u201cundesirables,\u201d because [Angela] herself had faced criminal charges and because [Angela] required more training. In fact, [Janet] changed [Angela\u2019s] shift as the first step in a plan to either force [Angela] to quit or to fire here because she had complained about [Fred]. [Janet] also changed the schedules for a number of other employees at the same time. Those changes did not transform her motives for changing [Angela\u2019s] schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b66 Based in part on these facts, the Hearing Examiner determined that Respondents illegally discriminated against Angela by subjecting her to sexual harassment in her employment in a continuing course of conduct. The Hearing Examiner awarded Angela $1050.83 for lost wages and prejudgment interest, as well as $7000.00 for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b67 Respondents appealed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision to the Human Rights Commission contending that this case should have been pleaded as a retaliation case. Respondents did not dispute the Findings of Fact in the Final Agency Decision, instead, they contested the application of the law to those findings. On December 30, 2002, after listening to argument and reviewing the record, the HRC issued its Order Reversing Final Agency Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b68 Angela petitioned for judicial review. On April 15, 2004, the District Court entered an Order affirming the HRC\u2019s determination. Angela then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Connell v. State, Dept. of Social Services </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 491, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>494, 930 P.2d 88, 90 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court erred in affirming the HRC\u2019s reversal of the Final Agency Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b611 In its Final Agency Decision, the Hearing Examiner concluded that Respondents unlawfully altered the terms of Angela\u2019s employment by making sexual harassment a condition of her employment. Angela contends on appeal that the HRC and the District Court erred by reversing the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision after they improperly reweighed the facts. Angela argues that Montana law prohibits the HRC from rejecting or modifying the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings of fact unless it states with particularity that those findings were not based on competent substantial evidence. Here, Angela claims that those findings were, indeed, based on competent substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b612 Angela also argues that the HRC and the District Court erred in concluding that this case should have been, but was not, pleaded as a retaliation claim. Angela maintains that retaliation was pleaded, but the Hearing Examiner applied the law to the facts as he found them and concluded that the facts proved a discriminatory hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b613 Respondents contend that Angela did not appeal the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding and conclusion that Angela failed to timely plead a retaliation claim. Respondents maintain that because Angela argues for the first time on appeal that she properly pleaded a retaliation claim, she has waived her right to argue that the Hearing Examiner was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b6 14 Respondents also maintain that the Hearing Examiner found that Fred\u2019s conduct did not create a hostile work environment, rather, it was Janet\u2019s reaction to Angela\u2019s complaint that created the hostile work environment. Consequently, Respondents contend that because Janet\u2019s conduct was not driven by Angela\u2019s sex, it cannot be used to support a claim of a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b615 We do not address the issue of whether Angela failed to properly plead a retaliation claim as we find Angela\u2019s claim regarding a hostile work environment dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u00b616 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d <em>Beaver v. DNRC, </em>2003 MT 287, \u00b6 29, 318 Mont. 35, \u00b6 29, 78 P.3d 857, \u00b6 29 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b617 Montana law also prohibits employment discrimination based on sex. <em>See </em>\u00a7 49-2-303(1), MCA. Because the Montana Human Rights Act was closely modeled after Title VII, we have determined that \u201creference to federal case law is both appropriate and helpful\u201d in construing the Montana Human Rights Act. <em>Harrison v. Chance </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 215, 221, 797 P.2d 200, 204 (citing <em>Johnson v. Bozeman School Dist. No. </em>7 (1987), 226 Mont. 134, 139, 734 P.2d 209, 212).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b618 The United States Supreme Court has held that under Title VII, \u201c[wlithout question, when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate\u2019s sex, that supervisor \u2018discriminate[s]\u2019 on the basis of sex.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 221, 797 P.2d at 204 (quoting <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 57, 64, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49). This Court similarly held in <em>Harrison </em>that sexual harassment is sexual discrimination under the Montana Human Rights Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">When sexual harassment is directed at an employee solely because of gender, the employee is faced with a working environment fundamentally different from that faced by an employee of the opposite gender. That difference constitutes sexual discrimination in employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\"><em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 221, 797 P.2d at 204 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b619 There are two forms of sexual harassment that violate Title VII\u2019s prohibition against workplace discrimination: (1) harassment that involves the conditioning of concrete employment benefits on sexual favors <em>(quid pro </em>quo); and (2) harassment that creates a hostile or offensive work environment. <em>Meritor, </em>477 U.S. at 62, 106 S.Ct. at 2403.</p>\n<p id=\"Abc\">\u00b620 The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the EEOC) determined long ago that \u201cTitle VII affords employees the right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult.\u201d <em>Meritor, </em>477 U.S. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 2405. In 1980, the EEOC promulgated the following guidelines in identifying sexual harassment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\u2019s employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions, affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 221, 797 P.2d at 203-04 (quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b621 Furthermore, in <em>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. </em>(1993), 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 371, 126 L.Ed.2d 295, the United States Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">whether an environment is \u201chostile\u201d or \u201cabusive\u201d can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it reasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance. The effect on the employee\u2019s psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b622 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Angela needed to satisfy all of the following elements to prove her claim of a hostile work environment':</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">1. she was subjected to verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">2. the conduct was unwelcome; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">3. her workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\"><em>Meritor, All </em>U.S. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 2404-05. The Hearing Examiner found in Angela\u2019s favor and determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">[Fred] did subject [Angela] to verbal and physical conduct of a harassing nature and the conduct was unwelcome. However, until [Angela] complained to [Janet], the conduct was borderline with regard to whether it was severe or pervasive enough to alter the conditions of [Angela\u2019s] employment and create a hostile work environment .... <em>The circumstance that created the hostile environment was [Janet\u2019s] reaction to the complaint. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u00b623 In reversing the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, the HRC determined that retaliation or retaliatory conduct by Janet was not the type of conduct referred to in the three-prong test for hostile work environment and that while the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings may support a conclusion that Janet\u2019s conduct was retaliatory, the findings do not support a conclusion that Janet\u2019s conduct was driven by Angela\u2019s sex. Consequently, the HRC determined that Janet\u2019s conduct could not be used to support the elements in a claim for hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b624 Respondents are correct in asserting that to be actionable under Title VII and the Montana Human Rights Act, sexual harassment must be because of gender. <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 75, 79-80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 1002, 140 L.Ed.2d 201; <em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 221, 797 P.2d at 204. The express language contained in Title VII and the MHRA only makes it unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate \u201cbecause of ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1); \u00a7 49-2-303(1)(a), MCA. Or, as Respondents point out, there can be no sexual harassment where actions are taken regardless of \u201cgender\u201d or \u201csex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b625 However, Respondents are incorrect when they maintain that Angela must use only evidence of Fred\u2019s conduct toward her to prove her claim for a hostile work environment. Respondents, the HRC and the District Court take too narrow a view when they conclude that Janet\u2019s conduct could not have been premised upon sex. The fact is that Angela was subjected to a hostile work environment by virtue of her sex and Janet\u2019s refusal to confront that problem along with her statement that Angela should put up with it, is sufficient to impose liability on Janet as the employer. To hold otherwise simply ignores the vicarious liability that Janet must suffer for failure to remedy the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b626 In <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 775, 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d 662, the United States Supreme Court adopted the following holding \u201cto accommodate the principle of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VU\u2019s equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees.\u201d To that end the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">[a]n employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proofby a preponderance of the evidence.... <em>No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor\u2019s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. at 2292-93 (citing <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 742, 762-63, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 2269, 141 L.Ed.2d 633).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b627 Similarly, this Court has previously held that \u201cculpable acts of continuing discrimination in the work place primarily [take] the form of the <em>employer\u2019s </em>failure to seriously and adequately investigate and discipline [the harasser] following the assault and the <em>employer\u2019s </em>subsequent failure to protect [the victim] on the job.\u201d <em>Benjamin v. Anderson, </em>2005 MT 123, \u00b6 54, 327 Mont. 173, \u00b6 54, 112 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 54 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b628  In this case, Fred\u2019s harassment culminated in a tangible employment action-an \u201cundesirable reassignment\u201d to a schedule that Angela was unable to work because of her child, thereby forcing Angela to quit. Moreover, when Angela complained to Janet about Fred\u2019s behavior, rather than disciplining Fred or attempting to protect Angela on the job, Janet told Angela that as a bartender Angela would need to be able to deal with sexual comments and that people misunderstood Fred because he is overly friendly. By failing to do anything to change Fred\u2019s behavior, Janet created a workplace permeated with discriminatory intimidation that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of Angela\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment. <em>Beaver, </em>\u00b6 30 (citing <em>Meritor, 477 </em>U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b629 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that \u00b6 23 of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s Findings of Fact is dispositive of this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">[Janet] did not tolerate a female employee criticizing her son\u2019s behavior toward women. Because of her refusal to consider any complaints against [Fred], and her hostile acts toward [Angela] because she complained, <em>[Janet] made it a condition of employment that [Angela] endure [Fred\u2019s] conduct without complaining or resisting. </em>[Janet] had notice of prior complaints regarding sexual harassment of female employees by [Fred]. She rejected all such complaints. [Janet] does not believe that her son ever sexually harassed anyone at any time, or that he ever would. [Fred\u2019s] conduct toward [Angela] and around her was offensive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>but it was [Janet\u2019s] response to [Angela\u2019s] complaint that created the hostile environment that [Angela] had feared. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b630  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in affirming the HRC\u2019s reversal of the Final Agency Decision and we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b631 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
