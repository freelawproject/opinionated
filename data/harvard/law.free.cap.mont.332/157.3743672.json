We reverse and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are dispositive on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in granting the Polaseks\u2019 petition for contact with their grandchild, Olivia?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">\u00b64 Does Petra\u2019s failure to timely notify the Attorney General of her challenge to the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA, procedurally bar her appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">\u00b65 Petra and Alexander Omura (Alexander), Olivia\u2019s father, were married in 1996, and they subsequently divorced in 1997 when Olivia was six months old. After the divorce, Petra became the primary custodial parent, and she and Olivia moved from Montana to Grosse Point, Michigan, to live with the Polaseks. Petra and Olivia stayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>with the Polaseks for three to five months before they moved into their own house. They later moved from Grosse Point to Rochester, Minnesota, in the fall of 1999. Daniela Polasek stayed with Petra and Olivia in October and November 1999 to assist in the transition. However, sometime in November Petra and Daniela had a falling out, resulting in Daniela returning to Grosse Point.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b66 From the time of Petra\u2019s divorce in August 1997 until November 1999, the Polaseks provided substantial care for Olivia while Petra, a physician, worked and studied for her Boards. Despite Polaseks\u2019 submission of affidavits on Petra\u2019s behalf in a later custody dispute with Alexander, and despite Petra\u2019s assurances-including a written promise-that she would permit future visits between her parents and Olivia, the relationship did not improve. Eventually, Petra forbade all contact between the Polaseks and Olivia, including communication by telephone and mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b67 As Intervenors in the dissolution action between Alexander and Petra, the Polaseks filed a petition for contact with Olivia on February 2, 2004, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 40-9-101 <em>et seq., </em>MCA. Following a bench trial, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order on February 9, 2005, granting the Polaseks unsupervised contact with Olivia on the third weekend of every other month and for two weeks every summer. In addition, the Polaseks were granted the right of telephone contact once per week and of correspondence by mail. The District Court also ordered the parties to attend trans-parenting classes. From this order Petra appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b68 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes for correctness.\u201d <em>In re </em>T.H., 2005 MT 237, \u00b6 35, 328 Mont. 428, \u00b6 35, 121 P.3d 541, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in granting the Polaseks\u2019 petition for contact with their grandchild, Olivia?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u00b610 Petra argues that, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, in order to determine the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>required in \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a court must first determine whether the child\u2019s custodial parent is unfit or abusive or whether the child is dependent or neglected. Absent such a finding, Petra contends, the court must conclude that the parent\u2019s wishes regarding grandparent contact comprise the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child. Alternatively, Petra argues that <em>Troocel </em>requires a court considering a grandparent contact petition to assign \u201cspecial weight\u201d to a fit parent\u2019s wishes when determining what is in a child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b611 The Polaseks respond that <em>Troocel </em>does not require grandparent contact to be awarded <em>only </em>where a parent is unfit or abusive or where the child is dependent or neglected. They contend that the District Court properly applied the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Abl\">\u00b612 In <em>Troxel, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered whether a Washington nonparental visitation statute infringed upon a parent\u2019s fundamental right \u201cto make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control\u201d of her children. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d at 57. The plurality opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> written by Justice O\u2019Connor and joined by three other justices described the statute at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">According to the statute\u2019s text, <em>\u201cany person </em>may petition the court for visitation rights <em>at any time,\u201d </em>and the court may grant such visitation rights whenever \u201cvisitation may serve <em>the best interest of the child.\u201d ... </em>[I]n practical effect, in the State of Washington a court can disregard and overturn <em>any </em>decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 67, 120 S.Ct. at 2061, 147 L.Ed.2d at 57-58 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b613 The Troxels, paternal grandparents to Granville\u2019s two daughters, petitioned for visitation with their grandchildren. Granville had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>willing to provide the Troxels some visitation with her children but not as much as the Troxels sought. The trial court granted the Troxels\u2019 petition, but the Washington Court of Appeals reversed that decision. The Washington Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, concluding that the visitation statute as written violated the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the Washington Supreme Court under a different rationale. The plurality concluded that the statute-as applied to Granville, rather than as written-was unconstitutional, reasoning that: the language emphasized in the above quotation made the statute \u201cbreathtakingly broad,\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 67, 120 S.Ct. at 2061, 147 L.Ed.2d at 57; the trial court failed to give any special weight to the fit parent\u2019s wishes, <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 69, 120 S.Ct. at 2062, 147 L.Ed.2d at 58; and, the trial court improperly apphed a \u201cpresumption in favor of grandparent visitation,\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 72, 120 S.Ct. at 2063, 147 L.Ed.2d at 60. The plurality emphasized that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children,\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d at 57, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">[S]o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children. See, <em>e.g., Flores, </em>507 U.S. at 304.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">The problem here is not that the Washington Superior Court intervened, but that when it did so, it gave no special weight at all to Granville\u2019s determination of her daughters\u2019best interests. More importantly, it appears that the Superior Court applied exactly the opposite presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\"><em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68-69, 120 S.Ct. at 2061-62, 147 L.Ed.2d at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"AR-\">\u00b614 The <em>Troxel </em>plurality opinion is consistent with our jurisprudence and helps guide our construction of the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard contained in Montana\u2019s grandparent contact statute. <em>Troxel </em>held that parents have a fundamental constitutional right \u201cto make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children,\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d at 57, and we have likewise held that \u201c[i]t is well-established that a natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of his or her child is a fundamental liberty interest <em>...\u201dIn re C.R.O., </em>2002 MT 50, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 48, \u00b6 10, 43 P.3d 913, \u00b6 10. Further, parents are presumed to act in their child\u2019s best interest. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68, 120 S.Ct. at 2061, 147 L.Ed.2d at 58 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>(citing <em>Parham v. J.R. </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 584, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b615  Thus, <em>Troxel </em>instructs that when a grandparent petitions for contact with a grandchild, a court must first inquire whether the child\u2019s parent is fit; that is, the court must determine whether the parent \u201cadequately cares for his or her children.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68, 120 S.Ct. at 2061, 147 L.Ed.2d at 58. If the parent is fit, a presumption arises in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes because \u201cthe Due Process Clause does not permit a State to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make childrearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a \u2018better\u2019 decision could be made.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 72-73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064, 147 L.Ed.2d at 61. If the parent is not fit, no presumption arises and the parent\u2019s wishes are due no deference.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The close scrutiny that we apply to any infringement on a person\u2019s right to parent a child, <em>see In re Guardianship of Aschenbrenner </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 540, 544-45, 597 P.2d 1156, 1160, and Pierce <em>v. Pierce </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 255, 260, 645 P.2d 1353, 1356, requires that the petitioning grandparent prove by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to have contact with the grandparent, and, in the case of an objecting fit parent, that the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes has been rebutted. <em>See Evans v. McTaggart </em>(Alaska 2004), 88 P.3d 1078 (holding that requiring a petitioner to establish by clear and convincing evidence that visitation is in the best interests of the child would provide effective protection for a parent\u2019s choice, except where the choice is plainly contrary to a child\u2019s best interests); <em>cf. In re Custody &amp; Parental Rights of P.M., </em>1998 MT 264, \u00b6 12, 291 Mont. 297, \u00b6 12, 967 P.2d 792, \u00b6 12 (a party seeking termination of parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that every requirement set forth in the statute has been satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b616 Here, there is no indication that the District Court inquired into Petra\u2019s fitness as a parent. Moreover, the District Court failed to accord Petra\u2019s wishes any deference. To the contrary, in its findings of fact the District Court referred to her wishes only dismissively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">Other than Petra and Dr. Allen\u2019s [Olivia\u2019s clinical psychologist] concern that the grandparents may impart something negative about the mother, there is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that unfettered visitation between grandparents and child would be in anyway [sic] harmful to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00b617  We express no opinion regarding Petra\u2019s fitness as a-parent or on the weight of the evidence in the case. However, because the District Court did not apply the correct analysis, as outlined above, we reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AEt\">\u00b618 Does Petra\u2019s failure to notify the Attorney General of her challenge to the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA, procedurally bar her appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b619 The Polaseks contend that this Court should not consider Petra\u2019s appeal because she failed to notify the Attorney General of her challenge to the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA-which they argue is an attack upon the statute\u2019s constitutionality-as required by Rule 24(d), M.R.Civ.P., and Rule 38, M.R.App.P. Petra replies that Rule 24(d), M.R.Civ.P., requires notice to the Attorney General only when a party brings a facial constitutional challenge to a statute, not when a party challenges a court\u2019s unconstitutional application of a statute, as she contends that she does here. In any event, Petra maintains, notice was given to the Attorney General in accordance with Rule 38, M.R.App.P., albeit belatedly, and the Attorney General has not intervened, which Petra argues cures any failure to notify that office pursuant to Rule 24(d), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b620  We need not address the merits of either argument. The issue raised by Petra and briefed in this appeal is not whether the best interest standard for grandparent-grandchild contact set forth in \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA, is unconstitutional. Indeed, <em>Troxel </em>does not mandate that the statute be rendered unconstitutional, and we have not declared it to be. Rather, the issue Petra has raised is whether use of the statute\u2019s best interest standard, without first considering the requirements of <em>Troxel, </em>violated her due process rights. Our decision today requires that grandparent proceedings must begin, in accordance with <em>Troxel, </em>with the presumption that a fit parent acts in the child\u2019s best interest. From that point of beginning, the statute\u2019s best interest standard, as enacted, remains intact as the standard by which a grandparent\u2019s request for contact must be judged. Although arguably an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to the statute, Petra\u2019s appeal, in reality, is a request for proper delineation of parental rights which must precede application of the grandparent visitation statute and the best interest standard stated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b621 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-14\"> The caption of the case has been changed to conform to the requirements of \u00a7 40-9-101(2), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\"> Section 40-9-102(2), MCA, reads as follows: \u201cGrandparent-grandchild contact granted under this section may be granted only upon a finding by the court, after a hearing, that the contact would be in the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\"> The Polaseks also argue that Petra\u2019s violation of her written promise that they would be permitted contact with Olivia constitutes a breach of contract. However, no breach of contract theory was raised below, and we will not consider it here. <em>In re Estate of Kinds father, </em>2005 MT 51, \u00b6 34, 326 Mont. 192, \u00b6 34, 108 P.3d 487, \u00b6 34 (\u201cThis Court has long held that it will not address either as issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\"> Justices Souter and Thomas filed separate concurring opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\"> We express no opinion about what implications, if any, a determination in a grandparent contact proceeding that a parent is not fit may have in other contexts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
