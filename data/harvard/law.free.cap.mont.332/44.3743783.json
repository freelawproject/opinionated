He contests the fairness of his trial on multiple grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in its jury instruction no. 12 concerning the requisite mental state for deliberate homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in failing to give a specific instruction on proximate cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">\u00b65 3. Was Dubois\u2019 counsel ineffective in not offering an instruction on proximate cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in denying Dubois\u2019 motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor, in cross-examining a defense witness, described him as a gangster?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court err in not granting Dubois a mistrial because, in closing argument, the prosecutor used the word \u201clie\u201d in referring to a statement by Dubois?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">\u00b68 The events leading to this appeal occurred on March 15, 2003. Dubois chose to testify at his trial. According to Dubois, he went to the home of Dion Guckeen (Guckeen) with his friend Herman Belgarde (Belgarde) to procure methamphetamine. While Belgarde was in another room, Guckeen told Dubois that he was a paranoid schizophrenic and could get away with killing Dubois. Dubois went into the other room and related these statements to Belgarde. Belgarde told Dubois not to worry and gave him a small baseball bat. When Dubois and Belgarde left the room, they found Guckeen holding a gun. Belgarde took the gun from Guckeen, removed all the bullets except one, and gave the gun back to Guckeen. Dubois left Guckeen\u2019s house and eventually got a ride back to his home from a local resident, to whom Dubois gave the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">\u00b69 Dubois said that Belgarde then called him, telling him to come back to Guckeen\u2019s house because methamphetamine was available there, and that he could safely return. Dubois said he tried to drive to Guckeen\u2019s house but got lost, and Belgarde sent friends to pick him up. Dubois took a large flashlight with him for defense. When Dubois arrived, there was no methamphetamine. Guckeen accused Dubois of sleeping with his girlfriend, which Dubois denied. Dubois then said that Guckeen pulled a gun from under a cushion he was sitting on. Dubois grabbed another baseball bat and left Guckeen\u2019s house with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Belgarde, Linda Scott (Scott), and Misty Palmerton (Palmerton).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b610 Dubois went on to say that, after dropping off Belgarde, he stayed with Scott and Palmerton, who promised they were going to go party. The three went back to Guckeen\u2019s house, where Dubois felt a tense atmosphere. Guckeen kept looking at Dubois and then at the cushion where the gun had previously been. Guckeen then reached under that same cushion, and Dubois, thinking Guckeen was reaching for the gun he had seen earlier, hit him in the head with the baseball bat. Dubois did not think the first hit had done anything to Guckeen, so he hit Guckeen twice more in the head. Dubois thus claimed that he acted in self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b611 According to Dubois, another man in the room, Tony Sambenedetto (Sambenedetto), appeared to be reaching for another bat, and Dubois told him not to. Sambenedetto then left. Dubois did not admit hitting Sambenedetto with the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b612 Dubois said Scott told him to call 911, which required him to leave the house. Palmerton went with Dubois, who took the bat. When they returned to the house, Palmerton suggested that they all lie to the police and say that they found Guckeen already injured, and she said she would tell Scott what to tell the police. Dubois initially lied to the police about what happened, saying that he found the bat and held it in safekeeping for the authorities. After Dubois learned that Palmerton and Scott had told the police what actually happened, he explained why he hit Guckeen with the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b613 The State\u2019s witnesses contradicted many parts of Dubois\u2019 story. According to Scott, she had been at the house earlier in the day when Guckeen, Dubois, Belgarde, and Sambenedetto were all present, and they appeared to be just sitting around talking. When Scott returned later with Palmerton, she heard neither arguing nor an exchange of bad words.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b614 Palmerton said she saw Dubois hit Guckeen in the head with the bat, and she yelled at Dubois as he walked away. Dubois then turned and headed back toward Guckeen. Palmerton jumped in front of Dubois, but he threw her into the wall and hit Guckeen in the head again. Palmerton then saw Dubois approach Sambenedetto, who put his arms up for protection. Dubois swung the bat at Sambenedetto\u2019s arms and told him to leave. According to Palmerton, Dubois told her to lie and say they found the baseball bat in the driveway. However, after the police put Palmerton and Scott in a car away from Dubois, Palmerton explained how Dubois had attacked Guckeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\u00b615 Sambenedetto testified that Dubois hit him with the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u00b616 According to Palmerton, Scott, and Sambenedetto, Guckeen did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>not have a gun on March 15, 2003, and none of them heard Guckeen threaten Dubois or argue with him. A friend of Guckeen\u2019s, Tiffany Cook, also said Guckeen did not have a gun that day, and she had never seen a gun at Guckeen\u2019s house. No gun was found in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"AKa\">\u00b617 Dr. Glenn Winslow (Dr. Winslow), a trauma surgeon, and Dr. Karen Fagin (Dr. Fagin), a neurosurgeon, treated Guckeen at Benefis Hospital. Guckeen was comatose and completely unresponsive. His breathing was alternately rapid and slow, which implied damage to the brain stem as well as to the brain itself. Guckeen exhibited limited brainstem function. Guckeen\u2019s treatment included intubation in order to force rapid breathing in an attempt to ease the pressure inside his head, as well as morphine to both ease pressure and alleviate pain. The amount of morphine administered to Guckeen was increased slowly during his time at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b618 Guckeen\u2019s family did not want extraordinary measures taken to keep him alive after being told he would likely never be aware again. Eventually, his breathing tube was removed because he could breathe on his own. Guckeen died on March 17, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b619 Dr. Fagin explained that she had never seen skull fractures as bad as those suffered by Guckeen. She described Guckeen\u2019s brain as pulped, and opined that the swelling was putting pressure on the brainstem. According to Dr. Fagin, barring a miracle, Guckeen would not have survived no matter what surgery was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b620 Dr. Fagin\u2019s opinion was that Guckeen died of traumatic brain injury, and neither morphine nor extubation contributed to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">\u00b621 Dr. Winslow\u2019s opinion was that Guckeen died of a blunt trauma to the head resulting in a closed head injury, with no contribution from morphine or extubation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b622 Dr. Gary Dale, the State Medical Examiner, testified he could not give an opinion what caused Guckeen\u2019s death to a high degree of certainty. He did, however, state that it was his opinion that preexisting conditions did not contribute to Guckeen\u2019s death. His opinion was that, more likely than not, an increased dose of morphine caused Guckeen\u2019s death. However, in his report he listed the cause of Guckeen\u2019s death as unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b623 Dr. Daniel Spitz (Dr. Spitz), a forensic pathologist, testified for the defense. After reviewing Guckeen\u2019s medical records, he gave the opinion that Guckeen died of respiratory failure caused by injuries to the brain and skull, morphine intoxication and extubation. In Dr. Spitz\u2019s opinion, Guckeen was never brain dead, and breathing on his own for over a day suggested his brain stem was relatively intact. Dr. Spitz stated he could not comment on whether Guckeen\u2019s treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ended too early, as a proper brain-death protocol was not performed. He stated he was unable to determine what chance Guckeen had to survive his injuries. He did agree that the injuries were severe enough to possibly cause death regardless of treatment, and that the proximate cause of death was blunt head trauma, which initiated the sequence of events leading to Guckeen\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b624 Dubois was charged by an amended information with Deliberate Homicide in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(1), MCA. He pled not guilty and trial by jury commenced on January 26, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b625 Dubois objected to the District Court\u2019s instruction no. 12. This instruction provided that the element of purpose or knowledge necessary to convict Dubois of deliberate homicide could be established even if Dubois did not contemplate that his blows with the baseball bat would kill Guckeen, if the result involved the same kind of injury that was contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b626 Dubois\u2019 trial counsel did not offer an instruction on whether his actions were the proximate cause of Guckeen\u2019s death. Appellate counsel claims this omission was both plain error and ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b627 One Vicki Algeo (Algeo) testified for the defense at trial. The prosecutor, by use of a leading question on re-cross examination, elicited from this witness that she felt Dubois was a gangster. Dubois moved for a mistrial on this ground, which motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b628 During closing argument, Deputy County Attorney Mary Ann Ries (Ries) characterized one of Dubois\u2019 statements as a lie. Dubois also moved for a mistrial on this ground, which motion was denied. \u00b629 The jury found Dubois guilty of deliberate homicide. The District Court sentenced Dubois to Montana State Prison for life without parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">\u00b630  This Court reviews jury instructions in a criminal case to determine if they fully and fairly instructed the jury on the law applicable to the case. The district court has broad discretion in instructing the jury, and this Court will only find reversible error if a jury instruction prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>State v. Baker, </em>2004 MT 393, \u00b6 14, 325 Mont. 229, \u00b6 14, 104 P.3d 491, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">\u00b631  This Court\u2019s inherent power of common law plain error review is used sparingly, on a case-by-case basis. Plain error review is undertaken only in those cases that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, where failing to review the claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137-38, 915 P.2d 208, 215, <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 21, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 21; <em>State v. Hill, </em>2005 MT 216, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 253, \u00b6 15, 119 P.3d 1210, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b632  In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we apply the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. This Court will only find ineffective assistance of counsel if the petitioner can show that (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cestablish prejudice by demonstrating that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 11, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 11 (quoting <em>State v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 275, \u00b6 14, 70 P.3d 1234, \u00b6 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b633  In deciding a motion for mistrial, a district court must determine whether a defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Aceto, </em>2004 MT 247, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 24, \u00b6 16, 100 P.3d 629, \u00b6 16. A district court properly grants a motion for mistrial when a reasonable possibility exists that inadmissible evidence may have contributed to the conviction. <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 238, \u00b6 24, 113 P.3d 290, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b634 Did the District Court err in its jury instruction no. 12 concerning the requisite mental state for deliberate homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b635 Dubois argues that giving jury instruction no. 12 was error because it did not fit the facts of his case and thus was an incorrect and inapplicable statement of the law. He claims that the giving of this instruction prohibited him from convincing the jury to acquit him on the deliberate homicide charge, even if the jury determined that Guckeen did not die because of the blows from the baseball bat, but instead died from the morphine administered to him in the hospital. \u00b636 Instruction No. 12 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>If purposely or knowingly causing death was not within the contemplation or purpose of the Defendant, either element can nevertheless be established if the result involves the same kind of harm or injury as contemplated but the precise harm or injury was different or occurred in a different way, unless the actual result is too remote or accidental to have a bearing on the Defendant\u2019s liability or on the gravity of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b637 Instruction No. 12 is taken from \u00a7 45-2-201(2)(b), MCA. We interpret this statute to mean that the mental state for deliberate homicide can be established if the result involves the same or similar kind of harm or injury as that which is contemplated by the defendant, even if the degree of injury actually caused was not contemplated by the defendant. <em>State v. Clausell, </em>2001 MT 62, \u00b6 41, 305 Mont. 1, \u00b6 41, 22 P.3d 1111, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b638 Instruction No. 12, as given by the District Court, did not prevent the jury from deciding to acquit Dubois of deliberate homicide, and perhaps convict him of assault. If the jury had believed that Guckeen died from the effects of morphine, rather than the head injuries he received, it could also have determined that the actual result of Dubois\u2019 actions, death, was too remote or accidental to have a bearing on his liability or on the gravity of the offense. And, if the jury so determined, the elements of purpose or knowledge would not have been established, which would in turn result in an acquittal of the charge of deliberate homicide. Indeed, counsel for Dubois argued to the jury that he should perhaps be convicted of aggravated assault and not deliberate homicide, because Guckeen died from morphine, not the blows to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b639  Instruction No. 12 was a correct statement of the law, was applicable to the facts of this case, and did not prevent Dubois from raising a reasonable doubt that he was not guilty of deliberate homicide because Guckeen died from morphine intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b640 Did the District Court err in failing to give a specific instruction on proximate cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u00b641 Dubois argues that, even though he did not offer a jury instruction on proximate cause, this Court should invoke the doctrine of plain error to review the failure of the District Court to give such an instruction, and order a new trial. Dubois argues that without an instruction on proximate cause the jury lacked the means to make a factual finding regarding his central theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u00b642 In order to undertake plain error review, we must determine that not reviewing the claimed error will result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b643 As we explained in our discussion of Issue One, jury instruction no. 12 correctly stated the law. While this instruction explained that the jury did not need to find that Dubois intended to kill Guckeen to find him guilty of deliberate homicide, it did require the jury to determine that Dubois caused Guckeen\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b644 In addition to instruction no. 12, instruction no. 10 listed the elements of deliberate homicide, one of which was that Dubois caused the death of Guckeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b645  We conclude that the jury instructions fully and fairly instructed the jury on deliberate homicide. Thus, the jury was properly instructed. <em>State v. Magruder </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 492, 497, 765 P.2d 716, 719. Under the facts of this case, the lack of a specific proximate cause instruction did not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, did not leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, and did not compromise the integrity of the judicial process. We decline to exercise plain error review and determine that a proximate cause instruction was necessary in order for Dubois to have a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u00b646 Was Dubois\u2019 counsel ineffective in not offering an instruction on proximate cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">\u00b647 Dubois argues that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to offer an instruction on proximate cause because of the defense theory that morphine, not the attack by Dubois, was the proximate cause of Guckeen\u2019s death. He argues that failing to offer an instruction on proximate cause prevented the jury from having means to agree with this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">\u00b648 To assess a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, both on direct appeal and in post-conviction proceedings, this Court applies the two-prong test from <em>Strickland. See Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 20, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 20; <em>State v. Hagen, </em>2002 MT 190, \u00b6 17, 311 Mont. 117, \u00b6 17, 53 P.3d 885, \u00b6 17. The <em>Strickland </em>test requires the defendant to show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 20. It is not necessary to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiency. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of prejudice, that course should be followed. <em>State v. DeMary, </em>2003 MT 307, \u00b6 27, 318 Mont. 200, \u00b6 27, 79 P.3d 817, \u00b6 27 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b649  In order to satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious that he was deprived of a fair trial. As we have determined that a proximate cause instruction was not required in order for Dubois to have a fair trial, his counsel was not ineffective because he did not offer such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b650 Did the District Court err in denying Dubois\u2019 motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor, in cross-examining a defense witness, described him as a gangster?</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b651 During trial, Algeo, a friend and roommate of Guckeen, testified for the defense. During re-cross examination, the following exchange took place between Algeo and Deputy County Attorney Ries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">Q: And when you and Tony were having this conversation, you were trying to figure out why it happened; is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">Q: You were trying to figure out why Rodney would beat your good friend, Dion; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">Q: And you told the detectives that Dion would never threaten, especially-Dion would never threaten his type, referring to Rodney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-14\">Q: And you explained that Rodney is like a gangster, and Dion would never threaten him; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-15\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-16\">Q: Detective Phillips asked you if Dion was that aggressive, do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-17\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-18\">Q: And you said Dion\u2019s not that stupid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-19\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-20\">Q: And you explained to the detective that Dion\u2019s scared to death, you know, he\u2019s not a fighter. He doesn\u2019t like fights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-21\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-22\">Q: Is that accurate? Is that how Dion was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b652 Dubois moved for a mistrial based upon the reference to him as a gangster. The District Court denied this motion, but offered to give a curative instruction if Dubois requested one.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b653 Dubois argues that the State\u2019s use of the term \u201cgangster\u201d in reference to him contributed to his conviction. Dubois argues that the use of this word is inflammatory, prejudicial and violated multiple rules of evidence. He contends that the use of this term undermined his theory of justifiable use of force, because it could have swayed one or more jurors against this theory. Dubois also contends that this term may have caused one or more jurors to wish to punish Dubois in spite of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b654 Algeo used the term \u201cgangster\u201d in her statement to the police and the State could properly question her about it. Further, use of the term \u201cgangster,\u201d given all the evidence at trial, would be unlikely to cause the jury to punish Dubois even if he was not proven guilty. There was substantial other evidence regarding Dubois\u2019 violent behavior and use of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u00b655  Considering the circumstances, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dubois\u2019 motion for a mistrial because of the testimony in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b656 Did the District Court err in not granting Dubois a mistrial because, in closing, the prosecutor used the word \u201clie\u201d in referring to a statement by Dubois?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u00b657 During her closing argument, prosecutor Reis argued to the jury concerning Dubois\u2019 statements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">And [Deputy] Van Dyken asked, he says, does it have to do with dope? And [Dubois] says, I can\u2019t say. Why can\u2019t he say? Because it\u2019s a lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">\u00b658 Dubois moved for a mistrial because Ries said he lied. The District Court agreed that the statement was improper, but denied Dubois\u2019 motion. Dubois accepted the District Court\u2019s offer of the following instruction, which the District Court read to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">The Court has determined that it was improper for the state to characterize a prior statement of Mr. Dubois as a lie. You are instructed that you are to disregard that portion of the state\u2019s argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">You are the sole judges of the credibility of all of the witnesses in this case. You\u2019re further admonished that the closing arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of counsel are not evidence and are not to be considered by you as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b659 This Court has strongly disapproved of characterizing testimony as a lie. <em>State v. Arlington </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 127, 157, 875 P.2d 307, 325. However, we have also explained that \u201cWe are not suggesting that it is reversible error every time counsel mentions the word \u2018lie\u2019 in closing argument.\u201d <em>State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 380, 897 P.2d 1063, 1071. We did conclude in <em>Arlington </em>that the prosecutor committed error in repeatedly suggesting that the defendant had lied, but a new trial was not necessary because of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Arlington, </em>265 Mont. at 158, 875 P.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b660 While Ries\u2019 characterization of a statement by Dubois as a lie was improper, the District Court immediately gave a clear and cogent corrective instruction to the jury, and the evidence of Dubois\u2019 guilt was very substantial. The general rule is that where the trial judge strikes improper statements from the record with an accompanying cautionary instruction to the jury, any error committed by its introduction is presumed cured. <em>State v. Brush </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 247, 251, 741 P.2d 1333, 1335; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 364, 375, 715 P.2d 1301, 1308; <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 334, 345, 599 P.2d 368, 374. Further, as we discussed in <em>Freeman, </em>the jury cannot be presumed to ignore its duty to respect the instructions of the court. <em>Freeman, </em>183 Mont. at 345-46, 599 P.2d at 374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b661  Because the trial court is in the best position to observe the jurors and determine the effect of questionable statements made in closing argument, it is given a latitude of discretion in its rulings on motions for mistrial based on such statements. <em>See State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 27, 327 Mont. 238, \u00b6 27, 113 P.3d 290, \u00b6 27; <em>Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 252-53, 741 P.2d at 1336. Any prejudicial effect the prosecutor\u2019s statement may have had was promptly cured by the District Court\u2019s cautionary instruction to the jury. We conclude, based on the record of this case, that the District Judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Dubois\u2019 motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b662 The judgment and sentence of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
