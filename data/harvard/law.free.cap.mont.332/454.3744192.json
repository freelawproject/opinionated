The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly admitted hearsay testimony from Officer Darcy Dahl that created the evidentiary support for designating J.M. a youth in need of care. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b62 This case involves the welfare of four-year-old J.M., born March 13,2002, to R.M. and L.W., his father and mother, respectively. In July 2003 the Department of Health and Human Services (DPHHS) took protective custody of J.M. and his half-brother, T.W., after police interrupted a domestic disturbance involving L.W., her boyfriend and her parents. At the time of the incident, the boys were running around without shoes in a yard full of broken toys, trash, lawn tools, coolers and other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b63 After initial proceedings in the Third Judicial District Court, the case was transferred to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, upon request by the Powell County Attorney. The court held a dispositional hearing and although L.W. and R.M. chose not to attend, the court approved treatment plans for both parents. Because R.M. resided in jail at the time, a social worker visited R.M. to discuss how he could successfully complete the plan while incarcerated. R.M. did not sign the treatment plan and apparently disagreed -with its implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b64 The court held a review hearing in July 2004, with neither of J.M.\u2019s parents in attendance. At this point, R.M. was still in jail and L.W. had moved to Washington State. Through counsel, R.M. asked the court to conduct another adjudication proceeding regarding J.M. because the State had not properly served R.M. when the matter was in Powell County. The court agreed and an adjudication hearing followed, with the court hearing testimony from R.M., the community social worker on J.M.\u2019s case, and police officer Darcy Dahle.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b65 Officer Dahle testified to a domestic disturbance between R.M. and L.W., which she responded to on the night of January 11,2004. On hearsay grounds, R.M. objected to the admission of Officer Dahle\u2019s testimony regarding statements made by L.W. that evening. The court ruled that because L.W. was upset and distraught, the comments to Officer Dahle were admissible under Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid., the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Officer Dahle testified that L.W. said R.M. became angry after she told him that she was tired of his drinking and was going to leave him; R.M. threatened L.W. that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>she would never see her son again. L.W. said that she ran into the bathroom with her son to get away from R.M., but that R.M. forced his way in, resulting in a tug-of-war over the child. L.W. finally let go because she feared that her child\u2019s arms would be broken. R.M. then left with the child and returned twenty minutes later by himself, at which point he caused L.W. to take a tumble to the ground, prompting her to again run into the bathroom and call someone, who in turn called dispatch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b66 The court adjudicated J.M. a youth in need of care and amended the treatment plan, which R.M. again declined to sign. DPHHS subsequently filed a petition to terminate R.M.\u2019s parental rights, alleging that R.M. had not complied with the treatment plan, and due to continued incarceration, was unable to parent. R.M. waived his personal appearance at the hearing. On October 25,2005, the District Court ordered termination of R.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b67 R.M. appeals, insisting that he never agreed to comply with the treatment plan because the court incorrectly adjudicated J.M. a youth in need of care by relying on impermissible hearsay testimony from Officer Dahle during the adjudication hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b68 When reviewing a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, our standard of review is whether the court abused its discretion. The district court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence. <em>Howard v. St. James Community Hospital, </em>2006 MT 23, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 60, \u00b6 17, 129 P.3d 126, \u00b6 17. Notwithstanding this deferential standard, however, judicial discretion must be guided by the rules and principles of law; thus, our standard of review is plenary to the extent that a discretionary ruling is based on a conclusion of law. In such circumstances, we must determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, \u00b6 17, 134 P.3d 45, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u00b69 Did the District Court properly admit hearsay testimony from Officer Darcy Dahle that provided the evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>support for designating J.M. a youth in need of care?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b610 R.M. argues that in adjudicating J.M. a youth in need of care, the District Court incorrectly admitted Officer Dahle\u2019s testimony regarding statements L.W. made on the night of January 11, 2004. R.M. contends that because L.W. was not present at the adjudication hearing, the statements amount to hearsay under Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid., and therefore should not have been admitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In making this argument, R.M. argues that he had a Sixth Amendment right to confront L.W. under <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, <em>Bonamarte v. Bonamarte </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 170, 174, 866 P.2d 1132, 1134, and Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b611 At the outset, we note that R.M. did not specifically object to Officer Dahle\u2019s testimony on Sixth Amendment confrontation grounds. Even if he had made such an objection, we disagree with R.M.\u2019s contention that <em>Crawford </em>applies to civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b612 In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment confrontation right precludes testimonial hearsay in criminal cases unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b613 R.M. essentially argues that <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>holding applies to civil cases in Montana because of our earlier decision in <em>Bonamarte, </em>263 Mont. at 175, 866 P.2d at 1135, in which we held that \u201cthe principles behind the right to confront witnesses are applicable to civil cases in Montana, as well [as to criminal cases], and that right is guaranteed in Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid.,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">Confrontation. <em>Except as otherwise provided by constitution, statute, these rules, or other rules </em>applicable to the courts of this state, at the trial of an action, a witness can be heard only in the presence and subject to the examination of all the parties to the action, if they choose to attend and examine. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>R.M. maintains that since <em>Bonamarte </em>applies the principles behind the confrontation right to civil cases, the <em>Crawford </em>holding necessarily applies to civil cases, as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b614 As <em>Bonamarte </em>recognizes, Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., states that the confrontation right is subject to exceptions \u201cprovided by constitution, statute, these rules, or other rules applicable.\u201d In other words, if an exception within the rules of evidence applies to a hearsay statement, pursuant to Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., Montana courts permit the testimony in a civil case. The same is not true, however, in a criminal action. The right to confrontation in the criminal realm does not depend upon the rules of evidence, since not all hearsay implicates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s core concerns. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. As the Supreme Court observed, \u201c[Heaving the regulation of out-of-court statements to the law of evidence would render the Confrontation Clause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial practices.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. Thus, in a criminal action, the right to confrontation may preclude a hearsay statement that the rules of evidence would otherwise permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b615  R.M. does not dispute that a hearing to adjudicate a child as a youth in need of care is a civil action. R.M.\u2019s right to confront a witness is therefore subject to Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., and thus any applicable exception to the hearsay rule. In this case, the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception under Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> applies to Officer Dahle\u2019s testimony of L.W.\u2019s statements from June 11, 2004, because L.W. made them immediately after fighting with R.M. and while still visibly upset. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Officer Dahle\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\"> Officer Dahle also testified that she responded to a separate domestic dispute involving L.W. and R.M. on June 10, 2003. During that incident, according to Officer Dahle, L.W. was extremely upset and explained that she and R.M. had been arguing, culminating in R.M. smacking her child into a wall. R.M. did not object to this testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\"> Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid., provides that \u201c[h]earsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 802, M.R.Evid., further provides that \u201c[h]earsay is not admissible except as otherwise provided by statute, these rules, or other rules applicable in the courts of this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\"> <em>Bonamarte </em>involved a dissolution action where the trial court permitted the wife to testify by telephone because she feared her husband. We held that the court abused its discretion in allowing the wife to provide telephonic testimony because it did not afford her husband a meaningful opportunity to confront or cross-examine the witness; it also did not allow the trial court to observe the witness in making its determination of her credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\"><em> </em>Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid., provides that \u201ceven though the declarant is available as a witness ... [a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement by the event or condition\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b458-8\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"A4_\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u00b617 I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion, but not in all that is said.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\u00b618 As noted at \u00b6 11 of the Opinion, R.M.\u2019s objection to Dahle\u2019s testimony was simply that it \u201c[c]all[ed] for hearsay.\u201d The State\u2019s attorney responded that the basis for the admissibility of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>was Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid., the excited utterance exception. R.M. did not respond; he failed to set forth the specific basis for his general hearsay objection. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 63, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 63, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 63 (\u201c[sjpecific objections must be made to portions of testimony deemed inappropriate; broad general objections do not suffice.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b619 Instead, on appeal, for the first time, R.M. recasts his arguments as ones involving confrontation, citing <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1254, 158 L.Ed.2d <em>177; Bonamarte v. Bonamarte </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 170, 866 P.2d 1132; Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid.; and <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458. Moreover, R.M. made no argument in the trial court that Dahl\u2019s statements might not even qualify as excited utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b620 The excited utterance exception is one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid. R.M. failed to articulate his objection to the trial court in a fashion that would have preserved any of his present appeal arguments against Dahl\u2019s testimony which was offered on the basis of the exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b621 Given the posture in which this case reaches us on appeal from the proceedings below, I would arrive at the same result as the Court, but on the basis of the well-established rule that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal, or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 109, 331 Mont. 517, \u00b6 109, 134 P.3d 53, \u00b6 109 (citations omitted). I would not go any further than that, because of the importance of the arguments being raised here for the first time and because of the fundamental nature of the right to parent which is at issue. <em>In re C.R.O., </em>2002 MT 50, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 48, \u00b6 10, 43 P.3d 913, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b622 I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
