(\u201cS &amp; S\u201d). Stacy answered the complaint and asserted a counter-claim. Although the District Court concluded that Sartori breached his fiduciary duties to S &amp; S, the court did not grant damages and/or attorney fees to Stacy, and because the corporation\u2019s loan was under Sartori\u2019s name, the court ordered S &amp; S dissolved unless Stacy paid off or refinanced the loan within a set time.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">\u00b62 We restate the appeal issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in ordering corporate dissolution when it did not find that the corporation had been injured?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in not awarding damages and/or attorney fees to S &amp; S, even though it concluded Sartori breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">\u00b65 In 2003, Stacy, who worked as a truck driver, approached his friend, Sartori, also a trucker, about purchasing a hauling business. Sartori expressed interest in the proposal, and the two men applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>a business loan with First Interstate Bank in Eureka in order to make the purchase. Because Sartori had a good credit history and Stacy did not, the bank agreed to loan Sartori the money. The bank finalized the loan listing \u201cJUSTIN M. SARTORI DBA: S &amp; S TRUCKING\u201d as the borrower. The loan was for a term of years in the amount of $78,493.68. Although the bank did not list Stacy as a borrower on the loan, he nonetheless pledged his logging truck and trailer as collateral. Sartori pledged twenty acres of real property that he owned with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b66 On August 23, 2003, Stacy and Sartori signed the articles of incorporation for S &amp; S, which the Secretary of State approved. While stock certificates were never actually issued, Stacy and Sartori agreed that they would be the only shareholders and would each own an equal number of shares. The partners designated Stacy as President and Sartori as Secretary/Treasurer, and hired Tanya Pluid as the office manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b67 Within weeks after forming the corporation in September 2003, Stacy and Sartori began to realize that they had incompatible working styles. Several incidents occurred in which Sartori did not show up when or where Stacy expected. Stacy came to believe that Sartori was not pulling his weight and therefore proposed some changes in the way the parties initially agreed to pay out earnings from the company\u2019s income. Sartori refused to approve the changes and the relationship further deteriorated. Both men contacted attorneys to see about disentangling from the corporation. Eventually, Stacy scheduled a meeting for November 22,2003, to iron out the parties\u2019 differences, but Sartori refused to attend once he decided the notice was for a board of directors meeting and that Stacy failed to notify him sufficiently in advance per the bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b68 Prior to the November 22, 2003, meeting, Sartori engaged in a number of actions to undermine S &amp; S, including incorporating a new trucking company, Brimstone Enterprise (\u201cBrimstone\u201d), on October 31, 2003. In addition, Sartori contacted the Eureka Post Office to have S &amp; S\u2019s mail forwarded to Sartori\u2019s mail box; he transferred S &amp; S\u2019s Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) number to Brimstone; he cancelled or transferred S &amp; S\u2019s vehicle licenses; he contacted S &amp; S\u2019s suppliers and cancelled or attempted to cancel S &amp; S\u2019s accounts; he closed S &amp; S\u2019s bank account; and he attempted to transfer S &amp; S\u2019s insurance to Brimstone. Sartori also contacted businesses with whom S &amp; S worked in an effort to transfer their business to Brimstone. For example, when Eureka Pellet Mill told Sartori that it was obligated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>honor its contract with S &amp; S, Sartori started getting up early in the morning and hauling sawdust to the Eureka Pellet Mill-on behalf of Brimstone-before Stacy arrived at work. S &amp; S could no longer do interstate business until it received a new DOT number, as Sartori had transferred S &amp; S\u2019s number to Brimstone. Sartori\u2019s actions caused S &amp; S to incur other losses and expenses, including trailer rent, trailer repairs, trip permit fees, and cell phone fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b69 On December 18,2003, Sartori sued Stacy for breach of corporate fiduciary duty and demanded judicial dissolution of S &amp; S. Stacy answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim alleging that Sartori engaged in deceit, intentional interference with a business contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, defamation, and breach of fiduciary duty. The District Court conducted a bench trial and found that \u201cSartori did everything in his power to sabotage S &amp; S after he quit the company on November 17,2003,\u201d and therefore had breached his fiduciary duty to the business. Although the District Court stripped Sartori of his interest in the company and his positions as a director and an officer, the court rejected Stacy\u2019s proposal to keep S &amp; S in business under its current corporate identity. The court disagreed with Stacy\u2019s contention that the loan should stay in place under Sartori\u2019s name until S &amp; S paid it in full, because, while the court explicitly found that Sartori\u2019s actions were \u201ctortious,\u201d it did not believe \u201ctying up Sartori\u2019s credit and property for the next five years\u201d was an appropriate remedy. Thus, the court ordered Sartori removed as a shareholder and director of S &amp; S, and awarded him no compensation for his interest in the corporation. Further, the court held that unless Stacy and/or S &amp; S paid off or refinanced the bank loan by July 1,2005, action would be taken to dissolve the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"A7L\">\u00b610 The court grounded its decision in \u00a7 35-1-938, MCA, which provides that a corporation is subject to judicial dissolution in a proceeding by a shareholder if a deadlock exists. The court noted that neither Stacy nor Sartori disputed that the requisites for judicial dissolution had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b611 In reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, our standard of review is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Leichtfuss v. Dabney, </em>2005 MT 271, \u00b6 21, 329 Mont. 129, \u00b6 21, 122 P.3d 1220, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b612 When reviewing an award of damages, the standard of review is whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Sletteland v. Roberts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>2000 MT 382, \u00b6 36, 304 Mont. 21, \u00b6 36, 16 P.3d 1062, \u00b6 36 (citing <em>Edington v. Creek Oil Co. </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 112, 127, 690 P.2d 970, 978).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b613 1. Did the District Court err in ordering corporate dissolution when it did not find that the corporation had been or was threatened with injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b614 The District Court dissolved S &amp; S pursuant to \u00a7 35-1-938(2), MCA, which states that a district court may dissolve a corporation in a proceeding by a shareholder if it is established that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">(a) the directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock, and <em>irreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered </em>or <em>the business and affairs of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders generally because of the deadlock',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">(b) the directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">(c) the shareholders are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">(d) the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfY\">(Emphases added.) The District Court determined that dissolution of S &amp; S was appropriate pursuant to subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u00b615 Stacy maintains on appeal that, rather than dissolving the corporation, the District Court, using its power under \u00a7 35-1-939, MCA, should have simply removed Sartori as a shareholder and director of the corporation. While Stacy appears to concede that he and Sartori were unable to break their management deadlock as to corporate affairs, he argues that the court failed to find any harm to the corporation per the statutory language. Stacy stresses the fact that S &amp; S is now a twelve-employee company that has thrived in the wake of Sartori\u2019s departure. Since there has been no corporate injury, Stacy argues, there can be no dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">\u00b616  In making this argument, Stacy ignores relevant statutory language. Section 35-1-938(2)(a), MCA, provides that the court may order dissolution if \u201cirreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered or <em>the business and affairs of the corporation can no </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>longer be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders generally because of the deadlock.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.) Stacy and Sartori were S &amp; S\u2019s only shareholders. Although the corporation may not have suffered irreparable injury, the District Court found that the management deadlock led Sartori to take numerous steps to sabotage the corporation. As a result, the business and affairs of S &amp; S could no longer be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders, Stacy and Sartori. The court properly exercised it statutory authority when it dissolved S &amp; S.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b617 In dismissing Stacy\u2019s argument, we note that he cites cases that apply \u00a7 35-1-921(1)(a)(i), MCA, the predecessor to \u00a7 35-1-938, MCA, to support his contention that the District Court only had authority to dissolve the company if it found corporate injury. The earlier statute provided that a corporation can be dissolved in an action \u201cby a shareholder\u201d when it is established that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">the directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs and the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock and that irreparable injury to the corporation is being suffered or is threatened by reason thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Section 35-1-92(1)(a)(i), MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b618 While the earlier rendering includes similarities to the present statute, the two differ in key respects. First of all, under the former statute, irreparable injury is a prerequisite to dissolution. Under the present statute, irreparable injury is listed in the disjunctive and is thus not necessary. Further, the older version does not provide that a \u201ccourt\u201d may dissolve a corporation because \u201cthe business and affairs of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders generally because of the deadlock.\u201d In light of these differences between the two statutes, Stacy\u2019s references to cases discussing the predecessor statute are not pertinent to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"ANL\">\u00b619  We hold that the District Court correctly ordered dissolution of S &amp; S pursuant to \u00a7 35-1-938(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b620 2. Did the District Court err in not awarding damages and/or attorney fees to S &amp; S, even though it concluded Sartori breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation?</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">\u00b621 Stacy argues that, at trial, he proved that S &amp; S sustained damages amounting to $24,585.24 as a consequence of Sartori\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>attempts to compete with and eliminate the company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the District Court did not make a specific dollar finding for the amount Sartori damaged S &amp; S, the court did conclude that Sartori breached his fiduciary duty to S &amp; S, causing damages to the corporation \u201cin excess\u201d of the $4,625.54 Sartori claimed as reimbursement for fuel costs. The court thus held that S &amp; S did not owe Sartori any financial compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b622  While Stacy agrees with the court\u2019s finding that S &amp; S does not owe Sartori reimbursement, he argues that the court erred in not ordering Sartori to pay S &amp; S damages for the amount Sartori damaged the corporation in excess of $4,625.54. We agree. Given that the court clearly found Sartori had damaged S &amp; S in an amount \u201cin excess\u201d of $4,625.54, it was incumbent upon the court to quantify the damages and award appropriate damages to the corporation. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a determination of damages to be paid by Sartori in favor of S &amp; S.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b623  As for Stacy\u2019s request for attorney fees, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying such compensation to S &amp; S, as the agreement terms contained no specific provision entitling attorney fees to the prevailing party in a civil action. <em>National Cas. Co. v. American Bankers Ins., </em>2001 MT 28, \u00b6 27, 304 Mont. 163, \u00b6 27, 19 P.3d 223, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b624 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\"> The damages alleged proved at trial include: $12,000 in lost profit; $4,622.57 in trailer repair; $36 for a new post office box; $30 for a DOT number; $300 for a new MC number; $120 in GVW fees; $3,285 in trip permit fees; $3,600 for rental trailer; and $591.67 in cell phone bills.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b509-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ABM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u00b625 I do not disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis. I respectfully dissent from its Opinion, however, because it is my view that this matter is not properly before us. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">\u00b626 The action underlying this appeal was tried to the District Court. That court filed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment on May 2, 2005. The final substantive part of the judgment provides that Stacy and/or S &amp; S must make arrangements to pay off or refinance the loan at the Bank by July 1, 2005; if the loan has not been renegotiated or paid off by that time, the court is to be notified in writing and \u201cappropriate action will be taken to dissolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>corporation and extinguish the corporation\u2019s liabilities.\u201d Notice of entry of this judgment was filed on June 7, 2005, and Stacy and S &amp; S filed a notice of appeal on June 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b627 The Court interprets this judgment as one ordering corporate dissolution and premises its discussion of the issues raised on that interpretation. In my opinion, the judgment is not one ordering a corporate dissolution, but merely one clarifying that an order or decree of corporate dissolution would be entered in the future absent Stacy and/or S &amp; S satisfying the conditions set forth in the judgment. Consequently, this judgment is not a final judgment from which an appeal can be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b628 Section 35-1-938(2), MCA, does vest discretion in a trial court to dissolve a corporation under the circumstances discussed by the Court. Section 35-1-942, MCA, however, makes it clear that a decree or order of dissolution is necessary to effectuate a judicial dissolution as of a date certain. After the decree of dissolution is filed, the only actions remaining are the winding up and liquidation of the corporation\u2019s business and affairs-under the direction of the trial court-as set forth in other statutes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-1-942, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u00b629 In the present case, the District Court\u2019s judgment was neither a decree nor an order of dissolution. It was, in effect, a warning that such a decree of dissolution would be forthcoming unless certain events occurred. The notice of appeal divested the District Court of further jurisdiction in this matter. For that reason, that court could not address the merits of the motion to dissolve and response to motion to dissolve filed by the parties thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b630 I conclude this appeal is not properly before us because it was not taken from a final judgment. Consequently, and notwithstanding the related year of unnecessary delay in the underlying case, I would dismiss this appeal as prematurely taken and return the case to the District Court for further proceedings. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
