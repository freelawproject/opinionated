He asserts on appeal that the District Court violated bis fundamental constitutional right to be present and appear at all criminal proceedings. Mann also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel based on the jury instructions his appointed counsel, John Keith (Keith) offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\u00b62 We rephrase the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court violated Mann\u2019s constitutional right to appear at all criminal proceedings against him when the court excluded him from a pre-trial meeting that addressed Mann\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, Mann\u2019s request to represent himself, and Keith\u2019s perceptions of bis client.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether Keith\u2019s decision to request jury instructions for the lesser included offenses charged deprived Mann of the right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">\u00b65 Police arrested Mann following an incident at a private residence in Great Falls. Mann remained in a house where he had formerly lived, despite being asked to leave repeatedly. The two female residents told police that Mann threatened them with a small caliber pistol while he remained in their home. The State charged Mann with aggravated burglary and two counts of assault with a weapon. Mann entered a plea of not guilty, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">\u00b66 Cascade County Public Defender Megan Lulf (Lulf) first represented Mann but later cited a conflict and withdrew. The court substituted Keith to represent Mann. Mann informed the court immediately prior to the trial\u2019s outset, however, that he was dissatisfied with Keith\u2019s performance. The court inquired further and determined that no grounds to substitute counsel existed. Mann then announced that he would rather represent himself than proceed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Keith as his attorney. The court informed Mann of the risks he would assume should he choose to represent himself. Mann insisted that he was determined to proceed without counsel. The court then excused Mann from the meeting, and continued the discussion concerning Mann\u2019s representation with Keith and the State on the record, addressing whether the District Court would permit Mann to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b67 Although the court did not ask Keith to respond to Mann\u2019s complaints, Keith proceeded to expound upon Mann\u2019s attitude and his own performance as counsel. He informed the court that Mann would never listen to him and stated twice that Mann had called Keith a liar. Keith further offered that Lulf had withdrawn \u201cbecause she was threatened by Mr. Mann. She was genuinely frightened of him.\u201d Keith also described the deteriorating relationship between him and his client, and asserted on several occasions that he believed Mann would disrupt the proceedings if the court prevented Mann from representing himself. At the conclusion of this somewhat lengthy discussion, the bailiff returned Mann to the courtroom and, unaware of what transpired outside his presence, Mann changed his mind and elected to proceed with Keith as counsel. The prospective jurors entered the room and voir dire began.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b68 Keith offered instructions on the lesser included offenses of burglary and misdemeanor assault when the parties settled jury instructions at the end of the first day of trial. The jury returned a guilty verdict the next day on these two charges. Judge Neill sentenced Mann as a persistent felony offender to thirty years at the Montana State Prison for burglary and two six-month sentences for the misdemeanor assault charges. The District Court ordered the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b69 Mann appeals his sentence and conviction, asserting that he was wrongly excluded from a critical stage of the proceedings against him, and that he was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s determination of whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at the critical stages of his or her trial is a question of constitutional law. <em>State v. </em>Aceto, 2004 MT 247, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 24, \u00b6 15, 100 P.3d 629, \u00b6 15. Our review of constitutional law questions is plenary. <em>Aceto, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">\u00b611 Whether the District Court violated Mann\u2019s constitutional right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>to appear at all criminal proceedings against him when the court excluded him from a pre-trial meeting that addressed Mann\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, Mann\u2019s request to represent himself, and Keith\u2019s perceptions of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b612 The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides a criminal defendant the right to be present at all criminal proceedings against him. <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1058, 25 L.Ed.2d 353, 356. The Montana Constitution includes express language aimed at protecting this right, providing that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel....\u201d Article II, Sec. 24, Mont. Const. We have established that the right to appear and defend is a fundamental right which may only be waived through an informed, intelligent, and recorded waiver. <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28, 307 Mont. 428, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28, 41 P.3d 305, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28; <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, \u00b6 29, 320 Mont. 161, \u00b6 29, 85 P.3d 1279, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b613 The 1889 Montana Constitution contained language identical to the right to appear and defend provision found today, and Montana case law has historically reflected the importance this state places on such rights. In one of its first opportunities to address the right to appear and defend clause, found at that time in Article III, Section 16, this Court stated that \u201cthe defendant must be present throughout the <em>entire </em>trial.\u201d <em>State v. Reed </em>(1922), 65 Mont. 51, 56, 210 P. 756, 757 (emphasis added). We added further that the defendant has a legal right to be present \u201cwhen the jury are hearing his case, and at all times during the proceeding of the trial, <em>when anything is done which in any manner affects his right....\u201d Reed, </em>65 Mont. at 58, 210 P. at 758 (emphasis added). We then stated over forty years later that a defendant's Article II, Section 24 rights are violated if he \u201cis prevented from attending other proceedings where his presence is essential to a fair and just determination of a substantial issue.\u201d <em>State v. Schenk </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 493, 500, 444 P.2d 861, 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b614 In recent years, we have been called upon to determine whether various situations in which the accused has been excluded from trial proceedings have resulted in a violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. For example, we concluded that the district court violated the defendant\u2019s rights when it excluded the defendant and his counsel from an in-chambers voir dire. <em>State v. Bird, </em>2001 MT 2, \u00b6 40, 308 Mont. 75, \u00b6 40, 43 P.3d 266, \u00b6 40. We also concluded a violation occurred when the trial judge entered the jury room during deliberations, <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 33, and when a judge ordered the defendant removed from the courtroom for the duration of trial without warning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>following courtroom outbursts by the defendant. <em>Aceto, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b615  We have not always concluded, however, that an alleged violation of this constitutional right warrants automatic reversal. Rather, we consider the effect the violation has on the defendant to determine whether the defendant suffered any conceivable prejudice. For example, in <em>Kennedy, </em>we concluded that the district court\u2019s act of excluding Kennedy from a private conversation the judge shared with a juror regarding the juror\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s order to not communicate with trial witnesses, violated Kennedy\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of his trial. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 27. We held nonetheless that the effect of Kennedy\u2019s exclusion did not prejudice him in any way, because any opportunity Kennedy missed to question the juror about his alleged misconduct was mooted when the district court removed the juror from the panel and further prevented the witness with whom the juror had contact from testifying at trial. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b616 On the other hand, we determined in <em>Bird </em>that the violation of Bird\u2019s constitutional right to be present warranted automatic reversal when the district court excluded him from an in-chambers voir dire. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 40. We noted that the purpose of the voir dire was to elicit the prospective juror\u2019s personal feelings and experiences regarding domestic violence. The effect of the constitutional violation deprived Bird of the opportunity to hear the juror explain her biases and thus prevented Bird \u201cfrom knowing about her prejudices and from insisting that defense counsel strike her with a peremptory challenge.\u201d <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b617  Here, by the time the District Court excluded Mann from the pre-trial meeting, it had already conducted the inquiry to determine whether Mann\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were substantial, <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 180, \u00b6 15, 955 P.2d 1371, \u00b6 15, and concluded that since Mann had failed to present \u201cany concrete substantive complaint about counsel,\u201d there was no basis to substitute counsel. This left the District Court to determine the question of whether Mann should be allowed to proceed pro se or with Keith as counsel, and it was from this discussion that Mann was excluded. The Dissent properly points out that following Mann\u2019s exclusion, the District Court also addressed security matters and held a discussion regarding an evidentiary matter. Nonetheless, the conversation included discussions regarding the determination of whether Mann himself or Keith would provide representation in the imminent trial. As this important determination implicates a substantial issue in the scope of the criminal proceedings against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>we deem such exclusion a violation of Mann\u2019s constitutional right to be present and defend himself. We now turn to the effect of the exclusion to resolve whether this constitutional violation warrants reversal. \u00b618 The right to effective assistance of counsel and the right to self-representation are two of the vital rights the constitution affords criminal defendants. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Lamere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 7, 327 Mont. 115, \u00b6 7, 112 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 7. The same provisions provide a criminal defendant the right to proceed pro se. <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 821, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2534, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 574; <em>State v. Woods </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 359, 372-73, 942 P.2d 88, 97. Mann, like any other criminal defendant, was entitled to knowingly and intelligently decide how to exercise these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b619 Here, unlike in Kennedy, Mann was not afforded a remedy following his exclusion from the pre-trial discussion that would have rendered the constitutional violation moot. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34. Rather, Mann was forced to make a decision regarding the substantial issue of whether to represent himself at trial or proceed with Keith as his representative without having the benefit of hearing all the pertinent information. The Dissent notes that the District Court did not make any statements \u201cregarding Mann\u2019s self-representation\u201d in Mann\u2019s absence. The crux of what Mann missed, however, was not the District Court\u2019s comments, but those of his own attorney, from whom this Court, the Professional Rules of Conduct, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution demand a duty of loyalty. <em>State v. Jones </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 121, 125, 923 P.2d 560, 562-63; Rule 1.6, MRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b620 Mann\u2019s absence from the discussions among the court, the State, and Keith deprived him of the opportunity to hear his own attorney, with whom Mann had already expressed deep dissatisfaction, describe for both the court and the State his personal biases against Mann and his very negative perception of his own client. Mann was unable to hear his lawyer accuse him of threatening another attorney, inform the court that Mann would never listen to him and had called him a liar, and deride Mann\u2019s choice of a specific witness Mann wanted to call in his defense. Keith spoke further of when \u201cthe relationship [between Mann and Keith] started to go downhill\u201d and stated that \u201ceverything seemed to unravel.\u201d Lastly, Keith presented hearsay and speculated that Mann would misbehave and disrupt the proceedings if the court refused to allow Mann to proceed pro se. Mann\u2019s inability to hear this protracted discussion clearly rendered his subsequent decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>proceed with Keith rather than pro se-an unquestionably critical decision-both unintelligent and uninformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b621  We conclude that the District Court violated Mann\u2019s constitutional right to appear at all critical stages of the proceedings against him when it excluded him from a pre-trial discussion at which Keith portrayed his client in a negative light, and whose purpose was to decide whether Mann would represent himself or proceed with Keith as counsel. This exclusion prevented Mann from exercising in a meaningful way the significant constitutional rights afforded him by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution-the rights to effective assistance of counsel or to choose to represent oneself at trial. <em>See </em>\u00b6 18, above. We therefore reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b622 Whether Keith\u2019s decision to request jury instructions for the lesser included offenses charged deprived Mann of the right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b623 In light of our decision to reverse and remand on Issue One, we deem it unnecessary to address Issue Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b624 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AEG\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A-R\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">\u00b625 I do not believe reversal of the Defendant\u2019s conviction is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">\u00b626 A reading of the transcript reveals another side to this story. There is no question that Mann was uncooperative and potentially dangerous to persons in the courtroom. Prior to Mann\u2019s arrival in court, the District Court was obliged to address security issues which had arisen as a result of Mann\u2019s behavior. Security officials expressed \u201cserious\u201d concerns and requested that the District Court require Mann to be restrained by leg irons and handcuffs, an issue which was resolved by the court approving leg irons only. Sheriffs deputies were asked to sit in the courtroom. These arrangements were made without Mann being present, for obvious security reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">\u00b627 When Mann arrived, he expressed his refusal to wear street clothes, wanting instead to appear in \u201cdetention center orange.\u201d He further asserted that he had not received \u201cfull representation\u201d from his lawyer, had not received a reasonable bond, was being \u201crailroaded\u201d and that the State was pressuring witnesses to testify against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">They had nine months, and I think they\u2019re coercing, threatening the victims to make a statement on me. They sit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>there and they give her a pop when she\u2019s in the comity jail and they give her a pop and wink at her and tell her that, you know, coerce, and then what happened? She then, what, you were scared? And then she finishes it. I think that\u2019s violation ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b628 In response to Mann\u2019s complaints, the District Court immediately took up the matter of defense counsel\u2019s representation and received testimony, concluding therefrom that counsel\u2019s communication and representation had been sufficient. At that point, Mann declared that he wanted to represent himself. Again delaying the start of the trial, the District Court patiently took up the issue of Mann\u2019s self-representation, attempting to advise him of the dangers of doing so and seeking to demonstrate that Mann was not qualified to try his own case, over Mann\u2019s protestations that \u201c[I]t\u2019s all rigged anyway. So I am just going to go with faith. I think this whole thing is rigged.\u201d The District Court\u2019s task was not an easy one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">THE COURT: In other words, what I am telling you is that it\u2019s not a good idea to try to represent yourself. Now, Mr. Keith will listen to anything you want to tell him during the course of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">THE DEFENDANT: He hasn\u2019t listened to this point. I mean-now he wants to listen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve-we\u2019ve been over this. What I am here to do, Mr. Mann, is give you a fair trial. And that\u2019s what I, that\u2019s-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">THE DEFENDANT: That ain\u2019t fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">THE COURT: And I\u2019m trying to let that, make sure that happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">THE COURT:... So what we\u2019re trying to do, Mr. Mann, is going forward. I\u2019ve explained to you we\u2019re going to have this trial. Now-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I want to go by myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-12\">THE COURT: So, you know, I don\u2019t want you to be in there-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">THE DEFENDANT: I won\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-14\">THE COURT: -making-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-15\">THE DEFENDANT: You won\u2019t hear one word. You guys go ahead and do your thing. I just don\u2019t want nobody there, I want to be there by myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-16\">THE COURT: You\u2019re going to have standby counsel at the very least.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-17\">THE DEFENDANT: I refuse. I have a constitutional right to represent myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-18\">THE COURT: Well, and we\u2019re getting to the point where that\u2019s probably what\u2019s going to happen. But we, I\u2019m going to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>standby counsel available to you. And you\u2019ll have these opportunities to question jurors, to cross-examine witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">But I want you to focus on just doing those things that are procedurally proper as we go along. Do you understand that? In other words, I don\u2019t want you to hurt yourself by, a few minutes ago you said in here, okay, I admit that all this, you said all this shit happened, but I didn\u2019t have a gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b629 After this difficult session, Mann left, and the District Court stated, \u201cI guess at this point I want to get the observations of counsel about where we are in this.\u201d The discussion that followed was essentially general observations, mostly about the continuing concern about the court\u2019s ability to conduct the trial in light of Mann\u2019s security risks. The bailiff raised concerns about Mann\u2019s unpredictability, and the presence of the deputies was discussed. Questions concerning Mann\u2019s trying the case in leg irons, where defense counsel would sit, the extent of Mann\u2019s access to the courtroom and what to do if Mann got out of control were raised and discussed. Defense counsel observed that Mann \u201cwould do exactly what he did in here [earlier], is break in every time I tried to explain something....\u201d The discussion then turned to the handling of evidentiary matters on which there was no disagreement. Finally, comments were made regarding Mann\u2019s self-representation, but were not extensive, and the District Court made no statements in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b630 Mann was properly excluded from the courtroom for purposes of discussing the security issues he presented to the conduct of the trial. \u201c[T]rial judges confronted with disruptive ... defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 337, 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1061, 25 L.Ed.2d 353, 359. The discussion of the other issues was general in nature, some of it a repeat of the discussion in Mann\u2019s presence. True, some comments were made about Mann in his absence by his counsel, but these were of little moment when compared to the substantial discussion about the security risks Mann\u2019s behavior presented. In that light, any prejudice suffered by Mann by his absence from this meeting was <em>de minimus, </em>and I would affirm his conviction pursuant to <em>State v. Kennedy.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
