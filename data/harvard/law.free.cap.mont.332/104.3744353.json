Sunday (Sunday) appeals from an Order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, declaring that he does not have an easement across property owned by Donald Harboway and Tina Harboway (Harboways).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harboways cross-appeal from another part of the District Court\u2019s Order which declares that an easement exists around the perimeter of one parcel of Harboways\u2019 property, which is a part of this litigation, but that Sunday cannot access it. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\u00b62 We restate and address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that Sunday does not have an easement for a road across Harboways\u2019 property?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that an easement existed for a road around the perimeter of a part of Harboways\u2019 property?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">\u00b65 3. Are Harboways entitled to attorney fees on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">\u00b66 The land at issue is located in Cascade County in the area commonly known as Sudden Valley. Prior to July 23, 1971, all of the land in question was owned by John L. and Anna Barrett. The Barretts conveyed this land to Harold Poulsen, subject to easements visible on the property. Mr. Poulsen and his wife conveyed the land to James R. Gist (Gist) and Carl Heishman (Heishman). Gist and Heishman divided the land into multiple parcels. Three parcels were eventually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>acquired by Harboways and one parcel was eventually acquired by Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b67 The land owned by Harboways is separated from that owned by Sunday by a tract owned by Darrel Evert (Evert), who is not involved in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b68 The property in question, the Alleged Road, and the 30 foot easement in question, are generally depicted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">\u00b69 Gist and Heishman conveyed Parcel A to Marlin J. Dimmer and Joy M. Dimmer (Dimmers), \u201csubject to all... easements ... appearing of record against said land or now visible....\u201d Harboways acquired Parcel A by separate conveyances from the Dimmers, neither of which was subject to visible easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">\u00b610 Gist and Heishman conveyed Parcel B to L. Kent Poulsen and Mary Kay Poulsen (Poulsens), \u201csubject to all... easements... appearing of record against said land or now visible....\u201d The Poulsens in turn conveyed Parcel B to Harboways. This conveyance was not subject to visible easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-17\">\u00b611 Gist conveyed Parcel C to Timothy F. Valerie and Anna H. Valerie (Valeries), \u201cfree from all incumbrances except all visible road easements and hereditaments.\u201d This conveyance was made September 24, 1976, nearly two years before Sunday\u2019s predecessors in interest, the Scotts, purchased Parcel D. The deed from Gist to Valeries specifically contained the language: \u201creserving unto the Grantor, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>heirs, successors and assigns, however, a Thirty (30) foot wide easement on all sides of the inside perimeter of the said described property for the purposes of construction, maintenance and use of roads, water, sewer, and utility facilities.\u201d Harboways acquired Parcel C following four conveyances that were not subject to visible easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b612 By contract for deed made December 23,1976, Gist sold to Evert\u2019s predecessor in title, Dwight A. Darrah, Annie Bell Darrah, Harry C. Darrah, and Esther L. Darrah (Darrahs), Parcel E. On May 8, 1978, Gist conveyed Parcel D to Calvin B. Scott and Judy R. Scott (Scotts). Sunday subsequently acquired Parcel D. Thus, prior to the time that Sunday\u2019s predecessor in interest, Scotts, acquired Parcel D from Gist, the 30 foot easement on Parcel C could not provide access to Sunday\u2019s land. There is no record of an easement across Parcel E for access to Parcel D.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b613 Sunday sometimes traveled over Harboways\u2019 land using the way depicted above as the Alleged Road. He refers to this route as a road, while Harboways refer to it as an indistinct two-rut trail. Harboways blocked the Alleged Road with a fence. Sunday sued, claiming an easement giving him the right to cross Harboways\u2019 land on the Alleged Road. He first claimed the Alleged Road constitutes an easement that was visible at the time of conveyances to Harboways\u2019 predecessors in interest. Alternatively, Sunday claimed an easement by prescription over the Alleged Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b614 Sunday\u2019s claims were tried to the District Court sitting without a jury. On December 22, 2004, the District Court filed its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order (Order). The District Court concluded that Sunday failed to establish the Alleged Road as a visible easement reserved in prior deeds, and further that he did not establish a prescriptive easement over it to access his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b615 Also in its Order, the District Court concluded that <em>\u201ca </em>30 foot easement was created on Harboways\u2019 property by the Gist to Valerie deed. However, Sunday does not have an easement across the northern portion of Harboways\u2019 land (original Kent and Poulsen property, original Dimmer and Calvert property) to access this \u2018road\u2019 easement.\u201d This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b616 Harboways have moved this Court for an injunction pending resolution of this appeal. Harboways claim Sunday is preparing to build a road along the 30 foot easement. This Opinion renders the motion for an injunction moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b617 We review the findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Tomlin Enters., Inc. v. Althoff, </em>2004 MT 383, \u00b6 12, 325 Mont. 99, \u00b6 12, 103 P.3d 1069, \u00b6 12. We will consider the findings to be clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b618 Did the District Court err in concluding that Sunday does not have an easement for a road across Harboways\u2019 property?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b619 The District Court specifically found credible a licensed engineer and surveyor presented by Harboways. He testified that no visible road existed at the times claimed by Sunday. The District Court also considered testimony concerning what roads and trails did exist, examined maps of the area, and testimony to the effect that the road claimed by Sunday never existed. The District Court also considered the witnesses and evidence presented by Sunday. It found that at least some of the testimony of Sunday\u2019s witnesses was inaccurate as to the time of use, extent of use, and location of the road at issue. After reviewing conflicting evidence, the District Court found as a matter of fact that at the various times that Gist and Heishman conveyed the property traversed by the Alleged Road, there was no visible road in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u00b620  The essence of Sunday\u2019s argument on appeal is that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous as it ignored the testimony of several witnesses that the Alleged Road was visible and in use when Gist and Heishman conveyed it and reserved an easement for visible roads. The evidence is indeed conflicting. And, if Donald Harboway\u2019s testimony is taken out of context as urged by Sunday, it could be said that he admitted that there was a trail across his property at one time. However, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. They are supported by substantial credible evidence, the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence, and we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u00b621  A party claiming an easement by prescription must prove each necessary element by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Brumit v. Lewis, </em>2002 MT 346, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 332, \u00b6 15, 61 P.3d 138, \u00b6 15. Similarly to Sunday\u2019s claim that a visible easement existed, the District Court examined the conflicting evidence presented concerning the Alleged Road. This evidence outlined the history of the property both before and since its acquisition by Harboways. Based upon this review, the District Court found that neither Sunday, nor any of his predecessors in interest, established a prescriptive easement on any of the three tracts now owned by Harboways prior to the time they purchased it. Further, the District Court found that after they acquired the land, Harboways zealously protected it and routinely refused others access, other than for a limited purpose with their permission. We conclude that these findings by the District Court are not clearly erroneous. <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err in concluding that an easement existed for a road around the perimeter of a part of Harboways\u2019 property?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b623 Harboways contend that the District Court erred in its Conclusion of Law No. 9 that the Gist to Valerie deed created a 30 foot easement surrounding Parcel C, as this conclusion is contrary to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Loomis v. Luraski, </em>2001 MT 223, 306 Mont. 478, 36 P.3d 862. They also claim that any such easement would not benefit Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b624 <em>Loomis </em>is inapposite. In <em>Loomis, </em>we rejected an attempt by landowners to establish an easement which was not within their chain of title. Since the reservation was outside their chain of title, we determined that these landowners could not enforce it. <em>Loomis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-30. However, in this case, Gist, who reserved the easement, is in Sunday\u2019s chain of title. Thus, the rational of <em>Loomis </em>does not apply. However, Harboways are correct that Sunday has no right to cross their land using such easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b625  Sunday\u2019s property does not abut the easement in question. When Gist reserved an easement across Parcel C, he created a dominant tenement which was his remaining land, and Parcel C, which was burdened with the easement, became the servient tenement. However, at the time Gist conveyed Parcel D to Sunday\u2019s predecessors, the Scotts, he had already conveyed Parcel E to Darrahs, and he reserved no easement across it. There is nothing in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>which shows that Sunday can cross Parcel E. An easement requires more than a burden on the servient tenement. It must be substantially beneficial to the dominant tenement. <em>See Murphy v. Kerr </em>(8th Cir. 1925), 5 F.2d 908, 911; 28A C.J.S. <em>Easements </em>\u00a7 6 (1996). There is no easement as far as Sunday\u2019s land is concerned, because an easement requires a dominant tenement. <em>See Burlingame v. Marjerrison </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 464, 469, 665 P.2d 1136, 1139; \u00a7 70-17-103, MCA. While we express no opinion as to whether the 30 foot easement exists for the benefit of any other successor landowners to Gist, Sunday\u2019s land is not a dominant tenement with the benefit of such easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b626 Are Harboways entitled to attorney fees on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b627 Harboways ask this Court to award them attorney fees on appeal, arguing that Sunday failed to offer \u201canything substantial or even reasonable in support of [his] appeal.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 32, M.R.App.P.; <em>Ponderosa Pines Ranch, Inc. v. Hevner, </em>2002 MT 184, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 311 Mont. 82, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 53 P.3d 381, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. In <em>Ponderosa Pines Ranch, </em>the district court concluded that Cherie Hevner\u2019s arguments were not well grounded in fact, and she made the same arguments to this Court. <em>Ponderosa Pines Ranch, </em>\u00b6 35. In the present case, while Sunday made the same arguments on appeal that he made in the District Court, these arguments are supported by facts. Both sides presented evidence which the District Court had to weigh. While we affirm the District Court\u2019s Order, in this instance we determine it is not appropriate to sanction Sunday for exercising his right to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u00b628 We affirm the District Court\u2019s Order. Sunday owns no easement across Harboways\u2019 land. We decline to award Harboways attorney fees. Harboways\u2019 motion for an injunction is denied as moot.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-17\"> The transcript of the trial reveals that Cheryl J.

I write separately to emphasize that the Court reaches this result based upon the District Court\u2019s resolution of conflicting testimony regarding the existence of any visible easements reserved in prior deeds. It was Sunday\u2019s failure to persuade the District Court of the existence of visible easements on the ground, rather than the failure of the predecessors in interest of either Sunday or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Harboways to reserve visible easements in conveying the various parcels at issue that dictated the outcome. Indeed, Gist originally conveyed Parcel C to the Valeries free from all encumbrances \u201cexcept all visible road easements and hereditaments.\u201d The Harboways, in turn, received Parcel C subject to any of these visible road easements. The District Court found, as a matter of fact, that no visible road easements existed on Parcel C and the Court correctly defers to the District Court\u2019s finding of fact in this matter. <em>Tomlin, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-4\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
