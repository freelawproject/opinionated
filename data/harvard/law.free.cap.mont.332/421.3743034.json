He alleged that during 2001, Defendant MarkMcLaverty, an attorney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>was negligent in his representation of Guest and he sustained damages as a result. McLaverty filed a Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., motion to dismiss the complaint based on the statute of limitations found at \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. The District Court granted McLaverty\u2019s motion and Guest now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b62 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Hall v. State, </em>2006 MT 37, \u00b6 10, 331 Mont. 171, \u00b6 10, 130 P.3d 601, \u00b6 10. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., has the effect of admitting all well-pled allegations in the complaint. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 10. The complaint is construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 10. We will affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal only if we conclude that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief based on any set of facts that could be proven to support the claim. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 10. The determination of whether a complaint states a claim is a conclusion of law, and the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed for correctness. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b63 McLaverty represented Guest by appointment as a public defender in connection with his charges of felony aggravated kidnapping and two counts of felony assault with a weapon, in Ravalli County. The representation commenced April 6, 2001. The last work McLaverty did for Guest was August 22, 2001, when he and Guest appeared before the District Court; Guest entered a guilty plea and was then released from jail on his own recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b64 Upon his release, Guest, having been displeased with the services of McLaverty for some time, retained other counsel on September 23, 2001. However, in Guest\u2019s complaint he makes no allegation that McLaverty did anything that could be construed as negligent after August 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b65 The statute of limitations applicable to legal malpractice actions is set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">An action against an attorney licensed to practice law in Montana ... based upon the person\u2019s alleged professional negligent act or for error or omission in the person\u2019s practice must be commenced within 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the act, error, or omission....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">One has discovered, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the act, error, or omission, when one has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry regarding the act or omission. <em>Johnson v. Barrett, </em>1999 MT 176, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 254, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 925, \u00b6 11. This test requires knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of the facts essential to the legal malpractice claim, rather than the discovery of legal theories. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11. Specifically, the court determines whether the plaintiff had \u201cthe opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation at that time or shortly thereafter[.]\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 15 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AxH\">\u00b66 Guest filed his malpractice complaint against McLaverty on September 23, 2004. This was more than three years after McLaverty performed his final services for Guest. Guest was aware of the majority of the underlying facts supporting his allegations of negligence, prior to August 22, 2001. However, Guest argues that he did not learn of several pertinent facts until his new attorney received his client file from McLaverty on November 2, 2001. Guest therefore claims the statute of limitations could not have started to run until his new attorney received the client file. Further, Guest argues that he could not be expected to have the professional legal experience to know he had a potential malpractice claim against McLaverty, prior to the time he retained a new attorney and was informed of the potential claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AqxY\">\u00b67 The allegations of the complaint make it clear that prior to August 22, 2001, Guest was aware that: McLaverty only visited him on a few occasions and each occasion for a short period of time; McLaverty would not accept telephone calls from Guest while he was incarcerated and instructed him to write letters instead; and finally, he repeatedly pled with McLaverty to perform his own investigation into the allegations. We determine that this was \u201csufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry regarding an [act or] omission.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>\u00b6 15. It is clear from Guest\u2019s complaint that he was dissatisfied with McLaverty by the time he was released from jail on August 22, 2001. This was further evidenced by the fact that he fired McLaverty and hired a new attorney shortly after being released from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b68 The fact that Guest, prior to hiring his new attorney, may have lacked the legal expertise to know he may have had a malpractice claim is irrelevant in this analysis. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11. Thus, Guest\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations cannot begin to run until he \u201crealized the acts and omissions complained of constituted legal malpractice[,]\u201d is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b69 Guest cites <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620, for the proposition that: \u201c[i]f a legal transaction is beyond the understanding of a layperson and the date of discovery is disputed, summary judgment is not appropriate.\u201d (Internal quotation omitted). He claims he did not understand that he had a malpractice claim, and thus the statute of limitations did not begin to run until he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>realized that he did. <em>Watkins, </em>however, is clearly distinguishable. The facts of that case involved highly complex issues in estate and tax planning. <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6 43. We concluded that a trustee, even though she had been provided with a copy of the trust, could not have known, as a matter of law, that her attorney had erred in telling her that the trust was revocable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6 43. The record in <em>Watkins </em>established that the trust involved \u201cwould be very difficult for the average layperson to understand!!,]\u201d and farther \u201c[the expert] testified that even as an estate and tax planning expert, he had to spend many hours reading the [t]rust agreement before he could understand it.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6 12. Thus, it was determined that the point at which the trustee should have known the facts at issue, was itself a question of fact. <em>See Watkins, </em>\u00b6 41. Yet the analysis still focuses on \u201cwhen the facts should have been knowable[;]\u201d not when the trustee should have known that a potential malpractice claim existed. <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6 41. In this case, unlike the trustee in <em>Watkins, </em>Guest knew substantially all of the salient facts by the time McLaverty preformed his final services, on August 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b610 Further, on August 22, 2001, Guest was released from jail, and thus, at least by this date, had the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation at that time or shortly thereafter. <em>See Johnson, </em>\u00b6 15. Section 27-2-206, MCA, gave him three years from August 22, 2001, within which to make inquiry and file a complaint. He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b611 Finally, McLaverty represented Guest by appointment as a public defender, under a contract between himself and Ravalli County to employ counsel to represent indigent defendants in criminal cases. Guest argues that, as a third party beneficiary of the public defender contract, he is entitled to damages as a result of McLaverty\u2019s breach of such contract because he did not provide competent legal services. Thus, he claims that the District Court erred in dismissing his contract claim, as it was timely filed within the applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b612 However, \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, specifically provides that an action based on an error or omission in a lawyer\u2019s practice must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>commenced witbdn three years. The claims against McLaverty are all based on alleged professional errors and omissions. A plaintiff cannot, simply by virtue of mislabeling a claim for relief, change the gravamen of the action and secure a longer period of limitation. <em>Demarest v. Broadhurst, </em>2004 MT 147, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 470, \u00b6 14, 92 P.3d 1168, \u00b6 14; <em>see also Erickson v. Croft </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 146, 153, 760 P.2d 706, 710 (\"The gravamen of a claim, not the label attached, controls the limitations period to be applied to that claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b613  Guest\u2019s claims all sound in legal malpractice, and because they were not brought within three years of the time within which he discovered, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the acts, errors, or omissions constituting the alleged malpractice, they are barred by \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-7\">JUSTICES RICE, NELSON, COTTER and LEA PH ART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> In <em>Watkins, </em>we applied the \u201cdiscovery rule.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40-41. Essentially, one\u2019s failure to discover the attorney\u2019s purported negligence may be excused because of the complexity of the legal transaction involved. <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\"> Guest does not specify which statute of limitations applies to his contract claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
