(Intercontinental). The Ninth Judicial District Court, Pondera County, granted Intercontinental\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered judgment. Vogel appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Intercontinental on grounds that Vogel is judicially estopped from claiming he suffered a compensable loss under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">\u00b63 Vogel was employed as a truck body painter at Intercontinental\u2019s Conrad, Montana, manufacturing business. In 1997 and 1998, he filed workers\u2019 compensation claims for injuries to his knees and had surgery on both knees, for which Intercontinental accepted liability. Between 1998 and 2002, Vogel continued to have problems performing his job, and sought treatment for pain in his shoulders, elbows and wrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">\u00b64 On May 22, 2002, Intercontinental terminated Vogel\u2019s employment. On June 5, 2002, Vogel filed a first report of injury and occupational disease with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry concerning the pain in his shoulders, elbows and wrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">\u00b65 On October 3, 2002, Vogel filed his complaint in this action, claiming Intercontinental wrongfully discharged him from employment and requesting all damages allowed under the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDEA), \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-901 through -915, MCA. Intercontinental timely answered, denying the allegations. Nearly two years passed with no further action in the WDEA case. During that time, Vogel completed vocational rehabilitation training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>as an auto damage appraiser and claims appraiser as a result of Intercontinental\u2019s acceptance of his knee injury claims. He also settled his occupational disease claim concerning the pain in his shoulders, elbows and wrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b66 In June of 2004, Vogel requested a scheduling conference in this action. Intercontinental moved to dismiss for failure to prosecute, but the District Court denied the motion. In April of2005, Intercontinental moved for summary judgment based on judicial estoppel or, alternatively, Vogel\u2019s inability to establish lost wages. In support of its motion, Intercontinental observed-and attached copies of supporting documents-that Vogel stated in his June 2002 occupational disease claim that he had suffered injuries to his upper extremities beginning in December of 1999 which rendered him unable to perform his previous work as a painter. Intercontinental further noted Vogel settled his occupational disease claim at the end of October of2003, via a stipulation for payment to him of $16,750. Intercontinental argued that, having represented in his occupational disease claim that he was unable to perform his time-of-injury job, Vogel was precluded from later arguing entitlement to wrongful discharge damages resulting from his loss of the same job. Alternatively, Intercontinental argued that a discharge, no matter how wrongful, does not damage an employee who is physically unable to continue in the job. Vogel submitted a brief in opposition to the motion and the court heard oral arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b67 The District Court granted Intercontinental\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on judicial estoppel and entered judgment. Vogel appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b68 Pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Employing the same evaluation as the district court based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. We review a summary judgment decision <em>de novo. Peyatt v. Moore, </em>2004 MT 341, \u00b6 13, 324 Mont. 249, \u00b613, 102 P.3d 535, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Intercontinental on grounds that Vogel is judicially estopped from claiming he suffered a compensable loss under the WDEA?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b610 Judicial estoppel precludes a party to an action or proceeding from taking a position inconsistent with the party\u2019s previous judicial declarations. <em>Fiedler v. Fiedler </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 133, 139, 879 P.2d 675, 679 (citation omitted). The doctrine includes four elements: (1) the estopped party had knowledge of the facts at the time he took the original position; (2) the estopped party succeeded in maintaining the original position; (3) the position presently taken is inconsistent with the original position; and (4) the original position misled the adverse party so that allowing the estopped party to change its position would injuriously affect the adverse party. <em>In re Raymond W. George Trust, </em>1999 MT 223, \u00b6 51, 296 Mont. 56, \u00b6 51, 986 P.2d 427, \u00b6 51 (citation omitted). All four elements must be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b611  The first element of judicial estoppel is satisfied here, because it is undisputed that Vogel was aware he had been terminated from employment with Intercontinental when he filed his first report of injury to his shoulders, elbows and wrists on June 5,2002; indeed, the termination had occurred about a week earlier. He also had knowledge of the facts of his termination from employment when, in a June 20, 2003, petition for hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on his occupational disease claim, he alleged that he \u201csuffers from an occupational disease arising from his longtime employment as a truck body painter and detailer. The disease affects his shoulders, arms and wrists bilaterally and renders [him] unable to perform his time of injury job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b612  Regarding the second element of judicial estoppel, Vogel succeeded in maintaining his original position that his injury rendered him unable to perform his time-of-injury job. In October of 2003, he obtained a settlement of his occupational disease claim for his shoulders, elbows and wrists from Intercontinental in the amount of $16,750.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b613  The third element is that the position presently taken by the party against whom judicial estoppel is sought is inconsistent with the original position. Vogel\u2019s argument in this action that he would have been capable of performing his job after the time of his discharge is entirely inconsistent with his position taken in his occupational disease claim that he was permanently unable to perform his previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>work because of an occupational disease before he was discharged. This inconsistency establishes the third element of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"ANG\">\u00b614  Finally, as to the fourth element of judicial estoppel, allowing Vogel to change his position to argue that he was wrongfully discharged from employment would injuriously affect Intercontinental. It would expose Intercontinental to liability for WDEA damages premised on Vogel\u2019s ability to perform his job when it had already settled Vogel\u2019s occupational disease claim premised on his inability to do so. Thus, the final element is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b615 Vogel does not specifically challenge any portion of the District Court\u2019s determination regarding judicial estoppel. Instead, he makes an argument not related to judicial estoppel. The appellant bears the burden of establishing error in a district court\u2019s decision. <em>In re T.H., </em>2005 MT 237, \u00b6 45, 328 Mont. 428, \u00b6 45, 121 P.3d 541, \u00b6 45 (citation omitted). By failing to directly challenge the application of judicial estoppel by the District Court, Vogel has failed to meet his burden on appeal, and we decline to address his other argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b616  We hold the District Court correctly ruled that this action is barred under the doctrine of judicial estoppel and correctly granted Intercontinental\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that basis. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
