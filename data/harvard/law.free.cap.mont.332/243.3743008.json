The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly determined that law enforcement had legal authority to search Schwarz\u2019s home after her thirteen-year-old daughter provided the officers permission to enter when Schwarz was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>not home?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b62 We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b63 On February 27,2004, Sanders County Deputy Sheriff Joe Brown enlisted the assistance of Thompson Falls City Police Officer Chris Nichols in arresting Jonathan Lowe. After Officer Nichols learned that Lowe was staying at the defendant\u2019s residence in Thompson Falls, the two officers, along with Reserve Deputy Bronner, drove to Schwarz\u2019s home to effect an arrest. Brittany Glazier, Schwarz\u2019s thirteen-year-old daughter, who had just arrived home from the movies with two girlfriends, answered the door. The three friends had been watching a video while waiting for one girl\u2019s ride home; the other friend had permission to spend the night at Brittany\u2019s house. Brittany testified that she did not recognize either of the officers, although, apparently she had met Officer Brown at a Girl Scout event. Officer Brown explained to Brittany, whom he believed to be either thirteen or fourteen years old, that he was looking for Lowe. The record is in dispute as to whether Brittany invited the officers to search the home, or whether the officers directly asked permission to enter. Either way, the officers entered with Brittany\u2019s consent. No one made an effort to contact Schwarz; nor did law enforcement obtain a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"Aso\">\u00b64 During the course of the search, Officer Nichols discovered a marijuana pipe and a small plastic container containing a white substance, later determined to be methamphetamine. At some point, Schwarz, who was out bowling, called home and learned of the officers\u2019 presence. She immediately drove home. Upon Schwarz\u2019s arrival, Officer Nichols indicated that he had discovered drugs. Schwarz admitted to owning the pipe and marijuana and provided written consent to another search of the entire house. Officer Nichols arrested Schwarz and drove her to the police station, obtaining further admissions from Schwarz along the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b65 Schwarz filed a motion to suppress the evidence and statements obtained by the officers, arguing that law enforcement illegally searched her home in violation of Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution. After hearing testimony on the motion, the District Court denied it, noting that because Brittany and her friend were home alone on a Friday night, \u201call the parents had confidence in these girls to exercise good judgment.\u201d Schwarz entered a conditional plea preserving her right to appeal the suppression issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b66 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. McLees, </em>2000 MT 6, \u00b6 9, 298 Mont. 15, \u00b6 9, 994 P.2d 683, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b67 Did officers have legal authority to search Schwarz\u2019s home based on consent from Schwarz\u2019s thirteen-year-old daughter?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b68 Since Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution mirrors the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, we analyze most search and seizure issues by applying traditional federal principles. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 23. Unlike its federal counterpart, however, Montana\u2019s constitutional scheme affords citizens broader protection of their right to privacy. <em>See </em>Article II, Section 10. In Montana, therefore, we analyze search and seizure issues in light of our citizens\u2019 enhanced right to privacy. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b69 In <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 10, this Court noted that \u201c[w]arrantless searches conducted inside a home are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) One such exception is a search conducted pursuant to a consent given freely and voluntarily. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 10. We have previously cited the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Matlock </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993, 39 L.Ed.2d 242, 249-50, for the proposition that \u201cwhen the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed <em>common authority </em>over or other <em>sufficient relationship </em>to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See McLees, </em>\u00b6 10, and <em>State v. Sorenson </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 269, 275, 590 P.2d 136, 140. The <em>Matlock </em>court specifically clarified that \u201ccommon authority\u201d does not necessarily flow from mere property interest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">The authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements, but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171, n.7, 94 S.Ct. at 993, n.7, 39 L.Ed.2d at 250, n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b610 A decade and a half after the <em>Matlock </em>decision, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of <em>apparent authority </em>in <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 177, 186, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2800, 111 L.Ed.2d 148, 159-60, concluding that \u201c[b]ecause many situations which confront officers in the course of executing their duties are more or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on their part. But the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.\u201d (Citation omitted.) In <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 32, this Court explicitly rejected the <em>Rodriguez </em>holding, \u201crefus[ing] to extend the doctrine of apparent authority based on ... [Montana\u2019s] increased right to privacy under Article II, Sections 10 and 11.\u201d We held \u201cthat for third-party consent to be valid as against the defendant, the consenting party must have <em>actual </em>authority to do so.\u201d <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 32 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b611 The question now before this Court is whether a third-party <em>youth </em>can provide legal consent to a search. Several courts have addressed this issue, with the majority concluding that \u201cthere is no <em>per se </em>rule that all minors lack the authority to consent to a search.\u201d <em>Abdella v. O\u2019Toole </em>(D. Conn. 2004), 343 F.Supp.2d 129, 135. Typically, the consenting party\u2019s youth will be one of many factors considered when the trier of fact analyzes the legality of a minor\u2019s consent. <em>See State v. Tomlinson </em>(Wis. 2002), 648 N.W.2d 367, 376 (\u201c[w]hether the child possesses such authority will depend on a number of factors, and courts must look at the totality of the circumstances to make such a determination\u201d); <em>State v. Butzke </em>(Neb. App. 1998), 584 N.W.2d 449, 458 (the court must analyze voluntariness and common authority over the premises, or whether law enforcement reasonably believed the child had apparent authority); <em>State v. Kriegh </em>(Kan. App. 1997), 937 P.2d 453, 457 (\u201c[a]lthough age is a factor to consider in ascertaining whether consent was given willingly, minority status alone does not prevent one from giving consent\u201d); <em>State v. Will </em>(Or. App. 1994), 885 P.2d 715, 720 (\u201cage is <em>merely one factor </em>to be considered in determining the scope of the minor\u2019s authority to consent and whether the minor\u2019s consent was knowing and voluntary\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Saavedra v. State </em>(Fla. 1993), 622 So.2d 952, 956 (\u201cthe State must show by clear and convincing evidence from the totality of the circumstances that the minor gave free and voluntary consent\u201d); <em>Davis v. State </em>(Ga. 1992), 422 S.E.2d 546, 549 (a court must \u201cexamine a child\u2019s mental maturity and his ability to understand the circumstances in which he is placed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the consequences of his actions\u201d); and <em>People v. Jacobs </em>(Cal. 1987), 729 P.2d 757, 764 (\u201c[a]s a child advances in age she acquires greater discretion to admit visitors on her own authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b612 In addressing this issue, we recognize that other jurisdictions have chosen not to create a <em>per se </em>rule that all youths lack the authority to consent to a search. However, just as we chose not to adopt <em>Rodriguez\u2019s </em>apparent authority doctrine in light of Montana\u2019s greater right to privacy, so too do we now opt not to march in step with our sister states and the federal courts on the issue of minor consent. Importantly, several of their decisions incorporated the doctrine of apparent authority. Since this Court has explicitly rejected that doctrine, we need only address the narrower question of whether a youth has <em>actual authority </em>to consent to a search of her parent\u2019s home. We hold that she does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b613 In reaching this conclusion, we observe that in general, a youth does not have authority equal to that of a parent or guardian regarding their shared property. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin noted, \u201c[a] minor child who lives in the same home with his or her parents or guardians obviously shares use of the property with the parents or guardians to some extent. However, it should also be obvious that a child generally does not share mutual use of the property with a parent to the same extent that such use might be shared between spouses or between cohabitating adults.\u201d <em>Tomlinson, </em>648 N.W.2d at 376. Similarly, the Supreme Court of California opined that even if a parent chooses to grant her minor children joint access and mutual use of the home, \u201cparents normally retain control of the home, as well as the power to rescind the authority they have given.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>729 P.2d at 763. The California court farther observed that a parent has not surrendered the privacy of his home to the discretion of a child, but rather, the child has privacy at the discretion of the parent. In other words, \u201ca child cannot waive the privacy rights of her parents.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>729 P.2d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b614  We agree with the above comments and further conclude that in light of Montana\u2019s enhanced right to privacy under Article II, Section 10, consent, as an exception to the warrant requirement, must be narrowly construed. Accordingly, we hold that a youth under the age of sixteen does not have the capacity or the authority to relinquish her parents\u2019 privacy rights. We find further persuasive authority for this conclusion in the Legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 41-5-331(2), MCA, which states that a youth under the age of sixteen can only waive her right against self-incrimination with parental permission or with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>advice of counsel. Although \u00a7 41-5-331, MCA, only addresses a youth\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination, it nonetheless supports the principle that a minor who cannot waive her own rights without parental permission or legal counsel, cannot waive her parent\u2019s privacy rights. <em>See State v. Allen </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 135, 612 P.2d 199, involving \u00a7 41-5-303, MCA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (which referenced all \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d), the predecessor to \u00a7 41-5-331, MCA, wherein we held that a sixteen-year-old youth could not, without the agreement of her parents or advice of counsel, consent to a search of her <em>own </em>apartment. Accordingly, we now adopt a <em>per se </em>rule that a youth under the age of sixteen lacks the capacity or the authority to consent to a search of her parents\u2019 home. \u00b615 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-5\"> Section 41-5-303, MCA (1980), read:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">When a youth is detained for investigation or questioning upon a matter which could result in a petition alleging that the youth being detained is either delinquent or in need of supervision, the following requirements must be met:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">(1) The youth shall be immediately and effectively advised of his constitutional rights and his rights under this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">(2) The youth may waive such rights under the following situations:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">(a) when the youth is under the age of 12 years, the parents of the youth may make an effective waiver;</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">(b) when the youth is over the age of 12 years and the youth and his parents agree, they may make an effective waiver; and</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">(c) when the youth is over the age of 12 years and the youth and his parents do not agree, the youth may make an effective waiver only with advice of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
