The question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-8\">May a debtor claim an exemption pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, in proceeds from the sale of shares of stock in a business under an agreement to sell such stock, as exempt \u201cbenefits,\u201d when such proceeds are used exclusively to pay for the debtor\u2019s end-of-life medical, surgical or hospital care and medications?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer the question \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">\u00b62 The following factual background is taken from the undisputed facts related by the Bankruptcy Court in its certification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b63 Lee Orio Archer and Vicki Baird Archer are married and filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in December of 2004. The list of their personal property provided to the Bankruptcy Court includes an asset with a market value of $25,000, described as \u201cProceeds from sale of stock in Instrument Service, Inc., Co. which he [Lee] formed. $1,000/mo. $12,000/yr through 2006.\u201d The Archers also included these proceeds from sale of stock in their list of property exempt from the bankruptcy proceedings, citing \u00a7 31-2-106, MCA. The Archers provided the Bankruptcy Court-and the Bankruptcy Court appended to its certification order-copies of documents relating to this asset, including the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Common Stock, a Guarantee, and the Promissory Note from the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">\u00b64 Lee Archer suffers from congestive heart failure, lymphoma, severe mitral reguration and various other medical conditions. In March of 2005, Lee\u2019s physicians estimated that he had approximately six months to live. Although the Archers have medical insurance which pays for some of Lee\u2019s medical care, the $7,878.18 annual cost of Lee\u2019s prescription drugs has resulted in their expenses exceeding their combined annual income in 2004 of $37,855.56. The entire $1,000 per month in contract payments from the sale of Lee\u2019s stock is used to pay for his medications and medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">\u00b65 The Bankruptcy Trustee objected to the Archers\u2019 claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>$1,000 per month payment is exempt under \u00a7 31-2-106, MCA. The Archers responded to the Trustee\u2019s objection by then citing \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, under which \u201cbenefits paid or payable for medical, surgical, or hospital care to the extent they are used or will be used to pay for the care\u201d are exempt from judgment execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b66 May a debtor claim an exemption pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, in proceeds from the sale of shares of stock in a business under an agreement to sell such stock, as exempt \u201cbenefits,\u201d when such proceeds are used exclusively to pay for the debtor\u2019s end-of-life medical, surgical or hospital care and medications?</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b67 A debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding may claim property enumerated in the Bankruptcy Code as exempt from the bankruptcy estate. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b). States may opt out of the exemption plan set forth in the federal bankruptcy statute, however, and Montana has done so. Debtors like the Archers who live in an \u201copt out\u201d state may claim the exemptions provided under state law. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b68 In this case, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s certified question involves the interpretation of Montana exemption law, specifically \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA. The Bankruptcy Court has determined, pursuant to Rule 44, M.R.App.P., that no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute of this state answers the question here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b69 Section 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, provides that a debtor is entitled to exemption from execution for \u201cbenefits paid or payable for medical, surgical, or hospital care to the extent they are used or will be used to pay for the care.\u201d The Archers claim the term \u201cbenefits\u201d should be interpreted to include the proceeds they receive from the sale of the stock, to the extent those proceeds are used for Lee\u2019s medical care. \u00b610 The Archers analogize this case to <em>Dayton v. Ewart </em>(1903), 28 Mont. 153, 72 P. 420. In <em>Dayton, </em>this Court ruled that gold dust from a placer claim by a poor miner whose family depended for support on his working the placer mine fell within a statute exempting \u201cearnings for personal services\u201d from attachment or execution. <em>Dayton, </em>28 Mont. at 157, 72 P. at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u00b611 <em>Dayton </em>plainly involved different statutory language and circumstances than those at issue here. Moreover, the Court premised its determination on the fact that personal services were not limited to services performed for another. <em>Dayton, </em>28 Mont. at 156, 72 P. at 421-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>22. Finally, the Court stated \u201cwe deem it proper to say that this case is determined and decided with reference to the facts presented only.\u201d <em>Dayton, </em>28 Mont. at 157-58, 72 P.2d at 422. As a result, <em>Dayton </em>is distinguishable from the present case on both the facts and the law, and the interpretation of \u201cearnings for personal services\u201d therein provides no guidance for resolution of the question in the present case. \u00b612 The Archers also claim interpreting \u201cbenefits\u201d to include the stock proceeds at issue here would be consistent with exemptions that exist in the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E) provides that the debtor\u2019s right to receive a payment under an annuity or contract on account of length of service may be exempt to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and his or her dependents. The Archers contend this federal statute demonstrates that exemptions of the type they claim clearly exist, and that interpretation of \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, in favor of the exemption they claim is not unreasonable. The Archers are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b613 Under federal law, payments made \u201con account of illness, disability, death, age ... for the support of the debtor and any dependent\u201d are exempt only if such payments qualify under special pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, employee annuities or individual retirement account provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(10) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401(a), 403(a) and (b), and 408. Payments received on a promissory note from the sale of stock in a business-the payments at issue here-generally would not qualify under these special Internal Revenue Code provisions for qualified pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus and qualified employee annuity plans, and individual retirement accounts. In the present case, the Agreement, Guarantee and Promissory Note contain no direction or indication whatsoever that the monthly payments Lee receives from the sale of his stock were intended as benefits which qualify under these specific Internal Revenue Code sections. The federal exemptions-which in any event do not apply in an opt-out state like Montana-provide no support for the Archers\u2019 argument that the exemption they claim is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b614 Finally, the Archers claim Article XIII, Section 5 of Montana\u2019s Constitution and our case law require that exemption statutes must be liberally construed in favor of debtors, citing <em>In re Zimmerman, </em>2002 MT 90, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 337, \u00b6 15, 46 P.3d 599, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). They maintain that interpreting \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, to grant exemption of the proceeds from the sale of shares of stock to the extent those proceeds are or will be used to pay for Lee\u2019s end-of-life medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>care and medications is a reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b615 Article XIII, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he legislature shall enact liberal homestead and exemption laws.\u201d Our cases, including <em>Zimmerman, </em>set forth the principle that courts will give liberal construction to exemption laws. <em>See also MacDonald v. Mercill </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 146, 151, 714 P.2d 132, 135; <em>Neel v. First Federal Savings and Loan Assoc. of Great Falls </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 376, 383, 675 P.2d 96, 100. We note, however, that the case cited as authority for the proposition relied on in <em>Zimmerman </em>also cautions that \u201c[i]t is the law in this state that the exemption statutes are to be liberally construed but such construction may not disregard plain legislative mandate.\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 151, 714 P.2d at 135. Thus, the principle of liberal construction of exemption laws set forth in <em>Zimmerman, </em>like virtually every other principle, has limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b616 In interpreting a statute, we attempt to implement the objectives the legislature sought to achieve. Legislative intent is ascertained, in the first instance, from the plain meaning of the words used. If the intent of the legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, the plain meaning controls and the court need go no further nor apply any other means of interpretation. <em>Western Energy Co. v. State, Dept. of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 289, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 55, \u00b6 11, 990 P.2d 767, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b617 Both the Amicus Curiae Montana Trial Lawyers Association and the Trustee cite dictionary definitions of \u201cbenefits\u201d as support for their interpretation of that word in \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA. \u201cBenefits\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">1 <em>archaic: </em>an act of kindness: BENEFACTION 2 a: something that promotes well being: ADVANTAGE b: useful aid: HELP 3 a: financial help in time of sickness, old age, or unemployment b: a payment or service provided for under an annuity, pension plan, or insurance policy 4: an entertainment or social event to raise funds for a person or cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 106 (10th Ed. 1993). The Amicus, in asserting that the contract payments in this case are \u201cbenefits,\u201d relies on \u201csomething that promotes well being: ADVANTAGE\u201d and \u201cfinancial help in time of sickness, old age, or unemployment.\u201d The Trustee, asserting that the contract payments are not \u201cbenefits,\u201d relies on \u201cpayment or service provided for under an annuity, pension plan, or insurance policy.\u201d Given the breadth of the dictionary definitions, they are of no assistance in our resolution of the meaning of the word here, so we will turn to reading \u201cbenefits\u201d in its statutory context.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u00b618 Section 25-13-608, MCA, provides an extensive list of exemptions from execution, including prescribed health aids, Social Security benefits, veterans\u2019 benefits, individual retirement accounts, maintenance and child support, burial plots and certain types of statutory retirement system payments. The common denominator in all these exemptions is their specificity \u2014 all are unique types of support created for specific purposes. Read in context with the other provisions of \u00a7 25-13-608, MCA, we conclude that \u201cbenefits paid or payable for medical, surgical, or hospital care\u201d indicates \u201cbenefits\u201d means a unique type of support which, by its terms, is to be used solely for medical, surgical or hospital care. In this context, it strains credulity to assert that the Legislature intended this provision to exempt payments received on a promissory note merely because the debtor ultimately chooses to use the payments to pay for health-care-related costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b619  We conclude that, in the context of \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, the term \u201cbenefits\u201d includes only those payments to a debtor which are expressly earmarked for the sole purpose of paying medical, surgical or hospital bills. As a result, we hold that where, as here, there are no contractual restrictions on the debtor\u2019s use of the proceeds from a sale of shares of stock in a business, the debtor may not claim such proceeds as exempt \u201cbenefits\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, even when the proceeds are actually used exclusively to pay for the debtor\u2019s end-of-life medical, surgical or hospital care and medications.</p>\n<judges id=\"b30-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b30-6\">JUSTICE NELSON dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b620 I dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u00b621 We had two ways of interpreting \u00a7 25-13-608(1), MCA-liberally and without technical objections as Article XIII, Section 5 of Montana\u2019s Constitution explicitly provides; as the Legislature intended in enacting the statute; and as we have consistently interpreted the statute in our case law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-recognizing the \u201chumane and remedial purposes\u201d of laws enacted under this provision \u201cto shield the poor, and not to strip them.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Speith </em>(1893), 13 Mont. 487, 491, 34 P. 1020, 1023 (interpreting the identical provision of Article XIX, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>4 of the 1889 Constitution). Or, we could have interpreted the statute narrowly, technically, without regard to its remedial purposes, and inhumanely to strip the Archers of virtually the only funds they have to meet their end-of-life medical expenses, and to benefit their general creditors. Sadly, we have chosen the latter interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b622 Section 25-13-608(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] judgment debtor is entitled to exemption from execution of the following: ...(f) benefits paid or payable for medical, surgical, or hospital care to the extent they are used or will be used to pay for the care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b623 Analyzing the relevant terms of this statute according to their context and approved usage-see \u00a7 1-2-106, MCA-a \u201cbenefit\u201d is \u201csomething that promotes well being; advantage; useful aid; help\u201d or constitutes \u201cfinancial help in time of sickness, old age, or unemployment.\u201d <em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>106 (10th ed. 1997) (hereinafter <em>Webster\u2019s). </em>\u201cPayable\u201d means: \u201cthat may, can or must be paid.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, </em>at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b624 The record reflects that the Archers claim the exemption at issue to shield stock sale proceeds and to use those proceeds to pay for their end-of-life medical care. These payments are undisputedly \u201csomething that promotes well being;\u201d are a \u201cuseful aid,\u201d \u201chelp\u201d and \u201cadvantage;\u201d constitute \u201cfinancial help in time of sickness [or] old age,\u201d and can be \u201cpaid\u201d for medical care. See <em>Dayton, </em>where applying a liberal and nontechnical construction to the statute, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">A technical construction of the statute would ... be at variance with the spirit of the constitution and the laws of the state [Article XIX, Section 4 of the 1889 Constitution]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">... One confers an advantage upon himself by striving for his own benefit, and looks upon his labor done in his own benefit... as that which particularly furthers his interest and happiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-9\"><em>Dayton, </em>28 Mont. at 155-56, 72 P. at 421-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">\u00b625 As noted, we had two ways to interpret the statute at issue in the context of this case. It is black-letter law that when a statute is susceptible to two interpretations, one in favor of a natural right and the other against it, the interpretation which favors the natural right should be preferred. Section 1-2-104, MCA. Here, the Archers\u2019 natural rights-indeed, their fundamental constitutional rights to pursuing life\u2019s basic necessities, seeking safety, health and happiness,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>individual human dignity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>-fully justify their right to use their only available financial asset to insure their end-of-life medical care and essential end-of-life expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b626 The Archers are heartbreaking examples of what is wrong with health care in this Country. Tragically, they are one of millions of elderly couples whose health care and medication costs have simply outstripped their meager ability to pay. And, they are the victims of a society and a government that does not particularly care.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b627 A liberal, non-technical and humane interpretation of the exemption statute would allow the Archers to live out their days in dignity providing for their own medical care and end-of-life expenses. To the contrary, our crabbed interpretation of the exemption statute-the one which is not preferred under the law-has stripped the Archers of their natural and constitutional rights and the benefit which the Legislature conferred upon them under the statutory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b628 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\"> <em>In re Zimmermann, </em>2002 MT 90, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 337, \u00b6 15, 46 P.3d 599, \u00b6 15; <em>MacDonald v.
