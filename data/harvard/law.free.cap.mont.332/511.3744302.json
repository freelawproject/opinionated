We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as whether the District Court erred in finding that A.K.\u2019s mental disorder rendered her a danger to herself and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">\u00b63 On April 22, 2005, the Powell County Attorney filed a petition for the involuntary commitment of A.K., a 25-year-old woman. The petition alleged A.K. had a mental disorder and required commitment. The petition was based on an attached letter and consultation summary dated April 21, 2005, from mental health professional Delbert D. Fisher. The petition also sought detention of A.K. at MSH pending the requested hearing because A.K. \u201cis a danger to herself or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">\u00b64 In his one-paragraph letter supporting the petition, Fisher reported that he had received a telephone call from Dr. Robert Caldwell, who relayed information received from A.K.\u2019s medical professional that A.K. had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, developmental disorder and polysubstance dependence. The letter stated A.K. had discontinued taking her prescription medications for three months, had been drinking alcohol and traveling with people she did not know, and had run up a phone bill of $7,000 and a cell phone bill of $900. The letter further stated that, in the past, A.K. had met a couple via the internet, \u201ctraveled to NYC\u201d and was held hostage, beaten and had her money stolen. More recently, she \u201cfound a way to empty her bank account, despite having a payee.\u201d Fisher ended his letter by recommending that A.K. be committed to MSH. The only diagnosis contained in Fisher\u2019s consultation summary was \u201cbipolar\u201d and it was designated as a \u201cknown past diagnosis.\u201d Fisher represented that A.K.\u2019s impulse control and judgment were \u201cseverely impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5e\">\u00b65 On April 22, 2005, the District Court appointed counsel to represent A.K., held a telephonic hearing with A.K. and counsel, and appointed a professional person to evaluate A.K. The court scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>a commitment hearing for Monday, April 25, 2005, and ordered A.K. detained at MSH until the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b66 The sole witness at the commitment hearing was G. Michael Sawicki, II, a licensed clinical social worker and certified mental health professional. A.K.\u2019s counsel objected on hearsay grounds to the admission of any testimony by Sawicki about a page attached to the end of Fisher\u2019s consultation summary and to admission of that page, and the District Court sustained the objection. Sawicki testified he had reviewed Fisher\u2019s case notes and information, and also consulted with Caldwell before conducting \u201ca mini mental status exam, a diagnostic interview, a very brief risk assessment, and a fairly brief psychosocial history\u201d of A.K. that morning. He concluded that A.K.\u2019s reported symptoms and his observations were consistent with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a recent manic episode. Sawicki also diagnosed A.K. as mildly mentally retarded with a suggestion of borderline personality disorder. When asked if these diagnoses caused A.K. to be a danger to herself or others, Sawicki responded that A.K.\u2019s judgment and impulse control were profoundly impaired and that her cognitive delay put her at significant risk, due to being easily influenced and suggestible; in Sawicki\u2019s opinion, A.K.\u2019s ability to defend or protect herself was \u201cmore at a childlike level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b67 The County Attorney next asked Sawicki whether A.K.\u2019s conduct on one night the previous week of drinking rather heavily and being in the company of people she did not know was an example of her lack of ability to protect herself. Sawicki answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">[A]ny of us could go and drink too much and end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, however, I feel it is profound in that that event happened and that she lacked the insight, or concern or worry, when recollecting it, she lacked the capacity to grasp how dangerous that situation and that behavior ultimately can be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Thereafter, the District Court sustained hearsay objections by A.K.\u2019s counsel to testimony about A.K.\u2019s conduct in the past and any other information in Fisher\u2019s report. In further response to inquiries by A.K.\u2019s counsel and the County Attorney, Sawicki testified he could not identify or point to a single recent overt act that would have initiated the interview by Fisher or police involvement with A.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">\u00b68 The District Court subsequently entered brief and conclusory findings of fact regarding A.K.\u2019s condition. It also found that no treatment facilities less restrictive than MSH were available for A.K.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>care and treatment. The District Court ultimately ordered A.K. committed to MSH for a period not to exceed 90 days. A.K. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b69 We review a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in an involuntary commitment case to determine whether, upon viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party, the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 11, 325 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 104 P.3d 1065, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in finding that A.K.\u2019s mental disorder renders her a danger to herself and others?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u00b611 The statutes governing involuntary commitment are critically important due to the \u201ccalamitous effect of a commitment,\u201d which includes loss of liberty and damage to the respondent\u2019s reputation; thus, the statutes are to be strictly followed. <em>In re Mental Health of D.L.T., </em>2003 MT 46, \u00b6 8, 314 Mont. 297, \u00b6 8, 67 P.3d 189, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted). Indeed, in prior involuntary commitment cases, we have strongly cautioned trial courts to strictly comply with all relevant statutes. <em>See, e.g., C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u00b612 In an involuntary commitment case, the trial court first determines whether the respondent suffers from a mental disorder; if so, the court determines whether the respondent requires commitment by considering various statutory criteria. Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. Commitment is justified if any of the criteria in \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, are satisfied, based on the court\u2019s \u201cdetailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-127(7) and (8)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">\u00b613 One criterion justifying commitment is \u201cwhether, <em>because </em>of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-126(1)(c), MCA (emphasis added). Imminent threat of injury \u201cmust be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as to be material and relevant as to the respondent\u2019s present condition.\u201d Section 53-21-126(2), MCA; <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 22 (citations omitted). Another criterion the trial court may consider regarding commitment is whether, because of a mental disorder, the respondent is \u201csubstantially unable to provide for [her] own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.\u201d Section 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court\u2019s findings of fact regarding whether A.K. suffered from a mental disorder requiring commitment are not lengthy. Therefore, to facilitate our discussion, we set them forth in their entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">1. That [A.K.] suffers from a bi-polar disorder, a mental illness, together with mild mental retardation, borderline personality disorder, and polysubstance abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">2. That [A.K.\u2019s] mental illness is serious in that it renders her to be [a] danger to herself or others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">3. That the respondent\u2019s dangerousness is established by evidence of recent overt acts, specifically poor judgment and impaired impulse control which results in her being unable to protect herself or to meet her basic needs, as were testified to by Mr. Sawicki.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">4. The Court finds that the respondent lacks insight into her condition and her judgment is significantly impaired. She is not competent to make decisions related to her medical care and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">A.K. does not directly argue that these findings are statutorily deficient; she does observe generally, however, that the District Court\u2019s order of commitment did not rigorously follow statutory requirements. We have cautioned trial courts on a number of occasions that they must satisfy the requirement in \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, of a \u201cdetailed statement of the facts upon which the court [finds] the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d <em>See, e.g., C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Matter of D.D. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 164, 169, 920 P.2d 973, 976; <em>Matter of R.J.W. </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 419, 424, 736 P.2d 110, 113. The District Court\u2019s findings in the present case do not satisfy the statutory mandate. Moreover, such conclusory findings make our review more difficult than is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u00b615 With regard to finding 1, it is undisputed that A.K. suffers from a mental disorder-namely, bipolar disorder. The first portion of the District Court\u2019s finding, referencing bipolar disorder, is sufficient to establish a mental disorder. A.K. asserts, however, that the inclusion of her mild mental retardation and polysubstance abuse in the finding is improper, and we agree. The term \u201cmental disorder\u201d does not include \u201cmental retardation;\u201d nor does it include \u201caddiction to drugs or alcohol.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-102(9)(a), MCA. The District Court\u2019s inclusion of mental retardation and polysubstance abuse does not relate to the issue of whether a mental disorder exists. Moreover, while the court may have intended merely to mention these other matters as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>additional \u201cfactual matters,\u201d that inclusion-when overlaid onto the court\u2019s subsequent findings-confuses the present case considerably. This is especially so because Sawicki did not provide any testimony about whether or how bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder, which he stated was \u201csuggest[ed],\u201d may have contributed to A.K.\u2019s situation at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b616 With regard to finding 2, that A.K.\u2019s mental illness is \u201cserious in that it renders her [a] danger to herself or others,\u201d we can only surmise that this was intended to track the consideration in \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(c), MCA, regarding whether, because of a mental disorder, \u201cthere is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others ....\u201d Again, while A.K. does not argue that this finding is insufficient on its face to constitute an \u201cimminent threat\u201d resulting from her mental disorder, the trial court\u2019s \u201cdanger\u201d language reflects yet again its disregard of our holdings that involuntary commitment proceedings must strictly follow statutory requirements. <em>See, e.g., D.L.T., </em>\u00b6 8. For purposes of this case only, we will follow A.K.\u2019s lead and deem the \u201cdanger\u201d finding a finding of \u201cimminent threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b617 The \u201cimminent threat\u201d finding carries over to finding 3, in which the District Court determined that A.K.\u2019s \u201cdangerousness [was] established by evidence of recent overt acts, specifically poor judgment and impaired impulse control....\u201d A.K. argues that the finding of \u201covert acts\u201d is clearly erroneous because it is not supported by the evidence and, in addition, does not meet the standard for an overt act set forth in our jurisprudence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b618 Imminent threat of injury to self or others must be proved by \u201covert acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as to be material and relevant as to the respondent\u2019s present condition.\u201d Section 53-21-126(2), MCA; <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 22. The State of Montana (State) relies on <em>Matter of F.B. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 229, 615 P.2d 867, regarding the difficulty courts have in determining the definition of an overt act. In <em>F.B., </em>we stated an overt act \u201cneed not be a completed act. An attempt or threat, or even a failure to act may suffice.\u201d <em>F.B., </em>189 Mont. at 233, 615 P.2d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b619 The <em>F.B. </em>language is of no assistance to the State in the present case, in which there was no evidence or finding of any attempt, threat or failure to act. There was no evidence concerning specific acts or omissions evidencing A.K.\u2019s bipolar disorder. As A.K. asserts, and the record establishes, Sawicki responded to an inquiry from A.K.\u2019s counsel about whether he could point to a single overt act that would have initiated Fisher\u2019s interview by stating, \u201cI cannot.\u201d In response to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>question on redirect by the County Attorney, Sawicki testified \u201chonestly, I cannot see any single overt act or omission.\u201d In addition, the County Attorney conceded that \u201cthere is no overt act as such[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4I\">\u00b620 Notwithstanding Sawicki\u2019s testimony, the District Court entered a finding of \u201crecent overt acts.\u201d This finding is not only not supported by substantial credible evidence, it is not supported by any evidence and, in fact, is directly contrary to the evidence before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b621 Sawicki did testify, however, that he was \u201cvery aware of... aseries of events and behaviors that when added up, in my opinion,... sum up to a very risky situation.\u201d The County Attorney then argued to the District Court that the \u201cconduct that has been testified to</p>\n<p id=\"AuV\">... leads inescapably to a conclusion that this Respondent is unable to protect herself.\u201d The District Court apparently agreed, and found that the \u201crecent overt acts\u201d resulting in A.K.\u2019s being unable to protect herself, were her \u201cpoor judgment and impaired impulse control... as were testified to by Mr. Sawicki.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b622 Relying on <em>C.R. C., </em>\u00b6 33, A.K. argues on appeal that poor judgment does not constitute an overt act. The State attempts to distinguish <em>C.R.C., </em>and also advances other cases which it asserts are more analogous to the present case. We address these cases in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b623 Like the present case, <em>C.R.C. </em>involved the existence of an undisputed mental disorder. It also involved a series of potentially risky behaviors and questionable judgment. <em>See C.R.C., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 25, 32. We stated that \u201c[i]t may well be that C.R.C. had \u2018poor judgment\u2019 in a number of regards; poor judgment is a not uncommon human condition.\u201d We went on to observe that nothing of record in that case established any imminent threat of injury to C.R.C. or others. <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 33. Ultimately, we concluded that \u201cnone of the evidence on which the District Court relied supports its finding that, due to her mental disorder, C.R.C. presented an imminent threat of injury.\u201d <em>C.R. C., </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"AuZ\">\u00b624 The State attempts to distinguish <em>C.R.C. </em>from the present case on grounds that, in that case, nothing in the record indicated that the less-than-desirable conditions in which the respondent was living endangered her in any way. In this regard, the State points to Sawicki\u2019s testimony that A.K.\u2019s cognitive delays put her at significant risk because she is unable to defend or protect herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b625  Both Sawicki's testimony and the District Court's finding that A.K. was unable to protect her health referenced A.K.\u2019s limited cognitive abilities. As discussed above, however, mental retardation is not a mental disorder for purposes of treatment of the seriously mentally ill. Moreover, Sawicki did not testify that A.K.\u2019s cognitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>delays, poor judgment or impaired impulse control resulted from her bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder rather than from her mild mental retardation. As a result, we hold that A.K.\u2019s cognitive delays may not be used for purposes of determining that, because of her mental disorder, she presents an imminent threat requiring commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b626  The same is true for the District Court\u2019s reference to, and any reliance the court placed upon, A.K.\u2019s polysubstance abuse. Neither addiction to drugs or alcohol nor drug or alcohol intoxication constitutes a mental disorder for purposes of treatment of the seriously mentally ill. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-102(9)(b)(i) and (ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b627 The State also analogizes this case to <em>Matter of L.C.B. </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 1, 830 P.2d 1299, and <em>Matter of G.P. </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 195, 806 P.2d 3. Both of those cases were decided under statutory criteria not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b628 In <em>L. </em>C.B., the respondent had been arrested in connection with an automobile accident. While in custody, he appeared disoriented and confused, prompting law enforcement officials to ask that he be examined by a mental health professional. After examining the respondent, a psychiatrist diagnosed him as suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia which significantly impaired his ability to meet his own basic needs and protect his life and health-grounds for commitment which are now codified at \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA. The issue on appeal was whether the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondent had a serious mental illness which deprived him of the ability to protect his life or health was clearly erroneous. <em>See L.C.B., </em>253 Mont. at 2-5, 830 P.2d at 1300-01. We concluded sufficient evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding and the finding was not otherwise clearly erroneous. <em>L.C.B., 253 </em>Mont. at 6, 830 P.2d at 1303. \u00b629 In <em>G.P., </em>the respondent\u2019s parents requested that he be committed because he slept most of the time, ate very little, tore at his clothing, stood outside and stared into space, doubled up as if in pain, tore up his own apartment on one occasion, had not picked up his social security check-his sole source of income-and refused to take medications prescribed for him during prior hospitalizations. G.P., 246 Mont. at 196, 806 P.2d at 4. The professional person appointed to examine the respondent diagnosed him as a severe chronic schizophrenic who, without medication, developed severe auditory hallucinations that directed him to do things he could not control, thus posing a danger to himself and others. As in <em>L.C.B., </em>the issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>respondent\u2019s serious mental illness deprived him of the ability to protect his life or health. <em>See G.P., </em>246 Mont. at 198, 806 P.2d at 5. That commitment criterion is now codified at \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA. \u00b630 Because the respondents in <em>L.C.B. </em>and <em>G.P. </em>were not committed under the \u201cimminent threat of injury\u201d criterion under any predecessor of \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(c), MCA, neither of those cases involved the same \u201covert acts\u201d requirement as does the present case. Nor did the trial courts in either of those cases reference the respondents\u2019 mental retardation or addiction to drugs or alcohol in connection with a commitment order. Most importantly, in each case, the appointed professional person connected the serious mental illness at issue to the respondent\u2019s significantly impaired ability or inability to protect life or health. <em>See L.C.B., </em>253 Mont. at 6, 830 P.2d at 1302-03; <em>G.P., </em>246 Mont. at 198-99, 806 P.2d at 5. In the present case, Sawicki\u2019s testimony did not connect A.K.\u2019s serious mental illness with the claimed imminent threat of injury to A.K. or to others because of A.K.\u2019s acts or omissions. We conclude the State\u2019s reliance on <em>L.C.B. </em>and <em>G.P. </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b631 Finally, we observe that the District Court did use, in finding 3, the \u201cunable to protect herself or to meet her basic needs\u201d language paraphrasing the criterion contained in \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA. As set forth above, this was not the basis on which the petition was filed. In any event, Sawicki did not testify that A.K.\u2019s \u201cpoor judgment and impaired impulse control\u201d were a result of her serious mental illness. Consequently, finding 3 is not a valid basis for A.K.\u2019s involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b632  We hold the District Court\u2019s findings are not supported by sufficient evidence and, as a result, its order committing A.K. to the Montana State Hospital does not meet the requirements for involuntary commitment. We reverse the order of commitment and remand with directions to the District Court to vacate that order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b519-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"Apq3\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u00b633 The Court reverses the order committing A.K. to Montana State Hospital on the grounds that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are unsupported by substantial evidence-specifically, the findings with regard to an \u201covert\u201d act, which the Court states are \u201cnot supported by any evidence and, in fact, is directly contrary to the evidence,\u201d and, further, that the testimony \u201cdid not connect A.K.\u2019s serious mental illness\u201d to the claimed imminent threat of injury to A.K. arising from her actions. I disagree with these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u00b634 The <em>\u201covert act\u201d testimony </em>on which the Court relies began on cross-examination, when A.K.\u2019s counsel asked Sawicki if he could point to an overt act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">A. [by Sawicki] Can you elaborate on what you mean by an overt act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Q. Overt act.-A recent overt act, something that happened in the not too distant past, which is the reason that the police became aware that [A.K.] was in Deer Lodge, and felt that she was suffering from some sort of a psychological problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">A. I cannot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b635 Obvious from his question, Sawicki was uncertain about counsel\u2019s meaning of the term, \u201covert act.\u201d In response, defense counsel defined the term as, essentially, \u201csomething recently that happened to bring A.K. to the attention of police and raised a concern she was suffering from a psychological problem.\u201d To this explanation, Sawicki answered negatively. Unfortunately, an \u201covert act\u201d has nothing to do with timing or coming to the attention of police, and Sawicki may have been confused about what information defense counsel was seeking. Indeed, in his direct testimony, Sawicki had testified that he did not know how A.K. had come to the attention of authorities. Regardless, when the whole of his testimony is examined, it is clear that he believed that A.K. had committed acts, recent in time, which established that she was an imminent threat to herself because of her mental disorders, as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00b636 \u201cOvert\u201d is not statutorily defined, but there is no mystery to the term. It simply means \u201copen and observable; not concealed or secret,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition; or, \u201copen to view,\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition. Thus, \u201covert,\u201d as applied to acts, describes actions which can be observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u00b637 Sawicki first testified about the observable circumstances. Without objection, Sawicki testified that A.K. was under the care of a psychiatrist for mental disorders, left Helena, without telling her mother and guardian, in the company of a person she described as a friend but whom she could not identify. This \u201cfriend\u201d left A.K. stranded in Deer Lodge, and A.K., without communicating with home, went to a local tavern, where she proceeded to drink from noon on Wednesday to 2:00 a.m. on Thursday morning, ending up in the company of people she did not know. These actions were observable, and the Court thus errs by concluding that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of overt acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">\u00b638 The question for the District Court then became, under \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(c), MCA, whether these overt acts demonstrated an imminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>threat of injury to A.K. because of her mental disorder. Here, the Court concludes that \u201cno connection\u201d was made between these acts and A.K.\u2019s mental disorders. However, after testifying that A.K. suffered from bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder (he later identified a third problem, a \u201cdefinite disability with her memory\u201d), Sawicki testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">Q. Do these diagnoses, or these conditions that you have diagnosed, excuse me, cause [A.K.] to be a danger to herself or others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">A. In my opinion, her judgment and impulse control is profoundly impaired. It is my opinion that her cognitive delays put her at significant risk in that she is easily influenced, very suggestible, and, if you will, has-lacks-the matine adult self-care mechanisms, more accurately, her ability to defend or protect herself are more at a childlike level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">Q. <em>Would, her conduct on last Friday night </em>of drinking rather heavily and being in the company of people that she did not know, be an example of the lack of ability to protect herself that you\u2019re talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">A. <em>I think it is very significant in this case. </em>Of-You know, of course, any of us could go and drink too much and end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, however, I feel it is profound in that-that event happened and that she lacked the insight, or concern or worry, when recollecting it, <em>she lacked the capacity to grasp how dangerous that situation and that behavior ultimately can be. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u00b639 Sawicki added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">A. ... [M]ost poignantly, she had a basically, uh-for lack of a better word, no performance on the-the components of the mini mental status exam that test for reasoning and judgment, that is, if I can use our language, the serial sevens, proper interpretation and fact recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">These and other elements of this case lead me to believe that-on a very functional level-[A.K] is unable to make healthcare decisions, she is unable to make decisions that will protect her life and health, and in fact I believe <em>she is at a high, high level of risk </em>because of her lower level of functioning on a-in a cognitive manner. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">\u00b640 Finally, Sawicki concluded with a statement that may have keyed off of defense counsel\u2019s definition of \u201covert act,\u201d but which nonetheless established the statutory requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>A. In this case, as I indicated to defense, honestly I cannot see any single overt act or omission. However, what I am very aware of is a <em>series of events and behaviors that when added up, in my opinion-sum up to a very risky situation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><em>... [TJhat\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing in this case. A series of behaviors, a course of conduct, a lack of judgment-and that\u2019s my concern for [A.K.], is safety at this case-in this time. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b641 A review of the entirety of Sawicki\u2019s testimony reveals that he clearly testified that A.K.\u2019s \u201cbehaviors,\u201d \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d had placed her, because of her mental disorders, in a \u201chigh, high level of risk\u201d and in a \u201cvery risky situation.\u201d It should be recalled that Sawicki also explained that A.K.\u2019s defense mechanisms were \u201cat a childlike level.\u201d Thus, A.K. was out of town, stranded, out of communication with her family, drinking heavily, in the company of people she did not know, with a childlike ability to care for herself. She was, in fact, far from home, lost and in danger-as a direct result of her mental conditions. Sawicki\u2019s testimony established that it was A.K.\u2019s mental disorders which had placed her in an \u201cimminent threat of injury,\u201d and that this threat was based upon her overt behaviors. The statute was thus satisfied and there was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b642 The Court holds that the evidence here was not sufficient to establish an \u201cimminent threat of injury\u201d which would allow the State to act. To the contrary, A.K. was a half step away from a tragic injury or outcome. It was imminent-\u201ca high, high level of risk.\u201d Requiring evidence which establishes a still greater \u201cimminent threat\u201d than existed in this case is not only unnecessary under the statute, but may well tie the hands of the State until it is too late to prevent tragedy. After that tragedy occurs, we will no longer debate whether the threat was imminent enough for the State to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u00b643 I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
