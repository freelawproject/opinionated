We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Golie\u2019s challenge of a prospective juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">\u00b63 The State of Montana charged Golie by information with the felony offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI). The State also charged Golie with misdemeanor offenses to which she eventually pled guilty; the misdemeanors are not at issue here. The case proceeded to trial on the felony charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u00b64 During jury voir dire, prospective juror John Lundt revealed the issue of DUI was a \u201csore subject\u201d for him because, in 1969, he had been injured by a drunk driver who was never prosecuted. After subsequent questioning, defense counsel challenged him for cause and the District Court denied the challenge. Later, after additional statements by Lundt, defense counsel renewed the challenge for cause and the court again denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">\u00b65 Golie exercised one peremptory challenge to remove Lundt and exhausted all of her peremptory challenges. The jury was selected, the parties presented their cases, and the jury convicted Golie of DUI. The District Court subsequently entered judgment and sentence. Golie appeals. We set forth additional facts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">\u00b66 We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Marble, </em>2005 MT 208, \u00b6 10, 328 Mont. 223, \u00b6 10, 119 P.3d 88, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Golie\u2019s challenge to a prospective juror for cause ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b68 Section 46-16-115(2), MCA, sets forth the bases for challenging potential jurors for cause in Montana criminal cases. One specified basis is that a juror has \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. A challenge under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, must be determined pursuant to both the statutory language and the totality of the circumstances presented. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 16, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 16, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 16. If voir dire examination raises a serious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, dismissal for cause is favored. <em>State v. Richeson, </em>2004 MT 113, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 126, \u00b6 14, 89 P.3d 958, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b69 Golie argues Lundt demonstrated bias by his statements regarding his unresolved DUI-related experience. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b610 We have acknowledged that a prospective juror\u2019s past experiences and characteristics may not necessarily affect his or her ability to remain impartial; however, we also have recognized a \u201c \u2018fundamental fact of human character\u2019 \u201d is that people are \u201c \u2018prone to favor that side of a cause with which they identify themselves either economically, socially, or emotionally.\u2019 \u201d <em>See State v. Lamere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 115, \u00b6 17, 112 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 17 (quoting <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 61, 64, 947 P.2d 57, 59-60, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 33, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 33, 70 P.2d 738, \u00b6 33). In determining whether a serious question has arisen regarding a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, we review his or her responses as a whole. <em>See Heath, </em>\u00b6 18 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b611 Here, the prosecutor asked various prospective jurors whether they could think of a situation in which it would be \u201cokay\u201d to drive while under the influence and whether the DUI laws were too strict. The prospective jurors responded. Then, the following exchange occurred between the prosecutor and Lundt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">MS. LaCROIX: You\u2019ve been kind of quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">JUROR LUNDT: This is kind of a sore subject for me. I would say I was injured by a drunk driver. My left arm was shattered. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>person in question was a well-to-do son of an attorney who sent the young lad to Europe to avoid prosecution. It\u2019s kind of a sore subject for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">MS. LaCROIX: Really. How long ago was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">JUROR LUNDT: 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">MS. LaCROIX: And was the person ever brought to justice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA\">JUROR LUNDT: Never.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">MS. LaCROIX: So-yeah, you have every reason to be angry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">JUROR LUNDT: (The juror nodded his head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">MS. LaCROIX: Probably at everybody involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">JUROR LUNDT: Both drunk drivers and attorneys. Not, you know, in a wholesale sense but I had issues with all those involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">MS. LaCROIX: We get that a lot. I like to tell people when they\u2019re railing on attorneys, you know, I\u2019m really not an attorney. I\u2019m a prosecutor. We\u2019re a little bit different but-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtU\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t have an instruction on that so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">MS. LaCROIX: -I won\u2019t say what I\u2019m thinking. Thank you for your candor. Would you be able to sit and listen to the-my officers testifying about what they saw Ms. Golie doing and could you be fair to \u2014 to the state and could you be fair to Ms. Golie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">JUROR LUNDT: Probably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">The prosecutor then questioned Lundt about his profession and family. \u00b612 Later, Golie\u2019s counsel questioned Lundt as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">MS. BORG: Mr. Lundt, let me start by going back to your concerns here, the sore subject if you would. As Kathleen Golie\u2019s attorney, what I\u2019m looking for today are people that can be unbiased and unprejudiced in this case, and this is a driving-while-impaired case. With your life experience, are you that guy? Are you unbiased and unprejudiced in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">JUROR LUNDT: Probably in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-16\">MS. BORG: Okay. Now neither Ms. LaCroix nor I can change the fact that-that we\u2019re attorneys. We\u2019re stuck with that, but we need to be very clear here that Kathleen Golie is presumed innocent, and jurors can\u2019t bring with them anything that would skew that perception or bring a bias and a prejudice, and as I heard you talk about the sore subject my little red flags went up. How can you guarantee you have no biases or prejudices in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-17\">JUROR LUNDT: I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-18\">MS. BORG: Okay. If you were on trial for a DUI, would you want to be judged by a juror that felt like you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-19\">JUROR LUNDT: Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>MS. BORG: Okay. And can you put that in words for me? Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\">JUROR LUNDT: I would be concerned about residual feelings concerning the subject at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">MS. BORG: Okay. I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth. The judge has to hear this from you, but are you telling me that in this case you can\u2019t guarantee no bias and no prejudice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">JUROR LUNDT: Can you restate that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">MS. B\u00d3RG: Can you promise me you have no bias and prejudice in this case either for the state or against the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">JUROR LUNDT: I have no bias against the state. I\u2019m-I\u2019m concerned about the State of Montana and its approach to this issue which I think has been sophomoric for years. I don\u2019t have a strong prejudice against attorneys in general. There are a few I\u2019m not fond of for obvious reasons, but I don\u2019t paint the entire profession, toggle them all with the same brush. This is a subject that is of great concern to me. The person in question was not obviously driving the car that hit me; wasn\u2019t even born yet. It-it\u2019s just an emotional issue for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">MS. BORG: I understand that, and I\u2019m looking for jurors on behalf of Kathleen Golie that don\u2019t have that emotional issue or that emotional charge that they bring to the panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">JUROR LUNDT: And you\u2019d probably be better to select someone else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">MS. BORG: Well, I appreciate that, but I have to have you say that so that I can ask the judge to excuse you for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">JUROR LUNDT: What-what-what do you want me to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">MS. BORG: I can\u2019t quite go there. I want you to tell me whether you can be unbiased and unprejudiced in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">JUROR LUNDT: I don\u2019t think I would be your best choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">MS. BORG: Okay. Should you be excused for cause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-15\">JUROR LUNDT: I don\u2019t know. What are the causes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-16\">MS. BORG: Well, I\u2019m trying to get you tell [sic] me that. I hear you say you can\u2019t guarantee that you wouldn\u2019t be biased or prejudiced in this case, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-17\">JUROR LUNDT: I think that this would be an emotionally charged issue for me in terms of being dishonest or-or prejudiced or-or ignoring evidence. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all. It\u2019s just a situation in which if I had not been involved in that type of-of an incident it would be much easier for me to participate and probably a lot easier for all of you folks also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>MS. BORG: I don\u2019t think anyone would-would want to leave you with the impression we think you would be dishonest or do anything inappropriate. What we\u2019re looking for is jurors don\u2019t come in with loaded emotional issues that might influence how they would deliberate this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">Everybody\u2019s the perfect juror for some case, not everybody is the perfect juror for this case, and I\u2019m hearing you say that you\u2019re not the right guy for this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">JUROR LUNDT: I don\u2019t think I would be the best selection for this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">MS. BORG: Okay. And I also hear you say that-that that might prejudice the defendant in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">JUROR LUNDT: I think it would make her nervous. Were I in her position listening to me I would be uncomfortable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">MS. BORG: Okay. And it might even prejudice the state. You said something about you thought they were sophomoric about their-the way they deal with DUIs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">JUROR LUNDT: I think the-no, not necessarily DUIs. I think the laws in the state of Montana in which you could actively drink and drive at the same time, which I guess have been changed recently, but when I first moved here I was absolutely floored to see people drinking and driving and to realize that they were not in violation of the law having come from-lived in several states where even having an open container was a violation of the law. I found the laws here to be shocking. Rather backward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">MS. BORG: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">JUROR LUNDT: Dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">MS. BORG: Okay. And then back to my trading-places question. I heard you say that if you were on trial as Kathleen Golie is you would not want to be judged by someone who had your opinions in this case; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-14\">JUROR LUNDT: I\u2019d feel more comfortable with someone who had not had an unpleasant experience in the exact same arena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">MS. BORG: Judge, I\u2019m going to ask Mr. Lundt be excused for cause in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">\u00b613 The prosecutor objected and the District Court asked if she wished to ask farther questions. The prosecutor stated, \u201cI do not, Your Honor. I think he\u2019s indicated he may not be her best choice but certainly has not met the level of bias or prejudice as required.\u201d The court asked defense counsel if she had anything to add, and she replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-17\">No, Judge. I would argue that I may not be as-as articulate as I need to to [sic] get the exact words out but I think he continues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tell me that he has bias and prejudices, that he would not want to be judged by someone like him in a case like this, and I believe that that reaches the level of a for cause objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The District Court denied Golie\u2019s challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b614 Toward the end of voir dire, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA7\">MS. BORG: My last question is the trading-places question. I want you all to think here for just a sec. If I was on trial in this case, would I want to be judged by a person just like me? Is there anybody on the panel that would be uncomfortable knowing what they know about themselves or the things they think about this case being judged by someone just like them if they were on trial? Mr. Lundt. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">JUROR LUNDT: I think we already discussed this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">MS. BORG: I think we did, and we didn\u2019t get where we needed to go with that. I\u2019d love to be able to ask the judge to excuse you for cause because I believe that you have given us cause, but Ms. LaCroix doesn\u2019t think you have, and the judge hasn\u2019t heard enough cause yet. So what is the cause that you can\u2019t be the right juror in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">JUROR LUNDT: Well, that\u2019s not the question you asked. You asked why would she be uncomfortable or why would I if I were trading places and that\u2019s simply because-MS. BORG: Help me out here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">JUROR LUNDT: -I would rather have somebody who had no experience in that area and maybe wasn\u2019t bringing anything to the table because of their past experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">MS. BORG: It\u2019s the issue of what you bring to the table in this case that\u2019s out there, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">JUROR LUNDT: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">MS. BORG: Okay. And how-how will what you bring to the table impact your ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A66\">JUROR LUNDT: I\u2019m not sure that-that it will entirely. It\u2019s just that were I in this hypothetical situation you\u2019re describing I would be nervous being, you know, at that table-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ank\">MS. BORG: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">JUROR LUNDT: -dealing with this because of the-the relatively bad experience that the other person had had in a very similar or at least potentially similar situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">MS. BORG: And-and what-what would the impact be? Would you-how-how would your experience influence how you would be a juror in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>JUROR LUNDT: I think I would-I would consider the fact that the person involved had an unresolved situation and that they might carry part of that baggage with them. The anger of-of that not being resolved, it would make me nervous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">MS. BORG: Okay. So we\u2019re talking about your-your anger about the issue of DUI and the fact that you have unresolved issues in-in this arena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">JUROR LUNDT: (The juror nodded his head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">MS. BORG: That you might somehow-those experiences might bias how you judge Kathleen Golie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">JUROR LUNDT: I think that would worry me were I her if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">MS. BORG: And I take it that would bias her or be somehow negative to her best interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">JUROR LUNDT: I-I think it would be something that probably would or should be in the back of her mind as a concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">MS. BORG: Okay. So you\u2019re telling me that in this case you are not unbiased or unprejudiced with regard to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">JUROR LUNDT: No. You\u2019re-you\u2019re rearranging what I\u2019m saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayq\">MS. BORG: I don\u2019t want to rearrange what you\u2019re saying but I\u2019m having a hard time-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">JUROR LUNDT: You\u2019re having a hard time getting where you want to go. I have no feelings about this person at all. I have serious issues with the-the overall issue of-of the irresponsibility that goes with driving while impaired. That\u2019s a-a very passionate concern for me, not necessarily connected, you know, to this person who I\u2019ve never seen before I walked in here but-but it is a relatively sore subject for me and-and one that I am very emotionally involved with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">MS. BORG: And what I need to know is will that-will that potentially negatively impact Kathleen Golie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">JUROR LUNDT: I would like to think it wouldn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">MS. BORG: Okay. Judge, I am going to renew my request that Mr. Lundt be excused for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">THE COURT: And subject to that, do you pass the remaining panel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-16\">MS. BORG: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-17\">THE COURT: So I again deny the request!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">\u00b615 Lundt\u2019s early response characterized the issue of DUI as a \u201csore subject\u201d for him since 1969. He consistently referred to his strong emotions about the subject. When asked how what he \u201cbrought to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>table\u201d would impact his ability to be fair and impartial, he stated he was \u201cnot sure that-that it will entirely.\u201d Ultimately, he stated he did not know if his \u201cpassionate concern\u201d about the \u201csore subject... one that [he was] very emotionally involved with\u201d would negatively impact Golie. These statements raised a serious question about Lundt\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial. <em>See Richeson, </em>\u00b6 14. Moreover, Lundt\u2019s responses establish he had a state of mind in reference to the case that would prevent him from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to Golie\u2019s substantial rights, as set forth in \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b616 The State argues, however, that this case is factually distinguishable from previous cases in which we determined the trial court abused its discretion by denying a challenge for cause. It asserts that, unlike <em>State v. Williams </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 530, 534-36, 866 P.2d 1099, 1101-02, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 63, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 63, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 63, Lundt did not repeatedly express concern about his ability to be impartial, was not a friend of any witness, did not live in the neighborhood of the alleged crime scene, did not form an opinion based on news coverage and did not recently serve as a juror in a similar case. The State also distinguishes <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, 292 Mont. 325, 972 P.2d 816, <em>overruled on other grounds by Good, </em>\u00b6 63, noting Lundt did not state a belief that Golie was \u201cguilty of something\u201d simply because she was charged. Distinguishing <em>Good, </em>apparently regarding prospective jurors\u2019 stated difficulty in believing a young alleged sexual abuse victim would lie and in waiting until submission of the case to make a decision, the State cites to Lundt\u2019s statement he would not ignore evidence and contends he indicated he would judge the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b617 In the past, we have reasoned that-despite factual distinctions from prior cases-the questions remain whether the prospective juror has a state of mind preventing him or her from acting impartially and without prejudice to a party\u2019s substantial rights, or whether the prospective juror\u2019s statements have raised a serious question about his or her ability to be impartial. For example, in <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 25, after addressing the factual distinctions between that case and <em>Williams, </em>we stated \u201c[ajlthough the facts are different, the issues in <em>Williams </em>and this case are the same.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Good, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-53, we acknowledged the prospective jurors in that case had not expressed a belief that the defendant was \u201cguilty of something,\u201d as did the prospective jurors in <em>DeVore-, </em>however, we concluded their belief that an alleged teenage victim would not lie about sexual abuse raised a serious question about their ability to be impartial and afford the presumption of innocence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00b618 It is hardly surprising that the statements at issue here differ from those in past cases addressed by this Court. Prosecutors and defense counsel in different cases may not ask-or follow up on-identical questions during voir dire, and prospective jurors in different cases are highly unlikely to respond with precisely the same answers. Our prior decisions establish only whether particular responses have indicated bias or raised a serious question of impartiality. Those cases provide guidance to litigants and trial judges, but a \u201cone size fits all\u201d rule defining all possible factual circumstances justifying a challenge for cause simply is not feasible. Ultimately, despite factual distinctions, the issues in \u201cchallenge for cause\u201d cases under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, remain constant: whether a prospective juror\u2019s statements have demonstrated a \u201cstate of mind\u201d affecting his or her ability to be impartial and act without prejudice to either party, and whether a \u201cserious question\u201d has arisen in that regard. Where, as in this case, the answer to either or both inquiries is in the affirmative, dismissal for cause is favored. <em>See Richeson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 <em>14-15.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b619 Next, citing to <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, 309 Mont. 154, 43 P.3d 968, the State argues Lundt did not state \u201can actual bias directly related to an issue critical to the outcome of the case.\u201d In <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 16, we applied \u201ccritical issue\u201d language to prospective jurors\u2019 statements of unwillingness to acquit a defendant if he established a legal affirmative defense. We also used \u201ccritical issue\u201d language in <em>State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 53, 325 Mont. 27, \u00b6 53, 103 P.3d 1037, \u00b6 53, regarding a prospective juror\u2019s statements that he could not apply a law with which he disagreed even if instructed to do so. The \u201ccritical issue\u201d language was appropriate and useful in those cases, but did not create an additional requirement for establishing a challenge for cause under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. \u201cCritical issue\u201d language in prior cases is simply not relevant to our determinations here that Lundt\u2019s statements met the \u201cstate of mind\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, and raised a serious question about his ability to be impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b620 The State also argues this case is similar to <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 31, where we determined a defendant\u2019s unsupported speculation regarding a prospective juror\u2019s emotional involvement fell far short of establishing bias via circumstantial evidence. In this regard, the State contends Lundt described his DUI injury as merely \u201can unpleasant experience\u201d and emphasizes his statement that Golie was not driving the car that hit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b621 <em>In Heath, </em>\u00b6 31, we rejected as \u201cpurely speculative\u201d the defendant\u2019s argument that a prospective juror \u201cwould have developed substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>emotional involvement\u201d in her prior work as a rape survivor advocate and \u201cit would only be natural\u201d for her to identify with the alleged victim in a sexual intercourse without consent case. Similarly, in <em>Richeson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28, we rejected as \u201cspeculation\u201d the defendant\u2019s argument that a detention officer\u2019s judgment and deliberations as a juror would have been affected by her observations of the defendant in jail before trial, pressure from workplace peers and knowledge that the defendant could return to the jail if convicted. Unlike the arguments in <em>Heath </em>and <em>Richeson, </em>Golie\u2019s argument is not speculative. It is supported by Lundt\u2019s statements that he was very emotional about his decades-old unresolved DUI-related incident and did not know if-or to what extent-his emotions would negatively impact Golie.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b622 With respect to Lundt\u2019s description of his past DUI-related incident as \u201cunpleasant,\u201d we review the totality of a prospective juror\u2019s responses to determine whether they raised a serious question about his or her ability to be fair and impartial. <em>See Heath, </em>\u00b6 18. Viewed in context, Lundt\u2019s characterization of his past experience as \u201cunpleasant\u201d is simply one of many expressions of his negative feelings about DUI, not a contradiction of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b623 The State also observes, correctly, that some of Lundt\u2019s statements were responses to defense counsel\u2019s questions asking him to place himself in Golie\u2019s position. In <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 25, we noted the defendant had not presented authority for the proposition that a prospective juror\u2019s statement that a defendant might not want him or her on the jury constitutes actual bias or an inappropriate state of mind under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. The same is true here. However, we have already set forth Lundt\u2019s responses raising a serious question about his ability to be fair and impartial and establishing the \u201cstate of mind\u201d criterion in \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. The record reflects Lundt was speaking from his own perspective when he made these statements. Thus, his separate responses to \u201ctrading places\u201d questions have no bearing on our analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b624 Emphasizing Lundt\u2019s \u201cprobably\u201d responses when asked by the prosecutor and defense counsel whether he could be fair, unbiased and unprejudiced, the State characterizes those responses as Lundt\u2019s initial statements regarding bias. It advances this Court\u2019s emphasis on a prospective juror\u2019s spontaneous, and usually initial, statements in evaluating whether he or she has expressed a \u201cfixed opinion\u201d regarding a defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt. <em>See, e.g., State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 35, 318 Mont. 219, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 35, 79 P.3d 797, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u00b625 The \u201cfixed opinion\u201d rule is only one argument that may be made under the \u201cstate of mind\u201d basis for a challenge for cause set forth in \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-16. Here, Golie\u2019s argument is not that Lundt expressed a \u201cfixed opinion\u201d regarding her guilt or innocence, but that he demonstrated a \u201cstate of mind\u201d indicating bias-that which would prevent him from acting impartially and without prejudice to her substantial rights, as set forth in \u00a7 46-16-115(2)0), MCA. Thus, the \u201cfixed opinion\u201d rule <em>send Falls </em>Doum-which concerns only the \u201cfixed opinion\u201d rule-are not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b626 The State is correct, however, that we emphasize initial statements or responses with respect to challenges based on \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. <em>See Heath, </em>\u00b6 25. Here, Lundt\u2019s \u201cprobably\u201d responses were not his initial statements about his state of mind. In fact, Lundt\u2019s first \u201cprobably\u201d response occurred <em>after </em>he volunteered DUI was a \u201csore subject\u201d due to his past experience, nodded at the comment that he had every reason to be angry, and expressed anger at drunk drivers and the attorneys involved in the prior incident. Lundt\u2019s first \u201cprobably\u201d answer also was in response to the prosecutor\u2019s comment that she was \u201creally not an attorney\u201d and question about whether he could listen to officers and be \u201cfair.\u201d Lundt\u2019s \u201cprobably\u201d response to defense counsel occurred even later. Given the dialogue before and between the \u201cprobably\u201d responses, those responses cannot properly be characterized as Lundt\u2019s initial statements. Thus, we need not address the State\u2019s assertion that defense counsel manipulated Lundt\u2019s \u201cprobably\u201d responses, because the \u201cmanipulation\u201d analysis pertains only to initial statements. <em>See Heath, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b627 Finally, the State contends this Court may not substitute its judgment for a trial court\u2019s determination of a prospective juror\u2019s demeanor, expression and manner. It relies on <em>Williams, </em>262 Mont. at 536, 866 P.2d at 1102 (quoting <em>State v. Allison </em>(1948), 122 Mont. 120, 129-30, 199 P.2d 279, 285-86), for the proposition that, although the statements of a person \u201cwho has first said \u2018no\u2019 and then said \u2018yes\u2019\u201d require careful scrutiny, it is within the province of the trial court to determine \u201cwhere the truth lies.\u201d Lundt stated consistently that he was emotional about DUI and admitted he did not know whether his emotions would prejudice Golie. Thus, the present case does not involve a \u201cno, then yes\u201d situation; nor does it involve a question of where the truth lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b628  We conclude Lundt\u2019s responses raised a serious question about his ability to be fair and impartial. We also conclude, pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, that his responses establish he had a state of mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>in reference to the case that would prevent him from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to Golie\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b629 We take this opportunity to remind trial courts that our decisions favoring dismissals for cause-when a nonspeculative \u201cserious question\u201d arises about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial-are premised upon both the constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury and the significant expense and inconvenience that results from retrial. <em>See Richeson, </em>\u00b6 14. When a district court abuses its discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s challenge for cause, the defendant uses a peremptory challenge to remove the disputed prospective juror, and the defendant exhausts all peremptory challenges, structural error requiring automatic reversal results. Heath, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted). It is fair to say that the failure to grant a valid challenge for cause negatively impacts the overall administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b630  We hold the District Court abused its discretion in denying Golie\u2019s challenge for cause. Because it is undisputed that Golie exercised a peremptory challenge to remove Lundt and exhausted all of her peremptory challenges, we further hold this structural error mandates automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b631 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
