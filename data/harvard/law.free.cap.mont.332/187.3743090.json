Markegard (Jane) appeals from the order entered by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, denying her motion for relief from judgment and from the underlying judgment in this dissolution proceeding. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Jane\u2019s second post-trial motion, in which Jane first requested recusal or disqualification of the presiding judge due to Jane\u2019s pre-petition meeting with the judge in her prior capacity as an attorney?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in distributing the marital estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b65 In August of 2003, Rodney Pierce Markegard (Rod) petitioned for dissolution of his marriage to Jane. Judge Diane G. Barz originally presided over the case, and Judge Ingrid Gustafson took her place in January of 2004. The case proceeded to trial on November 10, 2004, and the District Court entered a decree of dissolution on November 16, 2004. The court characterized a business as Rod\u2019s premarital asset and traced all but $23,179 of the proceeds from the sale of the home in which Rod and Jane lived to Rod\u2019s premarital assets and Rod\u2019s inheritance. In distributing the marital assets and debts, the court awarded Rod the real property where the business was located, along with certain associated debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b66 Pursuant to Rules 59(a) and 60(b)(3), M.R.Civ.P., Jane moved to reopen the hearing so she could submit additional evidence on a matter relating to the property distribution. The District Court denied the motion on December 10, 2004, and Rod served Jane with notice of entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b67 On January 26, 2005, Jane moved for reconsideration of the previously denied motion to reopen the hearing or, alternatively, for relief from judgment pursuant to Rules 60(b)(2) and 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. She did not argue that the District Court had improperly denied her motion to reopen the hearing, but asked Judge Gustafson to vacate the judgment, grant a new trial and recuse herself based on \u201cpast representation and legal advise [sic] given to [Jane]\u201d by Judge Gustafson before she became a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b68 In support of her Rule 60(b) motion, Jane filed her affidavit stating she had told her counsel on January 21, 2005, that, before Judge Gustafson assumed the bench, Jane had consulted with her for \u201csomewhere between one and two hours,\u201d obtained her \u201copinion as to the divorce expectations,\u201d and paid for her services. Jane further averred that she and attorney Gustafson discussed \u201cher marital situation, her marital strategy and other confidential information concerning her relationship with [Rod].\u201d She stated she did not previously tell her counsel about the consultation-\u201ceven though [she] recognized the Judge at the time of the hearing on the dissolution proceedings\u201d in November of 2004-because she \u201cwas intimidated by the proceedings, and did not know the appropriate information to pass on to her counsel.\u201d She stated \u201cthird parties\u201d encouraged her to'report the prior contact. She also stated she believed the knowledge gleaned during the consultation \u201cmay have influenced the Court, or at a minimum, your affiant\u2019s confidence has been diminished that your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Honor could fairly rule on the marital issues due tho [sic] this past representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b69 The District Court denied Jane\u2019s motion. In the order, Judge Gustafson stated she had contacted her former law firm and learned she had met for 1.3 hours with Jane on July 28, 2003, Jane had paid $108 for the consultation, and Jane did not retain Gustafson or the firm. Judge Gustafson further related that, to avoid the appearance of impropriety in other cases, she had recused herself immediately upon learning she had represented a party or met with a prospective litigant in her capacity as an attorney. In addition, Judge Gustafson stated that, other than her post-judgment review of the firm\u2019s records, she had \u201cno recollection, whatsoever, of ever consulting with [Jane],\u201d she did not remember the subject matter of the consultation-although she presumed it likely was related to dissolution issues-and she had not recognized Jane or the circumstances of the case during the proceedings. The judge explained she \u201cwould not hesitate to set aside the Judgment entered herein if [she] believed that her encounter with [Jane] ... in any way influenced, biased or prejudiced the Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decree of Dissolution. Such is not the case.\u201d Judge Gustafson suggested that, if the decree of dissolution had adopted Jane\u2019s proposed property distribution, Jane likely would not have reported the consultation and \u201cwould have been content to, in essence, reap the benefit of any prior contact[.]\u201d The judge opined Jane was \u201cmerely seeking another bite at the apple,\u201d expressed concern about Jane\u2019s \u201capparent game playing\u201d and stated she was denying J ane\u2019s motion \u201cto protect the integrity of the Judiciary ... and to avoid the blatant manipulation of this Court[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b610 Jane appeals. We set forth additional facts in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See In re P.D.L., </em>2004 MT 346, \u00b6 8, 324 Mont. 327, \u00b6 8, 102 P.3d 1225, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s distribution of property in a marriage dissolution case to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous; if the findings are not clearly erroneous, we affirm unless the district court abused its discretion. <em>See In re Marriage of Grende, </em>2004 MT 36, \u00b6 18, 320 Mont. 38, \u00b6 18, 85 P.3d 788, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Jane\u2019s second post-trial motion, in which Jane first requested recusal or disqualification of the presiding judge due to Jane\u2019s pre-petition meeting with the judge in her prior capacity as an attorney ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b613 On appeal, Jane barely acknowledges that the procedural posture of this appeal involves her challenge to the District Court\u2019s denial of her Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion for relief from judgment. Jane\u2019s argument is that Judge Gustafson was disqualified under</p>\n<p id=\"A_p\">\u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, or was required to recuse herself after judgment to avoid \u201cthe appearance of impropriety.\u201d In this regard, Jane mistakenly sets forth the \u201ccorrectness\u201d standard of review-generally applicable to conclusions of law-rather than the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard applicable to the denial of her motion for relief from judgment. We begin with Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., because Jane submitted her post-judgment motion-and the District Court decided it-under that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"ASN\">\u00b614  Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);... or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The only possible reference in Jane\u2019s appellate briefs to the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d requirement of Rule 60(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., is the statement that her motion \u201cwas based upon the discovery that the trial Court had represented [Jane] prior to taking the bench.\u201d She does not argue that the pre-petition consultation was \u201cevidence,\u201d nor does she assert-in light of her affidavit stating she was aware of the consultation at the time of trial-the consultation was \u201cnewly discovered\u201d or could not have been discovered by her \u201cdue diligence.\u201d Therefore, we conclude Jane has not established the basis for relief from judgment set forth in Rule 60(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b615 With respect to the Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., \u201cany other reason justifying relief\u2019 basis, Jane first advances \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, which provides, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">[a]ny justice, judge, justice of the peace, municipal court judge or city court judge must not sit or act in any action or proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">3. When he has been attorney or counsel in the action or proceeding for any party[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Section 3-1-803(3), MCA, is a Supreme Court Rule codified in the Montana Code Annotated for the benefit of code users. Sec. 2, Ch. 1, L. 1979. In a section of her District Court brief entitled \u201claw,\u201d Jane quoted \u00a7 3-1-803, MCA, in its entirety but provided no analysis, authorities, or application relating to any subsection of the rule. The District Court did not address \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, in its order. Moreover, although the District Court did not expressly refer to the \u201cupon such terms as are just\u201d portion of Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., its order-including the statements set forth above-clearly indicates the court did not believe it would be just to grant Jane relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b616  A Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., motion requires a showing that \u201c \u2018something prevented a full presentation of the cause or an accurate determination on the merits and that for reasons <em>offairness and equity </em>redress is justified.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Marriage of Schoenthal, </em>2005 MT 24, \u00b6 35, 326 Mont. 15, \u00b6 35, 106 P.3d 1162, \u00b6 35 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The record before us is clear that, at the time of the November 10, 2004 hearing, Jane was aware of having consulted with attorney Gustafson and Judge Gustafson was not. Moreover, Jane does not challenge the District Court\u2019s statement that Jane knew of the prepetition consultation and did not advise her counsel or the court for the entire year of 2004. Jane could have requested recusal pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, at any time after she became aware that she had consulted with the presiding judge, but waited until her second post-trial motion to do so. We conclude the District Court properly considered the fairness and equity factors of the case and did not abuse its discretion in denying Jane\u2019s Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b617 We turn next to Jane\u2019s arguments on appeal regarding \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA. She contends that \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, is mandatory, clear, and concise, and \u201cthe clear facts are that Judge Gustafson represented Jane Markegard in divorce matters. The Judiciary has a much higher duty to disqualify itself to comply with statutory and case law then [sic] the lay public.\u201d She asserts \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, does not contain a time limit, an exception for a judge\u2019s failure to recall counseling a party or prospective litigant, or a provision for considering whether a party is seeking another bite at the apple.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b618 Section 3-1-803(3), MCA, prohibits a judge from presiding in an action or proceeding \u201c[w]hen he has been attorney or counsel in the action or proceeding for any party[.]\u201d Although \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, is a codified Court rule rather than a legislatively-initiated statute, the first step in construing intent is to examine the plain language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>writing and, if the language is clear and unambiguous, we may not proceed to apply any other means of interpretation. <em>See, e.g., In re Lewis, </em>2004 MT 160, \u00b6 15, 322 Mont. 13, \u00b6 15, 92 P.3d 1218, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b619 It is undisputed that Judge Gustafson did not act as \u201cattorney or counsel <em>in the action or proceeding\u201d </em>at issue here. Jane does not challenge Judge Gustafson\u2019s statement that the consultation occurred in July of 2003, before Rod filed his dissolution petition in August of 2003. Judges routinely-and properly-recuse themselves <em>sua sponte </em>from cases involving parties or persons they recall having represented at some previous time; the record in the present case reflects that Judge Gustafson follows this practice. We conclude, however, that the plain language of \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, does not prohibit a judge from presiding in an action or proceeding unless the representation occurred in the action or proceeding. Of course, we may amend \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, at any time, as we recently amended \u00a7 3-1-803(2), MCA, with respect to the disqualification of judges based on relationships by consanguinity or affinity. <em>See </em>Montana Supreme Court Order dated Dec. 5, 2000, entitled \u201cIn re Modification of the Rule on Disqualification of Judges.\u201d Currently, however, we are bound by the language we have chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b620 Our jurisprudence on judicial disqualification, under current rules or their predecessors, is not extensive. We have decided a number of cases involving \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, and its predecessors, which relate to a party\u2019s motion to disqualify a judge based on an allegation of personal bias or prejudice. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Dambrowski v. Champion Intl. Corp., </em>2000 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51, 300 Mont. 76, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51, 3 P.3d 617, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51; <em>State v. Duncan </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 253, 255, 623 P.2d 953, 954. Jane does not rely on \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, which requires the filing of an affidavit alleging judicial bias more than 30 days before the date set for hearing or trial. Jane did not timely file such an affidavit and, as a result, our decisions addressing \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, and its predecessors are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b621 With the exception of <em>Shultz v. Hooks </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 234, 867 P.2d 1110, our cases addressing \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, and its predecessors are over one hundred years old. It is appropriate to address <em>Shultz </em>here, even though neither party has raised it, because it is our most recent authority on \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA. In <em>Shultz, </em>a district court awarded default judgment against an attorney in a legal malpractice case which centered on the attorney\u2019s representation of a client in an action against the client\u2019s father regarding the father\u2019s guardianship of the client and management of a personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>settlement. The court also awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages, punitive damages and costs. <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 235, 867 P.2d at 1111. After three writs of execution on the default judgment, the attorney moved for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., based on an assertion that the presiding judge had once represented the client. <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 235-36, 867 P.2d at 1111-12. Pursuant to Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P., the motion was deemed denied when the district court did not timely rule on it. <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 235, 867 P.2d at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b622 On appeal, we observed the presiding judge had represented the client approximately fifteen years before the malpractice action commenced and, during that representation, he had attempted to locate information about the father\u2019s guardianship of the client and a related accounting. We also noted the subsequent attorney\u2019s representation of the client in the guardianship matter was \u201cthe substance of the malpractice charges[.]\u201d <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 236, 867 P.2d at 1112. We then recited \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, and concluded the judge was required to disqualify himself, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">[t]he malpractice action here is a direct result of [the attorney\u2019s] representation of [the client] in the action for a guardianship accounting-an action in which [the judge] also represented [the client]. Although we conclude that [the judge] was required by \u00a7 3-1-803, MCA, to disqualify himself from presiding over the subsequent malpractice action against [the attorney], we emphasize that there is absolutely nothing in the record to indicate any wrongdoing or unethical conduct on the part of [the judge]. [The judge] represented [the client] for a short period of time beginning nearly eighteen years ago and his representation did not progress to the point of filing an action against [the client\u2019s] guardian, but rather, merely involved preliminary investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">A judge is not prevented from presiding over matters which involve his or her prior clients if the action involves another matter. Although this malpractice action is technically a separate action from the underlying suit against [the client\u2019s] father relating to the guardianship, it arises from the legal representation in that lawsuit, albeit the representation by [the attorney] and not that of [the judge].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">We reversed and remanded. <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 237, 867 P.2d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\u00b623 As is often true with precedent, <em>Shultz </em>could be distinguished from the present case. Unlike the attorney\u2019s assertion in <em>Shultz </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>regarding the judge\u2019s prior representation of an <em>opposing </em>party, Jane has raised <em>her own </em>interaction with Judge Gustafson. Moreover, we did not address in <em>Shultz </em>whether the defendant attorney or the presiding judge knew of the prior representation before or immediately after the default judgment, while the record here is clear and undisputed that Jane knew-and Judge Gustafson did not know-about their pre-petition consultation. In addition, we note our remand in <em>Shultz </em>for substitution of another judge to rule on the merits of the attorney\u2019s motion for relief from judgment-the very issue we had already decided in the attorney\u2019s favor-was inappropriate. <em>See Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 237, 867 P.2d at 1112. Instead, having concluded the attorney\u2019s motion was improperly deemed denied, we should have ordered substitution of another judge to preside over the underlying malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b624  Most importantly, however, our interpretation of \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, in <em>Shultz </em>went beyond the plain language of the rule. Section 3-1-803(3), MCA, states a judge is disqualified when he or she \u201chas been attorney or counsel <em>in the action or proceeding </em>for any party.\u201d Having recognized in <em>Shultz </em>that the malpractice suit was a separate action from the guardianship-related matter and the judge had not acted as attorney or counsel in any action or proceeding, we were obligated to conclude that \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, did not require disqualification. We did not do so. To the extent <em>Shultz </em>states \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, precludes a judge from sitting on a case in which he or she has rendered services for a person before an action is filed or has acted as a party\u2019s attorney in a separate related case, we overrule it. We conclude \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, does not require disqualification of Judge Gustafson due to the pre-petition consultation with Jane.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b625 Next, relying on <em>Washington v. Montana Min. Properties </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 509, 795 P.2d 460, and In. <em>re Marriage of Miller </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 12, 778 P.2d 888, Jane contends Judge Gustafson should have recused herself to avoid the appearance of impropriety. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"A9T\">\u00b626 In <em>Washington, </em>this Court issued a writ of supervisory control to remove a judge from a case. There, the judge\u2019s social interaction at a football game with attorneys from a party\u2019s law firm during the opposing party\u2019s pending disqualification motion and his son\u2019s internship at the law firm did not, by themselves, require disqualification. However, those facts-combined with the judge\u2019s admission of testimony from one of the law firm\u2019s attorneys at an injunction hearing, in violation of Rule 3.7(a) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, and a newspaper article about the case and the football game interaction-had \u201csnowballed to create an appearance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>impropriety.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>243 Mont. at 515-16, 795 P.2d at 464. Thus, <em>Washington </em>concerned a party\u2019s contentions about a judge\u2019s multiple interactions with the <em>opposing </em>party-of which the judge was almost certainly aware-which \u201csnowballed\u201d to create an appearance of impropriety leading to the issuance of a writ of supervisory control. Jane\u2019s Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion regarding <em>her own </em>single prepetition consultation with attorney Gustafson-which Judge Gustafson did not remember-bears no resemblance to the facts in <em>Washington. </em>Therefore, <em>Washington </em>does not support Jane\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b627 In <em>Miller, </em>we first concluded a district court\u2019s findings and conclusions in a dissolution proceeding contained sufficient errors to warrant reversal. <em>Miller, </em>239 Mont. at 15-17, 778 P.2d at 890-91. We then determined it was not necessary to rule on the \"wife\u2019s contention, as argued in her post-trial motion, that the presiding judge should have disqualified himself due to certain writings published in a local newspaper, including the judge\u2019s letter to the editor. However, we directed that, to eliminate any question of impropriety or impartiality on remand, the proceeding would be assigned to a different district judge. <em>Miller, </em>239 Mont. at 17-19, 778 P.2d at 891-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b628 Having expressly declined to rule on the disqualification issue in <em>Miller, </em>that case has no bearing on Jane\u2019s argument that she is entitled to post-judgment disqualification here. Further, unlike <em>Miller, </em>we need not determine here whether assignment of a different judge for future proceedings is appropriate pursuant to the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard because, as discussed below, we are not reversing and remanding this case for any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b629 <em>Washington </em>and <em>Miller </em>are the only authorities Jane advances for her position that she is entitled to relief from judgment based on an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d In addition to not supporting Jane\u2019s position with respect to establishing an \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d those cases do not address the additional inquiry required in the present case by Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., as to the fairness, equity or \u201cjust\u201d considerations involved in deciding a motion for relief from judgment, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b630 The appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>McDermott v.

Jane has not established an appearance of impropriety or entitlement to relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u00b631  We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jane\u2019s second post-trial motion, in which she first requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>recusal or disqualification of the judge due to the pre-petition consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b632 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in distributing the marital </em>estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b633 The District Court found, among other things, that (1) except for $23,179, the home sale proceeds were traceable to Rod\u2019s premarital assets and inherited funds; (2) a business was Rod\u2019s premarital asset; and (3) the real property where the business was located, which the court valued at $125,000, was a marital asset and certain debts on the real property were marital debts. In distributing the marital assets and debts, the court awarded the real property, as well as certain related marital debts, to Rod. After tallying the assets and debts allocated to each party, the court required Rod to make an \u201cEqualization Payment\u201d of $36,583 to Jane from an account containing proceeds from the sale of the home where Jane and Rod had lived. The total value awarded to each party was $42,583.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b634 Jane asserts that, in distributing the marital estate, the District Court failed to consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA. She makes no argument, however, regarding which factors the court allegedly failed to consider or the impact of those alleged failures. The appellant bears the burden of establishing error, and Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires an appellant to support arguments with citations to relevant authorities. <em>Rolison v. Deaconess, </em>2005 MT 95, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 491, \u00b6 20, 111 P.3d 202, \u00b6 20 (citation omitted). This Court has no obligation to formulate arguments on a party\u2019s behalf; thus, we decline to address \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, further. <em>See In re Marriage of Grende, </em>\u00b6 31 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b635 Jane\u2019s primary contention is that the District Court\u2019s division of the martial property was not equitable. She points to testimony that the parties viewed the marriage as \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201ccommingled\u201d their assets. Relying on <em>Zell v. Zell </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 216, 220, 570 P.2d 33, 35, and <em>Biegalke v. Biegalke </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 311, 316, 564 P.2d 987, 990, she argues she is entitled to one-half of the value of the home, business and business real property based on her work for the business and her contributions as a homemaker and, further, she is not required to trace her contributions to the marital estate. In this respect, we note Jane\u2019s observations on appeal that she received a salary for her work at the business and that she testified both she and Rod contributed to the upkeep of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u00b636 <em>Zell </em>and <em>Biegalke </em>involved the distribution of marital assets-that is, assets that were acquired or appreciated in value during the marriage. <em>See Zell, </em>174 Mont. at 217, 570 P.2d at 33; <em>Biegalke, </em>172 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Mont. at 313, 564 P.2d at 988. Here, the District Court made several findings supporting its determinations that the business was Rod\u2019s premarital asset and most of the home sale proceeds were traceable to Rod\u2019s premarital assets and his inheritance. With respect to the business, the court found Rod had operated the business as a sole proprietor from 1991 until the business\u2019 incorporation in 2001, the \u201cincorporation during the marriage does not alter the pre-marital nature of [Rod\u2019s] business,\u201d \u201c[i]n essence, [Rod] is the business,\u201d and \u201c[t]he business entity itself did not appreciate during the marriage.\u201d The District Court also found, among other things regarding the home, that Rod brought the value of his debt-free home into the marriage, both he and Jane contributed to improvements on that home-including $23,179 contributed by Jane and a $32,000 inheritance contributed by Rod-before they sold it, and a subsequently purchased home had not appreciated in value or resulted in a gain in equity through mortgage reduction during the marriage. With one exception, discussed below, Jane does not challenge these findings regarding the <em>premarital </em>nature of the business and most of the home sale proceeds. Thus, her reliance on <em>Zell </em>and Biegalke-which concern <em>marital </em>assets-is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b637 Jane does challenge the District Court\u2019s determination that she contributed $23,179 to the improvements on the home Rod brought into the marriage. She argues Rod \u201cacknowledged that [Jane] contended that she had contributed over $50,000.00 to the family but acknowledged only one payment of $26,000.00.\u201d Rod\u2019s acknowledgment of Jane\u2019s <em>contention </em>is irrelevant. However, the record reflects conflicting testimony from Rod and Jane regarding the amount Jane received for the sale of her premarital home. During cross-examination of Jane, Rod\u2019s counsel entered into evidenee-without objection-a settlement statement for the sale of Jane\u2019s premarital home reflecting a payment of $23,179. Jane insisted she had received a second payment, but admitted she could not provide any documentation to support her testimony or to demonstrate Rod had not been truthful. In this regard, we note Jane does not appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of her first post-trial motion, in which she requested that the court reopen the hearing to receive additional evidence of the alleged second payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b638 A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial credible evidence, the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or, after reviewing the record, this Court is convinced the district court made a mistake. <em>See In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>2005 MT 311, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 479, \u00b6 10, 124 P.3d 1151, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Credibility determinations are within the province of the finder of fact \u2014 here, the District Court. <em>See In re Marriage of Gerhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 94, \u00b6 21, 78 P.3d 1219, \u00b6 21 (citations omitted). We conclude, based on the settlement statement and testimony at trial, that the District Court\u2019s determination that Jane contributed $23,179 to the home was supported by substantial credible evidence and was not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b639  We conclude the District Court did not err in finding the business was Rod\u2019s premarital asset and the net proceeds of the home, except for $23,179, were traceable to Rod\u2019s premarital assets and his inheritance. In addition, we do not discern any abuse of discretion in those regards.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b640 With respect to the real property where the business was located, Jane asserts the District Court should have \u201csubtracted\u201d two debts associated with purchasing the property and then divided the remaining equity equally because all payments made on the real property were made by the parties during the marriage. The District Court found the real property was acquired during the marriage and, therefore, was a marital asset which it valued at $125,000. The court found Rod and Jane purchased the property for $65,000 and debts related to the purchase-$20,000 owed to Rod\u2019s father and $39,314.25 owed to a bank-were marital debts. The court allocated the real property and the specified marital debts to Rod as part of the marital estate and, as mentioned above, ordered Rod to make an \u201cEqualization Payment\u201d of $36,583 to Jane from the account containing the home sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b641  Jane offers no authority, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., for the proposition that a court must equitably divide each marital asset after \u201csubtracting\u201d related marital debts, rather than equitably distributing the entire marital estate. We conclude the District Court did not err in determining the real property where the business was located-and certain related debts-were marital, and did not abuse its discretion in distributing them to Rod as part of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b642  We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in distributing the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b643 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-9\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b223-10\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"Al3\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">\u00b644 I would reverse the denial of Jane\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the judgment, vacate the judgment and remand this matter for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>a new trial before a different judge. I would also order her to pay the costs of this action to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b645 Approximately one month before this divorce action commenced, Judge Gustafson met with Jane. At the time, Judge Gustafson was a practicing attorney. She consulted with Jane regarding her inevitable divorce proceedings. Jane confided in Gustafson confidential facts, pertinent to these divorce proceedings, which undoubtedly fall under the protection of the attorney-client privilege. Further, Judge Gustafson provided Jane with her legal opinion and charged her a fee. Consequently, the Court\u2019s determination that Judge Gustafson never acted as an attorney or counsel in this proceeding is nothing short of astounding. Indeed, the Court must go as far as overruling the longstanding precedent of <em>Shultz v. Hooks </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 234, 867 P.2d 1110, to arrive at its erroneous conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b646 In <em>Shultz, </em>this Court clearly held that \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, disqualifies a judge from presiding over a matter in which she represented one of the litigants at some time in that matter. <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 237, 867 P.2d at 1112. Under <em>Shultz, </em>the prior representation need \u201cnot progress to the point of filing an action[.]\u201d <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 237, 867 P.2d at 1112. In my view there is no justification for ruling to the contrary on this day. The Court claims that <em>Shultz </em>could be distinguished because there was prior representation of an opposing party in that case. However, \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, disqualifies the judge when she \u201chas been attorney or counsel... for <em>any </em>party.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b647 Judge Gustafson acted as Jane\u2019s attorney and was thus disqualified from taking any action in this case under the plain language of \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA. She therefore had no discretion to abuse. The Court\u2019s application of the abuse of discretion standard is thus irrelevant, as well as its discussion of a \u201cfairness and equity\u201d requirement under Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. The standard provided by \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, is an objective one and Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., is the procedural mechanism for relief from the operation of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b648 In addition to misconstruing the plain language of \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, and overruling longstanding Montana precedent correctly interpreting such, the Court disregards the precedent of sister states that have correctly applied similar provisions. <em>See e.g., Estate of Risovi </em>(1988), 429 N.W.2d 404; <em>Slaven v. Wheeler </em>(Tex. 1882), 58 Tex. 23, *3 (the prior relationship required to disqualify the judge \u201cmay exist with respect to a matter not in suit, and even though no fee was paid or charged for the advice.\u201d), <em>followed by Williams v. Kirven </em>(Tex. Ct. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>1976), 532 S.W.2d 159.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In Risovi, </em>the Supreme Court of North Dakota considered the effect of a judge\u2019s involvement in an action where he had given advice about that case to one of the parties, before becoming a judge. <em>Risovi, </em>429 N.W.2d at 405-406. The Court reversed and remanded for new proceedings as it concluded the judge was disqualified for prior representation of a litigant. <em>Risovi, </em>429 N.W.2d at 408. Like the case at hand, the judge in <em>Risovi </em>had consulted with one of the parties, prior to becoming a judge, advised the party as to matters relevant to the case, and billed him for his services. <em>Risovi, </em>429 N.W.2d at 405. The judge\u2019s representation went no further, and the party was represented by different counsel when the action was filed. <em>Risovi, </em>429 N.W.2d at 405. The <em>Risovi </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">Generally, prior legal advice to a party disqualifies a judge from acting in the same controversy. \u201cIt is sufficient to disqualify a judge that he had given legal advice to a party in connection with the subject matter before litigation began; it is not necessary that he was connected with the particular matter as a pending suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afv\"><em>Risovi, </em>429 N.W.2d at 406 (quoting 46 Am.Jur.2d <em>Judges </em>\u00a7 185).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b649 As this Court notes in its Opinion, a judge is disqualified from sitting or acting if \u201che has been attorney or counsel in the action or proceeding for any party.\u201d Section 3-1-803(3), MCA. To distinguish \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, as the Court impliedly has, from the analogous rales of other jurisdictions, simply because \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, uses the terms \u201caction or proceeding\u201d as opposed to \u201cmatter\u201d is illogical. In doing so, the Court, perhaps unintentionally, sets a precedent that an attorney may represent someone, yet will not later be disqualified as a judge in that matter, as long as she was not counsel of record when the \u201caction\u201d was brought. This is imprudent.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b650 Further, the language of the statute does not change the policy behind it. The rationale for the disqualification of a judge under these circumstances lies in the consequence of any former attorney-client relationship: that the former attorney-turned-judge was in a position to obtain prior knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts. Richard E. Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>\u00a7 11.2.2 (1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">In such a situation there is a danger that a judge, in passing judgment, will not rely solely on the facts that have been properly presented by the parties during the course of the action but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>on his own recollection of the facts.... Indeed, when a judge possesses personal knowledge of evidentiary facts, his own recollection is likely to weigh far more heavily than any testimony that may be given in open hearings. As a consequence of his personal knowledge, moreover, the judge even may have expressed an opinion on the very matter in controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Flamm, \u00a7 11.2.2; <em>see also </em>John Leubsdorf, <em>Theories of Judging and Judge Disqualification, </em>62 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 237, 282 n.225 (1987) (sufficient grounds for disqualification may exist because the \u201crepresentation gives the judge an interest in vindicating the positions she formerly advocated [or] an emotional commitment [is] likely to lead her to slant her behavior as a judge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b651 This rationale clearly applies to the facts of this case. Judge Gustafson claims that, at the time of the proceedings, she did not remember having counseled Jane on a prior occasion. However, the subjective awareness of the judge is irrelevant in this analysis. The underlying consideration in any case is the appearance of impartiality. <em>See </em>Leslie W. Abramson, <em>Judicial Disqualification under Cannon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, </em>55 (2d ed. 1992); <em>see also Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp. </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 847, 864, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 2205, 100 L.Ed.2d 855, 875 (\u201cWe must continuously bear in mind that to perform its high function in the best way justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). Thus, regardless of the extent of the judge\u2019s recollection of the prior representation, the fact that the representation took place, and that fact alone, satisfies the requirement for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b652 The Court attempts to justify its decision with the specific facts and \u201cequities\u201d of this case, contending that by granting Jane\u2019s motion for a new trial, she would be permitted to abuse the system or improperly have \u201canother bite at the apple.\u201d As previously stated, such considerations are plainly irrelevant. Section 3-1-803, MCA, is to be strictly construed. <em>See State v. Duncan </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 253, 255, 623 P.2d 953, 954. Therefore, this is not a question of \u201cwho knew what\u201d or \u201cwho remembered who.\u201d As a result of her prior representation, Judge Gustafson was prohibited from sitting or acting in this case. She never had the authority to preside over this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b653 Of course Jane is not blameless here. She did remember that she had previously counseled with Judge Gustafson, and yet she said nothing. She waited until the entire district court process had been completed, and only after a decision was made did she complain. I would conclude that such conduct was unreasonable and vexatious.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u00b654 Jane is thus in direct violation of \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">An attorney or party to any court proceeding who, in the determination of the court, multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorney fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b655 In my view, the law is clear. This Court has no choice but to reverse the order of the District Court denying relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., vacate the judgment, and order that a different judge be assigned the case for further proceedings. Such further proceedings would first include a hearing to set the amount Jane is required to pay for costs, expenses, and attorney fees incurred by Rod, in both the District Court and this Court, up to and including the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b656 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-7\">JUSTICES COTTER and NELSON join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> See also William W. Kilgarlin and Jennifer Bruch, Disqualification and Recusal of Judges, 17 St. Mary\u2019s L.J. 599, 611-612 (1986) (\u201cIf a judge has at anytime been consulted by an given advice to one of the litigants in a particular case as to the matters in the dispute... he is disqualified.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AYj\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"A2G\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b657 I join Justice Warner\u2019s well-reasoned dissenting opinion. In its rush to punish Jane for her conduct (which we all condemn<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), the majority have set an enormously bad precedent-indeed, one which makes a laughingstock of Canon 4 of the Judicial Canons of Ethics. This Canon provides that \u201c[a] judge\u2019s official conduct should be free from ... the appearance of impropriety ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\u00b658 In bald terms, what the majority now permits is this: Attorney Smith, for his usual fee, gives legal advice to XYZ Company about its dispute with ABC, Inc., over the parties\u2019 widget dealership contract. A month later, Smith is appointed (or is elected) judge of the local trial court. Within a few weeks, XYZ Company, represented by new counsel, sues ABC, Inc., for breach of the widget dealership contract. Judge Smith presides over the case and the trial. ABC, Inc., unaware of Judge Smith\u2019s prior relationship with XYZ Company, does not exercise its right to substitute him out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\u00b659 According to the majority, it is perfectly proper for Judge Smith to sit on <em>XYZ Company v. </em>ABC, <em>Inc., </em>and, presumably, render a judgment in favor of his former client, because \u201cthe plain language of \u00a7 3-1-803(3), MCA, does not prohibit a judge from presiding in an action or proceeding unless the representation occurred <em>in the action or proceeding.\u201d See </em>\u00b6 19 herein (emphasis added). Judge Smith is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>within the perceived statutory loophole because he was never counsel of record for XYZ Company in its suit against ABC, Inc. He just gave XYZ Company advice that may well have prompted or facilitated the suit-advice, coincidentally, in which he has a vested interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b660 The majority exalts form over substance. Section 1-3-219, MCA. Section 3-1-803(3), MCA, provides that a judge \u201cmust not sit or act in any action or proceeding ... [w]hen he has been attorney or counsel in the action or proceeding for any party ....\u201d In fixating on a portion of the statutory language, the majority completely discounts the obvious intendment of the statue-that being to preclude judges from sitting on cases in which they have had an attorney-client relationship with one of the parties to a dispute which eventually comes before the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"A9e\">\u00b661 It is a distinction without a difference that Judge Smith can sit on <em>XYZ Company v. ABC, Inc., </em>in the scenario described above (and the one in the case at bar), but he cannot preside if he, as counsel for XYZ Company, had filed the suit against ABC, Inc., four weeks before he was appointed or elected to the bench. The evil addressed by the statute is precisely the same-in either case the judge had an attorney-client relationship with one of the parties to a particular dispute and now will be judging the merits of the same dispute. The point at which the dispute matured into an actual lawsuit is substantively meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b662 Moreover, as Justice Warner states, Judge Gustafson\u2019s subjective awareness of her prior attorney-client relationship with Jane is beside the point. Taking Judge Gustafson at her word that she did not recall her prior attorney-client relationship with Jane (and I do take her at her word), that relationship having been brought to her attention-albeit belatedly and vexatiously-she was required under the statute to disqualify herself and appoint another judge to preside over further proceedings in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b663 Jane should be punished for her conduct. However, in so doing, we should not set a precedent that makes a mockery of the appearance of fairness and propriety \u2014 the foundational supports of an independent judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b664 The bench, bar and public should be shocked by this decision</p>\n<p id=\"Ak1\">\u00b665 I join in dissenting with Justice Warner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-11\"> And which, as Justice Warner points out, can be otherwise punished.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
