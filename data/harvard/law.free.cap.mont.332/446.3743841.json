We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b62 Keeney presents the following issue on appeal: Whether the Department of Justice (Department) could revoke Keeney\u2019s driver\u2019s license despite its failure to provide Keeney with the notice required by the former \u00a7 61-11-204(3), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">\u00b63 Keeney had a need for speed. This need manifested itself in him wracking up 10 speeding tickets within 30 months. The Department mailed to Keeney on July 27, 2004, a \u201cHabitual traffic offender declaration and notice of revocation/appeal rights.\u201d The notice informed Keeney that the Department\u2019s records indicated that he had accumulated 30 or more conviction points related to use or operation of a motor vehicle within a three-year period. The Department informed Keeney that state law required it to declare him a habitual traffic offender and to revoke his driver\u2019s license for a period of three years. The Department attached a certified copy of Keeney\u2019s driving record to the notice. The certified copy of Keeney\u2019s driving record reflected the fact that he had been convicted of 10 three-point speeding violations during the period of October 23, 2001, through April 21, 2004. In fact, Keeney accumulated 18 conviction points between October 23, 2001, and May 2, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\u00b64 Keeney contested the Department\u2019s actions and filed a petition for judicial review asking that the habitual offender designation be revoked and that the Department reinstate his driver\u2019s license. Keeney first argued to the District Court that Montana law, and not Idaho law, should apply to speed limits on Idaho highways. Keeney had received at least one of his speeding tickets while driving in Idaho. The District Court summarily dismissed his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">\u00b65 Keeney also argued to the District Court that Montana law as it existed on May 2,2003, the date on which he racked up his eighteenth conviction point within a two year period, required the Department to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>notify Keeney that he had accumulated 18 points within a two year period. The notice would have informed Keeney that the Department would suspend his license unless he completed a certified driver rehabilitation and improvement course. The District Court also rejected this claim. It noted that the legislature amended \u00a7 61-11-204, MCA, with an effective date of May 5, 2003, to eliminate the notification requirement. Idaho law enforcement stopped Keeney for speeding in April 2003. He forfeited bond on May 2, 2003. The State did not receive notification of Keeney\u2019s May 2, 2003, conviction from Idaho, however, until May 28,2003. By that date, the notice statute no longer was in effect and the District Court concluded that the Department had correctly applied the law as it existed on May 5,2003. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b66 The denial of a petition to reinstate a driver\u2019s license presents mixed questions of fact and law. <em>See Widdicombe v. State ex rel. Lafond, </em>2004 MT 49, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 133, \u00b6 7, 85 P.3d 1271, \u00b6 7. We review a district court's findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re McKenzie, </em>2001 MT 25, \u00b6 5, 304 Mont. 153, \u00b6 5, 19 P.3d 221, \u00b6 5. We conduct plenary review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>City of Billings v. Gonzales, </em>2006 MT 24, \u00b6 6, 331 Mont. 71, \u00b6 6, 128 P.3d 1014, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b67 Section 61-11-203, MCA (2001), defined the term \u201cdriver in need of rehabilitation and improvement\u201d as \u201ca person who within a 2-year period accumulates 18 or more conviction points according to the schedule specified in subsection (3).\u201d Section 61-11-204, MCA (2001), further provided that the Department shall notify such habitual offender \u201cthat -unless the person enrolls in and successfully completes, within 90 days of notification, a certified driver rehabilitation and improvement course\u201d as provided by \u00a7 61-2-302, MCA, \u201cthe person\u2019s driver\u2019s license will be suspended for a period not to exceed six months or until the person has successfully completed the course, whichever occurs first.\u201d The legislature repealed this notice requirement, effective May 5, 2003, pursuant to the enactment of 2003 Mont. Laws, Ch. 556, Sec. 11, 12. <em>See </em>Compilers Comments to \u00a7\u00a7 61-11-203, 204, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u00b68 Keeney argues on appeal that the Department violated his due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>process rights by failing to provide him notice of his status as an habitual offender as former \u00a7 61-11-204(3)(b), MCA (2001), required. He contends that the date of his Idaho conviction on May 2, 2003, before the statutory amendment took effect, controls for purposes of his point accumulation and thereby obligated the Department to provide the requisite notice. He argues that \u201creasonable reliance\u201d and \u201cfair notice\u201d counsel against applying the legislative amendment to his license revocation. He asserts that he and other Montana drivers possessed the statutory assurance that \u201cthey would know if and when they had accumulated enough conviction points to warrant modification of their driving behavior and how the accumulation of 18 conviction points would be evaluated by the department.\u201d The State counters that Keeney couches his argument in terms of due process, but actually challenges what he considers to be the retroactive application of the repealed amendment set forth in 2003 Mont. Laws, Ch. 556. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b69 \u201cNo law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\u201d Section 1-2-109, MCA. For purposes of this provision, \u201cretroactive\u201d means \u201ca statute which takes away or impairs vested rights, acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions already past.\u201d <em>Allen v. Atlantic Richfield </em>Co., 2005 MT 281, \u00b6 16, 329 Mont. 230, \u00b6 16, 124 P.3d 132, \u00b6 16. A retroactive or retrospective law \u201cgives a transaction a different legal effect from that which it had under the law when it occurred.\u201d <em>St. Vincent Hosp. v. Blue Cross </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 56, 60, 862 P.2d 6, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b610 Keeney argues that he possessed a valid Montana driver\u2019s license and once issued, he has an important interest in retaining it. As a result, he contends that his driver\u2019s license cannot be suspended or revoked without the procedural due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Dixon v. Love </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 105, 112, 97 S.Ct. 1723, 1727, 52 L.Ed.2d 172. Keeney\u2019s argument hinges on the assumption that he possessed a substantive right to receive the notice. We decline to recognize such a substantive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b611 In <em>Williams v. Wellman-Power Gas, Inc. </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 387, 390-91, 571 P.2d 90, 92, we concluded that application of an amendment extending the statute of limitations to claims not already barred at the time that the amendment took effect would not constitute retroactive application, because \"[n]o vested rights are taken away or impaired.\" We rejected a property owner\u2019s claim that she had a vested property interest to operate a bar on her property in <em>Germann </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>v. City of Whitefish, </em>2006 MT 130, \u00b6 33, 332 Mont. 303, \u00b6 33, 137 P.3d 545, \u00b6 33. The property owner premised her \u00a7 1983 claims on the fact that the City could not take her right to operate a bar on her property through a local ordinance. We dismissed the claims based on her lack of a substantive right to operate a bar when the Department of Revenue had received, but had not yet approved her application. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 33. We likewise rejected a claim of a protected property interest by a mining company in possession of a State mineral lease in <em>Seven Up Pete Venture v. State, </em>2005 MT 146, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 306, \u00b6 26, 114 P.3d 1009, \u00b6 26. We held that a voter-approved initiative enacted while the permit application was pending did not deprive the mining company of a protected property interest in the yet to be obtained mining permit. <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 33. Keeney possesses no vested or substantive right to have the Department treat him as a \u201cdriver in need of rehabilitation improvement\u201d and to receive procedural notice of his deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b612 We have held that new legislation that affects only procedural matters and does not relate to a parties\u2019 substantive rights falls outside the ambit of \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA. <em>State Compensation Ins. v. Sky Country </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 376, 379, 780 P.2d 1135, 1137. As recognized by the District Court, the 2003 legislative repeal of the notice requirement did not affect Keeney\u2019s substantive rights \u201cany more-so than the change in the law concerning lifetime offenses of driving under the influence of alcohol versus convictions in the last five years.\u201d The legislature amended the laws pertaining to driving while intoxicated in 1995 to create a felony sanction for fourth or subsequent offense DUI. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-714(4), MCA (1995). The amendment making a fourth or subsequent DUI a felony offense became effective on October 1, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b613 We first addressed the legislative changes to the DUI statutes and their potential retroactive application in <em>State v. Brander </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 148, 930 P.2d 31. We held that the application of the 1995 amendments did not constitute a retroactive application of the law to earlier convictions that occurred before the amendments took effect. <em>Brander, </em>280 Mont. at 154-55, 930 P.2d at 35. We reaffirmed that decision in <em>State v. Pratt </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 156, 951 P.2d 37. We noted in <em>Pratt </em>that the legislature enacted the felony DUI statute to punish repetitive behavior more severely rather than to punish defendants for prior convictions. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 170, 951 P.2d at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b614  Similar logic applies here. The Department did not change the method by which it calculated the points for Keeney\u2019s speeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>infractions that occurred before the effect of the legislative amendment. The Department did not punish Keeney for speeding or traffic violations that occurred before the legislative repeal. Instead the Department properly considered these previous violations as points against his driving record when he finally accumulated 30 points for driving offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b615  The Dissent cites no authority for the proposition that Keeney\u2019s possession of a driver\u2019s license amounted to a substantive right to a particular process. As noted by the Court in <em>State ex rel. Majerus v. Carter </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 272, 276, 693 P.2d 501, 504, in a driver\u2019s license revocation proceeding \u201c[t]he question is how much process is due. The answer is not as much as in a criminal case.\u201d It is important to remember that the Department did not revoke Keeney\u2019s license when he wracked up the eighteen points in a two-year period. The Department did not act until Keeney earned four additional speeding tickets in the next year. Once Keeney reached the thirty-point plateau in a three-year period, the Department sent Keeney a notice of revocation. Similar to <em>Carter, </em>the statutory scheme then afforded Keeney judicial review of the Department\u2019s revocation. Procedural due process requires nothing more in this instance as Keeney \u201cneed not be advised of his continuing duty to act as a law-abiding citizen.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>214 Mont. at 279, 693 P.2d at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b451-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b451-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"A4H2\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b617 I dissent. Because the suspension of a driver\u2019s license involves state action that adjudicates important interests of the licensee-including his interest in the pursuit of a livelihood-procedural due process as required by the Fourteenth Amendment must be extended. <em>State ex rel. Majerus v. Carter </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 272, 276, 693 P.2d 501, 503. Procedural due process includes at a minimum the application of the law in effect at the time of the proscribed conduct in question. Here, under the law in effect at the time Keeney accumulated eighteen points, the State was required to give him notice that he was declared a \u201cdriver in need of rehabilitation and improvement,\u201d and that he must either enroll in a rehabilitation and improvement course or face suspension of his driving privileges. The State failed to comply with this law, and as a result, Keeney was later deprived of his license without forewarning or opportunity to cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00b618 The Court errs in its analysis in two respects. First, it is undisputed that Keeney exceeded the eighteen-point threshold on May 2, 2003, that the law then in effect required that notice be given, and that the amendment to the statute removing the notice provisions did not take effect until May 5,2003. The Court however appears to reject Keeney\u2019s argument that he was entitled to rely on the law in effect at the time he accumulated these points, concluding that because the revised law did not affect Keeney\u2019s \u201csubstantive rights,\u201d its application to Keeney is not problematic. The trouble is that the inference does not follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b619 As the Court points out at \u00b6 9, \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, provides that no statute is retroactive unless expressly so declared. Section 61-11-204, MCA, as amended in May 2003, did not expressly so declare; therefore, the statute may not be applied retroactively. But, contrary to the Court\u2019s conclusion at \u00b6 8, retroactive application of the 2003 law is not the issue. The question is whether Keeney should have been able to rely upon the provisions of the law in effect on the date that he accumulated the eighteen points. In an apparent effort to dodge this question, the Court notes that while Keeney\u2019s determinative conviction occurred on May 2, 2003, the State did not receive notice of the conviction until May 28, 2003, after the notice statute had been amended. The date of receipt of notice is, however, immaterial, as the Department\u2019s own witness testified at the judicial review hearing that it is the date of conviction that the Department considers determinative in implementing the statute, and not the date of receipt. \u00b620 This brings me to my second disagreement with the Court\u2019s Opinion. In deciding that Keeney had no right to rely on the law then in effect, the Court attempts to draw a distinction between the right to retain one\u2019s license, a right which the Court seems to concede is substantive, and the right to receive notice that one\u2019s license is in jeopardy, which the Court concludes is not a substantive right. \u00b6 10. However, in each of the three cases cited by the Court in support of this proposition \u2014 Williams <em>v. Wellman-Power Gas, Inc., Germann v. Stephens, </em>and <em>Seven Up Pete Venture v. </em>State-the appellant had no vested interest that would be impaired by virtue of a change in the law. In <em>Williams, </em>a statute of limitations for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim was extended by the legislature, an act of grace which neither impaired vested rights nor imposed new duties or disabilities. <em>Williams, </em>174 Mont. at 391, 571 P.2d at 92-93. In both <em>Germann </em>and <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>the aggrieved party was in the stages of permit or license <em>application </em>when the ordinance and initiative at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>issue, respectively, took effect. Thus, in these cases, procedural due process was not implicated because there were no vested rights in existence (i.e., no license) at the time the new law went into effect. Here, clearly, such is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b621 Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Court at \u00b6 12, the repeal of the notice requirement <em>did </em>affect Keeney\u2019s substantive rights. Until the law was repealed, Keeney had a right to presume the law then in effect with respect to his license would be enforced, and that he would receive notice and an opportunity to protect his license before the State could suspend it. In my judgment, Keeney was denied the due process of the law to which he was entitled when his license was suspended without warning, and without adherence to the law in effect at the time he accumulated the eighteen points. I dissent from our refusal to so conclude.</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-5\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b453-6\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
