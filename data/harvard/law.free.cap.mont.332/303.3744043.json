The City denied Shelley Germann\u2019s (Germann) applications for conditional use permits. Germann appeals from an order of the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County, granting summary judgment in favor of the City, the City Council of Whitefish (Council), and Gary Stephens, Don Nelson, Shirley Jacobson, and Jan Metzmaker (Council Members), in their official and individual capacities as Council Members. Germann further appeals from the District Court\u2019s decision to grant attorney fees to the Council Members under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and its denial of her motion for costs incurred in preparation for a settlement conference. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u00b62 Germann\u2019s appeal presents the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the City on Germann\u2019s state and federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the Council Members on Germann\u2019s state and federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the Council Members under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Germann\u2019s motion for costs incurred in preparation for a mandatory settlement conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">\u00b67 Germann owned the Downtowner Motel located at 224 Spokane Avenue in Whitefish from 1995 until 2002. Local zoning ordinances in effect before June of 1999 designated the Downtowner\u2019s property as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>WB-3. The zoning ordinances allowed for bars and casinos on property zoned WB-3. The Downtowner sits directly across the intersection of Spokane Avenue and Second Street from the Whitefish Central School. The School\u2019s primary entrance sits on Spokane Avenue and lies approximately 420 feet from the entrance to the Downtowner. The School\u2019s mailing address is 600 East Second Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b68 Germann applied with the Department of Revenue (DOR) for approval to transfer an on-premises liquor license for operation at the Downtowner in August of 1998. Germann also applied for a gambling operator\u2019s license in September of 1998. DOR mailed a notice of the proposed liquor license transfer to various City officials, including the City Attorney and Virgil Bench, the City Building Inspector. The notice requested that City officials inform DOR by February 27,1999, whether the application satisfied all of the local laws and ordinances that the respective officials were responsible for regulating. DOR also published two separate notices of Germann\u2019s application in the Whitefish Pilot newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b69 Bench received phone calls from several concerned citizens regarding Germann\u2019s intent to operate a bar and casino at the Downtowner. Bench telephoned DOR in response and notified it that the Downtowner was within 400 feet of Central School and F oursquare Church. Bench also sent two letters to DOR noting that the Downtowner was within 600 feet of a school and a church. Bench expressed his view that the Downtowner\u2019s proximity to the school and the church precluded operation of a bar and casino under State liquor licensing laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b610 Section 16-3-306, MCA, prohibits DOR from granting retail liquor licenses to establishments located \u201cwithin 600 feet of and on the same street as a building used exclusively as a church ... or as a school....\u201d The statute further provides that the distance shall be measured in a straight line from the center of the nearest entrances of each establishment. Section 16-3-306, MCA. DOR\u2019s administrative rules restrict the application of \u00a7 16-3-306, MCA, however, only to those instances in which the business mailing addresses of each establishment are on the same street. Rule 42.12.129(1)(b), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b611 The City issued Germann a building permit in April of 1999 that allowed Germann to change the Downtowner from Group B occupancy to Group A occupancy. Group A occupancy allows for uses such as bars and casinos. The City lacked any authority, however, to permit Germann to open a bar or casino, as the State of Montana exclusively regulates the operation of bars and casinos. See Title 16, Chapter 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Montana Code Annotated (Control of Liquor, Beer, and Wine); Title 23, Chapter 5, Montana Code Annotated (Gambling).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b612 City officials became concerned that DOR\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 16-3-306, MCA, would allow Germann to operate a bar and casino despite its close proximity to the Central School. The City was further concerned that other bars and casinos might be proposed, particularly in light of its inability to control the opening of such establishments. The City thereafter enacted emergency Ordinance 99-8 (Emergency Ordinance) on June 7,1999, as a temporary ordinance that prohibited \u201cany new establishments [from] attempting to sell on-premises alcoholic beverages, beer and/or wine or attempting to permit or operate gambling or gaming\u201d within the City unless such establishments received a conditional use permit from the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"Ald\">\u00b613 DOR had not approved Germann\u2019s application for a liquor license at the time the Emergency Ordinance took effect. Section 23-5-119, MCA, provides that applicants for a gambling license must possess a valid liquor license as a prerequisite to obtaining a gambling license. The Montana Gambling Control Division (MGCD) earlier had filed a disciplinary action against Germann for making false representations on her gambling license application. Germann had yet to resolve this disciplinary action with MGCD at the time the City passed the Emergency Ordinance. In fact, neither DOR nor MGCD had ruled on Germann\u2019s applications by the time that she sold the Downtowner in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b614 Germann applied for a conditional use permit to operate her property as a bar and casino on September 27, 1999. The Flathead Regional Development Office (FRDO) prepared a staff report evaluating Germann\u2019s application. FRDO\u2019s report noted that the Downtowner sat on the edge of a residential neighborhood near the Central School, residences, and a church. The report recommended denial of Germann\u2019s application. FRDO presented the report to the city-county planning board and the board likewise recommended denial. FRDO then presented the report to the Council on December 20, 1999. Members of the public spoke at the Council meeting and voiced their concerns about the Downtowner\u2019s proximity to the church and to the Central School. The Council adopted FRDO\u2019s report as findings of fact and denied Germann\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b615 The Council enacted a permanent zoning ordinance (Ordinance 00-06) on April 3,2000, that precluded casinos on property zoned WB-3, such as the Downtowner. Ordinance 00-06 still allowed bars on WB-3 property if an applicant received a conditional use permit from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Council. Germann applied for a conditional use permit to operate the Downtowner as a bar in April of 2002. Germann still had not received a liquor license from DOR. FRDO reviewed the application and recommended it be denied based on the Downtowner\u2019s proximity to the Central School, churches, and residential neighborhoods. FRDO noted that the Downtowner\u2019s parking lot was a mere 100 feet from the school. The Council considered Germann\u2019s application in June of2002. Several members of the public again voiced their opposition to the establishment of a bar near the Central School. The Council denied Germann\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b616 Germann filed an action against the City, alleging various state and federal claims for damages allegedly suffered as a result of the City\u2019s enactment of the Emergency Ordinance and Ordinance 00-06, and from its denial of her applications for conditional use permits. Count two of Germann\u2019s complaint requested a declaratory judgment that the Emergency Ordinance was void and unenforceable. Germann moved for partial summary judgment on this count. The City filed a cross motion for summary judgment. The District Court granted the City\u2019s motion after determining that the Emergency Ordinance was valid and enforceable. Germann did not appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b617 Germann filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The District Court granted Germann\u2019s motion subject to several conditions. Notably, the District Court refused to allow Germann to repeat allegations that the Emergency Ordinance was void and unenforceable, as it already had disposed of that issue on summary judgment. Germann\u2019s amended complaint still contained allegations that the Emergency Ordinance was void and unenforceable despite the District Court\u2019s admonition. Germann\u2019s second amended complaint also included state and federal claims against the City, Council, and the Council Members in their individual and official capacities, including claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b618 The District Court\u2019s Rule 16 Scheduling Order required a settlement conference between the parties. The City and Germann scheduled a conference for December 7, 2004, in Kalispell. The City requested postponement of the conference by two weeks to secure more settlement authority for its representative. The parties attended the conference on December 21, 2004, but the City declined to make a settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u00b619 The Council Members moved for summary judgment on Germann\u2019s individual and official capacity claims. The District Court granted their motion, reasoning that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, and our decision in <em>Kiely Const. L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836, provided the Council Members with immunity for Germann\u2019s state and federal individual capacity claims. The District Court farther granted summary judgment to the Council Members on Germann\u2019s official capacity claims. The court reasoned that the official capacity claims were redundant of Germann\u2019s claims against the City. The District Court awarded the Council Members attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (\u00a7 1988) after determining that Germann\u2019s claims against the Council Members were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b620 The City also moved for summary judgment on the grounds that its actions did not deprive Germann of the legal use of her property. The City argued that \u00a7 16-3-306, MCA, prohibited DOR from licensing Germann\u2019s property as a bar because of the Downtowner\u2019s proximity to Central School. The City noted that Germann would be unable to obtain a gaming license without first acquiring a liquor license. The District Court agreed and granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that DOR exceeded its statutory authority in its interpretation of \u00a7 16-3-306(1), MCA. The District Court determined that the proper interpretation of \u00a7 16-3-306(1), MCA, did not require establishments to have business mailing addresses on the same street. Because the Downtowner was within 600 feet of a school located on the same street, the District Court held that \u00a7 16-3-306(1), MCA, precluded all claims against the City. The District Court further concluded that Germann was not entitled to settlement costs incurred in preparation for the court mandated settlement conference. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>Hardy v. Vision Service Plan, </em>2005 MT 232, \u00b6 10, 328 Mont. 385, \u00b6 10, 120 P.3d 402, \u00b6 10. We must determine whether the district court applied the law correctly. <em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6 10. If we reach the same conclusion as the district court, but on different grounds, we may nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Liss, </em>2000 MT 380, \u00b6 25, 303 Mont. 519, \u00b6 25, 16 P.3d 399, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b622 We review a district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1988 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ihler v. Chisholm, </em>2000 MT 37, \u00b6 24, 298 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Mont. 254, \u00b6 24, 995 P.2d 439, \u00b6 24. A district court abuses its discretion if it bases its fee award upon an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact. <em>Ihler, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b623 We review a district court\u2019s decision to award or deny sanctions for failure to comply with a Rule 16 Scheduling Order for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Seal v. Woodrows Pharmacy, </em>1999 MT 247, \u00b6 26, 296 Mont. 197, \u00b6 26, 988 P.2d 1230, \u00b6 26. We afford the district court discretion because it sits in the best position to evaluate whether one party has disregarded the rights of the opposing party and what sanctions for such conduct, if any, addresses most appropriately the sanctionable conduct. <em>Seal, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b624 1. <em>Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the City on Germann\u2019s state and federal claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b625 Germann argues that the District Court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the City. She brought state claims and federal \u00a7 1983 claims against the City for its actions in passing the Emergency Ordinance, Ordinance 00-06, and in denying her applications for conditional use permits. Specifically, Germann brought a takings claim under Article II, Section 29, of the Montana Constitution and the 5th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, substantive and procedural due process claims under Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution and the 5th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and an equal protection claim under Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Germann maintains that the court misinterpreted \u00a7 16-3-306(1), MCA, in holding that it precluded all of her claims against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b626  A plaintiff first must establish that it possesses a protected liberty or property interest to establish a viable \u00a7 1983 claim because the guarantees of the 5th and 14th amendments apply only when a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest is at stake. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 23. To have a property interest in a benefit, a plaintiff clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. Rather, it must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. <em>ISC Distributors, Inc. v. Trevor </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 185, 193, 903 P.2d 170, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u00b627 Federal due process and takings claims require a plaintiff first to demonstrate that it possesses a constitutionally protected property interest. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Gammoh v. City of La Habra </em>(9th Cir. 2005), 395 F.3d 1114, 1122. State due process and takings claims likewise require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the plaintiff to first establish that it has a property interest. <em>Montana Media, Inc. v. Flathead County, </em>2003 MT 23, \u00b6 65, 314 Mont. 121, \u00b6 65, 63 P.3d 1129, \u00b6 65 (due process); <em>Seven Up Pete Venture v. State, </em>2005 MT 146, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 306, \u00b6 26, 114 P.3d 1009, \u00b6 26 (takings). Independent sources, such as state law, create property interests. <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b628  When a plaintiff claims a property interest under state law, we determine whether a reasonable expectation of entitlement exists based largely on the language of the statute relied upon and the extent to which the legislature couched the entitlement in mandatory terms. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 27. Any significant discretion conferred upon a local agency defeats a claim of entitlement. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28. Stated another way, a property interest exists only when the legislature has so narrowly circumscribed the issuing agency\u2019s discretion that it virtually assures the interest\u2019s approval. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b629 Section 16-4-401, MCA, outlines the necessary criteria for obtaining a liquor license in Montana. That section states that a \u201clicense under this code is a privilege that the state may grant to an applicant and is not a right to which any applicant is entitled.\u201d Section 16-4-401(1), MCA. The statutory scheme provides broad discretion to DOR to determine whether an applicant qualifies for a liquor license. For example, \u00a7 16-4-405(3)(a), MCA, provides that DOR may not issue a license if it determines that the welfare of the people residing in the vicinity of the premises would be adversely or seriously affected by issuance of the license. An applicant for a gambling license to operate card games, sports pools, or video gaming must possess a valid liquor license to be eligible to offer gaming. Section 23-5-119, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b630 Germann\u2019s state and federal due process and takings claims thus turn on the deprivation of her asserted protected interest to operate a bar and casino at the Downtowner. Germann relies on the zoning ordinances in effect before the enactment of the Emergency Ordinance and Ordinance 00-06 for her assertion that the City\u2019s actions deprived her of her right to operate a bar and casino at the Downtowner. The zoning laws in place before the enactment of the Ordinances allowed for bars and casinos on property zoned WTB-3. The zoning ordinances could not, however, affirmatively authorize her to operate a bar or casino. Only DOR and MGCD possessed the authority to approve Germann\u2019s request to open a bar and casino. See Title 16, Chapter 3, Montana Code Annotated (Control of Liquor, Beer, and Wine); Title 23, Chapter 5, Montana Code Annotated (Gambling).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u00b631  Germann had yet to obtain a liquor license from DOR at the time the City passed the Ordinances and denied her applications for conditional use permits. She therefore did not have a property interest in operating the Downtowner as a bar. Moreover, Germann cannot assert that she ultimately was entitled to a liquor license. The statutory scheme explicitly states that receipt of a liquor license is not a right, but a privilege. Section 16-4-401(1), MCA. The legislature vested DOR with discretion when determining whether an applicant qualifies for a liquor license. Germann accordingly did not enjoy an entitlement to a liquor license. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b632 The mere fact that Germann had applied for a liquor license at the time that the City had enacted the Ordinances did not guarantee she would receive such an entitlement. We rejected a similar claim in <em>Seven Up Pete </em>where a mining company in possession of a State mineral lease argued that its application for a mining permit provided it with a protected property interest. <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 22. We held that a voter-approved initiative enacted while the permit application was pending did not deprive the mining company of a protected property interest in the yet to be obtained mining permit. <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 33. Further, Germann could not receive a gaming license without first obtaining a liquor license. Section 23-5-119, MCA. The City\u2019s actions therefore did not deprive Germann of any vested property right to operate the Downtowner as a bar or as a casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b633  Germann\u2019s inability to establish that she possessed a protected property interest in operating her establishment as a bar or casino precludes her from establishing her \u00a7 1983 due process and takings claims or her corresponding state claims. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Gammoh, </em>395 F.3d at 1122; <em>Montana Media, </em>\u00b6 65; <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 26. The City therefore did not deprive her of a protected property interest, either in enacting the Ordinances or in denying her conditional use permits. Germann did not appeal the District Court\u2019s determination on summary judgment that the Ordinances were valid and enforceable. Our determination that Germann\u2019s lack of a protected property interest in operating the Downtowner as a bar or casino precludes all claims against the City dispenses with the need to evaluate whether the District Court properly interpreted \u00a7 16-3-306, MCA. If we reach the same conclusion as the district court, but on different grounds, we may nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>Safeco Ins., </em>\u00b6 25. We therefore conclude that the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the City on all of Germann\u2019s state and federal claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u00b634 2. <em>Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the Council Members on Germann\u2019s state and federal law claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Axh\">\u00b635  Germann argues that the District Court improperly held that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, immunized the Council Members from Germann\u2019s state and federal law claims. Germann\u2019s claims against the Council Members suffer from the same defect, however, as her claims against the City. Her claims against the Council Members and the City arise from the same conduct, namely the Council\u2019s actions in passing the Ordinances and denying Germann\u2019s applications for conditional use permits. Our determination that Germann lacks a protected property interest in operating the Dowtowner as a bar or casino precludes all claims against the Council Members and dispenses with our need to evaluate whether the Council Members enjoyed immunity from suit. We therefore conclude that the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the Council Members on all of Germann\u2019s state and federal claims. <em>Safeco Ins., </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b636 3. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the Council Members under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b637 Courts may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties in relation to the prosecution of a federal civil rights claim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). Section 1988 entitles prevailing defendants to attorneys\u2019 fees only when a plaintiffs civil rights claim represents a frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless claim, or where the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so. <em>Thomas v. City of Tacoma </em>(9th Cir. 2005), 410 F.3d 644, 647. If a party prevails on a \u00a7 1983 claim, they also are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on pendent state claims where the state and federal causes of action arise from a common nucleus of operative fact. <em>Mateyko v. Felix </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 924 F.2d 824, 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A. Official Capacity Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b638 The District Court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the Council Members for Germann\u2019s official capacity claims on the grounds that longstanding jurisprudence dictates that there is no need for plaintiffs to bring official capacity claims when plaintiffs can sue the municipality directly. The U.S. Supreme Court stated over 20 years ago that plaintiffs no longer need to bring official capacity claims against local government officials. <em>Kentucky v. Graham </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 159, 167, n.14, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3106, n.14, 87 L.Ed.2d 114. The Court reasoned that official capacity claims generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent. <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. at 165, 105 S.Ct. at 3105. Germann\u2019s official capacity claims against the Council Members constitute causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of action that do not provide for personal liability against the Council Members. The City remains ultimately liable for the actions of its employees in official capacity claims. <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. at 169, 105 S.Ct. at 3107. The Ninth Circuit has determined that causes of action that do not provide for liability against the named defendants constitute unreasonable claims, entitling the prevailing defendant to attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Morse v. North Coast Opportunities, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 118 F.3d 1338, 1343. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b639 It appears that reasonable diligence and inquiry by Germann into the law would have revealed that her official capacity claims not only were unnecessary, but inadequate to provide for personal liability against the Council Members. <em>Margolis v. Ryan </em>(9th Cir. 1998), 140 F.3d 850, 854. At the very least, the Council Members demonstrated to Germann that clearly established law dictated that her official capacity claims were duplicative and unnecessary when they filed their brief in support of their motion for summary judgment on July 16, 2003. It was thereafter unreasonable for Germann to persist in her official capacity claims against the Council Members. <em>Thomas, </em>410 F.3d at 647. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the Council Members attorneys\u2019 fees for Germann\u2019s \u00a7 1983 official capacity claims and for Germann\u2019s pendent state law claims. <em>Mateyko, </em>924 F.2d at 828. We reverse and remand, however, for the District Court to limit the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees to the amount that the Council Members incurred in defending against Germann\u2019s official capacity claims and pendent state law claims after July 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">B. Individual Capacity Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b640 The District Court premised its award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Council Members for Germann\u2019s individual capacity claims on the grounds that Germann knew or should have known that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, and our decision in <em>Kiely </em>afforded the Council Members immunity from suit. Germann argues that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, serves as a double recovery statute that applies only when a party has recovered against a governmental entity. She further argues that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, cannot immunize the Council Members because state law cannot immunize federal claims under \u00a7 1983. The Council Members counter that our decision in <em>Kenyon v. Stillwater County </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 142, 835 P.2d 742, and the plain language of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, dictate that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, serves as more than just a double recovery statute. The Council Members further contend that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, does not provide government employees with absolute immunity from \u00a7 1983 claims and therefore does not deprive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>plaintiffs of a remedy for constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">i. <em>State Claims Against the Council Members in their Individual Capacities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b641 Section 2-9-305(5), MCA, titled \u201cImmunization, defense, and indemnification of employees,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that recovery against a governmental entity means that \u201cthe employee whose conduct gave rise to the suit is immune from liability\u201d for the same conduct if the claim arises out of the course and scope of the employee\u2019s employment. The explicit grant of immunity in the second sentence of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, belies Germann\u2019s contention that the statute serves merely as an anti-double recovery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b642 We applied this statute to a similar situation in <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. 142, 835 P.2d 742. Former county employee Roberta Kenyon (Kenyon) filed an age discrimination suit against Stillwater County (County) and the County Attorney, C. Ed Laws (Laws). <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 145, 835 P.2d at 744. Kenyon based her claim on Laws\u2019s decision to discharge her and replace her with a younger woman. <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 145, 835 P.2d at 744. She named both the County and Laws as defendants. <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 145, 835 P.2d at 744. The district court granted summary judgment to Laws individually on the grounds that Laws was an agent of the County acting within the scope of his authority. <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 146, 835 P.2d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b643 We upheld the grant of summary judgment, but on different grounds. <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 146-47, 835 P.2d at 745. We noted that state law subjects governmental entities to liability for their wrongful conduct and that of their employees acting within the scope of their employment. <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 146, 835 P.2d at 745 (citing \u00a7 2-9-102, MCA (1987)). We cited \u00a7 2-9-305, MCA (1987), in reasoning that where a litigant brings an action against a county based on actionable conduct by a county employee, the employee enjoys immunity from individual liability for the conduct where the county acknowledges that the conduct arose out of the course and scope of the employee\u2019s official duties. <em>Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 146, 835 P.2d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u00b644 Here the City acknowledged that Germann based her claims upon the conduct of the Council Members taken in the scope and course of their employment. Germann named the City as a defendant based upon the actions of the Council Members in enacting the Emergency Ordinance and Ordinance 00-06, and subsequently denying her applications for conditional use permits. The plain language of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, and our decision <em>inKenyon </em>demonstrate that the Council Members clearly enjoyed immunity from Germann\u2019s state law claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>We therefore agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 1988 entitled the Council Members to attorneys\u2019 fees for Germann\u2019s state law claims against them in their individual capacities. <em>Franceschi v. Schwartz </em>(9th Cir. 1995), 57 F.3d 828, 832. We must still evaluate, however, whether the District Court properly determined that Germann should have known that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, afforded immunity to the Council Members from Germann\u2019s federal claims against them in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">ii. <em>Federal Claims Against the Council Members in their Individual Capacities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b645 Germann relies on <em>Martinez v. California </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 277, 100 S.Ct. 553, 62 L.Ed.2d 481, to support her position that state law cannot immunize federal claims. <em>Martinez </em>involved a California statute that purported to provide absolute immunity to government entities and employees from liability for injuries resulting from parole release determinations. <em>Martinez, </em>444 U.S. at 280, 100 S.Ct. at 556. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that Martinez failed to establish a violation of \u00a7 1983, but noted that state law cannot immunize conduct by persons acting under color of state law that violates \u00a7 1983. <em>Martinez, </em>444 U.S. at 284, n.8, 100 S.Ct. at 558, n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b646 Germann further relies on our decision in <em>Miller v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2003 MT 44, 314 Mont. 278, 65 P.3d 562. The plaintiff in <em>Miller </em>sued the City of Red Lodge, but did not bring an action against individual government employees. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 27. We held that the doctrines of judicial and quasi-judicial immunity do not afford local government entities immunity from \u00a7 1983 actions, overruling our previous decision in <em>Reisdorff v. County of Yellowstone, </em>1999 MT 280, 296 Mont. 525, 989 P.2d 850. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 26. We reiterated our statement from <em>Reisdorff </em>that state immunity laws \u201cdo not shield the State or its officials from liability based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Reisdorff, </em>\u00b6 32).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b647 We distinguish these cases from Germann\u2019s claims. In <em>Martinez, </em>the statute at issue purported to grant absolute immunity to both the governmental entity and its employees, thereby entirely depriving plaintiffs of a remedy. <em>Martinez, </em>444 U.S. at 280, 100 S.Ct. at 556. Conversely, granting immunity to the Council Members under \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, would not deprive Germann of a remedy. She still could pursue an action against the City for the conduct of the Council Members.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b648 Although we cited to <em>Reisdorff </em>in <em>Miller </em>for the proposition that state immunity laws do not shield the State or its officials from \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>liability, our recitation of that proposition in both cases paints too broadly. In <em>Miller, </em>the plaintiff brought an action against only the governmental entity. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 27. We did not squarely address the issue Germann presents-whether state immunity laws afford immunity to government employees for violations of \u00a7 1983 where the government entity remains a viable defendant. <em>Reisdorff, </em>in turn, relied on <em>Morrison v. Jones </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 607 F.2d 1269, 1273, in stating that \u201cstate immunity laws ... do not shield the State or its officials from liability based on ... \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Reisdorff, </em>\u00b6 32. <em>Morrison </em>addressed a state statute that purported to grant absolute immunity to a governmental employee, without mention of the governmental entity\u2019s liability. <em>See Morrison, </em>607 F.2d at 1273. The actual language employed by <em>Morrison </em>recognized that \u201cstate law immunities... <em>cannot override a section 1983 cause of action.\u201d Morrison, </em>607 F.2d at 1273 (emphasis added). Again, application of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, would not override Germann\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action because the City remains liable for the actions of its Council Members.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b649 The U.S. Supreme Court provided further instruction in <em>Felder v. Casey </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 131, 108 S.Ct. 2302, 101 L.Ed.2d 123. <em>Felder </em>addressed the application of a Wisconsin notice-of-claim statute to plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 134, 108 S.Ct. at 2304-05. The Court noted that where state courts entertain a federally created cause of action, \u201cthe federal right cannot be defeated by the forms of local practice.\u201d <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 138, 108 S.Ct. at 2306. The Court recognized the preemption question at issue, namely whether \u201cthe application of the State\u2019s notice-of-claim provision to \u00a71983 actions brought in state courts [is] consistent with the goals of the federal civil rights laws, or [whether] the enforcement of such a requirement instead stand[s] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of Congress[.]\u201d <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 138, 108 S.Ct. at 2306-07, (internal quotations omitted). The Court further noted that the main objective of the civil rights statutes serves to ensure that individuals whose federal constitutional or statutory rights are abridged may recover damages or secure injunctive relief. <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 139, 108 S.Ct. at 2307.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b650 The Court accordingly reasoned that any assessment of the applicability of a state law to federal civil rights litigation must be made in light of the purpose and nature of the federal right. <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 139, 108 S.Ct. at 2307. To illustrate, the Court observed that \u201cwe have held that a state law that immunizes government conduct otherwise subject to suit under \u00a71983 is preempted, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>where the federal civil rights litigation takes place in state court, because the application of the state immunity law would thwart the congressional remedy.\u201d <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 139, 108 S.Ct. at 2307. The Court went on to hold that the burdensome requirements of Wisconsin\u2019s notice-of-claim statute conflicted with the remedial objectives of the civil rights laws and federal law thus preempted the state statute. <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 153, 108 S.Ct. at 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b651 Our recent decision in <em>Kiely </em>further illuminates the issue. Kiely Construction (Kiely) brought state and federal claims, including a \u00a7 1983 action, against the City of Red Lodge (City) and against individually named City Council members based on the City Council\u2019s denial of Kiely\u2019s subdivision plat application. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 12. The District <em>Court </em>granted summary judgment to the individually named City council members, concluding that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, provided immunity from suit. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b652 We determined that Kiely failed to demonstrate a \u00a7 1983 claim on appeal. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 47. We then addressed whether the District Court properly dismissed the individual defendants before trial based on \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 78-90. All ofKiely\u2019s alleged complaints turned on actions performed by the individually named defendants while serving as members of the city council. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 88. As a result, we determined that the district court properly dismissed the individual defendants in light of the fact that allowing Kiely to collect damages from both the City and the council members would violate the first sentence of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b653 Although we did not address the application of the second sentence of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, we upheld the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the individual defendants before trial and thus before any determination of liability under \u00a7 1983 and before any recovery from the City. <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 88. Our holding therefore suggests that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, affords immunity to government employees under \u00a7 1983 where the government entity remains a viable defendant for the same course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b654 We turn to the application of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, to Germann\u2019s federal law claims and whether the District Court properly concluded that \u00a7 1988 entitled the Council Members to attorneys\u2019 fees because Germann knew or should have known that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, shielded the Council Members from suit. The main objective of \u00a7 1983 serves to ensure that individuals who have suffered a deprivation of their constitutional or statutory rights are afforded relief through damages or injunctive relief. <em>Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 139, 108 S.Ct. at 2307. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>analysis of the applicability of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, to Germann\u2019s federal claims must be taken in light of this objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b655 The District Court\u2019s determination to afford immunity to the Council Members for Germann\u2019s federal claims against them in their individual capacities under \u00a7 1983 does not immunize fully the governmental conduct of which Germann complains. The City has acknowledged that the Council Members acted within the scope and nature of their employment when they undertook the actions giving rise to Germann\u2019s complaint. Granting immunity to the Council Members would not deprive Germann of a remedy against the City for these same actions. <em>See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035-36, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (holding that \u00a7 1983 subjects municipalities and other local government units to liability). Indeed, to succeed on her claims against the City would require Germann to prove the same set of alleged facts as her claim against the Council Members. Affording immunity from Germann\u2019s federal claims to the Council Member\u2019s under \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, would not thwart the objectives of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b656 We disagree, however, with the District Court\u2019s determination that Germann should have known that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, affords the Council Members immunity from Germann\u2019s federal claims. The District Court relied upon \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, and <em>Kiely </em>in determining that Germann should have known that the Council Members were immune from federal claims. <em>Kiely </em>indicates that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, affords immunity to government employees under \u00a7 1983 where the government entity remains a viable defendant for the same course of conduct. It does not, however, explicitly hold so. We based our decision in <em>Kiely </em>on the first sentence of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, but it is the statute\u2019s second sentence that grants immunity to government employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b657  Given the ambiguity of <em>Kiely\u2019s </em>holding and the prolixity of analysis necessary to conclude that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, affords immunity to government employees for federal claims where the governmental entity remains a viable defendant, we cannot conclude that Germann should have known that \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, shielded the Council Members from her federal law claims. Accordingly, we cannot deem unreasonable her federal claims against the Council Members in their individual capacities. Section 1988 therefore does not entitle the Council Members to attorneys\u2019 fees for their defense of Germann\u2019s federal claims against them in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u00b658 4. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Germann\u2019s motion for costs incurred in preparation for a mandatory settlement conference.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b659 The Scheduling Order required the parties to hold a settlement conference before January 21,2005. It further provided that failure of counsel to adhere to this Scheduling Order could result in sanctions. Germann argues that the City failed to participate in the settlement conference in good faith by sending a representative with no settlement authority and by failing to notify her that the settlement conference would be futile. The City counters that it had no duty to make a settlement offer and that it participated in the settlement conference as required by the Court\u2019s Rule 16 Scheduling Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b660 Rule 16(a), M.R.Civ.P., allows courts to create scheduling orders, wherein a court can require parties to attend settlement conferences to facilitate the settlement of a case. Rule 16(f) authorizes courts to impose sanctions against a party who fails to comply with a scheduling order or fails to participate in good faith, including the expenses incurred as a result of noncompliance. <em>Vermeer of Washington, Inc. v. Jones, </em>2004 MT 77, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 435, \u00b6 12, 87 P.3d 516, \u00b6 12; Rule 16(f), M.R.Civ.P. The City revealed to Germann before the settlement conference that its representative \u201chas extremely limited settlement authority.\u201d The City suggested pushing back the settlement conference by two weeks to allow the City\u2019s representative to \u201cpotentially [gain] some greater authority.\u201d The City noted, however, that it did not believe that there was much settlement value to the case. The record does not disclose the actual settlement authority vested in the City\u2019s representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b661 The City concedes that its representative\u2019s authority may have been \u201cextremely limited.\u201d Courts have recognized, however, that sending representatives with very little authority does not necessarily constitute grounds for sanctions. <em>E.g., Halaby, McCrea &amp; Cross v. Hoffman </em>(Colo. 1992), 831 P.2d 902, 908. The Rule 16 Scheduling Order here merely required the parties to attend a settlement conference. The City attended the conference as required by the court. The City declined to offer Germann a settlement, but failure to settle a case, without more, does not constitute grounds for sanctions. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emp., Inc. v. Nat. Feder. of Fed. Emp. </em>(5th Cir. 1988), 844 F.2d 216, 223. The City candidly informed Germann before the settlement conference that its representative had limited authority to settle and that it did not believe there was much potential for settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u00b662  The District Court determined that Germann was not entitled to sanctions for the City\u2019s conduct. The district court sits in the best position to evaluate whether litigants have abused the rights of other parties during the course of litigation. <em>Seal, </em>\u00b6 26. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Germann\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b663 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to the City on Germann\u2019s state and \u00a7 1983 claims based on Germann\u2019s lack of a protected property interest. We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Germann\u2019s claims against the Council Members for the same reason. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Council Members for all of Germann\u2019s state law claims against the Council Members. We affirm in part the District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Council Members for Germann\u2019s federal official capacity claims, but we reverse the award of fees incurred before the Council Members filed their brief in support of their motion for summary judgment on July 16, 2003. We reverse the District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees for Germann\u2019s federal claims against the Council Members in their individual capacities. We remand to the District Court for the limited purpose of recalculating attorneys\u2019 fees in light of this ruling. Finally, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of costs to Germann based on her claim of bad faith by the City with respect to the settlement conference.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, NELSON , LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
