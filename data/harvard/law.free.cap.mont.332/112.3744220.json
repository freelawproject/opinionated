(Coleman), appeals from the judgment of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, awarding the successful Defendant, Beverly F. Kudrna, her attorney fees under \u00a7 70-24-442(1), MCA, a part of the Montana Residential Landlord and Tenant Act of 1997 (MRLTA).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u00b62 This case arose from a February 11, 2002, fire that started in Kudrna\u2019s mobile home and spread to destroy Coleman\u2019s nearby trailer. Kudrna had leased her mobile home to an unrelated third-party, and she had rented the space adjacent to the mobile home to Coleman where its trailer was parked. Coleman used its trailer as a field office and as lodging for several employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u00b63 Coleman sued Kudrna alleging that she was negligent in inspecting and maintaining the chimney and the coal-fire heater in her mobile home, and that her negligence caused the fire that destroyed Coleman\u2019s trailer and its contents. Coleman also claimed at trial that Kudrna violated her duties of inspection and maintenance under the MRLTA and sought to recover its attorney fees under \u00a7 70-24-442(1), MCA. Coleman claimed damages of approximately $85,000. Kudrna offered to settle for $27,500, but Coleman declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">\u00b64 The case went to trial and the jury found in favor of Kudrna. Kudrna moved the District Court to award her attorney fees and costs under the reciprocal provisions of \u00a7 70-24-442(1), MCA. The District Court awarded Kudrna attorney fees of $22,866.50 plus costs. Kudrna\u2019s insurance company, which was not a party to the suit, paid for her defense. Coleman appeals the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\u00b65 Coleman does not contest that Kudrna was the prevailing party or the amount of the fees, but challenges Kudrna\u2019s right to collect them as an insured landlord under the MRLTA. Thus, the issue on appeal is whether an insured defendant may recover attorney fees, under \u00a7 70-24-442, MCA, incurred in a successful defense of an action by a tenant. We review a trial court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it was correct. <em>Paulson v. Flathead Conservation Dist., </em>2004 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>MT 136, \u00b6 17, 321 Mont. 364, \u00b6 17, 91 P.3d 569, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b66 Section 70-24-442, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">(1) In an action on a rental agreement or arising under this chapter, reasonable attorney fees, together with costs and necessary disbursements, may be awarded to the prevailing party notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">(2) As used in this section, \u201cprevailing party\u201d means the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b67 Under the plain meaning of the statute, the district court may award attorney fees to the prevailing party. Section 70-24-442, MCA; <em>Whalen v. Taylor </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 293, 304, 925 P.2d 462, 468. The statute makes no distinction between insured and uninsured parties. The role of the Court is to interpret the meaning of the terms included in a statute, not to insert what has been omitted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>City of Billings v. Gonzales, </em>2006 MT 24, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 71, \u00b6 13, 128 P.3d 1014, \u00b6 13. We decline to add a provision to the statute here that only uninsured landlords may recover attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b68 Coleman argues that if insured landlords are permitted to recover under \u00a7 70-24-442, MCA, the Court should extend <em>Tripp v. Jeld-Wen, Inc., </em>2005 MT 121, 327 Mont. 146, 112 P.3d 1018, and require that a successful defendant show that the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, before recovering attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"ArP\">\u00b69 In <em>Tripp, </em>we held that, under the Montana Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), a court may only award attorney fees to a successful defendant, \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Tripp, </em>\u00b6 37 (quoting <em>Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC </em>(1978), 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648, 657). We concluded that the MCPA had a preference for protecting the plaintiff. <em>Tripp, </em>\u00b6 37. Thus, under <em>Tripp, </em>the defendant in an action under the MCPA is afforded less protection than the plaintiff, and must meet a higher standard to recover fees. <em>Tripp, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u00b6 10 The MCPA\u2019s preference for protecting the interests of the plaintiff, over those of the defendant, is evidenced by the Act\u2019s treble damages provision, which allowed only plaintiffs to recover treble damages. <em>Tripp, </em>\u00b6 37. Conversely, the MRLTAprovides such protections for both the tenant and the landlord, as it allows a landlord to recover treble damages as well as a tenant. Section 70-24-422(f)(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u00b611  Coleman also argues that the MRLTA was created to provide tenants with greater protection than landlords because landlords often have more economic resources than tenants. Coleman cites <em>Whalen </em>for this notion, claiming in its brief that a goal of the MRLTA was to \u201clevel the playing field between Landlords and Tenants; to provide equal access to justice.\u201d In <em>Whalen, </em>we affirmed the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees, under \u00a7 70-24-442, MCA, to a plaintiff that had been represented by <em>pro bono </em>counsel. <em>Whalen, </em>278 Mont. at 304, 925 P.2d. at 468-469. We concluded that allowing <em>pro bono </em>attorneys to recover fees would promote equal access to justice as it would encourage such attorneys to assist indigent clients. <em>Whalen, </em>278 Mont. at 304, 925 P.2d at 468-69. However, at no point in <em>Whalen </em>did we conclude that a plaintiffs interests should be preferred over that of a defendant\u2019s. Thus, <em>Whalen </em>does not support the argument that the <em>Tripp </em>standard should be extended to the MRLTA. If anything, <em>Whalen </em>would support the opposite conclusion, as we allowed a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d that had not paid for his own counsel, to recover attorney fees under \u00a7 70-24-442, MCA. Therefore, we do not extend the <em>Tripp </em>standard, for a successful defendant to collect attorney fees under the Montana Consumer Protection Act, to \u00a7 70-24-442, MCA, of the Montana Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b612 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\"> This is an \u201cintermediate\u201d standard, as it falls between a \u201cbad faith\u201d and a \u201cprevailing party\u201d standard. <em>Tripp, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
