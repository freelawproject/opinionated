We now reformulate the question, pursuant to Rule 44(d), M.R.App.P., as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">May a Montana debtor claim an exemption for a gun under \u00a7 25-13-613(1)(b), MCA, in addition to exemptions allowed and claimed under \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer the question \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u00b62 Thomas O. Maynard and Lisa J. Maynard, a married couple referred to hereinafter as \u201cthe debtors,\u201d filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in May of 2005. The parties have stipulated that the debtors are able-bodied, neither is a member of the National Guard, the Montana Home Guard or the organized militia of Montana, and neither is required by law to keep any firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b63 The debtors\u2019 itemized list of their personal property for the bankruptcy proceeding includes a \u201cRemington 722 257 Roberts\u201d firearm valued at $420 and a \u2018Winchester 70 375\u201d valued at $725. The debtors claimed the two firearms as property exempt from execution of judgment pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-613(1)(b), MCA. The bankruptcy trustee objected to the debtors\u2019 claimed exemptions of the two firearms. Because there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute, the Bankruptcy Court certified the question of law to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">\u00b64 Article XIII, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution requires the Legislature to enact liberal homestead and exemption laws, and our jurisprudence establishes that courts will liberally construe exemption laws in favor of debtors where legislative intent is not clear. <em>See, e.g., In re Zimmerman, </em>2002 MT 90, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 337, \u00b6 15, 46 P.3d 599, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted); <em>MacDonald v. Mercill </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 146, 151, 714 P.2d 132, 135 (citation omitted); <em>Neel v. First Federal Sav. and Loan Assoc. of Great Falls </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 376, 383, 675 P.2d 96, 100 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">\u00b65 In interpreting a statute, we first look to the plain meaning of the words used. When the language of a statute is plain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself and no further interpretation is required. It is not a court\u2019s function to insert what has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>been omitted or omit what has been inserted; instead, our function is to ascertain and declare what, in terms of substance, is contained therein. <em>Matter of Estate </em>of Langendorf (1993), 262 Mont. 123, 125-26, 863 P.2d 434, 436 (citations omitted). In addition, we interpret a statute by viewing it in the statutory context in which it appears. <em>See Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 25, 324 Mont. 391, \u00b6 25, 106 P.3d 100, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted). Finally, in matters of statutory interpretation, the text of a statute takes precedence over the heading. <em>See Orozco v. Day </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 341, 348, 934 P.2d 1009, 1013 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b66 May a Montana debtor claim an exemption for a gun under \u00a7 25-13-613(1)(b), MCA, in addition to exemptions allowed and claimed under \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b67 The filing of a bankruptcy case creates a bankruptcy estate composed of all the legal and equitable interests of the debtor. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a). Federal law enumerates property which a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding may claim as exempt from the bankruptcy estate. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b). A state may choose to opt out of the exemption plan set forth in the federal bankruptcy statute, however, and Montana has done so via \u00a7 31-2-106, MCA. Debtors who live in an \u201copt out\u201d state like Montana may claim the exemptions provided under state law. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b68 Section 31-2-106, MCA, provides that property which is exempt from execution of judgment under Title 25, Chapter 13, part 6, MCA, is exempt from a bankruptcy estate. Section 25-13-609(1), MCA, provides that a judgment debtor\u2019s interest in up to $4,500 in aggregate value or $600 in any one item of property-specifically including firearms-is exempt from execution. The debtors in the present case rely on an exemption provided at \u00a7 25-13-613, MCA. That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">(1) In addition to the property mentioned in 25-13-609(1), there shall be exempt to all judgment debtors the following property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">(b) all arms, uniforms, and accouterments required by law to be kept by any person and one gun to be selected by the debtor[.] [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\u00b69 The bankruptcy trustee contends \u00a7 25-13-613(1)(b), MCA, only allows an exemption for a gun which is \u201cnecessary to carry out governmental functions,\u201d because the heading of \u00a7 25-13-613, MCA, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201cProperty necessary to carry out governmental functions.\u201d He relies on <em>Department of Revenue v. Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 255, 587 P.2d 1282, for the proposition that the title of a statute is presumed to indicate the Legislature\u2019s intent. His reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b610 The portion of <em>Puget Sound </em>upon which the trustee relies relates to the title of a legislative act. An \u201cact\u201d is not a specific statute. It is the Legislature\u2019s way of giving notice of what a piece of legislation covers and intends. In <em>Puget Sound, </em>the title was \u201cAn Act *** Broadening the Definition of New Industrial Property.\u201d <em>See Puget Sound, </em>179 Mont. at 263, 587 P.2d at 1287. The trustee provides no authority for the notion that the exemption at issue here originated as the title of a legislative act. Moreover, the specific statutory exemption for \u201cone gun\u201d dates back to 1895. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1222 Mont. C. Civ. Pro. (1895). At one time, the statute containing the \u201cone gun\u201d exemption was headed \u201cSpecific exemptions.\u201d The statutory heading referencing \u201cgovernmental functions\u201d was added in 1978 during recodification from the RCM to the MCA. <em>Compare </em>93-5814, RCM (1947) <em>with </em>\u00a7 25-13-613, MCA (1978). Stated simply, the \u201cgovernmental functions\u201d language was not enacted by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b611 As noted above, the text of a statute takes precedence over the heading for purposes of statutory interpretation. <em>See Orozco, </em>281 Mont. at 348, 934 P.2d at 1013. The exemptions under \u00a7 25-13-613, MCA, are available \u201cto all... debtors\u201d \u201c[i]n addition to the property mentioned in 25-13-609(1).\u201d Subsection (1)(b) exempts \u201call arms, uniforms, and accounterments required by law to be kept by any person and one gun to be selected by the debtor.\u201d The first portion of the subsection lists certain items a person is required by law to keep; the second allows \u201cone gun to be selected by the debtor.\u201d The two clauses are joined by the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d which indicates they are separate exemptions allowed to the debtor. The term \u201cgovernmental functions\u201d in the statute\u2019s heading cannot take precedence over-or limit-the Legislature\u2019s clearly stated exemption for \u201cone gun to be selected by the debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b612 The bankruptcy trustee also argues that allowing an exemption for a gun under \u00a7 25-13-613(1)(b), MCA, merely duplicates the exemption allowed under \u00a7 25-13-609, MCA, under which firearms may be included. The trustee points out that, under \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, courts must give effect to all provisions of a statute if possible, and urges us to conclude that the Legislature did not intend to merely duplicate \u00a7 25-13-609, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u00b613 The trustee\u2019s argument is not persuasive. Indeed, the conclusion he urges would result in not giving effect to all exemptions allowed by the statutes. Section 25-13-609(1), MCA, provides for a broad array of exemptions-only one of which is \u201cfirearms\u201d-within specific monetary limits. Section 25-13-613, MCA, specifically provides that its exemptions are \u201c[i]n addition to the property mentioned in 25-13-609(1).\u201d Thus, on its face, the \u201cone gun\u201d exemption is not merely duplicative, but is \u201cin addition to\u201d the exemptions provided in \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA. No liberal construction is necessary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b614  We hold that, pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 25-13-613(1)(b), MCA, a Montana debtor may claim an exemption for one gun in addition to exemptions allowed and claimed under \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA. Having reformulated and answered the certified question, we need not address the other arguments made by the parties.</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
