We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\u00b63 Did the defendant\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance of counsel, depriving him of a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied counsel\u2019s motions to withdraw and to appoint new counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">\u00b65 Worthan was charged by amended information filed February 10, 2004, with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent, two counts of incest, and one count of tampering with a witness or informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u00b66 On March 22, 2004, Worthan\u2019s appointed counsel, Kelli Sather (Sather), made a motion to withdraw from her representation of Worthan and to appoint new counsel. Sather had previously represented Worthan in a related civil matter, and it was her understanding that Worthan was planning to appeal the court\u2019s decision therein, making a claim of \u201cineffective assistance of counsel\u201d relating to her representation. Accordingly, Sather argued that by remaining Worthan\u2019s counsel she would be in violation of Rule 1.7(b), M.R.Prof.Cond., relating to conflicts of interest between lawyers and clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing on the motion on April 1, 2004. The District Court pointed out that ineffective assistance was a criminal standard, not a civil standard,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the Rules of Professional Conduct had changed, negating Sather\u2019s argument under Rule 1.7(b). Sather nevertheless maintained that Worthan\u2019s potential claim against her, whether ineffective assistance or malpractice, created a conflict in her representation of him in the criminal case. Sather also asserted that Worthan had sought advice from other attorneys and that she and Worthan had difficulty communicating. In addition, Worthan told the District Court that he found it difficult to contact Sather and that she did not keep him adequately informed of the progress of the case. The District Court concluded that Worthan\u2019s complaints were \u201csimple office management concerns\u201d and that Sather\u2019s representation was competent, despite her misgivings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">I\u2019m only interested in, if I appoint an attorney, ensuring that attorney stays on the case unless I\u2019m hearing there\u2019s been a complete breakdown in communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">And I have to hear more than the magic words complete breakdown in communication. I have to see substantively that the work is not getting done, and in this file the work is getting done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4p\">The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b68 During a hearing on May 26,2004, to consider various motions by the State, the foster mother to Worthan\u2019s daughters testified that Sather had improperly questioned one of the children during an examination by the defense\u2019s expert witness. Sather briefly broached the issue of withdrawing as counsel at a hearing on May 27, 2004, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>she did not pursue a definitive ruling from the District Court. On June 7,2004, Sather filed a second motion to withdraw and for appointment of new counsel. Sather denied the foster mother\u2019s allegation, but she asserted in her motion that she was now a necessary witness at trial and could not continue to represent Worthan without violating Rule 3.7(a), M.R.Prof.Cond., prohibiting lawyers from advocating at trials in which they are likely to be necessary witnesses unless certain exceptions apply. In its opinion and order dated June 9, 2004, the District Court determined that Sather\u2019s assertions that she was a necessary witness at trial and that her withdrawal would work no substantial hardship against Worthan-whose trial was scheduled for June 14, 2004-were unsubstantiated. The District Court stated that it was unable to evaluate whether there was merit to Sather\u2019s speculation that she would be a necessary witness at trial, and it noted that Sather failed to address why she delayed filing the motion until a mere five days before trial. The District Court also stated that this may be a situation where the general prohibition on an attorney for the defendant testifying at trial is outweighed by the potential detriment to the client should the attorney be replaced so close to trial. Ultimately, the District Court denied the motion but said it would consider appointing co-counsel, if Worthan were to request it. Worthan did not file a motion to appoint co-counsel, nor did he request a continuance of the trial. No evidence was admitted at trial regarding the incident other than the child\u2019s testimony that she could not remember whether Sather had questioned her during the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"ArP_\">\u00b69 Prior to trial, the District Court denied a motion by the State requesting that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts be admissible. During cross-examination at trial, however, Sather had the following exchange with Shelly Verwolf, a community social worker supervisor with the Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">Q. [by Ms. Sather] Okay. You stated you received the central intake report out of Helena on April 25th, 2003; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">A. [by Ms. Verwolf] Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">Q. So, were there any other reports made before April 25?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">A. Yes, there was. We had received a report in March of 2003 alleging that Kelly Worthan-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">Q. Okay. I just wanted to know if there was another report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">After an in-chambers conference and ruling, the State was able to ask this follow-up question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">Q. [by Mr. Fulbright, counsel for the State] Was that earlier report to central intake in March of 2003 an allegation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>defendant was involved in a separate or unrelated matter of sexual abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">A. [by Ms. Verwolf] Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b610 On the afternoon of the second day of trial, Sather cross-examined Dr. Ruggiero, the children\u2019s therapist. Sather had scheduled Dr. Vernon Whitley to testify that day concerning his physical examinations of the children because he would be unavailable later. However, Sather chose to continue her cross-examination rather than call Dr. Whitley to the stand. As a result, Dr. Whitley did not testify, but his reports were admitted into evidence by stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00b611 During the defense case-in-chief, Sather called David Stube (Stube) as an expert witness to criticize the therapy of the children and to testify about the children\u2019s suggestibility. However, during voir dire, doubt was raised about Stube\u2019s credentials and qualifications. Specifically, the State questioned whether Stube\u2019s doctoral degree from Columbia Pacific University was valid in light of a court order finding that the school was operating illegally prior to its issuance of a degree to Stube. Also, Stube admitted to misrepresenting to a mental health center where he had been employed that he had a master\u2019s degree. Stube later reimbursed the mental health center for refunds it made to clients who were improperly billed as a result of his misrepresentation. Additionally, though Stube is a licensed clinical counselor, the State argued that he was not qualified to criticize the work of the licensed psychologists who had testified for the State. Ultimately, the District Court disqualified Stube as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u00b612 The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts, and Worthan was sentenced to a total of 130 years imprisonment with sixty years suspended. Worthan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\u00b613  To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and he must demonstrate prejudice, i.e., \u201cthe existence of a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different absent counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674).</p>\n<p id=\"ArA\">\u00b614  In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">The trial record must adequately document a challenged act or omission of defense counsel for a defendant to raise an ineffective assistance claim on appeal. In addition to documenting the error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the record available to this Court on appeal must afford sufficient understanding of the reasons for counsel\u2019s act or omission to answer the threshold question of whether the alleged error expresses a trial strategy or tactical decision. If the record does not supply the reason for counsel\u2019s act or omission, the claim must be raised by petition for post-conviction relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b615 \u201cIt is within the sound discretion of the district court to rule on requests for substitution of appointed counsel, and absent an abuse of discretion, we will not overrule such a ruling.\u201d <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 4, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 4, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 4. \u201cIn evaluating discretionary rulings, this Court considers whether the district court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 4 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b616 Did the defendant\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance of counsel, depriving him of a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b617 Worthan asserts several grounds for concluding that Sather provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Worthan argues that Sather\u2019s failure to call Dr. Whitley to the stand, her failure to discover the deficiencies in Stube\u2019s qualifications as an expert, her elicitation of Verwolf s testimony regarding another report of sexual abuse, and her failure to investigate a list of potential witnesses that Worthan had provided her constitute, individually and collectively, ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u00b618  The State argues that Sather\u2019s failure to discover Stube\u2019s questionable qualifications was not objectively unreasonable because Stube had testified in court approximately fifty times in the previous twenty-one years, had held himself out as a \u201cPh.D.,\u201d and, in the words of the District Court at a post-trial hearing, was \u201cfacile and artful in holding out his qualifications to be more than they actually were.\u201d However, \u201c[o]nly when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Court review the matter on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20. Here, there is no record of Sather\u2019s decision-making process relating to offering Stube as an expert witness. Accordingly, we conclude that the record is insufficient to evaluate Sather\u2019s reasonableness in calling Stube as a witness, and the matter is therefore more appropriate for consideration in a petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b619  Likewise, the \u201crecord is insufficient to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objectively reasonable standard,\u201d <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 27, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 27, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 27, regarding Sather\u2019s decision not to call Dr. Whitley to the stand and Sather\u2019s alleged failure to investigate witnesses. Worthan cites to no portion of the record that indicates why Sather did not call Dr. Whitley to the stand or whether (or why) she failed to investigate Worthan\u2019s list of potential witnesses. Therefore, we again conclude that the matter is more appropriate for consideration in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>See White, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b620 The State also contends that Sather effectively mitigated the possible harm that her \u201copening of the door\u201d to evidence of prior reports of sexual abuse may have had. In a conference out of the jury\u2019s presence, after argument by the parties, the District Court ruled that the State should not be able to explore the content of the previous report of sexual abuse any further than to ask whether it involved a separate or unrelated matter. During the same conference, Sather gave her tactical reason for eliciting the testimony from Verwolf: \u201cI wanted to get in that Melissa Worthan [the defendant\u2019s wife] had gone in and made a report on the 24th before this report even came in on the 25th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b621  \u201cCounsel\u2019s trial tactics and strategic decisions cannot be the basis upon which to find ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Grixti, </em>\u00b6 25. It is clear from the record that the testimony Sather educed from Verwolf was the result of a considered tactical decision. Accordingly, we conclude that Sather did not render ineffective assistance by drawing out this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b622 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied counsel\u2019s motions to withdraw and to appoint new counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b623 \u201cA defendant\u2019s right to assistance of counsel at public expense extends through an original appeal of right, but the accused does not have the right to counsel of his or her choice.\u201d <em>State v. Zackuse </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 385, 385, 833 P.2d 142, 142. \u201cIf the trial court determines that the defendant and his counsel have a conflict so great that it results in a total lack of communication or if counsel is failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>render effective assistance, new counsel should be appointed.\u201dZackuse, 250 Mont. at 385, 833 P.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b624 Worthan argues that the District Court allowed concerns of judicial administration to outweigh \u201cthe necessity of trust between client and attorney.\u201d Worthan contends that the denial of the motions to withdraw were \u201ccomparable to a denial of a motion to continue trial\u201d because \u201cdisruption of the Court\u2019s schedule seemed paramount in the Court\u2019s decisions to deny trial counsel\u2019s requests to withdraw.\u201d Relying on <em>State v. Garcia, </em>2003 MT 211, 317 Mont. 73, 75 P.3d 313 (reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to continue trial so the defendant\u2019s newly retained private counsel that replaced appointed counsel ten days prior to trial would have time to prepare), Worthan argues that the expeditious administration of justice is not cause to deny the motions of counsel to withdraw. Worthan asserts, \u201cThere is simply no other reason the Court denied the motion of trial counsel to withdraw than to appease the desire to keep the Court\u2019s calendar in order.\u201d Consequently, Worthan argues that the District Court abused its discretion by denying the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b625 In <em>Garcia, </em>our reversal of the trial court\u2019s ruling was predicated upon the principles that a defendant has the right to decide who best can conduct the case and that this \u201cright to counsel also means that counsel shall be given a reasonable time to prepare before trial.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>State v. Blakeslee </em>(1957), 131 Mont. 47, 54, 306 P.2d 1103, 1106). \u201cFailure to respect these rights constitutes a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>\u00b6 13. However, <em>Garcia </em>drew a distinction between \u201cthose individuals with the means to secure private representation,\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>\u00b6 13, and defendants who have counsel appointed: \u2018Within the context of appointed counsel, a defendant may not insist upon appointment of specific counsel or demand dismissal or substitution of counsel so long as appointed counsel renders effective assistance.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b626 Despite his statement to the District Court that he had difficulty communicating with Sather, Worthan has failed to demonstrate that there was a \u201ctotal lack of communication,\u201d <em>Zackuse, </em>250 Mont. at 385, 833 P.2d at 142, with his trial counsel at the time the motions were made. At the hearing on the first motion to withdraw, the District Court specifically noted that Sather was \u201cperforming an adequate job here and ... surpassing the minimum professional standards for representation of Mr. Worthan,\u201d and that \u201cthe motions that Ms. Sather has filed have been well-briefed.\u201d In addition, Worthan, speaking directly with the judge, asserted that Sather had not subpoenaed the witnesses he had requested in the civil case in which she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>represented him, that it was difficult to confer with Sather due to frequent cancellations of appointments, and that he had belatedly received copies of the motions filed in the criminal case. The District Court interpreted these complaints as \u201cpart of the constant stresses and strains of a busy lawyer running a busy law office,\u201d and we are not persuaded by Worthan that the District Court\u2019s assessment of Sather\u2019s representation was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b627  The second motion to withdraw, rather than addressing client-attorney communication, focused on the possible conflict between Worthan and Sather that could have occurred had Sather been called to testify. However, as the District Court discussed in its ruling, Sather was unable to substantiate that she was likely to be a necessary witness at trial, and she was unable to demonstrate that her disqualification at such a late date would not work substantial hardship on her client. <em>See </em>Rule 3.7, M.R.Prof.Cond. Moreover, the District Court suggested that Worthan could request the appointment of co-counsel as means of alleviating the uncertainties surrounding the potential for Sather to become a witness at trial. As it happened, Worthan suffered no prejudice from the ruling because Sather did not testify at trial. Given the circumstances, we cannot conclude that the District Court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. Further, we deem unpersuasive Worthan\u2019s argument that Sather\u2019s second motion to withdraw was equivalent to a motion to continue, and we do not construe it as such. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying counsel\u2019s motions to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b628 Worthan\u2019s arguments regarding the effectiveness of his counsel\u2019s assistance in relation to the decisions whether to call Dr. Whitley and Stube as witnesses and whether to investigate his list of potential witnesses are best addressed in a petition for postconviction relief and not on direct appeal. With respect to the evidence elicited by Sather of a previous report of sexual abuse, we conclude that counsel did not provide ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b629 The District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying counsel's motions to withdraw and to appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> This statement of the law was not entirely correct.
