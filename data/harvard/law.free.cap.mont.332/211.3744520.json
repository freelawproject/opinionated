At trial, the District Court refused Aune\u2019s request for a lesser-included offense instruction on misdemeanor assault; the jury subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>found him guilty of PFMA. Aune now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court abused its discretion by refusing to give the jury a lesser-included offense instruction on assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b63 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b64 The defendant and his wife, Dawn Aune (\u201cDawn\u201d), arrived home intoxicated around ten o\u2019clock in the evening on May 3, 2005, with their baby. At the time, the couple lived with Dawn\u2019s mother, Ivon Lockwood, in her basement. Dawn\u2019s three other children also lived \u2022with Lockwood, including twelve-year-old Sean, the oldest child, whom Lockwood had adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b65 Sean testified that he was dozing off to television in the living room when he heard screaming and a car door slam. He looked outside and saw Aune and Dawn arguing in the driveway. Aune was holding the car seat carrying their baby, while Dawn screamed at him to give the baby to her. Sean testified that Aune either hit or pushed Dawn, at which point she appeared to be choking. Aune then threw food and a baby bottle at Dawn. Sean also testified that he believed Dawn slapped Aune at some point. Scared by the fighting, Sean ran upstairs to seek help from Lockwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b66 By the time Lockwood awoke and descended the stairs, Aune and Dawn had moved their argument to the basement. Lockwood testified that she instructed Dawn to bring the baby to her, at which point Aune attempted to explain what happened. Fed up, Lockwood refused to listen to Aune and instead told him to sleep off the alcohol and talk in the morning. According to Lockwood, Arme then stormed downstairs, slamming doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u00b67 Dawn told Lockwood that Aune had hit her and that she was \u201cscared to death.\u201d Law enforcement arrived shortly thereafter and detained Aune. Aune, who had a slight scratch under his left eye, stated that Dawn had hit him and that he had not touched her. Sean spoke with Deputy Ken Getz, showing him where the fight occurred; Deputy Getz observed food, food wrappers, a baby\u2019s bottle, a beer can and a belt. Law enforcement interviewed Dawn twice that evening. According to Deputy Getz, Dawn appeared visibly shaken and intoxicated; however, she indicated that she did not want Aune incarcerated. Although Dawn initially provided contradictory testimony to law enforcement, at trial she positively took blame for instigating the fight and insisted Aune did not hit her. Aune also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>testified at trial, maintaining that the altercation started as a verbal dispute and that he only used force in order to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b68 During trial, Arme asked the District Court to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of assault. The court denied this request \u201cbecause the only additional element in partner or family member assault that isn\u2019t in the assault offense is the family relationship,\u201d and since Aune and Dawn were indisputably married, the court concluded such an instruction would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b69 The jury convicted Aune of PFMA. He now appeals the court\u2019s decision to deny the lesser included offense instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b610 This Court reviews jury instructions to determine whether the instructions as a whole fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. In order for the district court to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense, the record must contain evidence from which the jury could rationally find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and acquit of the greater, and the offense must actually constitute an included offense of the crime charged. <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 23, 305 Mont. 123, \u00b6 23, 23 P.3d 216, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\u00b611 The State charged Aune with violating subsection (1) of the PFMA statute, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">45-5-206. Partner or family member assault .... (1) A person commits the offense of partner or family member assault if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">(a) purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to a partner or family member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">(b) ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">(c) purposely or knowingly causes <em>reasonable apprehension </em>of bodily injury in a partner or family member. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">\u00b612 Arme argues that the District Court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on assault as a lesser included offense. He insists that the assault statute qualifies as a lesser included offense of PFMA and the court should have instructed the jury accordingly in light of the fact that law enforcement found no signs of physical violence on Dawn. The assault statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">45-5-201. Assault. (1) A person commits the offense of assault if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-16\">(a) purposely or knowingly causes <em>bodily injury </em>to another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>(b) negligently causes bodily injury to another <em>with a </em>weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">(c) purposely or knowingly makes <em>physical contact </em>of an insulting or provoking nature with any individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">(d) purposely or knowingly causes <em>reasonable apprehension </em>of bodily injury in another. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b613 An \u201cincluded offense\u201d is an offense that \u201c(a) is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; (b) consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included in the offense charged; or (c) differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk to the same person, property, or public interest or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission.\u201d Section 46-1-202(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b614 Aune argues that pursuant to \u00a7 46-1-202(9)(c), MCA, assault constitutes a less serious injury or risk or a lesser kind of culpability than PFMA. In making this argument, however, Aune has mistakenly relied on language in subsection (1)(a) of the PFMA statute, rather than the wording in subsection (1)(c), the provision under which Aune was charged. In other words, Aune\u2019s argument is based on the false premise that the jury convicted him of \u201cpurposely or knowingly caus[ing] <em>bodily injury </em>to a partner or family member,\u201d when in fact, he was convicted of \u201cpurposely or knowingly caus[ing] <em>reasonable apprehension </em>of bodily injury in a partner or family member.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b615  Aune\u2019s assertion that assault constitutes a less serious injury or a lesser kind of culpability than PFMA fails when applied to \u00a7 45-5-206(1)(c), MCA. The PFMA statute, subsection (c), requires proof of \u201creasonable apprehension of bodily injury,\u201d while the assault statute, at a minimum, requires proof of that same \u201creasonable apprehension of bodily injury.\u201d Thus, the assault statute does not differ from PFMA in requiring a less serious injury or a lesser kind of culpability. A charge of assault is not, as Aune argues under \u00a7 46-1-202(9)(c), MCA, a lesser included offense of PFMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-10\">JUSTICES RICE, WARNER, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
