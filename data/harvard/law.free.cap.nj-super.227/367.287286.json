A. </em>39:6A-4 and 10 of the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act (No-Fault), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 <em>et seq., </em>after termination of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We hold that where temporary disability benefits under workers\u2019 compensation are paid in excess of income disability payments under No-Fault but the disability continues beyond the period of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits, a claimant is entitled to receive income continuation benefits under the No-Fault Act as long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the disability persists up to the maximum income continuation benefits under the policy less a credit under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-6 for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">This is an action for a declaratory judgment by plaintiffs to determine personal injury protection benefits (PIP) coverage pursuant to the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act (No-Fault), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 <em>et seq., </em>under an automobile insurance policy issued by defendant New Jersey Manufacturer\u2019s Insurance Company (NJM) to plaintiff Margaret Olivero. On a previous appeal we reversed a dismissal of the complaint and remanded for a determination as to whether income continuation benefits were payable to Mrs. Olivero\u2019s daughter, Tina, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 and 39:6A-10. <em>Olivero v. New Jersey Manufacturers Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191 (1985). After remand, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to reform the insurance policy to provide for income continuation benefits for as long as plaintiff\u2019s disability continued. <em>See Clendaniel v. New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>361 (1984). <em>See also Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Carriere, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437 (Law Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Plaintiffs appeal from an order entered April 1, 1987<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The order also denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment to determine and adjudge that Tina Olivero is entitled to income continuation benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 for as long as her disability exists and further to reconstruct her wage losses for impairment of earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The basic facts underlying plaintiffs\u2019 claim are essentially undisputed. On April 21, 1981, plaintiff Tina, then 12 years of age, was seriously injured when she was struck by an automobile while riding her bicycle and delivering papers for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Vineland Times Journal. As a result of head injuries, she suffered from neurological deficiencies with ambulation, coordination and speech dysfunction. Her learning ability and memory retention have also been seriously impaired. Extensive surgery, treatment and therapy, designed to minimize the effects of the injury, have continued over the years since the accident to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">On May 11, 1981, a workers\u2019 compensation petition was filed by Tina. On July 16, 1981, Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for Vineland Times Journal, was directed to \u201csupply to the petitioner all reasonable and necessary medical care necessary for her to recover from her injuries suffered on April 21, 1981.\u201d Liberty Mutual was also directed to pay the minimum temporary disability payments of $53.07 per week (Tina earned $29 per week for six and one-half hours work). As of July 17, 1984, Liberty Mutual paid a total of $157,356.58 for medical benefits as well as temporary disability benefits under workers\u2019 compensation which continued after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Tina has been treated at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia on several occasions. Medical doctors at Children\u2019s Hospital recommended home therapy and physical therapy requiring private tutoring, remodeling of plaintiffs\u2019 home and physical therapy at a health spa.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">She has also been admitted on numerous occasions to Children\u2019s Seashore House in Atlantic City for surgery and rehabilitative treatment. In June 1984, Tina had surgery to correct the spastic condition of her toes and foot. During July and August 1984 she was an in-house patient at Children\u2019s Seashore House and received occupational and speech-language therapy. The discharge summaries from Children\u2019s Seashore House state that physical, occupational and speech therapy are to be continued at home and at the Newcomb Hospital in Vineland.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Although Tina is still severely disabled and handicapped, she was able to graduate from high school in 1986. She is now 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>years of age and is a freshman at Cumberland County College. Her marks range between \u201cB\u2019s\u201d and \u201cC\u2019s\u201d and, after graduation, she intends to transfer to a four-year college. Although it has been six years since the automobile accident, Tina remains under the care of a doctor and continues to be severely disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">At the time of the accident, Tina resided with her mother, Margaret Olivero. When Mrs. Olivero initially applied for an insurance policy from NJM, she requested option 5 for additional income continuation benefits up to $36,400. The policy, which was renewed from year to year, was issued in February 1977 with coverage under option 5 and was in effect on the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On August 12, 1987, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge entered an order approving settlement which awarded Tina 340 weeks temporary disability at $53.07 per week for a total of $18,424.63<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plus total permanent disability of 450 weeks at $124.88 per week for a total of $56,196 less $4,192.53 paid for a balance of $52,003.47. Permanent disability payments were made retroactive to January 13, 1986, thus allowing Liberty Mutual a credit for all temporary disability benefits paid to Tina after that date with \u201c[permanent disability to continue beyond 450 wks., as allowed by statute.\u201d The 100% of total was based on neurologic, orthopedic and psychiatric permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The order also required that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Respondent [Liberty Mutual] shall continue to authorize all medical treatment presently provided petitioner, including without limitation, all physicians presently treating petitioner out of Childrens' Hosp. in Philadelphia, Pa., Leona Glovsky, a speech therapist in Vineland, N J., and such further reasonable and necessary treatment as may be recommended by these physicians.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">NJM acknowledges that under option 5 of the policy, Tina is entitled to the maximum income continuation benefits up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>$41,600 which represents $5,200 as the basic benefits plus $36,400 for additional income continuation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">On this appeal, plaintiffs raise the following issues: \u201c[1] Defendant NJM\u2019s failure to offer the option to purchase additional PIP benefits provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 to cover plaintiff mandates that the policy be reformed to provide these benefits; [2] [pjlaintiff is entitled to the payment of income continuation benefits from the date that she is declared permanently disabled by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, and [3] [pjlaintiff was entitled to reconstruct and project the amount her wages would have been except for the injuries suffered in the automobile accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">In their first issue, plaintiffs contend that \u201c[a]t the time of the accident, the benefits provided in the insurance policy did not include the required section 10 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10] option for income continuation benefits <em>for the length of the disability </em>covering either the named insured and/or household relatives.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) They contend that the failure to offer additional options requires that the policy be reformed to provide those benefits. <em>See Clendaniel v. N.J. Manufacturers Ins. Co., supra. See also Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Carriere, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The basic personal injury protection (PIP) pursuant to <em>N.J.S. A. </em>39:6A-4b provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\"><em>b. Income continuation benefits. </em>The payment of the loss of income of an income producer as a result of bodily injury disability, subject to a maximum weekly payment of $100.00, per week. Such sums shall be payable during the life of the injured person and shall be subject to an amount or limit of $5,200.00, on account of injury to any one person, in any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pertaining to additional PIP coverage at the time the policy was issued provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\n<em>Additional personal injury protection coverage.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">Insurers shall make available to the named insured covered under section 4, suitable additional first-party coverage for income continuation benefits, essential services benefits, survivor benefits and funeral expense benefits. Income continuation in excess of that provided for in section 4 must be provided as an option by insurers to persons for disabilities, <em>as long as the disability persists, </em>up to an income level of $35,000.00 per year, with the excess between $5,200.00 and the amount of coverage contracted for to be written on the basis of 75% of said difference. The Commissioner of Insurance is hereby authorized and empowered to establish, by rule or regulations, the amounts and terms of income continuation insurance to be provided pursuant to this section. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Under this section, the Commissioner of Insurance promulgated <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3 pertaining to additional income continuation benefits as set forth in Appendix I annexed hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In addition to the five options which insurance carriers were required to offer, the notes to the table under Appendix A of the regulation required that the insurance carriers inform their insureds that: \u201cBroader forms of additional personal injury protection benefits are available on a \u2018referred to company\u2019 basis.\u201d The Commissioner also notified insurance carriers that policyholders must be apprised of coverage available under the Act and promulgated a form letter for that purpose. <em>See Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Carriere, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404. Insurers were not required to use the Commissioner\u2019s form letter, but to the extent that the insurer\u2019s form letter varied from the Commissioner\u2019s in substance, his approval was required. <em>Id. </em>at 444-45. The Commissioner suggested the following to be included in a notice or letter by the insurance carriers to their insureds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">As a part of each loss of income benefits there are included additional benefits for essential services and a $10,000 death benefit. Please refer to the enclosed \u2018Offer to Purchase Additional Coverage\u2019 for further details of these options. If you desire coverage in excess of those quoted above, inquire directly of your [company] [agent].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Richard Pazdan, an underwriter with NJM for 16 years, was deposed by plaintiffs. He stated that prospective insureds were sent a business package which contained an explanation of \u201cPersonal Injury Protection coverage\u201d and also the availability of \u201cAdditional PIP Coverage\u201d. The notice itemized the five options for additional PIP coverage as set forth in Appendix I attached hereto. Above the schedule of the five options, the form contained the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">ADDITIONAL PIP COVERAGE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">Additional coverage for loss of income is available in blanket sum amounts of $5,200, $7,800, $13,000, $20,800 or $36,400 payable in specific weekly maximum, and applies per named insured (i.e., husband and wife).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">Therefore, we are pleased to make available additional first-party \u201cNo Fault\u201d coverages as outlined in five (5) options below. <em>Broader forms of additional Personal Injury Protection benefits are available on request. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Pazdan stated that the same type notice would have been sent to Mrs. Olivero for the renewal of her policy from February 1981 to February 1982.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">In addition, Pazdan testified that prior to December 1982, NJM did not offer an additional PIP endorsement as an option under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 to provide income continuation benefits \"for so long as the disability existed.\u201d He testified that there was no provision in 1981 for rating this type of risk. In absence of a rating, the risk could not be offered to insureds. He also stated that the absence of a rating was not peculiar to NJM, but rather there was no such rating by the Commissioner available to the entire insurance industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>There is nothing in the record to refute Pazdan\u2019s testimony that no rates were available to offer to prospective insureds for additional income continuation benefits for \u201cas long as the disability persists\u201d prior to December 1982. His testimony appears to be corroborated by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-1.3, promulgated by the Commissioner as required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10, as well as by the directive of the Commissioner. Neither <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3 nor the Commissioner\u2019s suggested notice or form letter makes any reference specifically to additional income continuation benefits \u201cas long as the disability persists.\u201d The Commissioner's suggested letter directs the insurance carriers to enclose an \u201cOffer to Purchase Additional Coverage\u201d for further details of these options, and that \u201c[i]f you desire coverage in excess of those quoted above, inquire directly to your [company] [agent].\u201d The \u201cOffer to Purchase Additional Coverage\u201d form attached to the letter itemizes the five options available in Appendix A of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3 but there is no reference to income continuation benefits for \u201cas long as the disability persists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The regulations in effect prior to December 1982 appear to indicate a transitory period in which there was no requirement for income continuation benefits for \u201cas long as the disability persists.\u201d Significantly <em>N.J.A.C. </em>ll:3-7.3(b) required only five weekly indemnity schedules \u201cwith a <em>two-year benefit </em>duration.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Further, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>ll:3-7.3(c) directs that <em>\u201cat least for the initial period, </em>it will be sufficient if your manuals exhibit these <em>minimum benefits schedules with corresponding rates.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) The historical note to subchapter 7 of the regulations pertaining to Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.1, states that the provisions of that subchapter became effective December 4, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The present regulations under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11:3-7.4 pertaining to minimum schedule of additional personal injury protection coverage benefits, annexed hereto as Appendix II, became effective August 16, 1982. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>ll:3-7.4(a) provides that: \u201cEvery rate filer\u2019s schedule of rates for additional personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>protection benefits shall provide at least the benefit schedules set forth in Table 1 in [subsection] (b) below.\u201d The additional PIP coverage table in subsection (b) requires eight options up to $700 per week for total income continuation benefits of $72,800, but, significantly, now requires eight additional options from 9 to 16 for weekly income continuation benefits of $100 to $700 per week with the total income continuation benefits \u201cunlimited.\u201d It thus appears that it was not until August 1982 that insurance carriers were required to file a schedule of rates for additional unlimited or \u201cas long as the disability persists\u201d PIP income continuation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">From our review of the record and the regulations and directives of the Commissioner, we are satisfied that plaintiffs have failed to sustain their burden of proof that additional income continuation benefits for \u201cas long as the disability persists\u201d were available prior to December 1982. Moreover, there is nothing in the record before us to indicate that, even if additional continuation benefits were available for \u201cas long as the disability persists,\u201d the additional coverage would have been requested. We note that in the renewal policy issued to Mrs. Olivero for the period from February 21,1986 to February 21, 1987, she still had not elected unlimited coverage. She chose option 6 with weekly benefits of $500 and total benefits of $52,000, but she made no election for option 14 which provides for unlimited income continuation benefits of $500 per week. In absence of any statement from Mrs. Olivero to the contrary, it would be sheer speculation for us to infer that she would have purchased additional income continuation benefits for \u201cas long as the disability persists\u201d had it been offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Defendants cite <em>Greenberg v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223 (App.Div.1978), affd 79 <em>N.J. </em>399 (1979) for the proposition that \u201c[t]he measure of income loss referred to in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:6A-4b. is the difference between what one would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>have earned had the injury not occurred and what one did earn.\u201d 158 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 228. At oral argument before the trial court, plaintiffs indicated that the \u201creconstructed rate of disability will be somewhere between one hundred and fourteen and one hundred and twenty-four dollars a week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On appeal before us, they argue that the nature of Tina's injuries \u201chas created a loss of income over what she would have earned as an adult without quadriparesis. Her income loss is, therefore, much greater than the loss of a part-time job.\u201d They assert that Tina, therefore, \u201cis entitled to reconstruct what that loss of income is\u201d which results in \u201ca substantial difference between what she earned before the accident and what she will not earn because of her injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The issue presented in <em>Greenberg </em>was whether plaintiff had, or may have had, \u201closs of income despite the fact that his cash receipts during this period of disability, partial or total, exceeded] those he was receiving before the accident.\u201d 158 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 227. We held that income continuation benefits to be paid under the No-Fault Act is measured by the difference between the amount that the claimant would have earned if not injured and the income actually received. <em>Id. </em>at 228. This formula applies to \u201call income producers, wage earners, those on tips, commissions, royalties, contingent fees and any other sort of income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The rationale for the measure of loss of income is based upon the proposition that, for <em>e.g., </em>lost commissions or contingent fees during the period of income continuation benefits probably will differ from that offered in support of a claim for loss for a fixed salary per week. <em>Id. </em>An income producer such as a salesman or broker may receive income during the period of disability which was generated prior to the date of the accident. A salaried worker on a fixed income should be permitted to prove any increments he may have received over his fixed salary. <em>Id. </em>at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>In <em>Greenberg, </em>we reversed the trial judge who had held that where a claimant\u2019s income during a period of disability after an automobile accident exceeded his income before the accident, the claimant\u2019s increased income while disabled repelled the notion that he had lost income during the disability period. <em>Id. </em>at 227. <em>Cf. Gambino v. Royal Globe Insurance Co., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>100 (1981) (insured who had always been gainfully employed and who had sold his taxi company and was injured two days before beginning new employment was entitled to income continuation benefits). Under certain conditions, that conclusion may not be valid: A partner may receive income during the period of disability which was generated prior to the date of the accident. By the same token, a claimant may sustain a diminution in income after the disability has been terminated because of his inability to generate income during the time of the disability. <em>See Zyck v. Hartford Insurance Group, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580 (Law Div. 1976), mod. and aff\u2019d 150 <em>NJ.Super. </em>431 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">What is more important, <em>Greenberg </em>expressly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Tina is entitled to project her future diminution in earning capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">Income continuation benefits provided under the no-fault law do not redress diminished earning capacity, a traditional item of damage in third-party tort cases, but rather indemnify for actual earning loss suffered as a result of a covered automobile accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">SjS \u25a0!{ J-! # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">We stress ... that the formula by which earning loss is to be determined measures just that and not diminished earning capacity. The inquiry is, what would the victim have earned had he not been injured. [158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 230-231.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\"><em>See Zyck v. Hartford Insurance Group, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 592 (tort damage concepts cannot be applied with equal force under the No-Fault Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4b. and 39:6A-10, the maximum total income continuation benefits has a ceiling or cap as to the total amount which may be recovered\u2014$5,200 under the former and $41,600 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>under option 5 of the latter statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the purpose of the Act is \u201creparation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1. In <em>Webster\u2019s New Third International Dictionary </em>at 1923, \u201creparation\u201d is defined as the act or process of mending or restoring. As stated in <em>Marcos v. Transamerica Insurance Company, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>572, 583 (1978) (Justice Schreiber dissenting):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">Indeed, viewing the statute in its entirety, one discerns a pattern of <em>reimbursement, </em>whether for medical expenses, funeral expenses, loss of income, or essential service benefits. The intent certainly was not to provide someone with a windfall, a result which conflicts with another major purpose of the no fault law\u2014to decrease the cost of automobile liability insurance to the motoring public. <em>M. lavicoli, [No-Fault &amp; Comparative Negligence in New Jersey </em>(1973) ] at 20. <em>Reimbursement and reparations </em>are the keys to the legislative intent. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The purpose of the No-Fault Act is incompatible with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that income continuation benefits may be projected to anticipate future loss of income because of a diminution in earning capacity under principles for damages in tort actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Based upon the premise that the workers\u2019 compensation award for permanent disability does not constitute a weekly income, plaintiffs contend that Tina \u201cis entitled to the payment of income continuation benefits from the date that she is declared permanently disabled by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.\u201d They submit that an award for a permanent disability does not constitute wage benefits and that PIP benefits are payable after the temporary disability benefits from the workers\u2019 compensation termination, citing <em>Skryha v. Pennsylvania Nat. Mut. Cas., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66 (App.Div.1985). They argued before the trial court that \u201cwhen they [workers\u2019 compensation] don\u2019t supply a benefit, then you can go back to PIP and get it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>There is no doubt that an award for permanent disability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act represents compensation for the employee\u2019s physical impairment to carry on the ordinary pursuits of life and not loss of income, <em>Perez v. Pantasote, Inc., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>105, 111 (1984); <em>accord Young v. Western Electric Co., Inc., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>220, 226 (1984). Nevertheless, <em>Skryha </em>does not support plaintiffs\u2019 contention that PIP income continuation benefits up to the maximum coverage commence after the workers\u2019 temporary disability benefits terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In <em>Skryha, </em>the plaintiff was attempting to collect for essential service benefits which were not collectible under workers\u2019 compensation insurance and therefore was not barred from recovery under PIP coverage by the workers\u2019 survivor. <em>Id. </em>at 71. On the other hand, <em>Skryha </em>denied plaintiffs application for funeral expenses up to $1,000 pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4(e) because plaintiff had already recovered $2,000 for funeral benefits under workers\u2019 compensation. This is because <em>N.J.S. A. </em>39:6A-6 requires benefits collectible under workers\u2019 compensation insurance to be deducted from the benefits collectible under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 and 10. <em>Id. </em>As stated in <em>Aetna Insurance Co. v. Gilcrest Bros., Inc., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>550, 566 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">When the Legislature desired to modify the impact of having the automobile liability insurance company pay PIP benefits, it has done so in unmistakable fashion. Thus the Legislature has expressly provided that PIP payments shall be <em>reduced </em>by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits collectible under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-6. In that event, the automobile liability carrier will receive the benefit of workers\u2019 compensation because of the express legislative intent. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Income continuation benefits under the No-Fault Act and temporary disability payments under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act are co-extensive. No-fault continuation benefits do not supplement workers\u2019 compensation benefits except insofar as the No-Fault Act provides more benefits than those provided under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See <em>Wagner v. Transamerica Insurance Company, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 34 (App.Div. 1979). <em>(\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-6, in requiring the deduction of collectible PIP benefits, is a clear legislative mandate that workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>compensation should be the ultimate source for recovery of the medical expenses of claimants injured in compensable auto accidents.\u201d) <em>See Olivero by Olivero v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Although PIP benefits are \u201cpayable as loss accrues\u201d, <em>N.J.S. A. </em>39:6A-6, and commence on the date of the accident, <em>Virden v. Travelers Insurance Company, </em>167 <em>NJ.Super. </em>209, 210 (1979), in the present case NJM had no obligation to pay income continuation benefits as long as temporary benefits equal to or more than the income continuation benefits were paid by Liberty Mutual, the workers\u2019 compensation carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">We are convinced that where temporary disability payments under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act are in excess of income continuation benefits under the No-Fault Act and the disability continues beyond a period of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits, a claimant is entitled to receive income continuation benefits under the No-Fault Act for as long as the disability persists until the maximum benefits have been paid. However, the PIP insurance carrier is entitled to a credit under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-6 for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid during the period of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">If NJM had paid the PIP income continuation benefits in the amount of $29 per week in the first instance, it would have been subrogated to Tina\u2019s right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and would have been fully reimbursed for the PIP benefits it had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Stated another way, had there been no workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable to Tina, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 and 10 the maximum benefits which she could have collected would be at the rate of $29 per week up to the basic amount of $5,200 with the \u201cexcess between $5,200.00 and the amount of coverage contracted for [$36,400] ... on the basis of 75% of said difference,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10. The additional benefits amount to $27,300 for total PIP income continuation benefits of $32,500. Although she has in fact received 340 weeks of temporary</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>disability payments at $53.07 per week, NJM would have been obligated to pay a total of $8,701.75 for PIP wage income continuation benefits during the 340 weeks of payments by the workers\u2019 compensation carrier, Liberty Mutual.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Deducting these benefits from the total additional benefits of $32,500, NJM is obligated to pay the balance in the amount of $23,758.25 in weekly installments of $21.75 until the full balance of income continuation benefits is paid. <em>Cf. Smith v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>610 (Law Div.1985) (insured, who had received temporary disability benefits, but whose disability continued beyond the period of temporary disability benefits, held entitled to receive additional income continuation benefits under PIP for as long as the disability persisted, until the maximum PIP benefits have been paid and temporary disability benefits were not to be deducted from maximum coverage) and see <em>Zoller v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552 (App.Div.1987) (no income continuation benefits under PIP where plaintiff returned to work one month after accident then took early retirement 15 months later with no medical testimony that this disability required retirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The order of April 1, 1987 granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>APPENDIX I</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Minimum schedule of additional personal injury protection</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">(a) Appendix A outlines the minimum schedule of \u201cadditional personal injury protection\u201d coverage benefits that insurers must make available in accordance with Section 10 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">(b) In the Appendix A table, only five weekly indemnity schedules are shown, with a two-year benefit duration.
