Frey against Tazewell county, for $2,676.30, reported upon by the committee on swamp lands on the 11th day of September, 1878, be and the same is hereby disallowed and rejected.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b503-13\" pgmap=\"503\">Ho other action was taken or had by the board in reference to the allowance or disallowance of this claim.</p> <p id=\"b504-4\" pgmap=\"504\">From these proceedings of the hoard of supervisors appellee appealed to the circuit court of Tazewell county, when a trial was had and judgment rendered against the county from which it prosecutes an appeal to this court.</p> <p id=\"b504-5\" pgmap=\"504\">At the \u00a1November term of the circuit court, it being the first term after the appeal was perfected and before any other steps were taken, a motion was made by the attorney of tlie county to dismiss the appeal for the following reason, among others:</p> <p id=\"b504-6\" pgmap=\"504\">\u201c Because the papers filed in the cause show that it is not a proper subject of appeal.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b504-7\" pgmap=\"504\">This motion was overruled by the court, and this ruling is now assigned for error. The statute allowing an appeal from the board of supervisors to the county court is as follows: \u201cAnd when the claim of any person against a county is disallowed, in whole or in part, by the county board, and the nature of the claim is not such that the allowance is discretionary with the county board, such person may appeal from the decision of such board to the circuit court of the same county.\u201d Stat. 1874, p. 309, sec. 35.</p> <p id=\"b504-8\" pgmap=\"504\">In this case the claim was not disallowed; on the contrary, when a resolution was offered to that effect it was laid on the table. Thus the board refused to disallow the claim. True, the record does not show that the claim was allowed, but the board refused to disallow it, and no further action was taken in reference to the matter.</p> <p id=\"b504-9\" pgmap=\"504\">There was no such order of the board as could be appealed from, and the circuit court erred in not dismissing the appeal. For this error the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to the Circuit Court to dismiss the appeal.</p> <p id=\"b504-10\" pgmap=\"504\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
