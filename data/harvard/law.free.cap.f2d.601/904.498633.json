The instant case, one of first impression in this circuit, requires this court to analyze the inter-relationship of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">Plaintiff-appellee, Transmatic, Inc., brought this action seeking a declaration that a utility patent held by defendants-appellants, Guit\u00f3n Industries, Inc. and Patent License Corp., was invalid. The grounds asserted for such invalidity included that the utility patent constituted double patenting of a previously issued design patent held by Guit\u00f3n and Patent License. The district court agreed that double patenting had occurred and granted summary judgment in Transmatic\u2019s favor. 442 F.Supp. 911, 196 U.S.P.Q. 788 (E.D.Mich.1977). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-23\">The patents involved in this lawsuit are both for interior lighting fixtures which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>employed along the ceilings of buses, subway cars, and other mass transit coaches, Their general use is depicted in the following figure:</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>The utility patent, No. 3,210,875 (hereinafter \u201c \u2019875 patent\u201d or \u201cutility patent\u201d), was applied for on February 5, 1963, and issued on October 12,1965, for a term of seventeen years. The named inventor was Norbert Schwenkler. The patent was assigned to Patent License, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Guit\u00f3n, the exclusive licensee. The lighting fixture is shown in the following cross-sectional figure:</p>\n<p id=\"pAMAS\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">The four claims of the '875 patent are:</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">1. A cornice type lighting fixture comprising a light source housing, a light transmitting panel, and a light source in said housing, said panel including a pair of lens sections disposed in approximately right angular and spaced relation for controlled multiple directional concentrated light transmission, one of said lens sections being at least generally remote from said source, a translucent display section intermediate said lens sections for illumination of a display forming a part thereof, said display section being of an area which is substantially greater than the area of either of said lens sections, and means on said display section for detachably mounting a display thereover, said housing including light reflective inner surface portions arranged to direct light from said source at least to said display section and remote lens section.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">2. The fixture of claim 1 wherein said display section is of arcuate configuration with said display mounting means arranged along opposite margins thereof for retention of a display against the outer surface of said display section in arcuately conforming relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-16\">3. The fixture of claim 1 wherein said panel is of generally U-shape longitudinally thereof and projects from said housing, said lens sections being provided with means attaching said panel to said housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">4. The fixture of claim 1 wherein said housing includes a specular inner surface portion and a light diffusing inner surface portion, said specular surface portion being arranged for the reflection of light toward said remote lens section and said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>diffusing surface portion being arranged for the reflection of light toward said display section.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Appendix, at 31; Claims of Utility Patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The design patent, Des. No. 201,380 (hereinafter \u201c \u2019380 patent\u201d or \u201cdesign patent\u201d), was applied for on February 14, 1963, after the utility patent application, and issued on June 15, 1965, before issuance of the utility patent, for a term of fourteen years. Again, the named inventor was Norbert Schwenkler and Patent License was the as-signee and Guit\u00f3n the exclusive licensee. The fixture is shown in the following figures:</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">The sole claim of the \u2019380 patent is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">The ornamental design for a lighting fixture, as shown and described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-11\">Appendix, at 32; Claim of Design Patent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">In the mid-1970\u2019s Transmatic began to manufacture a lighting fixture similar to those covered by these patents. Guit\u00f3n learned of this development and sought to persuade potential Transmatic customers that Transmatic\u2019s fixtures would infringe upon Gulton\u2019s patents. This led to Trans-matic\u2019s filing of this lawsuit seeking a declaration that the \u2019875 patent was invalid and not infringed by Transmatic\u2019s lighting fixtures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-15\">After considerable discovery, Transmatic moved the district court to enter summary judgment in its favor declaring the \u2019875 patent invalid. Transmatic argued that the \u2019875 constituted double patenting of the later filed but earlier issued \u2019380 patent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>The district court agreed, entered summary judgment in Transmatic\u2019s favor and entered an order declaring the \u2019875 patent invalid. The significance of invalidating the \u2019875 patent stems from its longer term, as a utility patent, of seventeen years, which extends to October 1982.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The term of the earlier issued and unchallenged \u2019380 patent, as a design patent, is only fourteen years, which extends\u2019 only to June 1979.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Guit\u00f3n and Patent License appeal, arguing that the \u2019875 patent is not invalid for double patenting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">' We initially address appellants\u2019 argument that the rule against double patenting has no application when comparing utility and design patents. Noting the separate statutory authorizations for the two types of patents (35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 &amp; 171), they argue that applying double patenting principles in this context would run afoul of the rule of statutory construction that separate statutory enactments should be given their full effect. They further note that Congress has created four devices to protect intellectual and industrial property \u2014 copyright, trademark,, design patent and utility patent. They argue that just as copyright registration of an ornamental design has been held not to bar a design patent on the identical design, Application. <em>of Yardley, </em>493 F.2d 1389, 1393-94 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a design patent on the configuration of a bottle has been held not to bar trademark registration of the same bottle, <em>Application of Mogen David Wine Corp., </em>328 F.2d 925, 51 CCPA 1260 (1964), so should a design patent be held not to bar a utility patent on the identical invention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In sum, they contend the four Congressionally created protections are mutually exclusive so that double patenting would apply only when comparing two utility patents or two design patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">This argument is not insubstantial. There is some support for this position in <em>Gross v. Norris, </em>18 F.2d 418, 420 (D.Md.1927), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, on other grounds, </em>26 F.2d 898 (4th Cir. 1928). The argument has been expressly rejected, however, by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. <em>Application of Thorington, </em>418 F.2d 528, 535-37, 57 CCPA 759 (1969), <em>cert. den. </em>397 U.S. 1038, 90 S.Ct. 1356, 25 L.Ed.2d 649 (1970), <em>citing cases.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We elect to follow the CCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">The CCPA conceded in <em>Thorington </em>that there is no statutory basis for applying double patenting principles in the design vs. utility context, as there is when comparing utility patents or design patents.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, the rule in this context is based upon a judicially recognized doctrine that a holder of a patent may not extend the term of his patent beyond that permitted by law. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>accept this reasoning and hold that the rule against double patenting applies in the utility vs. design context.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Having decided that double patenting applies to this case, its application is no easy task. The judicially created rule against double patenting is of long standing. <em>See Miller v. Eagle Mfg. Co., </em>151 U.S. 186, 14 S.Ct. 310, 38 L.Ed.2d 121 (1894), <em>citing cases. </em>But the issue almost always arises in cases involving either two utility patents or, less frequently, two designs patents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> One recent case involving utility and design patents is <em>Ropat Corp. v. McGraw-Edison Co., </em>535 F.2d 378 (7th Cir. 1976), wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">The patent laws, of course, provide that a design patent and a utility patent may well be issued on the same construction. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 (utility), 171 (design). However, each such patent must claim a separate, distinct patentable invention. <em>In re Barber, </em>81 F.2d 231 [23 CCPA 834] (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1936).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">In order to determine whether the \u201csame invention\u201d is claimed in two patents, their claims must be compared to determine whether they define the same subject matter. <em>Application of Vogel, </em>422 F.2d 438, 441, 57 C.C.P.A. 920 (1970). And when the double patenting situation involves a design patent and a utility patent, we recognize that it is \u201cnot easy to compare utility word claims with design picture claims in determining if the \u2018same invention\u2019 is being claimed.\u201d <em>Application of Swett, </em>451 F.2d 631, 635, 59 C.C.P.A. 726 (1971). In comparing their claims, the mere use of the same design claimed in the design patent as the vehicle for describing the utility claimed in the utility patent is not dispositive. <em>Anchor Hocking Corp. v. Eyelet Specialty Company, </em>377 F.Supp. 98, 101 (D.Del.1974); <em>Appel v. Lilling, </em>60 F.Supp. 749 (S.D.N.Y.1945).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-10\">The law of double patenting in the precise situation where a design patent and a utility patent are involved is plagued by a dearth of case law. A review of the cases which do exist reveals various \u201ctests\u201d for determining whether a design patent and a utility patent claim the \u201csame invention.\u201d We believe the best formulation of the applicable standard in this situation is that set forth in such decisions as <em>In re Hargraves, </em>53 F.2d 900 [19 CCPA 784] (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1931), and <em>Application of DuBois, </em>262 F.2d 88, 46 C.C.P.A. 744 (1958). Those cases state that double patenting exists if the feature in which the novel esthetic effect resides is the identical feature which produces the novel function so that a structure embodying the mechanical invention would of necessity embody the design, and vice versa. See also <em>In re Barber, supra, </em>81 F.2d at 232; <em>In re Phe-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number><em>lan, </em>205 F.2d 183, 184, 40 C.C.P.A. 1023 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">535 F.2d at 381-82 (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">While the court in <em>Ropat </em>reached a different result than we do today, we agree with the above principles and adopt them as governing in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The \u2019875 patent has no single feature but rather a combination of features which produce its novel function. The question for decision thus becomes: is the feature in which the novel aesthetic effect resides in the \u2019380 patent identical to the features which produce the novel function in the \u2019875 patent so that a structure embodying the mechanical invention would of necessity embody the design, and vice versa? And since a patent is measured by its claims, <em>see Scharmer v. Carrollton Mfg. Co., </em>525 F.2d 95, 101 (6th Cir. 1975), the question could alternatively be phrased: would a device' embodying the claims of the \u2019875 patent necessarily embody the claim of the \u2019380 patent, and vice versa? We think the answer to both questions is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">The critical essence of the subject of a design patent is its distinctive appearance. It is \u201cthe effect upon the eye\u201d which controls. <em>Gorham Co. v. White, </em>81 U.S. (14 Wall.) 511, 526, 20 L.Ed. 731 (1871); <em>Thabet Mfg. Co. v. Kool Vent Metal Awning Corp., </em>226 F.2d 207, 212 (6th Cir. 1955). A design patent can be based only upon visible characteristics; it cannot be based upon elements which are concealed during normal use. <em>Application of Cornwall, </em>230 F.2d 457, 459, 43 CCPA 824 (1956). The appearance of the \u2019380 patent is best set forth in the figures reproduced above, <em>ante </em>at p. 908, but it can be verbally described as follows: two similarly sized rectangular lens panels at right angles to one another, the lower lens in a horizontal plane and the upper lens in a vertical plane, each lens connected by a concave display panel which is larger than either lens panel and which has slots in which advertising may be placed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">, This same appearance would seem to necessarily result from a lighting fixture which embodied the claims of the \u2019875 patent. Claim 1 of the \u2019875 patent provides, in part: \u201ca cornice type lighting fixture comprising a light source housing, a light transmitting panel, . . said panel including a pair of lens sections disposed in approximately right angular and spaced relation . . , a . display section intermediate said lens sections . . . , said display section being of an area which is substantially greater than the area of either of said lens sections, and means on said display section for detachably mounting a display thereover . .\u201d Claim 2 of the \u2019875 patent reads: \u201cThe fixture of claim 1 wherein said display section is of arcuate configuration with said display mounting means arranged along opposite margins thereof for retention of a display against the outer surface of said display section in arcuately conforming relation.\u201d We think <em>these portions </em>of the \u2019875 patent claims define the same thing that is defined in the \u2019380 patent claim, and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">But the \u2019875 patent has additional claims, concerning the location of the light source, the reflective (specular) backing, the translucent display panel and the like, which are not claimed in the \u2019380 patent and which would not necessarily be embodied in the device disclosed in the \u2019380 patent. In other words, a device embodying the claims of the \u2019875 patent might necessarily embody the claim of the \u2019380 patent, but <em>not </em>vice versa. A lighting fixture which embodied the claims of the \u2019875 patent would look like the lighting fixture claimed in the \u2019380 patent, but a lighting fixture which looks like that claimed in the \u2019380 patent would of necessity embody only some, not all, of the claims of the \u2019875 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-18\">Concededly,- Figure 3 of the \u2019875 patent, <em>ante </em>at p. 908, and Figure 2 of the \u2019380 patent, <em>ante </em>at p. 907, but for the patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>reference numerals in the former, are mirror images of each other.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But, as stated earlier, \u201cthe mere use of the same design claimed in the design patent as the vehicle for describing the utility claimed in the utility patent is not dispositive.\u201d <em>Ropat, supra, </em>535 F.2d at 381. Similarly, the mere use of the same figure depicted in the utility patent as the vehicle for depicting the design claimed in the design patent is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The principal error in the district court\u2019s analysis was attributing more to the design patent than it actually did, or could, claim. All that can be claimed in a design patent is appearance, so the \u2019380 patent could only claim the outer shell of the fixture depicted in Figure <em>2 </em>\u2014 viz., the lens panels and display section. Indeed, the \u2019380 patent specifications state: \u201cThe dominant features of my design reside in the portions shown in full lines.\u201d The interior portions of the fixture in Figure 2, including the lighting source (and its location), the backing, and the means for attaching the lens panels to the housing, are shown in dotted lines.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> They simply were not and could not be a part of the claim of the \u2019380 patent. The district court erred in so considering them. <em>See </em>442 F.Supp. at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The district court reasoned in the alternative that even if all of Figure 2 were not claimed in the \u2019380 patent it would be so treated if \u201cthe balance of the illustration aside from the lens panel is so obvious that it is implied in any event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 915. We agree that a design patent could be treated as claiming items necessarily implied even if not expressly claimed, but we disagree that such occurred here. We realize that since the \u2019380 patent was titled \u201clighting fixture,\u201d \u201cit readily appears that a lighting source was required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 916. But nothing is readily apparent about the <em>location </em>of the lighting source or the type of bulb to be used.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And we disagree that \u201cit readily appears . . . that the fixture would have a back which would be a reflective surface.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It might seem more likely that such a backing would be reflective but this can hardly be said to be necessarily implied from the mere design. It could well be the case that some might think a reflective backing produced a too harsh lighting effect. The means for attaching the lens panels to the housing are also not necessarily implied from the depiction of the lens panels alone. Nor is the peculiar shape of the backing noted in the \u2019875 patent necessarily implied merely from the lens panels alone.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Finally, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>not necessarily implied from the \u2019380 patent that its display section would be translucent, as is expressly claimed in Claim 1 of the \u2019875 patent; it could be transparent or opaque.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">It is apparent that both patents at issue in this cause relate to the same general purpose, <em>viz., </em>illumination of mass transit coaches. It is equally apparent that it was contemplated that the lens panels and display section covered by the \u2019380 patent would be used with the overall fixture covered by the \u2019875 patent. But they are not for the \u201csame invention.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201ca design patent and a utility patent may well be issued on the same construction.\u201d <em>Ropat, supra, </em>535 F.2d at 381; <em>Dubois, supra, </em>262 F.2d at 90. The claims of the \u2019875 patent and the \u2019380 patent do not \u201ccross-read,\u201d as this circuit requires to demonstrate double . patenting. <em>Preformed Line Products Co. v. Fanner Mfg. Co., </em>328 F.2d 265, 269 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. den. </em>379 U.S. 846, 85 S.Ct. 56,13 L.Ed.2d 51 (1964).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">There is a heavy burden of proof on one seeking to show double patenting, <em>TSC Industries, Inc. v.

Appellants, of course, do not concede that their design and utility patents are for the identical invention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b997-16\">. <em>Thorington </em>was expressly followed by the CCPA in <em>Application of Swett, </em>451 F.2d 631, 635, 59 CCPA 726 (1971), and was implicitly followed by the seventh circuit in <em>Ropat Corp. v. McGraw-Edison Co., </em>535 F.2d 378, 380-81 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b997-17\">. The statutory basis for the rule in the utility vs. utility or design vs. design context stems from a construction of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (\u201cmay obtain a [utility] patent\u201d) and \u00a7 171 (\u201cmay obtain a [design] patent\u201d). 418 F.2d at 536.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b998-8\">. If we wrote on a clean slate, we might not ultimately agree with appellants\u2019 position but we would give it more credence than did the CCPA in <em>Thorington. </em>We feel constrained, however, to follow the CCPA\u2019s holding due to the unique position of that court in the overall scheme of patent law. Generally speaking, the CCPA reviews the decisions of the Patent Office\u2019s Board of Appeals relative to the issuance of patents. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 134 &amp; 141. So long as the CCPA denies the issuance of a design patent based upon double patenting of a prior utility patent, and vice versa, the second patent should never issue if full disclosure is made to the Patent Office and the CCPA and if the second patent is susceptible to a double patenting charge. Thus, if we were to hold that double patenting does not apply when comparing design and utility patents, we would encourage less than full disclosure before the Patent Office and CCPA. This could yield the anomalous result of our sanctioning a patent issued only because of deception. We choose to avoid this unseemly confrontation with the CCPA. We leave to the Supreme Court any eventual holding that double patenting does not apply in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b998-12\">. Our research has disclosed no sixth circuit cases or Supreme Court cases comparing utility and design patents. <em>Cf. Preformed Line Products Co. v. Fanner Mfg. Co., </em>328 F.2d 265 (6th Cir.), cert. <em>den. </em>379 U.S. 846, 85 S.Ct. 56, 13 L.Ed.2d 51 (1964) (two utility patents).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\">.

Being a design patent, the only claim of the \u2019380 patent is its \u201cornamental design . . as shown and described.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">. The appendix to the district court\u2019s opinion, 442 F.Supp. at 919, is an altered version' of Figure 3 of the \u2019875 patent and Figure 2 of the \u2019380 patent. Unfortunately, the district court did not disclose the fact that the drawings were slightly altered. Transmatic\u2019s brief to this court has reproduced the appendix to the district court\u2019s opinion, but with a proper disclosure that it was altered. Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 4-5. The patent reference numerals have been removed from Figure 3 of the \u2019875 patent and Claim 1 of the \u2019875 patent has been broken down into separately numbered clauses which correlate to the numerals which have been added to each figure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">. Dotted lines are used in patent drawings to show immaterial parts or the environment of the claimed invention. <em>Application of Blum, </em>374 F.2d 904, 907 &amp; n. 1, 54 CCPA 1231 (1967); <em>Application of Wise, </em>340 F.2d 982, 983-84, 52 CCPA 936 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">. The importance of the location of the lighting source <em>(viz., </em>\u201cgenerally remote from\u201d one of the lens panels) to the \u2019875 patent is demonstrated by the fact that the Patent Office Examiner rejected Claim 1 of the patent (as encompassed in Claim 4 of the patent application) as unpatentable until the applicant added, <em>inter alia, </em>the words \u201cone of said lens sections being at least generally remove from said source.\u201d Appendix, at 49-55. While appellants may have overstated their case in asserting that the light source location was the \u201cessential feature\u201d of the \u2019875 patent, it is correct to say it was an important feature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">. While the peculiar shape of the backing is not expressly claimed in the \u2019875 patent claims, it is suggested in the last clause of Claim 1\u2014 \u201csaid housing including light reflective inner surface portions arranged to direct light from said source at least to said display section and remote lens section.\u201d Moreover, the shape of the backing is shown in Figure 3 and the claims of a patent are to be read in light of the specifications and drawings. <em>Tillotson Mfg. v. Textron, Inc., </em>337 F.2d 833, 838 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">. It would seem more likely that the display section transmit some light in order to illuminate the advertisements placed thereupon, but that only narrows the choice to either transparent or translucent. Moreover, it could well be that the case that such rear illumination was considered either ineffective or not aesthetically pleasing, making an opaque surface preferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">. Nor is the later issued utility patent an \u201cobvious variation\u201d of the design patent. <em>Application of Driscoll, </em>562 F.2d 1245, 1251 (CCPA 1977); <em>Application of Vogel, </em>422 F.2d 438, 440-41, 57 CCPA 920 (1970); <em>Application of Thor-ington, </em>418 F.2d 528, 534, 57 CCPA 759 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">. While <em>Preformed Line Products </em>was a utility vs. utility double patenting case, its principles are equally applicable here on this point. The district court erred in relying on cases from other circuits which do not require that claims cross-read in order to establish double patenting. 422 F.Supp. at 916, <em>citing Tidewater Patent Development Co. v. Kitchen, </em>371 F.2d 1004 (4th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. den. </em>389 U.S. 821, 88 S.Ct. 46, 19 L.Ed.2d 74 (1967) and <em>Application of Zickendraht, </em>319 F.2d 225, 50 CCPA 1529 (1963), both of which were utility vs. utility double patenting cases. <em>Compare Application of Stanley, </em>214 F.2d 151, 155, 41 CCPA 956 (1954) claims of patents must cross-read to establish double patenting).</p>\n<p id=\"A1T\">\u201cThe district courts in this circuit are, of course, bound by pertinent decisions of this Court even if they find what they consider more persuasive authority in other circuits.\u201d <em>Timmreck v.
