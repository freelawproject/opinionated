Section 1988 places the award of such fees within the trial court\u2019s discretion but it is settled law in this circuit that this means more than it appears to say and that such prevailing parties as plaintiff should ordinarily recover attorneys\u2019 fees unless special circumstances would render an award of them unjust. See <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284, 1300 (5th Cir. 1978). We cannot determine from this record or from the court\u2019s brief reference to inappropriateness why fees were denied. We therefore vacate the court\u2019s order of denial and remand for an appropriate award of fees or for a finding on and statement of the special circumstances which render such an award unjust. See <em>Criterion Club v. Board of Comm\u2019rs, </em>594 F.2d 118 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
