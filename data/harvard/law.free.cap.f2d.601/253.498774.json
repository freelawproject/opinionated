Hill, et al., appeal from a judgment entered by District Judge L. Clure Morton, Chief Judge of the Middle District of Tennessee, which granted the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s petition for enforcement of certain subpoenas issued against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">While we note appellants\u2019 contentions that the IRS is basically seeking to track down \u201cfinders fees\u201d and/or \u201cbribes\u201d which may have been paid by one or both of two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Hospital Corporation of America, which subsidiaries appellants claim to be entirely exempt from United States Federal income tax provisions, we also note that District Judge Morton specifically determined that \u201cdefendants are not required to answer any questions relating to the so-called \u2018slush fund,\u2019 the government having abandoned these questions,\u201d and that this issue is not before this court at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">We further note no meritorious issue which requires this court\u2019s intervention in the IRS investigation on behalf of taxpayers at this point because they plainly have mistaken their remedy which under clear statutory enactment requires responding to the subpoenas and raising such meritorious issues as they may have by refusing to answer specific questions (which, of course, may be followed by the government seeking contempt adjudication in the District Court, with the possibility of subsequent appeal to this court). <em>See Reisman v. Caplin, </em>375 U.S. 440, 84 S.Ct. 508, 11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-17\">Now, therefore, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
