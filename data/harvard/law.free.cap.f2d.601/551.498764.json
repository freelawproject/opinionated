Fritz, </em>572 F.2d 856, 196 USPQ 600 (1978). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-20\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">The single count in interference is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-22\">1. A method for the inhibition of plant growth which comprises applying thereto an effective amount of 2-chloroe-thylphosphonic aeid.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-23\">As we outlined in the prior <em>Weil v. Fritz, </em>the chronology of applications is thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-24\">Party Fritz Party Weil</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-25\">Application Serial No. 617,860 (hereinafter Fritz I) filed February 23, 1967; abandoned December 1, 1969 applicants: Fritz and Evans</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Party Fritz Party Weil</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Application Serial No. 693,698 (hereinafter Fritz II) filed December 27, 1967; abandoned April 2, 1970 continuation-in-part of Fritz I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">applicants: Fritz and Evans (amendment approved March 27, 1970 adding Cooke as joint inventor)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Application Serial No. 826,653 filed May 21, 1969</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">Application Serial No. 869,386 (hereafter Fritz III) filed October 24, 1969 continuation-in-part of Fritz II applicants: Fritz, Evans, and Cooke</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">Application Serial No. 221,803 (Fritz IV) filed January 28, 1972 division of Fritz III applicants: Fritz, Evans, and Cooke</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">When the case was last here, we disposed of a number of preliminary questions and remanded to the board so that it could specifically consider whether the Fritz II application set forth a disclosure of the best mode contemplated by the inventor at the filing date of that application. Additionally, the board was to consider, for completeness, the sufficiency of various proofs regarding reduction to practice by Fritz et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Since we affirm the holding of the board on the best mode issue, we do not find it necessary to discuss or reach the latter questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">\n<em>Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">Weil argued before the board that Fritz II fails the \u201cbest mode\u201d test of \u00a7 112 because of Fritz\u2019 failure to refer to the pH sensitivity of 2-CEPA. It appears to be necessary that 2-CEPA remain in solution if it is to perform the function recited in the count. The compound will prematurely decompose, with production of ethylene gas, if the solution is not maintained in a sufficiently acidic condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-20\">The board considered the record to be clear in establishing that the Fritz parties in interest knew of the pH sensitivity of 2-CEPA prior to the filing of Fritz II. One of the Fritz coinventors, Dr. Cooke, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-21\">RXQ2. When did you first observe that 2-chloroethyl phosphonic acid tends to decompose in solutions which have a pH of about 4.5 or above? A. First observations of this were within two months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-22\">RXQ3. Within two months of what? A. I can give you the date, but it would be within two months. It would have been around November of 1965, December of 1965. I can\u2019t give you an exact date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">Similarly, Mr. Bishop, Director of the Agricultural Chemicals Laboratory of Am-chem, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-24\">ZQ12. Again with reference to Exhibit 20, do you know if Mr. Hart tried any basic or alkaline solution? A. We were aware of stability problems if the pH got above 3V2 to 4, so we avoided any alkaline solutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-25\">XQ13. You were aware of this in the time period of \u201966 and \u201967 when Mr. Hart was doing his formulation work? A. Yes. We were aware of that pretty early in the game.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-26\">Fritz argued before the board that Examples 35 and 42 of Fritz II <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were examples specifically setting forth the best mode. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Weil took the position that the best mode could not be determined from these examples in that no concentration of 2-CEPA is provided therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The board considered it proper to read the application rates of those examples in light of the preferred range of concentration found in the specification <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and thereby derive the exemplified concentration (or at least a range of possible concentrations). The most dilute solution obtainable within the specification\u2019s preferred range was calculated to be 600 ppm 2-CEPA and that of the two examples to be 1200 ppm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Weil argued that the use of alkaline water<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in mixing the compositions as used might well result in a pH in excess of that known by Fritz to be useful. The board considered the testimony of Weil\u2019s own witness, Dr. Tseng, adequate to rebut that contention. Dr. Tseng testified on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">Q. For instance, did you run a pH test using 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid at 250 per million? A. 250?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Q. 250. A. I think so; 250, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">Q. What was the pH of the resulting solution of 250 parts per million 2-chloro-ethylphosphonic acid in water? A. About 3.5, or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">Q. Did you run a pH evaluation involving 500 parts per million 2-chloro-ethylphosphonic acid in water? A. I personally did not, the chlor acid itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">Q. Acid? A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">Q. Did you run a pH evaluation where 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid was present in an amount greater than 250 parts per million water? A. I did not. I don\u2019t believe I measured larger than 250 parts per million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">Q. You just testified that when you ran a pH evaluation of 250 parts per million 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid in the water that the pH of that solution was 3.1. I believe that is your testimony. A. About 3.5. I don\u2019t exactly remember the number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">Q. What was the pH of the water that you used in that experiment? A. The pH of the water was approximately 8.4, something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-14\">Q. Where there is a solution of 500 parts per million of 2-chloroethylphos-phonic acid in water, isn\u2019t it correct that the pH would be less than 3.5? A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-15\">Q. And where there is a solution of a thousand parts per million of 2-chloro-ethylphosphonic acid in water, wouldn\u2019t that solution be, the pH of that even less than the pH of the 500 parts per million solution? A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The board then concluded that the derived \u201clowest possible\u201d 1200 ppm concentration of the examples would have a value below the apparently critical pH limit of 3.5 as would any solution of 2-CEPA within the preferred range disclosed in Fritz II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The board indicated that, in its view, the party Weil had the burden of proof in showing that Fritz et al. had concealed (intentionally or otherwise) the best mode for carrying out the invention. Since Weil did not sustain his burden pursuant to 37 CFR 1.257(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> priority of invention was awarded to Fritz.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The statute, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, paragraph one, requires that \u201c[t]he specification * * * shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.\u201d This court has steadfastly followed the general rule that any party making the assertion that a U.S. patent specification or claims fails, for one reason or another, to comply with \u00a7 112 bears the burden of persuasion in showing said lack of compliance. <em>See In re Morehouse, </em>545 F.2d 162, 192 USPQ 29 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App. 1976); <em>In re Ghiron, </em>442 F.2d 985, 58 CCPA 1207, 169 USPQ 723 (1971); <em>In re Marzocchi, </em>439 F.2d 220, 58 CCPA 1069, 169 USPQ 387 (1971); <em>In re Cook, </em>439 F.2d 730, 58 CCPA 1049, 169 USPQ 298 (1971); <em>In re Moore, </em>439 F.2d 1232, 58 CCPA 1043, 169 USPQ 236 (1971). We see no reason to vary from this general rule when the subject is \u201cbest mode.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Weil argues, in essence, that Fritz\u2019 prior appreciation of the pH sensitivity of 2-CEPA solutions and the potential adverse impact of that sensitivity on the successful practice of the method in the count coupled with complete silence regarding pH constitutes a substantial showing that Fritz II does not disclose the \u201cbest mode\u201d contemplated by the inventors.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">We do not agree. We have, on various occasions, observed that an applicant, in drafting an application, may choose any method he deems desirable in portraying essential information so long as that method fulfills the description<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and enablement<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, paragraph one. It is not up to this court to state <em>how </em>the applicant displays his information, but only, under proper circumstances, to review <em>whether </em>he has done so adequately under the statute. So it should be with the \u201cbest mode\u201d requirement. In our view, the inventors of Fritz II have merely selected a particular form of clearly relaying all the information (concentration and dosage in an aqueous solution), pertinent and necessary, to one having ordinary skill in the art concerning the particular embodiment which was contemplated to be the \u201cbest mode.\u201d The board found it reasonable to read the preferred ranges disclosed in the specification into the two noted examples and thereby derive that \u201cbest mode.\u201d Appellees argue in their brief that even this is not necessary \u2014 that the mere disclosure of a particular range of concentrations as \u201cpreferred\u201d is sufficient. In this case, we agree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s well-argued contention that pH sensitivity of 2-CEPA solutions is fatal to such a broad disclosure of the \u201cbest mode\u201d is not persuasive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>as can be determined from this record, each composition reasonably within the preferred ranges of the specification is stable and fully capable of effectuating the result recited in the count.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Enumeration of possible problems, while desirable, is not absolutely essential unless such a nondisclosure strikes at the truthfulness of the presumption that the \u201cmode\u201d described is indeed the \u201cbest\u201d contemplated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not think such to be the case here. The method of disclosing the \u201cbest mode\u201d appears to be no more than an equivalent to the pH method argued by appellants. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\n<em>Taxation of Cost</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Appellants ask that the cost of printing 431 out of the total 609 pages of the printed transcript be assessed to the appellees under Rule 5.6(c) of this court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellees argue that under Court Rule 1.4(a),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rule 39(a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP) should apply and all costs taxed against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">Our rules deal adequately with this situation and, accordingly, recourse to the FRAP is not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">We agree with appellant that the noted addition to the record was not necessary for the purposes of his appeal. Appellees are rearguing the issue of reduction to practice which they lost below. The addition to the record was useful only in support of appellees\u2019 position and appellees should therefore pay for the addition to the record. <em>Meitzner v.
