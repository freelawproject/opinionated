We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Waite faced both state and federal, charges arising from the two bank robberies. In the state proceeding, Waite entered a plea bargain whereby he was promised a lenient sentence to be served in federal, not state, prison if he pleaded guilty in state court and promised to plead guilty in federal court. The state trial judge was fully aware of the elements of the bargain, and the state sentence conformed to the bargain. Waite\u2019s state sentence was to run concurrently with whatever federal sentence was imposed, and his state time was to be served in federal prison. At the time of sentencing the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">The sentence you will receive is conditioned upon your entering a plea to the Federal charges, in Federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">Waite now claims that his guilty plea in federal court was coerced by the state judge\u2019s implied threat that a harsher state sentence would result if Waite did not enter the federal guilty plea. We do not accept Waite\u2019s argument. He entered both pleas with the assistance of counsel and after appropriate inquiry and admonition by both the state and federal judges. Although it is possible that Waite may have believed that a harsher state sentence would be imposed if he chose to plead \u201cnot guilty\u201d in federal court, we do not consider this to be unconstitutional coercion. <em>Cf. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 365, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (Prosecutor\u2019s confronting defendant with \u201cthe unpleasant alternatives\u201d of pleading guilty or facing trial on the maximum charges held not violative of the fourteenth amendment\u2019s due process clause.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">Waite also claims that the government did not keep promises made in the course of federal plea bargaining. He asks us either to vacate his sentence or, at least, to order an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The record, established by affidavits from Waite, FBI agents and Waite\u2019s former counsel, reveals that the government made no promises to ask for a light sentence as Waite alleges in his \u00a7 2255 petition. At most,-the record suggests that FBI agents speculated as to what Waite\u2019s \u201cprobable\u201d sentence would be. In view of the absence of any evidence of broken government promises and in view of Waite\u2019s own statements at the time he entered the plea that he was under no promises or threats, we see no reason to grant an evidentiary hearing and no merit to his substantive claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
