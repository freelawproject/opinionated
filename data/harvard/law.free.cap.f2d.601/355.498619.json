The railroad claimed that the collision resulted from decedent\u2019s negligent inattention or deliberate attempt to commit suicide. The jury returned a verdict for the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On appeal Rasmussen challenges several evidentiary rulings made by the trial court, the trial court\u2019s refusal to take the negligence issue from the jury, and the trial court\u2019s failure to give a jury instruction even though counsel never requested the instruction. Having carefully reviewed the records, briefs, and trial transcript we conclude no error of law appears. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 14(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
