The district court found that appellant had failed to comply with a state statute which required him to appeal the County\u2019s denial of his claim within thirty days of receiving notice of that denial, that such failure would constitute a bar to his action in state court, and thus was a bar to his federal diversity action. We find no error in such ruling and affirm the dismissal of the appellant\u2019s action on the opinion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
