Appellant is an adult adoptee seeking to obtain the medical history of his natural parents and their forebears. Judgment dismissing his complaint was granted by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Mark A. Costan-tino, Judge. <em>Rhodes v. Laurino, </em>444 F.Supp. 170 (E.D.N.Y.1978). We have upheld the statute against a broadbased attack on its facial validity in <em>Alma Society v. Mellon, </em>601 F.2d 1225, handed down herewith. We affirm Judge Costantino\u2019s opinion dismissing the complaint insofar as it seeks to obtain a ruling as to unconstitutionality as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">The statute in question permits an adop-tee to obtain access to his sealed adoption records \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Appellant wrote to the Deputy Chief Clerk of the Queens County Surrogate\u2019s Court requesting to be apprised of the proper procedure to obtain information about his natural parents; the clerk advised that medical information <em>could </em>be disclosed upon evidence from competent medical authority that it was <em>urgently </em>needed. Appellant submitted a letter from a doctor to the effect that \u201csome ailments (e.g. cardiac) do not permit for court petitions upon an attack\u2019s unexpected occurrence, and any time delay might well prove fatal or seriously disabling to the patient.\u201d Someone in the Surrogate\u2019s Court told appellant that the doctor\u2019s letter was insufficient. He then requested advice as to how he \u201cmight seek review of the Surrogate\u2019s administrative decision,\u201d and someone suggested that he obtain counsel. Finally, after unsuccessfully seeking to obtain the desired information from the records of the hospital where he was born,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>appellant filed a petition with the Surrogate\u2019s Court on December 20, 1976. The petition, however, was returned to him without a hearing and with a cover letter from a law assistant stating that it did not meet the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement of the statute. Appellant then brought suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">We recognize appellant\u2019s impatience with a system that seemingly permits law assistants to the Surrogate to decide what does or does not constitute \u201cgood cause,\u201d but we must find that the case is not ripe because the Surrogate\u2019s Court itself has not determined the issue adversely to him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant should file his petition again and seek a hearing thereon. If the court itself refuses to hear him, <em>Mendez v. Heller, </em>530 F.2d 457, 461 (2d Cir. 1976) (Oakes, J., concurring opinion), or its clerical or legal personnel continue to refuse to accept his petition for filing, <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), a complaint such as the one now filed may then state a federal claim that is ripe for relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also Berrigan v. Norton, </em>451 F.2d 790 (2d Cir. 1971) (prisoner attempting to publish a sermon did not present a justiciable case or controversy absent a showing of rejection by the warden).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">. N.Y.Dom.Rel.Law \u00a7 114 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-8\">If satisfied that the best interests of the adoptive child will be promoted thereby the judge or surrogate shall make an order approving the adoption and directing that the adoptive child shall thenceforth be regarded and treated in all respects as the child of the adoptive parents or parent. . . . Such order shall contain the full name, date and place of birth and reference to the schedule annexed to the petition containing the medical history of the child in the body thereof and may direct that the child\u2019s medical history be furnished to the adoptive parent. . Such order and all the papers in the proceeding shall be filed in the office of the court granting the adoption and the order shall be entered in books which shall be kept under seal and which shall be indexed by the name of the adoptive parents and by the full original name of the child. Such order, including orders heretofore entered, shall be subject to inspection and examination only as hereinafter provided. ... If the confidentiality is violated, the person or company violating it can be found guilty of contempt of court. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-10\">No person, including the attorney for the adoptive parents shall disclose the surname of the child directly or indirectly to the adoptive parents except upon order of the court. No person shall be allowed access to such sealed records and order and any index thereof except upon an order of a judge or surrogate of the court in which the order was made or of a justice of the supreme court. No order for disclosure or access and inspection shall be granted except on good cause shown and on due notice to the adoptive parents and to such additional persons as the court may direct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1328-13\">. The district court dismissed the complaint against Dorothy M. Dooley, the Director of the Adoption Department, New York Foundling Hospital. It found that the complaint failed to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because Dooley, as a private individual, was not acting in concern with state officials and was not performing a public function; nor was the challenged action compelled by \u201cthe state statute involved here \u2014 Dom.Rel.Law \u00a7 114 . .\u201d <em>Rhodes v. Laurino, </em>444 F.Supp. 170, 173 (E.D.N.Y.1978). Dooley\u2019s action was compelled, however, by N.Y.Soc.Serv.Law \u00a7 372 (McKinney) which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-14\">\u00a7 372. Records and reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-15\">4. All such records relating to such children shall be open to the inspection of the board and the department at any reasonable time, and the information called for under this section and such other data as may be required by the department shall be reported to the department, in accordance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>regulations of the department. Such records kept by the department shall be deemed confidential and shall be safeguarded from coming to the knowledge of and from inspection or examination by any person other than one authorized, by the department, by a judge of the court of claims when such records are required for the trial of a claim or other proceeding in such court or by a justice of the supreme court after a notice to all interested persons and a hearing, to receive such knowledge or to make such inspection or examination. No person shall divulge the information thus obtained without authorization so to do by the department, or by such judge or justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AavS\">Nevertheless we affirm the dismissal of the complaint against Dooley. Even assuming that Dooley was acting under color of state law by virtue of \u00a7 372, appellant has not made any showing that Dooley deprived him of his constitutional rights. He has not alleged that Dooley would have refused to supply the information had she been ordered to do so. Because it is not unconstitutional for the State to require a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d before authorizing the release of adoption information, <em>Alma Society v. Mellon, </em>601 F.2d 1225, it is, a fortiori, not unconstitutional for Dooley to refuse to disclose the information unless the court has found \u201cgood cause\u201d and ordered her to release the records. Accordingly, we affirm the lower court\u2019s opinion with respect to appellee Dooley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">. According to N.Y.Surr.Ct.Proc.Act \u00a7 2609 (3)(a) (McKinney), the Surrogate may \u201c[d]esig-nate the chief clerk, one of the other clerks, a law assistant or any assistant, to take and report the testimony in any proceeding, but without authority to pass upon the issue therein.\u201d In explaining this section, the Practice Commentary states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO7\">Subdivision 3(a) extends to the surrogate of all counties discretionary power to designate law clerks and law assistants to take and report testimony. Previously this authority was limited to the surrogates in the metropolitan counties and Erie County. <em>Such designated clerks and law assistants have no' power to determine any issues of fact or law. </em>That is the responsibility of the surrogate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a5m-dedup-0\">Practice Commentary accompanying N.Y.Surr.Ct.Proc.Act \u00a7 2609 (McKinney 1967) (emphasis added). Thus, although the law assistant to a Surrogate has a certain amount of authority, it does not include making a ruling on a petition such as Rhodes\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"asb-dedup-0\">. In the .event that the Surrogate Court rules unfavorably on Rhodes\u2019s petition, it is likely that this court would abstain from immediately hearing appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action. The validity of the statute as applied might well be dependent upon the New York courts\u2019 interpretation of \u201cgood cause,\u201d warranting abstention under <em>Railroad Comm\u2019n v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). <em>See McRed-mond v. Wilson, </em>533 F.2d 757, 760-64 (2d Cir. 1976). <em>But see Kusper v. Pontikes, </em>414 U.S. 51, 94 S.Ct. 302, 38 L.Ed.2d 260 (1973); <em>Lindsey v. Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 92 S.Ct. 862, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972); <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
