The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., (the Society) and William G. Ogle, president of the Society\u2019s Atlanta Branch, claim that the ordinance violates their first amendment rights. They sued the Atlanta chief of police for declaratory and injunc-tive relief; when the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia refused to grant a preliminary injunction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">The ordinance is not complex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Any person or organization wishing to distribute literature (\u00a7\u00a7 1, 3) or to solicit funds (\u00a7 11) at the Atlanta airport must obtain a permit from the Commissioner of Aviation. Appellants originally challenged the detailed provisions governing the grant and denial of permits, but since the appeal was filed Atlanta has amended the ordinance and modified the provisions to which appellants objected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This portion of the appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>claim is therefore moot. <em>See, e.g., Kre-mens v. Bartley, </em>431 U.S. 119, 129, 97 S.Ct. 1709, 52 L.Ed.2d 184 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The ordinance then divides the airport into five \u201careas\u201d and requires that the permit specify the' areas within which a permit holder may solicit funds and distribute literature. \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8,15,16. Certain parts of the airport \u2014 for example, \u201c[b]eyond the security check points,\u201d and \u201c[w]ithin ten (10) feet of any area leased exclusively to a tenant of the Airport,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 6(a), (c) and 14(a), (c) \u2014 are off limits in any event. The appellants do not challenge any of these provisions. But the ordinance goes on to provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axd-dedup-0\">The Commissioner may move such permitted activities from one area to another and among the different areas upon reasonable written notice to the applicant when in the judgment of the Commissioner such move or moves are necessary to the efficient and effective operation of the transportation function of the airport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">\u00a7 8. The ordinance also provides that if two or more persons or organizations seek to distribute literature or solicit funds at the same time, \u201cthe Commissioner shall apportion the available areas between or among them all on as equitable a basis as possible,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 8, 16. Moreover, the ordinance allows no more than three persons to solicit funds or distribute literature in any one \u201carea\u201d at the same time, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahx-dedup-0\">[wjhen the Commissioner receives more applications for permits than he is able to grant by following this rule, then he may impose such reasonable and equitable restrictions as to allowable dates or hours or numbers of participants as may reasonably be required to provide fair and as equal as possible opportunities for all applicants, while insuring the efficient and effective operation of the transportation function of the Airport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">\u00a7\u00a7 8, 16. The appellants claim that the vagueness of this language gives the Commissioner unconstitutionally broad discretion to deny and condition permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The ordinance also limits the activities of those who hold valid permits. The appellants challenge two of these limits. Section 9(a) specifies that no person may \u201cobstruct, delay or interfere with, or seek to coerce or physically disturb\u201d another person, or \u201champer or impede the conduct of any authorized business\u201d at the airport. Appellants charge that this provision is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Sections 9(c) and 16 impose a more novel restriction. Permit holders may distribute literature and proselytize throughout the area specified in their permit, but they may not \u201c[rjeceive or accept any donation of money\u201d, \u00a7 9(c), except at certain \u201c \u2018Solicitation Booths\u2019 which shall be furnished by the Commissioner . . . and shall be located within the permissible areas at such points as may be designated from time to time by the Commissioner\u201d \u00a7 16. The appellants say that the first amendment prohibits Atlanta from limiting the transfer of funds to certain locations in this fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Finally, any person convicted of violating these or other prohibitions contained in the ordinance loses his or her permit and right to distribute literature or to solicit funds in the Atlanta airport, and cannot receive another permit for twelve months. \u00a7 18(a), (c). Moreover, if persons \u201crepresenting\u201d a single organization, \u00a7 18(b), violate the ordinance a total of three times within six months, that organization loses any permit it holds and cannot reapply for twelve months. \u00a7 18(b), (c). The appellants challenge these penalty provisions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">In summary, then, the appellants raise five challenges: to the alleged vagueness of the rules permitting the Commissioner to move permit holders from one area to another; to the alleged vagueness of the criteria the Commissioner is to apply when allocating space among competing applicants; to the alleged vagueness and overbreadth of the provision prohibiting obstructing, interfering, and the like; to the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>that money be transferred only at specified solicitation booths; and to the penalty provisions,</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The district court found that the Society is a religious group within the meaning of the first amendment, and that the religion \u201cimposes on its members the duty to perform a religious ritual known as Sankirtan, which consists of soliciting and accepting donations and contributions while disseminating religious literature and information, all in public places.\u201d R. at 149. Neither of these findings is questioned by the appellee. Members of the Society have apparently obtained permits to distribute literature and to solicit funds in the Atlanta airport and are currently doing so. Apparently they are complying with all the provisions of the ordinance. Moreover, so far as we can tell from this record, no one has ever been charged with violating the ordinance, and it has never been applied or interpreted by any state court. Appellants\u2019 challenge to the various provisions of the Atlanta ordinance is, therefore, anticipatory in two senses; none of the provisions has actually been enforced against them, and they do not allege that they have yet engaged in any conduct punished or otherwise proscribed by the ordinance. Like most anticipatory challenges, appellants\u2019 suit raises serious questions of justiciability, and we must first decide which of their claims is justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Justiciability is a notably amorphous notion, \u201ca concept of uncertain meaning and scope.\u201d <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). It has at least two distinct components. One is jurisdictional, the Article III requirement that federal courts decide only \u201ccases\" and \"controversies.\" The other consists of \u201cpolicy considerations,\" <em>id. </em>at 97, 88 S.Ct. 1942, not specified in the Constitution but bearing on whether it is appropriate to permit a particular ease to be litigated in a federal court at a particular time. <em>See generally Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan, </em>406 U.S. 588, 588-89, 92 S.Ct. 1716, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1972). This component is \u201cnot always clearly distinguished from the constitutional limitation.\u201d <em>See Barrows v. Jackson, </em>346 U.S. 249, 255, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 1034, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The constitutional requirement of a case or controversy is rooted in <em>Marbury v. Madison, 5 </em>U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). It is an especially crucial limit on the power of a federal court faced with an anticipatory challenge like appellants\u2019. \u201cThe power and duty of the judiciary is in the final analysis derived from its responsibility for resolving concrete disputes brought before the courts for decision . . <em>Marbury v. Madison . </em>But this vital responsibility, broad as it is, does not amount to an unlimited power to survey the statute books and pass judgment on laws . . . <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 52, 91 S.Ct. 746, 754, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); <em>see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610-11, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) ; <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 178, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). In other words, a plaintiff must not be allowed to enlist the aid of a federal court in a general effort to purge unconstitutional measures from the body of the law. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Richardson, </em>418 U.S. 166, 173, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) ; <em>Boyle v. Landry, </em>401 U.S. 77, 81, 91 S.Ct. 758, 27 L.Ed.2d 696 (1971). To say this is not by any means to suggest that we should be hostile to anticipatory challenges; they play a most vital role in modern efforts to enforce constitutional rights. \u201cIt is not necessary that [a party] first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights,\" <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 459, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 1216, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974). But the premise of <em>Marbury v. Madison </em>requires us to insist that an anticipatory challenge to statute's constitutionality grow out of a \u201creal, substantial controversy between parties . , \u201e a dispute definite and concrete.\" <em>Babbitt v. UFW, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>- U.S. -, -, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2308, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979), <em>quoting Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, </em>326 U.S. 88, 93, 65 S.Ct. 1483, 89 L.Ed. 2072 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">In deciding whether such a dispute exists, courts have traditionally focused on each of the parties in turn. They have asked whether the plaintiff is seriously interested in disobeying, and the defendant seriously intent on enforcing, the challenged measure. Some courts have held that no case or controversy exists if either of these elements is missing. <em>See, e.g., Rincon Band of Mission Indians v. County of San Diego, </em>495 F.2d 1, 4-6 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1008, 95 S.Ct. 328, 42 L.Ed.2d 283 (1974). But we think the second aspect of this inquiry \u2014 focusing on the probability of enforcement \u2014 is relevant only to the non-jurisdictional, \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d underlying justiciability and not to the existence of a case or controversy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There are, to be sure, several important reasons for insisting on some significant likelihood that the defendant government will enforce the statute if it is violated. A defendant uninterested in enforcing a statute is less likely to provide a vigorous defense of its constitutionality, <em>see generally Poe v. Ullman, </em>367 U.S. 497, 501-02, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (plurality opinion); <em>see also Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 114, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1975); prosecutors should be permitted, and perhaps encouraged, to refuse to enforce unconstitutional laws, <em>see e.g., Ex parte La Prade, </em>289 U.S. 444, 458-59, 53 S.Ct. 682, 77 L.Ed. 1311 (1933); see <em>also Spomer v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 514, 94 S.Ct. 685, 38 L.Ed.2d 694 (1974); and for related educative reasons, challenges to laws that have fallen into disuse should be directed to the political branches, with the judiciary intervening only after the other branches reexamine and reaffirm such measures by resuming enforcement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But these do not appear to be jurisdictional arguments; they do not speak to the concerns of the premise derived from <em>Marbury v. Madison.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Indeed there is clear Supreme Court authority that the probability of enforcement is not relevant to a court\u2019s jurisdiction over an anticipatory challenge. <em>Epperson v. Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97, 89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968), was an appeal of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(2) from a state court\u2019s dismissal of an anticipatory challenge. The statute under attack prohibited public school teachers from teaching evolution. The Court noted that \u201c[t]here is no record of any prosecutions in Arkansas under its statute. It is possible that the statute is presently more a curiosity than a vital fact of life . . . .\" <em>Id. </em>at 101-02, 89 S.Ct. at 269. Nevertheless, the Court accepted jurisdiction and \u2014 apparently believing that \u00a7 1257(2) required it to decide all appeals of which it had jurisdiction and precluded it from denying review for \u201cpolicy\" rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>sons \u2014 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reversed on the merits. The Supreme Court, like every federal court, is of course limited by Article III. Thus <em>Epper-son </em>implicitly holds that the probability of a statute\u2019s being enforced, however important it is to the non-jurisdictional, \u201cpolicy\u201d component of justiciability, is not relevant to whether an anticipatory challenge presents a case or controversy sufficient to establish federal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">When we decide whether a case or controversy exists, then, we must focus on the plaintiff\u2019s interest in \u201cengagpng] in a course of conduct, arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute.\u201d <em>Babbitt v. </em>UFW, - U.S. -, -, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2309, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979). While many varieties of plaintiffs can qualify to raise anticipatory claims, <em>see e. g., Doran v. Salem Inn, </em>422 U.S. 922, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974), the Supreme Court has been most willing to allow anticipatory claims by plaintiffs who allege that they wish to violate the challenged statute because of their active membership in some profession or organization that has goals apart from the extirpation of unconstitutional measures. <em>Compare Babbitt v. </em>UFW, - U.S. -, -, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2309-10, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979); <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 7-8, 12 &amp; n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976); <em>United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. 548, 551-53, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973) (decided on merits without discussing jurisdiction); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 188, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973); <em>Lake Carriers\u2019 Association v. MacMullan, </em>406 U.S. 498, 506-07, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 32 L.Ed.2d 257 (1972); <em>and Epperson v. Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97, 100-02, 89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968), <em>with Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 459-60, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974), <em>and Golden v. Zwickler, </em>394 U.S. 103, 89 S.Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969). <em>See Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972) (plaintiff\u2019s longstanding concern with issue, by itself, is insufficient to confer jurisdiction). The Court has never been explicit about this practice, but the reasons for it are clear. If we are to be faithful to the premise derived from <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>we cannot always be satisfied by a plaintiff\u2019s formal allegation that he wishes to violate the challenged statute, for such an allegation could be honestly made by a plaintiff interested only in sweeping unconstitutional legislation from the statute books. <em>See generally Laird v. Tatum, </em>408 U.S. 1, 13-15, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972). We can be most certain that a constitutional challenge grows out of a genuine dispute \u2014 and is not a contrivance prompted solely by a desire to enforce constitutional rights \u2014 if we know that the allegedly unconstitutional statute interferes with the way the plaintiff would normally conduct his affairs. Of course anticipatory challenges should be allowed in a variety of other circumstances. But usually it is sufficient, although not necessary, that the plaintiff have a role in an organization dedicated in part to activities proscribed by the challenged statute and assertedly protected by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We can now turn to appellants\u2019 particular claims. Two of these claims pose few jurisdictional problems. Appellants assert that Atlanta cannot constitutionally require that they accept donations only at certain \u201cSolicitation Booths.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 9(c), 16. Appellants say that this requirement does more than inconvenience them; fairly construed, their complaint alleges that fidelity to their religious duty requires them to solicit aggressively and without inhibition. Therefore, appellants claim, the Constitution entitles them to solicit funds at least in any part of the airport where they are allowed to distribute literature and proselytize.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Second, appellants argue that \u00a7 9(a) is vague and overbroad. Section 9(a) makes it illegal for a permit holder to \u201cobstruct, delay, or interfere with the free movements of any other person . or hamper or impede the conduct of any authorized business at the Airport.\u201d Appellants say that this provision is replete with unconstitutionally imprecise terms \u2014 \u201cobstruct,\u201d \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cinterfere,\u201d \u201cfree movements,\u201d \u201champer,\u201d \u201cimpede.\u201d Fairly read, their vagueness claim is that these terms have forced them to steer wide of any possible violation lest they be unwittingly ensnared. <em>See, e.g., Baggett v. Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 372, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1969), <em>citing Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). In other words, they assert that they have had to leaflet and solicit far less aggressively than they otherwise would, in order to avoid being accused of \u201cimpeding\u201d or \u201champering\u201d others. Alternatively, appellants say, these terms are overbroad; if they do have a precise meaning, that meaning includes activities that Atlanta cannot constitutionally proscribe. As we have said, both of these claims are anticipatory because appellants have not yet violated the ordinance to test their asserted constitutional rights. That is, they have not yet accepted money away from the solicitation booths or engaged in the sort of conduct that they fear may be prohibited \u2014 but cannot be certain is prohibited \u2014 by \u00a7 9(a). Instead, they say, they have trimmed their sails.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Judged by . the standards we elaborated, appellants\u2019 interest in bringing these two anticipatory claims is jurisdictionally impeccable. The district court found that the Society\u2019s members are under a religious duty to distribute literature, solicit funds, and proselytize. The Society asserts, without contradiction, that at other times and in other places it aggressively solicited funds and distributed literature. Members of the Society currently distribute literature, proselytize, and solicit funds as aggressively as Atlanta permits. Plainly, appellants have an interest in escaping the solicitation booths, and in knowing exactly how far they can go without being punished, that is independent of any desire to enforce the Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"auz-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>The non-jurisdictional, \u201cpolicy\u201d component of justiciability is less focused than the Article III requirement. To apply it we must respond to \u201cmany subtle pressures, including the appropriateness of the issues for decision\u201d by the federal district court \u201cand the actual hardship to the litigants of denying them the relief sought.\u201d <em>Poe v. Ullman, </em>367 U.S. 497, 508-09, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1759, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (plurality opinion). <em>See also Socialist Labor Party </em>v. <em>Gilligan, </em>406 U.S. 583, 588-89, 92 S.Ct. 1716, 32 L.Ed.2d 317 (1972); <em>Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 158, 162, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967) (\u201cripeness\u201d for review of federal administrative agency\u2019s action). Appellants\u2019 challenges to the solicitation booths provisions and to \u00a7 9(a) also satisfy the requirements of this component.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">To begin with, several policies suggest that we should generally be receptive to anticipatory challenges; they apply, with perhaps more force than usual, to appellants\u2019 attacks on the solicitation booths and on \u00a7 9(a). To insist that a person must break the law in order to test its constitutionality is to risk punishing him for conduct which he may have honestly thought was constitutionally protected. Not only is this prima facie unfair, but it discourages people from engaging in protected activity and enforcing constitutional rights. In a case like this, where the appellants claim that the challenged ordinance deters them from practicing their religion, the injury to their first amendment rights recurs each day and is, in a sense, irreparable. <em>See Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 486-87, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); <em>Baggett v. Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 378-79, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"AI3\">Other policy concerns also suggest that appellants\u2019 claims against the solicitation booths and \u00a7 9(a) are justiciable. One of these, as we have mentioned, is the probability that the challenged provisions of the Atlanta ordinance will be enforced against the appellants if they violate it. Appellants need cross only a low threshold; the Supreme Court requires no more than-a \u201ccredible threat of prosecution,\u201d <em>Babbitt v. </em>UFW, - U.S. -, \u2014\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2309, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979), one that is not \u201cchimerical,\u201d <em>Poe v. Ullman, </em>367 U.S. 497, 508, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (plurality opinion) or \u201cimaginary or speculative,\u201d <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 42, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), \u201csome reason [for] fearing prosecution,\u201d <em>Babbitt v. </em>UFW, - U.S. -, -, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2311, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979). We have no doubt that appellants\u2019 challenge to \u00a7 9(a) and the solicitation booths provisions meet this standard. The parties disagree about whether the airport authorities specifically threatened to enforce the ordinance, but the ordinance was enacted only months ago and we are probably entitled to assume that law enforcement agencies will not disregard such a recent expression of the legislature\u2019s will. <em>Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 12, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (conclusory finding of jurisdiction in anticipatory challenge to recently enacted statute). In an evident attempt to assure that it will be valid and enforceable', Atlanta\u2019s city council amended the ordinance in response to the district court\u2019s decision, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>that certain portions of an earlier version were unconstitutional. Airport authorities have issued permits and set up solicitation booths. In all these ways, Atlanta shows every sign that it is planning to enforce the ordinance seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">The Supreme Court has also suggested that a court may declare an anticipatory challenge not justiciable in order to \u201cdelay resolution of constitutional questions until a time closer to the actual occurrence of the disputed event, when a better factual record might be available.\u201d <em>Blanchette v. Connecticut General Insurance Corps. </em>(Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases), 419 U.S. 102, 143, 95 S.Ct. 335, 358, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974); <em>see Babbitt v. UFW, </em>- U.S. -,-, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2310, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979); <em>United Public Workers v. Mitchell, </em>330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>754 (1947). Neither appellants\u2019 attack on the solicitation booths provisions nor their challenge to the alleged vagueness and overbreadth \u00f3f \u00a7 9(a) falls into this category, however. Atlanta began requiring solicitation booths after it had had some experience with allowing donations to be given and accepted throughout the airport; the Atlanta authorities\u2019 impressions of the lessons of the experience are in the record. <em>See </em>pp. 828-829 <em>infra. </em>By the time this suit came before the district court, the solicitation booths had apparently been operating for some time; evidence about their workings was available. Moreover, appellants attack the solicitation booths provision on its face. As we shall discuss, <em>see </em>pp. 826-830 <em>infra, </em>they say that allowing money to be accepted only at booths restricts their religious freedom and that Atlanta cannot constitutionally distinguish between accepting donations and other forms of expression. They do not, for example, attack the particular locations of the booths. Efforts to resolve such a facial challenge will gain little from a more complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Similarly, appellants challenge the allegedly vague and overbroad \u00a7 9(a) on its face. Heuristically, we might be aided by a real illustration of borderline conduct, neither plainly proscribed nor plainly permitted by \u00a7 9(a); as it is, we must rely on appellants\u2019 hypothetical examples. But this is a minor drawback, and in any event considering \u00a7 9(a) in the abstract has its heuristic advantages, too. It makes us more able to appreciate the quandary, if indeed it is a quandary, that appellants face when they attempt to plan their activities; they, after all, have only the abstract terms of the ordinance to guide them. And there are additional policy reasons for allowing the challenge to \u00a7 9(a) to be heard now. Something will be gained, <em>see </em>pp. 830-831 <em>infra, </em>but much will be lost if we permit \u201cthe contours of regulation to be hammered out case by case,\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 487, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1121, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965), in a series of enforcement proceedings, as state courts gloss the allegedly vague terms to render them precise, <em>see, e.g., Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), or as the enforcement agencies provide \u00a7 9(a) with a patina of \u201cless formalized custom and usage,\u201d <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974); <em>see Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, </em>425 U.S. 610, 622 n. 6, 96 S.Ct. 1755, 48 L.Ed.2d 243; <em>see also Ehlert v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 99, 105, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971). While the \u201chammering out\u201d continues so do the vices of vagueness; the appellants\u2019 uncertainty about the reach of the ordinance will force them to continue to restrict their religious activities. Moreover, if we believe that the ordinance\u2019s vagueness can be cured by a reasonable construction, we can, in several ways, refrain from invalidating it. We can abstain and allow a state court, if it wishes, to interpret the ordinance in a way that corrects its constitutional defects. <em>But see Baggett v. Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 378-79, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964). Or we <em>may be </em>able to construe the statute ourselves, if there is only one plausible saving construction, <em>see Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance, </em>587 F.2d 159, 166-67 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), or if we can anticipate what a state court would do by \u201cextrapolating\u201d from its decisions in related or analogous cases. <em>See generally Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Another policy argument affirmatively favors entertaining a vagueness claim like appellants\u2019 challenge to \u00a7 9(a). All vague statutes are unacceptable partly because they \u201cencourage[] arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions,\u201d <em>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 162, 92 S.Ct. 839, 843, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1971) and \u201carbitrary and discriminatory application,\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972); similarly, vague measures regulating first amendment freedoms enable low-level administrative officials to act as censors, deciding for themselves which expressive activities to permit. The very existence of this censorial power, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>how or whether it is exercised, is unacceptable. That, at least, seems to be the lesson of the series of Supreme Court decisions striking down statutes that allow officials excessively wide discretion to grant or deny permits to engage in activities protected by the first amendment. <em>See, e.g., Cox v. Louisiana </em>(I), 379 U.S. 536, 555-75, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965); <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 305-06, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). In these cases the Court has considered it immaterial whether the official who denied a permit acted reasonably, whether a permit could legally have been denied under a narrower statute, or indeed whether the party challenging the measure even applied for a permit. <em>See Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 151 &amp; n. 3, 89 S.Ct. 935, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969) (collecting cases). In other words, in the first amendment area, the Court will invalidate an excessively broad grant of discretion on its face. But if the Court were concerned merely about officials\u2019 abusing their wide discretion, it need not have chosen this facial approach; it could have struck down the abuses when they arose. <em>See, e.g., Poulos v. New Hampshire, </em>345 U.S. 395, 73 S.Ct. 760, 97 L.Ed. 1105 (1953). By facially invalidating excessively broad grants of discretion, then, the Court has revealed that the problem is not potential abuses but the very existence of broad, censorial power.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As we have said, a vague statute creates a similar power, and it is equally unacceptable; since the very existence of the power is unacceptable, there is little reason to forbear entertaining an anticipatory challenge in order to allow that power to be exercised. For these reasons, appellants\u2019 claim that \u00a7 9(a) is invalid, like their challenge to the solicitation booths, is justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Appellants\u2019 attack on the penalty provision of the ordinance, \u00a7 18, presents a much closer question. Section 18 provides that the violation of any part of the ordinances is an \u201coffense,\u201d and that any individual convicted of this offense loses the right to distribute literature or solicit funds in the airport for twelve months. If people \u201crepresenting\u201d an organization violate the ordinance a total of three times within six months, that organization loses its permit for twelve months. It might be argued that those penalty provisions do not <em>currently </em>injure the Society or any of its members. Section 18 imposes no penalties until the Society\u2019s members violate some other provision, and so far, according to this record, they have violated none. Thus even if the \u00a7 18 penalties are unconstitutional, the appellants cannot complain of having suffered them. Moreover, the argument would continue, the appellants cannot complain that \u00a7 18 has deterred them from doing anything they have a right to do. As long as any other unconstitutional prohibitions in the ordinance are invalidated, appellants have no constitutional right to violate it; therefore being deterred from violating it cannot count as an injury, so even if \u00a7 18 deters appellants it does not injure them. There will be no injury, it might be argued \u2014 and therefore no case or controversy \u2014 until members of the Society are actually convicted of a violation and punished under \u00a7 18. At that time, the argument would conclude, they can attack the constitutionality of the penalty provision, but not before.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">This argument is abstractly persuasive and may be entirely correct in other contexts. But it is insufficiently sensitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>to the first amendment interests at stake here, and it does not take account of the practical organizational difficulties faced by any group like the Society. The appellants are entitled to exercise their first amendment rights vigorously and aggressively and to go to the limits of the law in preaching, proselytizing, leafletting, and soliciting. One who goes to the limits, of course, is more likely to transgress them inadvertently than one who leaves some margin. One who goes to the limits is also more likely to be thought to have transgressed them even if he or she has not. The threat of a severe punishment, therefore, is likely to deter members of the Society from pressing their religious views as forcefully as they otherwise might; it is likely to induce them to leave some room for error. The Society\u2019s leadership will make similar calculations. When they organize and deploy their devotees, they know that a certain number are likely to be convicted, eventually, of some infraction, either because they deliberately or negligently violated some provision or because others are mistakenly convinced that they did. If the Society knows that it will be penalized for those violations, it will alter its designs, probably again by making them less aggressive. Of course, Atlanta is free to impose any constitutional penalty on those who violate its ordinances, even if the prospect dampens the enthusiasm of those engaged in expressive activities. But Atlanta cannot use an unconstitutional punishment for this purpose. Since the threat of punishment under \u00a7 18 does affect appellants\u2019 conduct, by causing them to exercise their first amendment rights less forcefully than they otherwise would, appellants have shown the injury necessary to Article III jurisdiction. If we were to hold \u00a7 18 unconstitutional, the threat, and thus the injury, would be removed. Therefore there is a case or controversy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Policy considerations also counsel us to hold that appellants\u2019 challenge to the penalty provisions is justiciable. As our discussion of the merits shows, <em>see </em>pp. 832-833 <em>infra, </em>appellants attack Atlanta\u2019s use of the empirical generalization that one who violates the ordinance on several occasions is likely to violate it again; first amendment rights, they say, cannot be restricted on the basis of such a premise. They need not claim that this premise is generally untrue, much less that it is untrue in any one case. Under these circumstances, waiting for the issue to be framed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>the concrete facts of a particular real case will probably not aid our decision and may even distract.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aii-dedup-0\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"abt-dedup-0\">Appellants\u2019 remaining two challenges, to \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 16, are not justiciable. Taken together, these sections authorize the Commissioner of Aviation to apportion airport space and time among competing applicants \u201con as equitable a basis as possible.\u201d If necessary, the Commissioner may restrict both the times at which groups may use their permits and the number of adherents who may solicit or distribute literature. These restrictions must be \u201creasonable and equitable\u201d and must \u201cprovide fair and as equal as possible opportunities for all applicants, while insuring the efficient and effective operation of the transportation function of the Airport.\u201d Appellants insist that terms like \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201cequitable,\u201d \u201cefficient and effective operation,\u201d and \u201cfair and as equal as possible\u201d are too vagu\u00e9 and give the Commissioner essentially unlimited discretion to circumscribe their activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We do not see how appellants are injured by this alleged vagueness. The Commissioner\u2019s discretion, however excessive, does not exist until competing applicants appear; nothing in this record suggest that they have appeared or will appear.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The appellants do not allege that the Commissioner has ever been able to invoke his authority, or that he can invoke it now.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The contingent possibility of excessively broad discretion to regulate first amendment activity \u2014 unlike its actual ex-ist\u00e9nce, <em>see </em>pp. 822-823 <em>supra </em>\u2014 cannot injure appellants. Nor do we see how this contingent discretion, if indeed \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 16 confer it, affects appellants\u2019 conduct. . Because appellants do not allege that competing applications have been filed or will soon be filed, they allege no injury, and this claim presents no case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Appellants pose a more troublesome challenge to a provision of \u00a7 8 that gives the Commissioner a general authority to relocate permitted activities. It says that the Commissioner, after giving \u201creasonable written notice\u201d to the holder of a permit, may \u201cmove [the] permitted activities from one area to another and among the different areas.\u201d He may do so only if \u201cin the judgment of the Commissioner such move or moves are necessary to the efficient and effective operation of the transportation function of the airport.\u201d Appellants\u2019 claim is that the language \u201cnecessary to the efficient and effective operation of the transportation function\u201d is so imprecise that again the Commissioner has virtually unlimited discretion to move them. Appellants do not allege that the Commissioner acts or will act in bad faith, so they cannot say that their activities are inhibited by the fear that he may harass them by relocating them frequently. Nevertheless, as we suggested, see pp. 822-823 <em>supra, </em>Supreme Court decisions invalidating statutes that grant excessive administrative discretion in the first amendment area suggest that the mere existence of broad, discretionary, censorial power itself injures those who wish to speak. To be sure, discretion to move a speaker is different from discretion to silence him or her, at least if there is no bad faith. But being moved about the airport may significantly affect the Society\u2019s ability to proselytize and solicit. For this reason we hold that this allegedly broad discretionary authority stemming from \u00a7 8 injures the appellants enough to create a case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">But \u00a7 8 also requires the Commissioner to give a permit holder reasonable notice before requiring a move. If the Commissioner ever proposes to relocate the appellants, then, they will be able to challenge his decision before they sustain any further, concrete harm. In such a case, moreover, a court would have before it the Commissioner\u2019s specific explanation of why a particular move promoted the \u201cefficient and effective operation of the transportation function.\u201d It is not at all obvious that this language confers excessively broad discretion on the Commissioner. <em>See e.g., Cox v. New Hampshire, </em>312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941). Therefore an explanation from the Commissioner in a particular case would better enable us to decide whether \u00a7 8 does indeed realistically confine the Commissioner\u2019s discretion. For these reasons, we hold, as a matter of policy, that appellants\u2019 challenge to \u00a7 8 is not justicia-ble. <em>See generally United Public Workers v. Mitchell, </em>330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">We can now proceed to the merits of the justiciable claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">First we consider appellants\u2019 assertion that Atlanta cannot constitutionally prohibit them from accepting donations at places other than the designated solicitation booths. Section 9(c) of the ordinance provides that no person may \u201c[r]eceive or accept any donation of money (but may direct to a location established under PART TWO of this Ordinance any person wishing to make such a donation).\u201d The relevant portion of Part Two provides: \u201c . [Solicitations shall be conducted only from \u2018Solicitation Booths\u2019 which shall be furnished by the Commissioner; and such booths shall be located within the permissible areas at such points as may be designated from time to time by the Commissioner.\u201d \u00a7 16. As we said when we held this claim justiciable, p. 822 <em>supra, </em>appellants attack this restriction on its face; they say that Atlanta has no power to impose this limitation on the places where donations may be accepted. They do not say, for example, that particular solicitation booths are located in such remote parts of the airport that members of the Society find it unreasonably difficult to perform their religious duty of soliciting donations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Atlanta attempts to justify this restriction as a regulation of the place and manner of religious expression. In general, a government may enact such a regulation so long as it does not classify expression on the basis of content, <em>see e. g., Niemotko v. Maryland, </em>340 U.S. 268, 71 S.Ct. 325, 95 L.Ed. 267 (1951), and so long as the regulation is \u201creasonable,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166-70, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944); <em>Cox v. New Hampshire, </em>312 U.S. 569, 574-77, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941). <em>See also Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 115-16, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Appellants say both that the solicitation booths provisions classify on the basis of content and that they are not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Appellants first assert, in effect, that the religious expression involved in accepting a donation differs in content from that involved in proselytizing, and that content-based classifications are unconstitutional under all but extraordinary circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Hudgens v. NLRB, </em>424 U.S. 507, 520, 96 S.Ct. 1029, 47 L.Ed.2d 196 (1976); <em>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 209, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975); <em>Niemotko v. Maryland, </em>340 U.S. 268, 71 S.Ct. 325, 95 L.Ed. 267.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Police Dep\u2019t v. Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), held that Chicago could not permit labor picketing near its schools but prohibit demonstrations on behalf of other causes; similarly, appellants say, Atlanta cannot permit what appellants depict as less controversial forms of religious activity generally throughout the airport while it circumscribes the religious act of accepting a donation.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We do not quarrel with the principle that, in general, a government may not discriminate against expression with a certain content. Our difficulty is with appellants\u2019 premise that accepting donations differs from proselytizing, distributing literature, and other forms of religious activity, in content, not manner or form. This premise finds its best support in <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). <em>Buckley </em>dealt with the constitutionality of various congressional restrictions on contributions to political campaigns and expenditures made in connection with campaigns. The <em>Buckley </em>Court did not explicitly treat these restrictions as if they were regulations based on the content of expression, but it did require a more substantial justification of these restrictions than it would have required of such content-neutral regulations of the manner of speech as, for example, ordinances limiting the use of sound trucks. <em>Id. </em>at 18 &amp; n. 17, 96 S.Ct. 612. On the basis of this holding, appellants argue that restrictions on giving and receiving contributions to a religion also cannot be treated as regulations of the manner or place of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">This argument fails. The <em>Buckley </em>Court emphasized that when Congress enacted the campaign expenditure and contribution limits, it intended to reduce the influence of those who spent money on politics. <em>See id. </em>at 17-18, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-10\">The interests served by the Act include restricting the voices of people and interest groups who have money to spend . . Although the Act does not focus on the ideas expressed . . it is aimed in part at equalizing the relative ability of all voters to affect electoral outcomes . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 17, 96 S.Ct. at 634. In other words, the <em>Buckley </em>regulations were directed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the communicative aspect of transferring money. In some measure, Congress wanted to interdict the messages that the transfers would convey. As the Court said, \u201cit is beyond dispute that [Congress\u2019s] interest in regulating the . . . giving or spending [of] money \u2018arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 96 S.Ct. at 634, <em>quoting United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 382, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">By contrast, Atlanta attempts to justify the solicitation booths provisions by referring only to the mechanical, non-communicative aspects of transferring money. In support of the provisions requiring solicitation booths, Atlanta submitted an affidavit from an airport manager which spoke of traffic congestion caused by \u201cthe fumbling through pocketbooks and wallets, the searching for the right amount of money, the making of change, and the dropping of money.\u201d R. at 236. In <em>Buckley, </em>the political significance of the transfers of money\u2014 the likelihood that the contributor would attempt to influence the recipient, or that the spender would influence votes \u2014 was the principal reason for the regulations; here, the religious significance of the contributions is irrelevant to Atlanta. If Atlanta had established the solicitation booths because soliciting funds was a controversial variety of religious expression particularly likely to snarl traffic in the terminal building by causing disputes, we would have a different case, one far closer to <em>Buckley. </em>But Atlanta has made no such claim. In this case, unlike <em>Buckley, </em>the regulated transfers of money were the medium, not the message.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For this reason, we must view Atlanta\u2019s solicitation booths provisions as regulations of the place and manner of religious expression that do not classify on the basis of content.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Accordingly, we need only decide whether the solicitation booths provisions are \u201creasonable\u201d. <em>See, e.g., Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 115-16, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972); <em>Cox v. New Hampshire, </em>312 U.S. 569, 574-77, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941). Deciding what is reasonable is essentially a matter of balancing Atlanta\u2019s interest against appellants\u2019, <em>see e. g., </em>Kalven, The Concept of the Public Forum: <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>1965 Sup.Ct.Rev. 1, 27-28, but the balancing is not unstructured. The governmental interest must be \u201csubstantial,\u201d <em>see e.g., United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376-77, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), or \u201ccompelling\u201d, <em>see e.g., Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 119, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). We must decide \u201cwhether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 116, 92 S.Ct. at 2303, but in doing so we have to \u201cweigh heavily the fact that communication is involved,\u201d <em>id. </em>Moreover, we must insist that the regulation be narrowly tailored to serve the interest that assertedly justifies it. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 116-17, 92 S.Ct. 2294; <em>Cox v. Louisiana </em>(II), 379 U.S. 559, 562-64, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965); <em>Schneider v. State, </em>308 U.S. 147, 164, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939); <em>Lovell v. City of Griffin, </em>303 U.S. 444, 451, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938). But in this case appellants were asking for a preliminary injunction; that makes it more difficult for them to obtain relief against the solicitation booths provisions. <em>See, e.g., Compact Van Equipment Co. v. Leggett &amp; Platt, Inc., </em>566 F.2d 952, 954 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">We do not think that the district judge abused his discretion when he denied the preliminary injunction. Under the terms of the ordinance, appellants can ask for funds or attempt to sell religious tracts at any place in the airport where they are allowed to proselytize; the ordinance requires only that instead of accepting any proffered money, they refer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>donor to a solicitation booth. We do not doubt that this is burdensome and that appellants lose money as a result. But there is little in this record to reveal the extent of the loss, and it is not obvious that the loss would be very great. Atlanta\u2019s interest in confining transfers of money to the booths is better documented. The airport\u2019s Operations Manager asserted in an affidavit, and appellants do not deny, that Atlanta\u2019s is an unusually congested airport and that since about two-thirds of the passengers boarding planes in Atlanta are transferring from other flights, it is important that they be able to move easily through the terminal. The Operations Manager also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-4\">\u201cThe activities of the various organizations conducting their activities in the Terminal Building \u2014 and especially those of the Krishna Society \u2014 where they relate to money, have created confusion and caused congestion by the stopping of people in their normal movement through the building, the fumbling through pocketbooks and wallets, the searching for the right amount of money, the making of change, and the dropping of money. Deponent has observed such congestion and confusion on numerous occasions as he has watched the activities of these organizations. It is for these reasons that the City has required that donations of money be received only at solicitation booths located at points which will avoid such problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">On its face, this affidavit shows Atlanta\u2019s \u201csubstantial\u201d interest in limiting the exchange of money to solicitation booths, and it tends to show that exchanging money would be \u201cincompatible with the normal activity of\u201d the airport if it were not confined to the solicitation booths. Since appellants neither contested the truth of the affidavit nor offered contradictory evidence, the affidavit\u2019s assertions are sufficient to sustain the solicitation booths provisions. Needless to say, appellants are free, in any further proceedings concerning permanent relief, to attempt to show that Atlanta has overestimated the congestion caused by exchanging money. They might present evidence contradicting the Operations Manager\u2019s affidavit, for example, or they might show that other airport regulations \u2014 for example, those permitting commercial sales \u2014 belie the city\u2019s claims about the disruptive effects of transferring money.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Finally, appellants claim that these provisions are not \u201cnarrowly tailored to further the [city\u2019s] legitimate interest.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 116-17, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2303-2304, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972); <em>see Davis v. Francois, </em>395 F.2d 730 (5th Cir. 1968). The ordinance, they point out, does not prohibit digging into pockets and fumbling for money, the assertedly disruptive acts; it does not prohibit the requests for donations which are likely to precipitate such disruptive acts; and it does not prohibit tendering a donation, the purpose of the disruptive acts. All the solicitation booths provisions prohibit is accepting a donation, and that, appellants say, is precisely the least disruptive act in the chain. At best, then, appellants argue, the solicitation booths provisions are not \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d; at worst they are simply arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">This argument rests on a misconception. To say that a regulation must be tailored to the ends it serves is not to say that it can serve only one end. A regulation of the place or manner of religious exercise is constitutional if it makes a substantial enough contribution to some <em>combination </em>of important governmental ends to outweigh its restrictive effect on first amendment freedoms. In the first amendment area we will not strain our imaginations to link a measure with objectives which the government will not avow, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>which the measure promotes only very indirectly, but here Atlanta\u2019s aims are obvious. It wished to reduce disruption, and, as we have just discussed, the solicitation booths provisions are one of the several possible ways to do that. But obviously Atlanta also wanted to adopt an ordinance that was fair and enforceable. It is manifestly more fair to place a duty on permit holders, who can be put on notice, than on travellers who happen to be using Atlanta\u2019s airport; similarly, a regulation that prohibited permit holders from asking for donations,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or trav-ellers from offering them, would be far more difficult to enforce than one which prohibited only the discrete and (relatively) easily defined act of accepting them. Thus the solicitation booths provisions make a very substantial contribution to the pursuit of an important goal consisting of three specific ends \u2014 fairness, ease of enforcement, and reduced disruption. Considered as such, on this record, its benefits outweigh the burdens it places on religious practices. It is therefore constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Section 9(a) of the ordinance provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARq\">\u201c[N]o person shall . . . [i]n anywise obstruct, delay, or interfere with the free movements of any other person, seek to coerce or physically disturb any other person, or hamper or impede the conduct of any authorized business at the Airport.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Appellants focus on the terms \u201cobstruct,\u201d \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cinterfere,\u201d \u201ccoerce,\u201d \u201cdisturb,\u201d \u201champer,\u201d and \u201cimpede.\u201d They assert that these terms are vague and overbroad. The vagueness and overbreadth challenges are linked, as these two notions often are. Appellants\u2019 claim is that if these terms are assigned the only plain meaning they can possibly have, they outlaw a variety of constitutionally protected activities and are therefore overbroad. See, <em>e.g., Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. 241, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967); <em>Hobbs v. Thompson, </em>448 F.2d 456, 459-60 (5th Cir. 1971). If they are not assigned this meaning, appellants suggest, they have no precise meaning and are unconstitutionally vague. <em>See, e.g., Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, </em>425 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 1755, 48 L.Ed.2d 243 (1976). Obviously, both of appellants\u2019 challenges fail if these terms have a precise meaning that does not reach protected conduct. The district court held that they have such a meaning. We agree that some of these terms do, but believe that others have no ascertainable meaning at all.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">Any law is unconstitutionally vague if people \u201cof common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>Connally v. General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). Measures affecting first amendment rights must be drafted with an even \u201cgreater degree of specificity.\u201d <em>E.g., Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 573, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cCondemned to the use of words,\u201d however, \u201cwe can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2300, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). <em>See also American Communications Association v. Douds, </em>339 U.S. 382, 412, 70 S.Ct. 674, 691, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950). (\u201cThere is little doubt that imagination can conjure up hypothetical cases in which the meaning of these terms will be a nice question. The [objective], however, is not . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>[the] wholly consistent academic definition of abstract terms.\u201d) We must also bear in mind that \u201c[t]he applicable standard . is . . . the practical criterion of fair notice to those to whom the statute is directed. The particular context is all important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because this ordinance deals only with the airport, and only with those licensed to proselytize there, it will be applied repeatedly by a relatively small number of enforcement officials to a relatively small number of people. Over time \u2014 indeed, probably fairly quickly \u2014 certain patterns of enforcement and tacit understandings will develop. This \u201cless formalized custom and usage,\u201d <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974), will clarify much of the inevitable imprecision. Supreme Court decisions strongly suggest that the authorities will not be permitted to prosecute conduct permitted by those understandings, <em>see e.g., id.; Cox v. Louisiana </em>(II), 379 U.S. 559, 568-73, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965); <em>Raley v. Ohio, </em>360 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 1257, 3 L.Ed.2d 1344 (1959), even if it is apparently proscribed by the ordinance itself. \u201cDeeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy . . . are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.\u201d <em>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. Ry. v. Browning, </em>310 U.S. 362, 369, 60 S.Ct. 968, 972, 84 L.Ed. 1254 (1940). Under these circumstances, we can permit slightly more imprecision than we would approve in a measure about to be enforced against the public at large in multifarious contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In light of these principles, the phrase \u201cseek to coerce or physically disturb any other person\u201d in \u00a7 9(a) poses little problem. \u201cCoerce\u201d is used throughout the law; one does not coerce unless one threatens some serious harm or applies force, and appellants, of course, do not claim the right to do that. \u201cPhysically disturb\u201d obviously involves some harmful or offensive contact, actual or apparently imminent. If the ordinance simply outlawed \u201cphysical disturbances,\u201d one might be uncertain whether the term comprised both accidental and negligent disturbances. But under \u00a7 9(a) permit holders may not \u201cseek to . physically disturb.\u201d One who does something accidentally or carelessly has, by definition, not sought to do it. So the \u201ccoerce or physically disturb\u201d clause of \u00a7 9(a) is sufficiently precise.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The phrase \u201cin anywise obstruct, delay or interfere with the free movement of any other person\u201d is more problematic, but here precedent confines us. In <em>Cameron v. Johnson, </em>390 U.S. 611, 88 S.Ct. 1335, 20 L.Ed.2d 182 (1968), the Supreme Court upheld, against a facial vagueness claim, a statute prohibiting \u201cpicketing * * * in such a manner as to obstruct or unreasonably in-' terfere with free ingress or egress to or from any * * * county * * * courthouses * * The Court said that \u201cobstruct\u201d and \u201cunreasonably interfere\u201d were \u201cplainly\u201d not vague. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 88 S.Ct. at 1338. Arguably, obstructing and interfering with \u201cfree ingress or egress to and from\u201d a building are more clearly defined acts than generally obstructing or interfering with \u201cfree movements.\u201d Entrances and exits are usually obvious and traffic moves through them in regular, and predictable ways; \u201cfree movements\u201d may, in some contexts, include such a variety of random and unexpected actions that persons subject to the restriction cannot know what they are to avoid doing. But as we have noted, this ordinance applies only to airports. In an airport-Minlike a park, for example \u2014 \u201cfree movements\u201d are likely to be almost as regular and predictable as those of people entering and leaving a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Appellants also complain that this portion of \u00a7 9(a) might make illegal the routine distraction and diversion inevitably caused by activities like theirs. The purpose of the ordinance, however, is to authorize these activities under certain circumstances, and it would be most eccentric to read this section as nullifying the rest of the ordinance.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellants also say that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>is unclear whether \u00a7 9(a) reaches negligent or inadvertent interfering, obstructing, or delaying; we believe, however, as the <em>Cameron </em>Court apparently did, that the words themselves imply intentional action. This portion of \u00a7 9(a) is also not unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The remaining clause of \u00a7 9(a) provides that \u201cno person shall . . . hamper or .impede the conduct of any authorized business at the airport.\u201d This part of \u00a7 9(a) is unconstitutionally vague. We must assume that it is intended to proscribe actions not already reached by the other language of \u00a7 9(a), and it is not clear what those actions are. One may, of course, \u201champer or impede the conduct of\u201d a business at an airport by interrupting a person while he or she is attempting to buy a ticket or a newspaper; a provision specifically prohibiting that sort of conduct would not be vague. But distracting a person who is on his or her way to transact some other business may also be thought to \u201champer or impede the conduct\u201d of the business. More generally, leafletting or soliciting on a route used by those who are about to patronize a business may divert some from continuing and discourage others. Indeed, the very proximity of a proselytizer for an unpopular cause may \u2014 and no doubt generally does\u2014 adversely affect many businesses; these adverse effects might be comprised by the terms \u201champer or impede the conduct of [a] business.\u201d Thus in <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940), the Supreme Court invalidated an Alabama statute which prohibited picketing \u201cfor the purpose of hindering, delaying, or interfering with or injuring any lawful business\u201d, because, it said, that offense \u201ccan be proved merely by showing that others reacted in a way normally expectable of some upon learning the facts of a dispute,\u201d <em>id, </em>at 100, 60 S.Ct. at 743.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This part of \u00a7 9(a) is too inscrutable; these several constructions are all plausible, and people in appellants\u2019 position cannot know which to expect. It is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">The penalty provision of Atlanta\u2019s ordinance, \u00a7 18, automatically revokes the permit of any person \u201c[c]onvict[ed] of a violation of a provision of this Ordinance.\u201d \u00a7 18(a).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, in the event that three (3) or more convictions hereunder of a person or persons representing the same organization occur within a period of six (6) months, then the third conviction shall serve to automatically' terminate any permit which may have been issued to the organization which such person or persons represent.</p>\n<p id=\"Al-\">\u00a7 18(b). Individuals and organizations who lose their, permits in this fashion cannot reapply for twelve months. \u00a7 18(c).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">This section presents no difficult issues; it is simply a recipe for an unlawful prior restraint. A plausible but broad generalization can support some kinds of regulation, see, <em>e.g., New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, -, 99 S.Ct. 1355, 1368-69, 59 L.Ed.2d 587. (1979), but no government may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>impose a prior restraint unless it has shown, at the very least, that the particular speech it is attempting to suppress is overwhelmingly likely to fall outside the protection of the first amendment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A person may not be prevented from speaking unless what he or she will say \u2014 or the time, place, and manner in which he or she will say it \u2014 will \u201csurely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. v. United States, </em>403 U.S. 713, 730, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 2149, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971) (Stewart, J., joined by White, J., concurring). <em>See also Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976); <em>Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, </em>402 U.S. 415, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971); <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). Atlanta attempts to meet this extraordinary burden by asserting, in the case of restrictions on individuals, that once a sinner always a sinner; anyone who has violated the ordinance once is likely to violate it again. We have recently held, en banc, that no prior restraint may be based on this broad generalization. <em>Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance, </em>587 F.2d 159, 165-66 (5th Cir. 1978). The \u00a7 18 restriction on organizations merely conjoins this premise with one of guilt by association; sinners, apparently, flock together.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This generalization is, at best, equally weak. It cannot support a prior restraint either. The penalty provision is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Appellants\u2019 challenge to the provisions governing the issuing of permits by the Commissioner of Aviation has become moot. Therefore the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying a preliminary injunction against these provisions is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss, without prejudice, this portion of the complaint. <em>See Kremens v. Bartley, </em>431 U.S. 119, 129, 97 S.Ct. 1709, 52 L.Ed.2d 184 (1977); <em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The claims against \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 16 of the ordinance are not justiciable; the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying a preliminary injunction against these provisions is therefore also vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss, without prejudice, these parts of the complaint as well. The district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction against the provisions concerning solicitation booths is affirmed. The denial of a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of \u00a7 9(a) is affirmed except insofar as the district court refused to enjoin prosecutions under the phrase \u201champer or impede the conduct of any authorized business at the airport\u201d; to that extent the district court\u2019s order is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. The district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction against \u00a7 18 of the ordinance is reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED &amp; REMANDED IN PART; AND REVERSED &amp; REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">APPENDIX I</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The Atlanta Airport ordinance in effect at the time of the district court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">PART ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\"><em>Section 1. </em>Any person or organization desiring to engage in activities at any airport owned by the City of Atlanta (\u201cAirport\u201d) which involve the exercise of constitutional freedoms, including but not limited to distribution of non-commercial, non-obscene, non-subversive literature, shall be protected in such activities, provided that the same do not constitute commercial activities and do not result in interference with the transportation function of the Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\"><em>Section 2. </em>The regulations hereinafter set out are hereby declared to be necessary for the accomplishment of the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-10\">(a) To insure that persons seeking to exercise constitutional freedoms of expression can communicate effectively with users of the Airport;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-11\">(b) To insure adequate nearby police facilities for the protection of persons exercising their constitutional freedoms;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-12\">(c) To restrict such activities to public areas of Airport buildings and premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-13\">(d) To protect persons using the Airport from repeated communications or encounters which might constitute harassment or intimidation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-14\">(e) To insure the free and orderly flow of pedestrian traffic through the Airport premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-15\"><em>Section 3. </em>Any person or organization desiring to distribute literature at the Airport shall first obtain a written permit therefor from the Commissioner of Aviation (\u201cCommissioner\u201d).

In the event that any permit hereunder is denied, by reason of unusual or emergency conditions at the Airport, or for other valid reason, the City of Atlanta, acting by and through its City Attorney (or his designee) shall within five (5) days following such denial, apply to either the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, or to the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, for a judicial determination as to whether the proposed activities described in the application may be prohibited, naming the applicant as a party defendant. The City shall exert every reasonable effort to have this issue heard on its merits without delay, and as soon as legally possible. The burden of showing that the proposed activities may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>be prohibited shall rest on the City. In the event that the applicant certifies in his application for a permit that, due to emergency circumstances, the permit applied for is required by a specified time in order to be effective, then upon receipt of such certification, the Commissioner shall issue a permit within the time requested in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\"><em>Section 4A. </em>If the issue for judicial determination described in Section 4 above is not heard and decided on the merits by the court within ten (10) days from the date the complaint is filed, then an interim permit shall be deemed issued under this ordinance to the applicant by operation of law, and all activities proposed to be carried on in the application for the original permit may be carried on just as though a permit had been duly issued by the Commissioner, subject to the same restrictions and obligations under this ordinance as other permitted activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The interim permit shall be deemed renewed each ninety (90) day period for so long as no judicial determination has been made and from the time such determination is made until the time for appeal therefrom has expired.

The interim permit shall be deemed renewed each ninety (90) day period and shall continue in effect as provided hereinabove until a final and binding appellate decision has been reached. If the City appeals an adverse judicial determination, it shall file its notice of appeal within five (5) days following said determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\"><em>Section 5. </em>The activities referred to herein shall be conducted strictly in conformity with the terms and conditions of this Ordinance and the permit issued by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\"><em>Section 6. </em>The activities referred to herein shall be conducted only in or upon those premises which are non-secured, public use areas.

Our instruction to the district court is to dismiss this portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the complaint without prejudice, so appellants are free to challenge \u00a7 10 again; obviously they can challenge any part of the amendments as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\">. <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), may be the origin of the rule that a plaintiff must shew a threat of enforcement. <em>Young </em>permitted a suit against a state official to enjoin an unconstitutional action. It circumvented the eleventh amendment by reasoning that the suit was against the official as an individual tortfeasor who lest his official immunity when he violated the Constitution. It follows from this reasoning that a plaintiff may sue only the particular official who has threatened to take some unconstitutional action against him or her. <em>See generally </em>Comment, Threat of Inforeement \u2014 Prerequisite of a Justiciable Controversy, 62 Colum.L. Rev. 108, 111-13 (1662), The <em>Young </em>rationale is, of course, now recognized as a fiction,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. <em>See generally A, </em>Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch, 148-48, 155-56 (1662),</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b906-11\">. The probability of enforcement seems relevant to these concerns in only one way. If there is no serious possibility that a statute will be enforced against him, a plaintiff with a genuine independent interest in acting in the way it prescribes will probably de so. A plaintiff who does not act but Instead challenges its constitutionality is, therefore, more likely to be raising the constitutional claim simply because he wants to enforce his constitutional rights, not for reasons connected to any genuine concrete dispute, The premise of <em>Marbury v, Madison, </em>of course, dees net permit a constitutional claim to be raised in this fashion, But any probability of enforcement, however small, may deter even a genuinely interested plaintiff, And a conscientious citizen may be unwilling to break any law that has net been repealed or invalidated, even if he believes it to be unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b907-11\">. \u201c[T]he present case was brought, the appeal of right is properly here, and it is our duty to decide the issues presented.\u201d 393 U.S. at 102, 89 S.Ct. at 269.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b907-12\">. <em>See </em>P. Bator et al.. Hart &amp; Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System (2d ed.) 657 (1973). <em>Poe v. Ullman, </em>367 U.S. 497, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 689 (1961), which seems irreconcilable with <em>Epperson, </em>in fact supports this conclusion. <em>Poe </em>was an anticipatory challenge to the constitutionality of a Connecticut statute punishing anyone who used contraceptives or gave medical advice about them. The Court refused to decide the case on the merits; the prevailing plurality opinion pointed to Connecticut\u2019s persistent refusal to enforce the statute. But the plurality opinion\u2019s language suggests that the decision was not jurisdictional but \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 502-09, 81 S.Ct. 1752. This view may be inconsistent with <em>Ep-person\u2019s </em>apparent insistence that the Supreme Court decide all mandatory appeals of which it has jurisdiction, <em>see also Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, </em>331 U.S. 549, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666 (1947), but it supports the <em>Epperson </em>Court\u2019s implicit holding that the probability of enforcement is irrelevant to the existence of an Article III case or controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">. <em>Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, </em>425 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 1755, 48 L.Ed.2d 243 (1976) reinforces our conclusion that the district court had jurisdiction over these claims. In <em>Hynes, </em>the Supreme Court upheld, on the merits, an anticipatory challenge to two Oradell, New Jersey, municipal ordinances regulating door-to-door solicitation and canvassing. That challenge, like these appellants\u2019, asserted that the ordinances imposed unconstitutionally vague restrictions on persons engaged in activities protected by the first amendment. The <em>Hynes </em>plaintiffs asserted only that they wished to campaign or canvass door-to-door in Oradell, or that they wished to speak to door-to-door canvassers. They did not allege that the ordinances had been enforced against them in any way. The case reached the Supreme Court on appeal from the New Jersey Supreme Court, and the Court decided the case on the merits without discussing jurisdiction. A dissenting opinion remarked on the problematic procedural posture of the case, however, <em>see id. </em>at 633 n. *, 635, 96 S.Ct. 1755 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), and of course the Court would have had to dismiss the appeal if it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Doremus </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952). Thus the Court\u2019s decision on the merits indicates that the requirements of Article III were met. We should note, however, that the <em>Hynes </em>plaintiffs included persons who wished to speak to door-to-door canvassers; they, of course, could not test the ordinances\u2019 validity by violating it, so their claim to be heard in anticipatory proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>ings was arguably stronger than the potential speakers\u2019, in <em>Hynes, </em>or appellants\u2019 here. <em>See, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b911-5\">. It can be argued that the Court invalidates an excessively broad grant of discretion on its face because it is too difficult to review the merits of a highly particular decision made by a low-level official in accordance with no explicit standard. <em>See </em>Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 844, 876-82 (1970). <em>Cf. Alexander v. Louisiana, </em>405 U.S. 625, 630, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 31 L.Ed.2d 526 (1972) (use of questionable procedures in jury selection supports inference of racial discrimination). <em>See generally </em>The Supreme Court, 1976 Term, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 70, 172 (1977). But most of these difficulties occur in reviewing decisions made under more specific statutes as well, <em>see, e.g., Poulos v. New Hampshire, </em>345 U.S. 395, 73 S.Ct. 760, 97 L.Ed. 1105 (1953), so this cannot be a complete explanation. Antipathy to the mere existence of censorial power must play some role.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b912-4\">. <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), is not inconsistent with this conclusion. The plaintiffs in <em>O\u2019Shea </em>charged that local judges discriminated against blacks, and violated the Constitution in other ways, in setting bail, sentencing, and administering various other aspects of the criminal justice system. None of the plaintiffs alleged that he or she had actually been charged or was awaiting trial or sentencing before one of the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 94 S.Ct. 669. (The Court noted that <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), would preclude such a defendant from seeking relief in federal court in any event. 414 U.S. at 492, 91 S.Ct. 746. <em>But see Gibson v. Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 93 S.Ct. 1689, 36 L.Ed.2d 488 (1973).) The Court said, \u201cIf the statutes that might possibly be enforced against [plaintiffs] are valid laws, . . . the question becomes whether any perceived threat to [plaintiffs] is sufficiently real and immediate to show an existing controversy simply because they anticipate violating lawful criminal statutes and being tried for their offenses, in which event they may appear before [defendants] and, if they do, will be affected by the allegedly illegal conduct charged.\u201d <em>Id., </em>414 U.S. at 496-97, 94 S.Ct. at 676. Such a prediction was only \u201cspeculation and conjecture,\u201d the Court held, insufficient to establish a case or controversy. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 94 S.Ct. 669. \u201cWe assume that [plaintiffs] will conduct their activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and conviction as well as exposure to the challenged course of conduct said to be followed by petitioners.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVo\">The decisive difference between <em>O\u2019Shea </em>and appellants\u2019 attack on \u00a7 18 is that the plaintiffs in <em>O\u2019Shea </em>alleged only \u201cthe prospect of future injury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 496, 94 S.Ct. 669, a prospect \u201cnecessarily contingent\u201d upon several intervening events, <em>id. </em>at 498, 94 S.Ct. 669; they could identify no present injury to themselves, much less an injury to their first amendment interests. They did allege that they were engaged in political protests which raised racial tensions, but \u2014 as the Court noted, <em>id. </em>at 497, 94 S.Ct. 669 \u2014 they did not link these activities to the alleged constitutional violations of which they complained. For example, they did not claim, as appellants can here, that the prospect of an assertedly unconstitutional punishment reduced the vigor with which they exercised their first amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"ajx-dedup-1\">. Appellees argue in effect that other provisions of \u00a7 18 \u2014 obviously designed to comply with the procedural requirements of <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965), and kindred cases \u2014 should induce us to hold any anticipatory challenge to \u00a7 18 nonjusticiable. Section 18(d) commands the Atlanta City Attorney to seek judicial approval, in either state or federal court, of any decision to suspend a permit under \u00a7 18. Section 18(e) provides that unless the court chosen by the City Attorney validates the suspension within ten days, the permit must be provisionally restored until it does. (Section 4 of the ordinance provides that if an applicant for a permit certifies that the permit \u201cis required by a specified time in order to be effective . the Commissioner shall issue a permit within the time requested . . . Under a possible, although strained, interpretation of the ordinance, this provision would apply to a permit revocation under \u00a7 18; if it did, then a permit could not be suspended at all without either judicial approval or some form of consent. This interpretation of the ordinance would not change our analysis.)</p>\n<p id=\"aox-dedup-1\">These provisions have very little effect on the justiciability of appellants\u2019 claim. They do no more than assure permit holders that if Atlanta proposes to enforce the penalty provisions of \u00a7 18 against them, they will have a forum in which to raise their constitutional objections. This is no novelty. Routinely, a party can challenge the constitutionality of a measure being enforced against him or her; the challenge is usually raised in the enforcement forum itself. A criminal defendant, for example, can defend by alleging the unconstitutionality of the statute under which he or she is charged. When we permitted appellants\u2019 anticipatory challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 9(a) and to the solicitation booths provisions, we were fully aware that the same constitutional claims could be raised as defenses if those provisions were ever enforced against appellants. Similarly, appellants\u2019 right under \u00a7 18(d) and \u00a7 18(e) to demand judicial review of the constitutionality of \u00a7 18 if it is enforced against them does not make their anticipatory challenge any less justiciable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b913-12\">. Even if other applicants are now competing with the appellants, the Commissioner may never have to invoke his authority; the dispute may be resolved by mutual agreement. <em>See Rogers v. Brockette, </em>588 F.2d 1057, 1061 (5th Cir. 1979). But while this may affect the policy considerations bearing on justiciability, <em>see </em>pp. 818 819 <em>supra, </em>it is not relevant to the existence of a case or controversy; as we discussed, <em>see </em>pp. 822-823 <em>supra, </em>the mere existence of excessive low-level administrative discretion, amounting to a power to censor, inflicts an injury on those subject to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b913-13\">. <em>Appellee </em>says, in his brief, that other groups solicit at the Atlanta Airport, Appellee\u2019s Br. at 17; but there is no indication that they compete for space with the Society.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b914-5\">.

Because this is the injury which appellants allege, we need not resolve the problem \u2014 posed by cases like <em>Murdock v. Pennsylvania, </em>319 U.S. 105, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292 (1943), and perhaps cast in a new light by <em>Buckley v.
