The district court held that the regulation barring waiver of recoupment was unenforceable in states with statutes permitting waiver. But the district court held that attorneys\u2019 fees were not available for the prevailing plaintiffs under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976. The Secretary of Labor (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s judgment on the merits. Plaintiffs appeal the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">In order to augment existing unemployment compensation programs in states with extraordinarily high unemployment, Congress passed the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974. (H.R.Rep.No. 93-1549 (1974), 1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 6842.) Under the Emergency Extended Benefits program established by the Act, federal funds were provided for states to pay up to 26 weeks of addition unemployment compensation to persons exhausting their rights to compensation under existing programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Under the terms of the Act, each state was directed to apply its own unemployment insurance law in administering the Federal Supplemental Benefits. Section 102(d)(2) of the Act provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-6\">\u201cthe terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof shall (except where inconsistent with the provisions of this Act or regulations of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this Act) apply to claims for emergency compensation and the payment thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOxy\">Although the federal Act was silent on recovery of overpayments, California and at least 24 other states (as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) authorized waiver of recoupment in certain circumstances. Section 1375 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-7\">\u201cAny person who is overpaid any amount as benefits under this part is liable for the amount overpaid unless: (a) The overpayment was not due to fraud, misrepresentation or wilful nondisclosure on the part of the recipient, and (b) The overpayment was received without fault on the part of the recipient, and its recovery would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">On February 6, 1975, the Secretary of Labor promulgated regulations requiring states to recover overpayments in Federal Supplemental Benefits (\u201cFSB\u201d) regardless of any state laws permitting waiver of re-coupment. The regulations provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AepP\">\u201c[i]f the State agency of the applicable State or a court of competent jurisdiction finds, after a determination and opportunity for a fair hearing thereon, that an individual has received a payment of FSB to which the individual was not entitled under the Act and this Part, whether or not the payment was due to the individual\u2019s fault or misrepresentation, the individual shall be liable to repay to the applicable State the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled, and the State agency shall take all reasonable measures authorized under any State law or Federal law to recover for the account of the United States the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled.\u201d (20 C.F.R. \u00a7 618.15(a).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">The regulations further specified that \u201c[a]ny provision of the applicable State law providing for waiver of recovery of over-payments of compensation shall not be applicable to FSB.\u201d (20 C.F.R. \u00a7 618.15(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">On May 17,1976, Reynaldo Tongol filed a class action against the Secretary of Labor and three California defendants (the California Employment Development Department and its director, and the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board) on behalf of all persons who had received FSB overpayments and who resided in states with laws permitting waiver of re-coupment. Tongol sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the regulation prohibiting waiver on the grounds that it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">On January 28, 1977, the district court certified plaintiff class <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and granted sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>mary judgment to plaintiffs. The district court held that the regulations \u201crequiring the recovery of FSB overpayments in circumstances not authorized by state law are without statutory authority and are therefore void and unenforceable.\u201d The district court enjoined defendants from enforcing the regulations and ordered them to reevaluate the cases of persons against whom overpayments had been assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">The district court\u2019s decision was largely premised on its previous decision in <em>Martinez v. Dunlop </em>(N.D.Cal.1976) 411 F.Supp. 5, which we affirmed <em>sub nom. Martinez v. Marshall </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 573 F.2d 555. In <em>Martinez, </em>the district court invalidated another regulation barring waiver of recoupment, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 619.13, that was virtually identical to the regulation at issue here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The regulation struck down in <em>Martinez </em>barred states from waiving recoupment of overpayments in Special Unemployment Assistance (\u201cSUA\u201d) benefits established by the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974, P.L. 93-567, 88 Stat. 1845. The program authorizing payment of SUA benefits and the program providing the Federal Supplemental Benefits at issue here were part of a package of programs passed by Congress at the same time to deal with the unemployment problem. (Sen.Rep.No.94-208 (1975), 1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 377, 378-79.) Like the Act at issue here, the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974 contained a provision mandating the application of state law. The district court in <em>Martinez </em>held that the regulation barring waiver of recoupment was invalid in states with statutes authorizing waiver because it conflicted with the congressional command to apply state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">On appeal, we affirmed the district court in <em>Martinez. </em>We held \u201cthat Regulation 619.13 is not consistent with the legislative purpose of the Act and is in excess of the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority . . . .\u201d <em>(Martinez v. Marshall, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 560.) We observed that the Secretary\u2019s regulation was \u201cinconsistent with previous regulations under similar statutory provisions\u201d because waiver of recoupment had been permitted by the Secretary in four earlier unemployment insurance programs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We noted that the Secretary had barred waiver under only two statutes \u2014 the Disaster Unemployment Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121 <em>et seq., </em>which did not mandate the application of state law, and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974, the program at issue in this case. Although we reserved judgment on the validity of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 618.15, we noted that it \u201cdeparted from past practices in the area of unemployment compensation regulation.\u201d <em>(Martinez v. Marshall, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 559 n. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">In light of our decision in <em>Martinez, </em>the district court\u2019s decision invalidating 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 618.15 was entirely proper. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>Section 618.15 is invalid for the same reasons that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 619.13 was held invalid in <em>Martinez. </em>As we noted in <em>Martinez, </em>both regulations are inconsistent with previous regulations of the Secretary of Labor permitting waiver of recoupment in a variety of unemployment insurance programs. Like the regulation stricken in <em>Martinez, </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 618.15 conflicts with the congressional command to apply state law in states, like California, with statutes permitting waiver of recoupment. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974, provides that state law shall apply \u201cexcept where inconsistent with the provisions of this Act or regulations of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this Act . . .\u201d (Section 102(d)(2), P.L. 93-572, 88 Stat. 1869.) The reference to \u201cregulations of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this Act,\u201d does not indicate that Congress intended to give the Secretary authority to override state law in circumstances where the Act itself is not inconsistent with state law. The direction that state law shall apply would have little meaning if the Secretary had unbridled authority to suspend the application of a state law that is not inconsistent with anything in the balance of the Act. There is no indication that Congress intended to prohibit waiver of recoupment of FSB overpayments when it enacted the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974. Indeed, in 1977 Congress amended the program expressly to permit waiver on a nationwide basis. (Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 1977, P.L. 95-19, 91 Stat. 39.) We recognized in <em>Martinez </em>that the Secretary\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations _ to carry out the purposes of a congressional program does not permit the enforcement of regulations that are themselves inconsistent with the legislative purpose. Because the Secretary\u2019s regulations barring waiver are inconsistent with the legislative purpose of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act, the district court properly invalidated 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 618.15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">Plaintiffs appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. On February 14, 1977, plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the Civil Right Attorney\u2019s Fee Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. This section provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of . [42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1983 ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.) The district court denied the motion for attorneys\u2019 fees because it held that plaintiffs had not made out a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The court further held that it had no authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs under its equitable powers because their action did not fall within the narrow \u201ccommon fund\u201d or \u201ccommon benefit\u201d exceptions to the rule of <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">Section 1983 of Title 42, U.S.Code, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-11\">\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">To state a claim for relief under section 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate two elements: (1) that \u201cthe defendant was acting under color of state law at the time the acts complained of were committed,\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe defendant deprived plaintiff of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>(Briley v. California </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 564 F.2d 849, 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">The district court held that plaintiffs had not stated a claim under section 1983 because they had not met the state action requirement and because they had not raised a \u201csubstantial\u201d constitutional claim under the test of <em>Hagans v. Lavine </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577. The court held that there was no state action because \u201cthis case is a suit attacking a federal regulation as contrary to statute\u201d and \u201cthe state is here simply implementing the federal regulations as it was obliged to do.\u201d The district judge apparently thought that the \u201ccolor of state law\u201d requirement could be satisfied only when state law was being implemented by state authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">The \u201ccolor of state law\u201d requirement of section 1983 \u201chas consistently been treated as the same thing as the \u2018state action\u2019 \u201d requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. (U<em>nited States v. Price </em>(1966) 383 U.S., 787, 794 n. 7, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267; <em>Briley v. California, supra, </em>564 F.2d at 855; <em>Ouzts v. Maryland National Insurance Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 505 F.2d 547, 550 (en banc).) Courts applying the \u201ccolor of state law\u201d requirement have indicated that the relevant inquiry focuses not on whose law is being implemented, but rather on whether the authority of the state was exerted in enforcing the law. <em>(United States v. Classic </em>(1941) 313 U.S. 299, 326, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368; <em>Green v. Dumke </em>(9th Cir. 1973) 480 F.2d 624, 628-29.) Thus, the actions of state agencies administering federally-funded programs have been held to be actions undertaken under color of state law for the purposes of section 1983. <em>(Green v. Dumke, supra, </em>480 F.2d at 628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">The state officials who sought to recover these FSB overpayments were empowered to act only by virtue of their authority under state law. (Calif. Unemployment Ins. Code \u00a7\u00a7 301 <em>et seq. </em>&amp; 401 <em>etseq.) </em>Thus, the state defendants were acting \u201cunder color of state law\u201d within the meaning of section 1983. <em>(Cf. Lidie v. California </em>(9th Cir. 1973) 478 F.2d 552 (state implementation of federally-approved regulations for administering federal food stamp program is \u201cstate action\u201d within the meaning of section 1983).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">Because plaintiffs satisfied the first element for stating a claim under section 1983, we must consider whether they met the second element for such a claim by seeking to vindicate rights \u201csecured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>(Briley v. California, supra, </em>564 F.2d at 853.) In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged two bases for relief: a statutory claim based on the alleged conflict between the Secretary\u2019s regulation and the terms of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974, and a constitutional claim based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In determining whether plaintiffs had stated a claim for relief under section 1983, the district court only considered whether plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim was substantial enough to meet the requirements of <em>Hagans v. Lavine, supra</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because section 1983 indisputably embraces claims based on deprivations of constitutional rights, there is no question that plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>tiffs would have stated a claim for relief under section 1983 if they raised a substantial constitutional claim. However, the district court held plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim to be too insubstantial to form the basis for a 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contest the district court\u2019s holding that their constitutional claim was insubstantial, and they also argue that their action states a claim under section 1983 because it seeks to redress a deprivation of federal statutory rights. By its terms, section 1983 applies to actions to redress deprivations of rights \u201csecured by the Constitution <em>and laws . </em>. . .\u201d If plaintiffs\u2019 statutory argument is correct, we need not decide the substantiality of their constitutional claim. Thus, we must consider whether section 1983 provides a cause of action for deprivations of the kind of statutory rights involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The Supreme Court has not defined the extent to which 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides a cause of action for deprivations of federal statutory rights. In <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization </em>(1979) - U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508, a decision construing the jurisdictional counterpart of section 1983, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(3) &amp; (4), the Supreme Court discussed the scope of section 1983 in the context \u00f3f a suit to redress an alleged conflict between state welfare regulations and the Federal Social Security Act. Four members of the Court expressed the view that section 1983 provided a cause of action to redress a deprivation of the kind of federal statutory rights involved in the case. <em>(Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>- U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. 1905 (White, J., concurring in judgment), -, 99 S.Ct. 1905 (Stewart, J., dissenting).) Three members of the Court were of the opinion that section 1983 did not provide a cause of action for the deprivation of such statutory rights. <em>(Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>- U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. 1905 (Powell, J., concurring).) Two members of the Court did not reach the issue because they held, for the plurality, that even if section 1983 provided a cause of action, there was no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) or (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-18\">Although the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Chapman </em>means that jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 action cannot be founded on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(3) &amp; (4), jurisdiction was still proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (mandamus jurisdiction). <em>(Martinez v. Marshall, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 558 (upholding mandamus jurisdiction in virtually identical action); <em>of. Califano v. Yamasaki </em>(1979) - U.S. - , -, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (declining to reach question of mandamus jurisdiction tyhere jurisdiction provided by Social Security Act).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>determine whether section 1983 provides a cause of action for plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">Although the Supreme Court has yet to define the extent to which section 1983 provides a cause of action for deprivations of statutory rights, the issue is not an unfamiliar one. The question has been the subject of considerable scholarly comment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Three Circuits have held that 1983\u2019s reference to rights \u201csecured by the Constitution <em>and laws </em>\u201d is to be taken literally to mean that the section provides a cause of action for deprivations of federal statutory rights. <em>(Blue v. Craig </em>(4th Cir. 1974) 505 F.2d 830; <em>Gomez v. Florida State Employment Service </em>(5th Cir. 1969) 417 F.2d 569; <em>Bomar v. Keyes </em>(2d Cir. 1947) 162 F.2d 136.) The Supreme Court has meticulously recounted the legislative history of section 1983 on a number of occasions <em>(Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>supra; <em>Examining Board of Engineers v. Flores de Otero </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 572, 96 S.Ct. 2264, 49 L.Ed.2d 65; <em>Lynch v. Household Finance Corp. </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424; <em>Monroe v. Pape </em>(1961) 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492) and two views have emerged about the scope of the section\u2019s protection of statutory rights. One view holds that the plain language of the statute indicates that a cause of action is provided for deprivations of any federal statutory rights. <em>(Chapman, supra </em>(White, J., concurring in judgment).) The other view is that section 1983 was intended to be only as broad as its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), which is limited to actions claiming a deprivation of rights \u201csecured by . . . any Act of Congress providing for equal rights.\u201d <em>(Chapman, supra </em>(Powell, J., concurring).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">A meticulous review of the legislative history of section 1983 convinces us that the former view is correct. Because we are venturing on such well-trod terrain, it is unnecessary for us to give a detailed repetition of the legislative history of section 1983. \u201cAnyone who ventures into the thicket of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983 quickly realizes that there is no clearly marked path to the correct interpretation of this statute.\u201d <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>- U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. at 1919 (Powell, J., concurring).) In these circumstances, we think that the clearest indication of the intended scope of section 1983 is the language of the statute itself. <em>(See Smith v. Califano </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 597 F.2d 152, 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-16\">Section 1983 is derived from section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. This section provided a private civil cause of action to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights \u201csecured by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d When Congress adopted the Revised Statutes of 1874, the words \u201cand laws\u201d were added to section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which became section 1979 of the Revised Statutes. While we recognize that Congress provided scant indications of the reasons for this change, we cannot ignore the plain meaning of the language Congress employed. <em>(Cf. Examining Board of Engineers v. Flores de Otero </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 572, 96 S.Ct. 2264, 49 L.Ed.2d 65 (unexplained addition of the words \u201cor Territory\u201d in 1874 revision accorded its plain meaning).) Moreover, \u201c[t]he conclusion that \u00a7 1983 provides a remedy for deprivations under color of state law for federal statutory as well as constitutional rights not only reflects a straightforward and natural reading of its language, but is supported by [Supreme Court decisions] that have assumed or indicated in dicta that this is the correct construction of the provision <em>[Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 658, 700-701, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611; <em>Edelman v. Jordan </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 651, 675, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662; <em>Mitchum v.

Thus, we hold that section 1983 provides a cause of action to redress deprivations of federal statutory rights of the kind alleged by plaintiffs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claim stated a claim for relief under section 1983, we need not decide whether the district court was correct in holding plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim to be too insubstantial to state a cause of action under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">Because plaintiffs stated a claim under section 1983, the district court had discretion to award plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Thus, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and remand that portion of the case to the district court for consideration of whether attorneys\u2019 fees should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">The judgment of the district court on the merits is affirmed.

The previous regulations to which we referred in <em>Martinez </em>included unemployment insurance programs for federal employees 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8501 <em>et seq., </em>ex-servicemen, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8521 <em>et seq., </em>the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, Title II of P.L. 91-373, 84 Stat. 695, 708, and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1971, Title II of P.L. 92-224, 85 Stat. 810, 811. For each of these programs the Secretary of Labor provided for waiver of overpayments pursuant to applicable state law. <em>(Martinez v. Marshall, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 558-59.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">. Congress\u2019 failure to amend the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act in 1975 to permit waiver expressly does not suggest that Congress approved the Secretary\u2019s regulation by its silence. While Congress did amend the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act on June 30, 1975, to permit waiver with regard to SUA overpayments, there is no indication that Congress knew that the Secretary had barred waiver of recoupment of FSB overpayments. Indeed, the legislative history of the 1977 amendments to the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act indicates that Congress believed that the waiver question previously was governed by state law. (See 123 Cong.Rec. H 2913 (remarks of Congressman Corman, April 4, 1977) (\u201cUnder the present statute, waiver is permitted only in those States which have State law waiver provisions applicable in their regular unemployment insurance program.\u201d).) The fact that the 1977 amendments were not retroactive and Congress\u2019 awareness that they would change the law relative to recoupment is not inconsistent with this conclusion because the 1977 amendments permitted waiver for the first time even in states without laws authorizing it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">. In <em>Hagans v.

Title 28, U.S.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1343(3) &amp; (4) provide: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person: ... (3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.

The court majority did not reach the question whether section 1983 provided a cause of action for such a suit, although four members of the Court indicated that they would answer that question in the affirmative, while three members of the Court indicated that they would give a negative answer to that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1186-22\">. In their complaint, plaintiffs asserted jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C, \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 706, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(3) &amp; (4), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. As we recognized in <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 573 F.2d 555, 558, jurisdiction in a suit such as this cannot be premised on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 706, in light of <em>Califano v. Sanders </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization </em>(1979) \u2014 U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508, indicates that in the absence of a substantial constitutional claim jurisdiction would not lie under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(3) &amp; (4). Because of our holding in <em>Martinez </em>that mandamus jurisdiction under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 was proper in suits such as this, we need not decide whether jurisdiction also existed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (jurisdiction over acts regulating commerce).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1187-17\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Note, \u201cThe Propriety of Granting a Federal Hearing for Statutorily Based Actions Under the Reconstruction-Era Civil Rights Acts: <em>Blue v.

We reject cross-appellees\u2019 arguments that the rights plaintiffs seek to vindicate are not federal rights. The statutory rights plaintiffs seek to vindicate are created by section 102(d)(2) of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974, a federal law which commands states to apply their own unemployment insurance law in administering the Federal Supplemental Benefits program. Cross-appellees\u2019 argument that plaintiffs\u2019 action cannot be brought under section 1983 because it is a claim for monetary rights rather than for personal liberty rights was laid to rest in <em>Lynch v.
