Lewis was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, later reduced to seven, and a special parole term for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">In 1977, Lewis moved to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that the district court failed to advise him that the special parole term was mandatory and could be imposed for life. The district court denied the petition without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">The record of the hearing shows that the trial court advised Lewis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-14\">THE COURT: And also there is a minimum parole term, special parole term, of at least three years, and I suppose conceivably, up to life, the maximum. So the court can impose upon you a special parole term of not less than three years nor more than a life special parole, meaning that you would be on parole and would go back if you violated for whatever number of years. Do you follow me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-15\">LEWIS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-16\">Before accepting Lewis\u2019s guilty plea, the court advised codefendant Deshotel that hers was the \u201csame situation\u201d as Lewis\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhhF\">THE COURT: Okay. Now, as far as you are concerned, Miss Deshotel, its the same situation. If you are sentenced to prison the court will impose a special parole term. Even if you are sentenced to prison and maybe it is suspended or something like that, there will be a special parole term imposed upon you of not less than three years .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-17\">On appeal, Lewis argues the court\u2019s remarks were ambiguous because use of the word \u201ccan\u201d indicated that the special parole term was not mandatory, and use of the word \u201cconceivably\u201d discounted the possibility of a special parole term of \u201clife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-18\">In <em>United States v. Del Prete, </em>567 F.2d 928 (9th Cir. 1978), we held that the trial court\u2019s explanation that a drug charge \u201ctriggered a three year special parole term which <em>may </em>be imposed\u201d (emphasis added) was insufficient to inform the accused that the special parole term was mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 929. In the present case, however, the word \u201ccan\u201d was obviously used to express the existence of the court\u2019s power to impose any term of special parole ranging from the mandatory three-year minimum to the maximum possibility of life. Moreover, if ambiguity existed, it was removed by the court\u2019s subsequent remark that both defendants were in \u201cthe same situation,\u201d in that if sentenced to a prison term \u201cthe court <em>will </em>impose a special parole term\u201d (emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-19\">The court\u2019s use of the word \u201cconceivably\u201d in referring to the possibility that a life special parole term might be imposed provides no ground for relief. Rule 11 does not require that the court inform the defendant of the probability of his receiving one sentence or another. Indeed, it is improper to do so. <em>Hinds v. United States, </em>429 F.2d 1322 (9th Cir. 1970). The rule only requires that the defendant understand the range of possible sentences and penalties. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>539 F.2d 1241 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 918, 97 S.Ct. 2182, 53 L.Ed.2d 228 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>Because the record conclusively established that Lewis was sufficiently apprised of both the minimum and maximum mandatory parole terms, it was proper for the district court to deny the section 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1,16, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
