Citizens Casualty Co., </em>431 F.2d 409 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b307-27\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b307-28\">A fire occurred in the engine room of the M/V NORTH TIDE. In the course of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>investigation of this occurrence pursuant to 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 239,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Coast Guard became aware that the NORTH TIDE was not inspected and certified. The Coast Guard then broadened its investigation to cover possible violations of 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 404,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> related to the carriage of freight in an uninspected vessel. Lieutenant Commander J. E. Shkor, designated as a Marine Investigating Officer by the Officer in Charge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Marine Inspection, issued subpoenas to various parties connected with the ownership and operation of the NORTH TIDE which sought information as to freight carriage by it. When compliance was refused, the Coast Guard obtained an order of enforcement in the district court. The present appeal is from that enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Appellants submit that the duly designated investigating officer lacks regulatory authority to issue the subject subpoenas and to conduct an investigation into any matter other than the fire. Alternatively, they assert that the subpoenas are overly expansive in time and seek irrelevant materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Appellants concede, as they must, that 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 239 permits the Commandant of the Coast Guard to promulgate regulations for carrying out his duties under \u00a7\u00a7 239 and 404. The challenge to Lt. Cdr. Shkor\u2019s subpoena authority is based on the language used in the regulations as adopted in 46 C.F.R. Part 4 Marine Investigation Regulations. Appellants urge that the Commandant has limited the Coast Guard\u2019s investigative power under subpart 4.07 to marine casualties or accidents involving safety of life at sea. They urge that the investigatory powers granted do not permit inquiry about civil or criminal liability for such matters as may arise under 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 404. The Coast Guard urges that the Part 4 regulations are sufficient for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">It is not necessary for us to resolve the difference between the parties by pursuing the meaning or interpretation of sub-part 4. Lt. Cdr. Shkor was designated as an Investigating Officer under 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.02-20.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As such, he is specifically in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>vested with authority to investigate violations of acts in violation of 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 404.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.05-5<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he is clearly given the power to issue the subpoenas issued here.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The magistrate found that the appellants submitted no evidence to substantiate the claim made before him that the subpoenas were burdensome, harassing and oppressive. In the absence of such a showing, we decline to reverse the grant of enforcement on the vague alternative ground urged here. The Coast Guard acknowledges that it cannot subpoena irrelevant documents. Should the investigation become an overbroad policy inquiry into the use of offshore vessels, as appellants speculate it might, nothing said here will preclude their making such a showing in the district court and seeking a proper protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-5\">.
