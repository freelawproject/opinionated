We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>reject these arguments and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">1. <em>Factual Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">On July 3, 1978, McCauley possessed an unregistered Japanese type-96 light machi-negun, which lacked the magazine necessary for automatic firing. On that date, McCauley met with Darold Hays, his brother-in-law, and Victor J. Herbert, Jr., a BATF agent, at McCauley\u2019s home in Ken-nett, Missouri, and agreed to sell the weapon to Herbert. BATF agents recorded that conversation and sale, by means of hidden transmitters voluntarily carried by both Hays and Herbert, and arrested McCauley immediately after the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">At trial McCauley conceded possession of the weapon. He contended, however, that he was under no duty to register the gun because without a magazine it could not be fired automatically, and, therefore, it was not a \u201cmachinegun\u201d within the meaning of the registration statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McCauley also introduced expert testimony that magazines for type-96 machineguns are rare and practically impossible to acquire on the open market.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The Government, on the other hand, introduced evidence that a type-96 machine-gun magazine was available at a St. Louis gun store and that, for a price of $45, a gunsmith in the St. Louis area had converted a German MG 13 magazine, which is readily obtainable on the open market, into a magazine useable in a type-96 machine-gun. In addition, the Government showed that, in offering to sell the type-96 machi-negun, McCauley told Herbert that he possessed a thirty-round \u201cclip\u201d (/. e., magazine) for the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">A. <em>Definition of \u201cMachinegun.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">McCauley initially contends that one of the definitions of \u201cmachinegun\u201d in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>i. e., </em>a weapon \u201cdesigned to shoot * * * automatically more than one shot,\u201d is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad for a strict liability statute such as the National Firearms Act. We need not address this contention here because the record establishes beyond question that the gun in McCauley\u2019s possession met the alternative test in section 5845(b), as a weapon that \u201ccan be readily restored to shoot\u201d automatically.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">B. <em>Admissibility of the Recorded Conversation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">The district court admitted into evidence the entire tape recording of the conversation between McCauley, Hays, and BATF agent Herbert, at which the sale of the machinegun was discussed. McCauley challenges the admissibility of this recording on three grounds: (1) the recording of the conversation constituted an unreasonable search and seizure; (2) the identification at trial of the recorded voices was inadequate; and (3) the prejudicial effect of the tape recording substantially outweighed its probative value. We reject each of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">First, no unreasonable search or seizure occurred here, because both Hays and Herbert, participants in the conversation, consented to the recording. <em>United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Second, the voices on the tape were sufficiently clearly identified at trial to prevent confusion by the jury, particularly in light of Herbert\u2019s testimony relating the substance of the crucial portions of the recorded conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">McCauley\u2019s third objection to the admission of the entire tape recording, that the playing of the recording unfairly prejudiced him because it contained vulgarity, racial slurs, and cavalier statements concerning past gun sales, presents a more serious question. The better- practice might have been to admit only those limited portions of the recording in which McCauley discussed the machinegun in question. However, any error in admitting other portions of the recording was harmless given the overwhelming evidence of McCauley\u2019s guilt of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">C. <em>Opinion Concerning an Ultimate Issue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">McCauley argues that the trial court erred in permitting the Government\u2019s expert witness to testify that, in his opinion, McCauley\u2019s weapon was a machinegun required to be registered under the Act. We find no abuse of discretion in the admission of this testimony; Under Fed.R.Evid. 704, such opinion testimony \u201cis not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">D. <em>The Firearms Registry Certificate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Finally, McCauley contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a BATF registry certificate indicating that McCauley had not registered any firearms and that he had neither applied to transfer a firearm nor paid a transfer tax on any firearm. McCauley maintains that the latter part of the certificate constitutes evidence of other crimes, namely, that he sold the machinegun to Herbert without applying to transfer it or paying a transfer tax as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5812(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">While the certified statement contained information in addition to that required to support the indictment for possession of an unregistered firearm, that document was nonetheless relevant and admissible to establish that McCauley possessed a machinegun not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. See <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>509 F.2d 683, 685 n.1(b) (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 989, 95 S.Ct. 1993, 44 L.Ed.2d 479 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">t7] The district court, at McCauley\u2019s request, might have deleted the statements in the certificate pertaining to transfer, but McCauley failed to make such a request and, in any event, no prejudice is shown. The certificate, including the statements that McCauley had not applied to transfer any firearm or paid transfer tax upon any firearm, merely sets forth the national firearms registration and transfer record of McCauley. Those statements on the certificate, standing alone, do not show that McCauley has committed any crime. Even if the reception of the surplus material in the certificate was erroneous, such error must be deemed harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence in the record of McCauley\u2019s guilt of the possession offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-22\">. The Honorable James H. Meredith, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, sentenced McCau-ley to four years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) makes it unlawful for any person \u201cto receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record[.]\u201d The definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) includes \u201ca machinegun,\u201d which \u00a7 5845(b) defines as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The terms shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting a weapon into a machi-negun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWM\">In its jury instructions, the district court included only the first sentence of \u00a7 5845(b) in its definition of a machinegun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-19\">. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b427-15\">ORDER ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">In his petition for rehearing, John Keith McCauley asserts that the court, in part IIA of its opinion in this case, improperly bypassed constitutional issues he previously raised and brings to our attention <em>Strom-berg </em>v. <em>California, </em>283 U.S. 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931). Upon reconsideration, we agree that McCauley\u2019s constitutional arguments must be reached but conclude those contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">McCauley challenges on due process grounds the application in this case of the portion of the National Firearms Act (Act) defining \u201cmachinegun\u201d as a weapon <em>\u201cdesigned to shoot * </em>* * automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(b) (1976) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McCauley contends the challenged definition of machinegun (1) is unconstitutionally vague, i.e., fails \u201cto give comprehensible notice of what is required or proscribed [or] to provide a sufficiently definitive standard for nonarbitrary application by the jury,\u201d and (2) permits a conviction without <em>scien-ter </em>for an innocent act, such as possession of a device which, though originally \u201cdesigned to shoot\u201d automatically, cannot now be made to do so because it lacks an irreplaceable part.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">1. <em>Vagueness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">It is \u201c \u2018well established that vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>423 U.S. 87, 92, 96 S.Ct. 316, 319, 46 L.Ed.2d 228 (1975), <em>quoting United States v. Mazurie, </em>419 U.S. 544, 550, 95 S.Ct. 710, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975). Here McCauley possessed a Japanese type-96 machinegun in working order except that the gun lacked a magazine necessary for firing more than one shot at a time. The evidence indicates that magazines for Japanese type-96 machineguns are rare, but McCauley\u2019s own expert witness testified that he possessed two such magazines, although they were not for sale. Moreover, the evidence of McCauley\u2019s conversation with a prospective purchaser of the machinegun conclusively demonstrates that McCauley did not possess the machinegun merely as a curio or ornament.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">On the facts of this case, we think the challenged portion of the statute, defining \u201cmachinegun\u201d as a weapon \u201cdesigned to shoot\u201d automatically, even taken in isolation, sufficiently advised McCauley that the mere fact that his machinegun was not then equipped with a magazine did not remove his weapon from the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While one may conceive of marginal fact situations in which notice under this definitional language would be constitutionally inadequate, this is not such a case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore reject McCauley\u2019s vagueness challenge to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">2. <em>Scienter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">In <em>United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971), the Supreme Court rejected a blanket attack charging that the Act impermissibly imposes criminal liability for possession of unregistered firearms without a finding of criminal intent, or <em>scienter, </em>as to the unregistered status of the weapons. The Court characterized the Act as \u201ca regulatory measure in the interest of the public safety,\u201d <em>United States v. Freed, supra </em>at 609, 91 S.Ct. at 1118, and concluded that the character of the weapons subject to the Act \u2014 \u201chighly dangerous offensive weapons\u201d \u2014 justifies liability under the Act without a specific finding of criminal intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>McCauley seeks to avoid <em>Freed </em>by arguing that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">[i]f literally applied, \u00a7 5845(b) makes it a severely punishable crime to possess, without consciousness of wrongdoing or evil intent, a device which, though designed to shoot as a machine gun, can\u2019t and won\u2019t because of the absence of an irreplaceable part, as the jury could have believed of the alleged firearm in this case. It cannot with reason be argued that such a device is invested with [the] inherent dangerousness of the grenades in <em>Freed * </em>* * to justify sacrificing the deeply-rooted moral notions associated with the <em>mens rea </em>requirement in our criminal law * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">This high-sounding argument of McCauley, however, misconceives both the import of the \u201cdesigned to shoot [automatically]\u201d language of section 5845(b) and the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">An ordinary reading of the \u201cdesigned to shoot\u201d language does not disclose the broad meaning, encompassing devices lacking \u201cirreplaceable\u201d parts necessary to shoot automatically, contended by McCauley. Moreover, cases arising under the pre-1968 version of the National Firearms Act, which defined a \u201cmachinegun\u201d as \u201cany weapon which shoots, or is <em>designed to shoot, </em>automatically * * <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> indicate a narrow construction of that language. <em>See United States v. Leavell, </em>386 F.2d 776 (4th Cir. 1967); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lauchli, </em>371 F.2d 303, 311-13 (7th Cir. 1966); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>202 F.Supp. 503 (N.D.Cal.1962). No indication exists that Congress intended to alter this judicial construction of the \u201cdesigned to shoot\u201d language when it reenacted the Act, with amendments, in 1968.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to McCauley\u2019s premise, it does not appear that the challenged portion of section 5845(b) makes punishable the possession, without criminal intent, of a device that no reasonable effort could render capable of automatic fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">In addition, the record refutes McCau-ley\u2019s claim that \u201cthe jury could have believed\u201d that his machinegun lacked an \u201cirreplaceable\u201d part and therefore was permanently incapable of automatic fire. As already indicated, McCauley\u2019s own evidence at best demonstrated that magazines for a Japanese type-96 machinegun are difficult \u2014 not impossible \u2014 to obtain. The record contains no evidence indicating complete unavailability of such magazines or effective substitutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">In sum, McCauley\u2019s machinegun represents the type of highly dangerous offensive weapon placing its possessor on notice that possession of such a weapon \u201cis not an innocent act.\u201d <em>United States v. Freed, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 609, 91 S.Ct. 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">Accordingly, we reject McCauley\u2019s contentions that the conviction violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. McCauley stands, convicted under the Act of possessing an unregistered firearm, specifically, a machinegun. The entire definition of ma-chinegun reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxE\">(b) <em>Machinegun. </em>\u2014 The term \u201cmachinegun\u201d means any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting a weapon into a machi-negun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person. [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU9\">As the trial court included only the first sentence of \u00a7 5845(b) in its jury instructions, the jury considered only the three disjunctive definitions of machinegun contained in that sentence. Arguably, the jury\u2019s verdict may have rested on any of those disjunctive definitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-13\">. In any event, we think it is beyond peradventure that the complete definition of \u201cmachine-gun\u201d in the Act, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>provided adequate notice to McCauley that his machine-gun fell within the Act\u2019s coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-14\">. The record, even if viewed in the light most favorable to McCauley, simply fails to support McCauley\u2019s contention that his machinegun is \u201cfunctionally inert\u201d and therefore not the type of device at which Congress aimed the National Firearms Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b428-15\">. In <em>Freed, </em>the defendant stood convicted of possessing unregistered hand grenades. In rejecting his claim that his lack of knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the unregistered status of the hand grenades precluded conviction, the Court stated that \u201cone would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freed, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 609, 91 S.Ct. at 1118.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\">.
