Appellants are adult adoptees and an association of such persons; and they urge that the New York statutes that require the sealing of adoption records<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are facially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>invalid on Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection grounds and on the further basis that those statutes impose upon them badges or incidents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>slavery in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Milton Pollack, Judge, dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint against representative record keepers and surrogates represented by the State of New York and certain adoption agencies or societies. <em>Alma Society, Inc. v. Mellon, </em>459 F.Supp. 912 (S.D.N.Y.1978). We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Appellants argue that adult adoptees should be given access to the records of their adoptions with no showing of cause whatsoever. Their supporting affidavits, which we must take as true for present purposes, indicate that lack of access to such records causes some of them serious psychological trauma and pain and suffering, may cause in them or their children medical problems or misdiagnoses for lack of history,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may create in some persons a consciousness of danger of unwitting incest, and in others a \u201ccrisis\u201d of religious identity or what they feel is an impairment of religious freedom because they are unable to be reared in the religion of their natural parents. Appellants point out that only in the last fifty years has New York had sealed adoption records,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Scotland and Israel have had open records for some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>time,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that England and Wales have recently changed from closed to open records with access to adults who have obtained a certain age.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">The attack upon the New York statutes is three-fold. Appellants first argue that the interest of an adult adoptee in learning from the State (or from agencies acting under compulsion of state law) the identity of his natural family is a fundamental right under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \u201cThis section affords not only a procedural guarantee against the deprivation of \u2018liberty,\u2019 but likewise protects substantive aspects of liberty against unconstitutional restrictions by the State.\u201d <em>Kelley v. Johnson, </em>425 U.S. 238, 244, 96 S.Ct. 1440, 47 L.Ed.2d 708 (1976); <em>see Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 503 n. 2, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977) (Marshall, J., concurring) (recognizing impact of discrimination on \u201csense of self\u201d). <em>See also Moore </em>v. <em>City of East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (impact of housing ordinance on family relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">Second, appellants argue that adult adop-tees constitute a suspect or \u201cquasi-suspect\u201d classification under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under this view semi-strict or intermediate scrutiny of the New York statutes would be appropriate, and appellants maintain that such a review does not indicate that the statutes are based on sufficiently important state interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-11\">Finally, appellants argue that the Thirteenth Amendment also applies to this case because the statutes that require sealing of the adoption records as to adults constitute the second of the five incidents of slavery\u2014 namely, the abolition of the parental relation \u2014 listed by Senator James Harlan of Iowa in a speech made during the deliberations on the Thirteenth Amendment. <em>See </em>1 B. Schwartz, <em>Statutory History of the United States: Civil Rights </em>71, 72 (1970). Furthermore, appellants say none of the exceptions to the Thirteenth Amendment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> covers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>appellants as adults. Under appellants\u2019 view, the rights that the Thirteenth Amendment guarantees are not subject to balancing but are instead protected absolutely. We will discuss each of appellants\u2019 three arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">\n<em>Substantive Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"arp-dedup-0\">What appellants assert is a right to \u201cper-sonhood.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They rely on a series of Supreme Court cases involving familial relationships, rights of family privacy, and freedom to marry and reproduce.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As they put it, \u201can adoptee is someone upon whom the State has, by sealing his records, imposed lifelong familial amnesia . . . injuring the adoptee in regard to his personal identity when he was too young to consent to, or even know, what was happening.\u201d The district court considered that intrusions on privacy are justifiable in the public interest, 459 F.Supp. at 916, but that the natural parent has a countervailing right of privacy and right to be let alone, <em>citing Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557, 89 S.Ct. 1300, 22 L.Ed.2d 557 (1969). The court also referred to the right of privacy of the adopting parents, presumably referring to \u201cthe disruption caused by locating their adoptive child\u2019s natural parents.\u201d 459 F.Supp. at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"AJn\">We could readily take a \u201cpigeon-hole\u201d approach and in doing so, because appellants\u2019 novel claims do not fit into any as yet recognized category of \u201cprivacy,\u201d exclude them. For example, there is not involved a general \u201cindividual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters,\u201d Whalen <em>v. Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 599, 97 S.Ct. 869, 876, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977). Although it could be argued that appellants do have an \u201cinterest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 599-600, 97 S.Ct. at 876<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that categorization still would leave the question whether in a situation involving both natural parents and adoptive parents the adult adoptee should have \u201cindependence\u201d in determining whether he or she shall obtain knowledge of the natural parents. So, too, with a categorization of privacy as including \u201crepose, sanctuary, and intimate decision,\u201d <em>see Comment, A Taxonomy of Privacy: Repose, Sanctuary, and Intimate Decision, </em>64 Cal.L.Rev. 1447 (1976) , or incorporating the rather vague concepts of \u201cautonomy,\u201d \u201cintimacy,\u201d and \u201cidentity.\u201d <em>See </em>Gerety, <em>Redefining Privacy, 12 </em>Harv.C.R.C.L.L.Rev. 233, 236, 268 (1977) ; see <em>generally </em>L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 15-2 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-13\">We think that it advances analysis, how.ever, to examine more closely , the character of the choices and information that we are asked to treat as special and the factual framework of the decision that we are asked to render. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 15 \u2014 1, at 887. We note, of course, that we \u00e1re dealing with the \u201cfamily\u201d in general and with two families in particular \u2014 first, the natural parent(s) who has (have) surrendered custody of the adoptee child to the State and in turn an agency or other family, and second, the adopting family which has, presumably nurtured the child to the age of adulthood. The adoptee\u2019s attainment of majority is a definite event in the adoptee\u2019s life; but it occurs independent of either the legally terminated natural family relationship or the legally assumed adoptive one and does not affect termination or continuation of those relationships. The information sought is information as to the identity of the real parent(s) that was concealed from one and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>all upon adoption as a matter of law and that may indeed have been a consideration in the willingness of the real parent(s) to give up the child for adoption. With this factual background two recent Supreme Court cases have a bearing upon our deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">The first of these is <em>Quilloin v. Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978). There the appellant, the natural father of an illegitimate child, sought to prevent the husband of the child\u2019s mother from adopting the child although the natural father had never attempted to legitimate the child who had always been in the mother\u2019s custody. The Court held that the application of a \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard did not violate appellant\u2019s substantive rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court noted its recognition that the relationship between parent and child is constitutionally protected, referring to <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); and <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). It also noted its own recognition in <em>Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944), that \u201cthe custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents.\u201d The Court expressed \u201clittle doubt\u201d that the State\u2019s attempt \u201cto force the break up of a natural family, over the objections of parents and children, without some showing of unfitness\u201d would violate the Due Process Clause, <em>citing Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality &amp; Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 862-63, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 2119, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 (1977) (Stewart, J., concurring). But the Court emphasized that \u201cthe result of the adoption in this case is to give full recognition to a family unit already in existence, a result desired by all concerned, except appellant.\u201d 434 U.S. at 255, 98 S.Ct. at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">Of course <em>Quilloin </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar because there a natural father who had never sought nor had actual or legal custody of a child was seeking to prevent adoption, while here the child himself \u2014 now an adult \u2014 is seeking information. But the relevance of the case is the Court\u2019s \u201cfull recognition [of] a family unit already in existence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And even though appellants are adults we must assume that they are still part of their adoptive families, families still in existence as to each of them which might be adversely affected by the release of information as to the names of natural parents or the unsealing of the adoption records. At-least it would seem that there is an interest on the part of the <em>adopting </em>parents that is of recognized importance, one that however, they surely can waive if they see fit to do so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">In <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 98 S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978), the second recent case, a majority of the Court held that the right to marry, a \u201cfundamental\u201d interest under the Equal Protection Clause, was abridged by a statute requiring court permission to marry where the applicant has minor issue not in his custody and whom he is under obligation to support. The \u201cright to marry\u201d was said to be \u201cof fundamental importance for all individuals,\u201d 434 U.S. at 384, 98 S.Ct. at 679, and \u201cpart of the fundamental \u2018right of privacy\u2019 implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court quoted the references in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 328, 13 L.Ed.2d 339 (1965), to marriage as \u201ccoming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred\u201d as well as \u201can association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects.\u201d Thus the Court held in <em>Zablocki </em>that the decision to marry was \u201camong the personal decisions protected by the right of privacy.\u201d 434 U.S. at 384, 98 S.Ct. at 679. <em>See also Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 639-40, 94 S.Ct. 791, 796, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974) (\u201cfreedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause\u201d). The <em>Zabloeki </em>Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-5\">The woman whom appellee desired to marry had a fundamental right to seek an abortion of their expected child . or to bring the child into life to suffer the myriad social, if not economic, disabilities that the status of illegitimacy brings .. Surely, a decision to marry and raise the child in a traditional family setting must receive equivalent protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\"><em>Id. </em>434 at 386, 98 S.Ct. at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">Again although <em>Zabloeki </em>is not directly pertinent to this case, it does recognize that we must look to the nature of the relationships and that choices made by those other than the adopted child are involved. Under all the applicable precedents, the State may take these choices into consideration and protect the natural mother\u2019s choice of privacy which not all have forsaken even if appellants are correct, as we are told, that many mothers would be willing in this day and age to have their adult adopted children contact them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> So, too, a state may take into account the relationship of the adopting parents, even if, as appellants assert, many of them would not object to or would even encourage the adopted child\u2019s seeking out the identity of or relationship with a natural parent. The New York statutes in providing for release of the information on a \u201cshowing of good cause\u201d do no more than to take these other relationships into account. As such they do not unconstitutionally infringe upon or arbitrarily remove appellants\u2019 rights of identity, privacy, or personhood. Upon an appropriate showing of psychological trauma, medical need, or of a religious identity crisis \u2014 though it might be doubted upon a showing of \u201cfear of unconscious incest\u201d-\u2014 the New York courts would appear required under their own statute to grant permission to release all or part of the sealed adoption records.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-11\">Appellants begin their equal protection analysis with the argument that adult adop-tees are a suspect classification (and the correlative argument that the State has no compelling interests to support the validity of the sealed records laws). Appellants refer us to <em>Trimble v. Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 766, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52 L.Ed.2d 31 (1977), where the Court stated that classifications based on illegitimacy fall in a \u201crealm of less than strictest scrutiny\u201d although the scrutiny \u201cis not a toothless one.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By the citation of <em>Trimble, </em>appellants suggest that they are at least entitled to the same level of constitutional scrutiny as illegitimates who have been termed a \u201csensitive\u201d or quasi-suspect category for which the appropriate level of scrutiny is \u201cintermediate,\u201d not \u201cstrict,\u201d <em>see </em>L. Tribe, <em>supra </em>\u00a7\u00a7 16-30, -31. But appellants cite us to no case holding that <em>adoptees </em>are a \u201csensitive\u201d or quasi-suspect classification. Instead they argue that because the overwhelming majority ' of adoptees adopted by nonrelatives are illegitimate and because, they say, the State actually treats adoptees <em>worse </em>than nonadopted illegitimates, who at least know who their natural mothers are or were and often their natural fathers as well, strict scrutiny is the applicable standard of analysis under the Equal Protection Clause. Of course, as Professor Gunther has said, scrutiny that is \u201c \u2018strict\u2019 in theory\u201d is usually \u201cfatal in fact,\u201d <em>Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection, </em>86 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 8 (1972). Second, appellants argue for application of \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d on the basis of suspect classification status under the Thirteenth Amendment on the theory that \u201c[a]ny group upon which a State imposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>. a badge or incident of slavery is <em>ipso facto </em>also a suspect category under the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">We are not persuaded that strict or even intermediate scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review in this case. Appellants\u2019 second strict scrutiny argument requires little discussion. The Supreme Court has been loathe to expand the list of traits subject to this most rigorous level of review,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and we are confident that the Court would not include a trait simply because it is a \u201cbadge or incident of slavery.\u201d Here, indeed, we cannot even conclude that the State has subjected appellants to such a \u201cbadge or incident,\u201d as the subsequent section of our opinion explains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">Appellants\u2019 first argument for strict scrutiny, although more plausible, is also flawed. Simply because most adult adop-tees are allegedly illegitimates, it does not follow that adoptees are subject to the same level of constitutional scrutiny as illegiti-mates, much less a greater level.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, there is a more fundamental, structural defect in the argument that discrimination between adult adoptees (who gain access to their adoption records only upon good cause) and non-adopted illegitimates (who will usually have ready access to the information that adoption records contain) is quasi-suspect. When a court decides that a classification is suspect or quasi-suspect, it has concluded that the State has employed a questionable trait to distinguish those whom the law should burden from those whom the law should not. Here, however, the distinguishing trait between adult adop-tees and nonadopted illegitimates, the allegedly similarly situated classes, is not illegitimacy \u2014 indeed, <em>both </em>of these classes are largely comprised of illegitimates, according to appellants. The trait, rather, is adopted status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">Appellants present no arguments in favor of treating classifications by adopted status as even quasi-suspect, entitled to an intermediate level of judicial scrutiny. Discrimination against illegitimates is generally so treated because of the illogic and injustice of stigmatizing a child in order to express disapproval of the parents\u2019 liaisons. <em>Mathews v. Lucas, </em>427 U.S. 495, 505, 95 S.Ct. 431, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976), <em>quoting Weber v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>406 U.S. 164, 175, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 31 L.Ed.2d 768 (1972). This rationale is less apposite to discrimination against adopted persons. If adopted persons experience social stigma, it is not as intense or pervasive as illegitimates suffer. Mpreover, the present statute notwithstanding, the adopted are not generally subject to extensive legal disabilities and thus have less of a claim to judicial protection than illegitimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-10\">Even assuming that the classification here were subject to intermediate scrutiny,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it would not violate equal protection; for we conclude that it is substantially related to an important state interest. <em>See Craig v. Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976). As noted above, appellants argue that they are similarly sit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>uated to non-adopted illegitimates. By their claim to suspect status, appellants apparently argue in the alternative that adopted persons should be compared to non-adopted persons generally. The question', in either case, is whether the two classes are sufficiently different with respect to an important governmental interest to justify treating the two classes differently.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In evaluating this question under the intermediate level of review we must, as in the case of rational basis scrutiny, look to the current articulation of the rationale of the statute as advanced by the appellants themselves, <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 314 &amp; n. 6, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (per curiam); <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 376, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974). We must be sure that the rationale advanced is not simply an afterthought supplied purely by hindsight. <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 653, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring). Rather, we must look to the actual purposes of the statute, <em>Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, </em>420 U.S. 636, 648 n. 16, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975); <em>see also Eisenstadt v. Baird, </em>405 U.S. 438, 448-49, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), and we must ensure that the individual has the opportunity to rebut any overbroad presumptions that seriously affect the fairness of the scheme. <em>Craig v. Boren, supra, </em>429 U.S. at 199, 97 S.Ct. 451; <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, supra; Crawford v. Cushman, </em>531 F.2d 1114, 1123-26 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Judged by these standards, the New York sealed record statutes do not want constitutional validity. The statutes, we think, serve important interests. New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 114 and its related statutes represent a considered legislative judgment that the confidentiality statutes promote the social policy underlying adoption laws. <em>See In re Anonymous, </em>89 Misc.2d 132, 133, 390 N.Y.S.2d 779, 781 (Surr.Ct.1976). Originally, sealing adoption records was discretionary with the court, 1924 N.Y.Laws, ch. 323, \u00a7 113, but in 1938 confidentiality of adoption records became mandatory. 1938 N.Y.Laws, ch. 606 \u00a7 114. As late as 1968, the legislature enacted various amendments to increase the assurance of confidentiality. 1968 N.Y.Laws, ch. 1038. Moreover, the purpose of a related statute, Section 4138 of the Public Health Laws, was to erase the stigma of illegitimacy from the adopted child\u2019s life by sealing his original birth certificate and issuing a new one under his new surname. ' And the major purpose of adoption legislation is to encourage natural parents to use the process when they are unwilling or unable to care for their offspring. New York has established a careful \u2022 legislative scheme governing when adoption may occur and providing for judicial review, to encourage and facilitate the social policy of placing children in permanent loving homes when a natural family breaks up. As the court of appeals stated in <em>Scarpetta v. Spence-Chapin Adoption Service, </em>28 N.Y.2d 185, 195, 321 N.Y.S.2d 65, 73, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 805, 321 N.Y.S.2d 65, 269 N.E.2d 787 (1971), \u201c[i]t cannot be doubted that the public policy of our State is contrary to the disclosure of the names and identities of the natural parents and prospective adoptive parents to each other.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Forty-two other states, according to the State of New York, require that birth and adoption records be kept confidential, indicating the importance of the matter of confidentiality. <em>See also </em>Uniform Adoption Act (U.L.A.) \u00a7 16(2) (rev. 1969) (adoption records \u201c\u00e1re subject to insp\u00e9ction only upon consent of the Court and all interested persons; or in exceptional cases, only upon an order of the Court for good cause shown\u201d). These significant legislative goals clearly justify the State\u2019s decision to keep the natural parents\u2019 names secret from adopted persons but not from non-adopted persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">To be sure, once an adopted child reaches adulthood, some of the considerations that apply at the time of adoption and through<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>out the child\u2019s tender years no longer apply or apply with less force. Illegitimacy might stigmatize an adult less than a child, and the goal of encouraging adoption of unwanted and uncared for children might not be significantly affected if <em>adult </em>adoptees could discover their natural parents\u2019 identities. But the state does have an interest that does not wane as the adopted child grows to adulthood, namely, the interest in protecting the privacy of the natural parents. \u201c[T]he liberty interest in family privacy has its source, and its contours are ordinarily to be sought, not in state law, but in intrinsic human rights . . . <em>Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality &amp; Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 845, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 2110, 2111, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 (1977) (footnote omitted) (examining the right of a natural family to the return of its child from the care of a foster family). Whether or not the State\u2019s interest is \u201ccompelling,\u201d as the court in <em>Mills v. Atlantic City Department of Vital Statistics, </em>148 N.J.Super. 302, 372 A.2d 646, 653 (Super.Ct.Ch.Div.1977), and the court below, 459 F.Supp, at 917, suggested, it is an important interest, and one which justifies keeping the records confidential regardless of the adopted child\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">We also believe that the statutory classification is \u201csubstantially\u201d related to this interest. To be sure, the law is somewhat overinclusive; for some natural parents undoubtedly would not object to revealing their identities, to their children, and some adult adoptees have an extraordinary need for their records that might outweigh their natural parents\u2019 need for privacy. But a law does not violate equal protection simply because it results in overinclusion or under-inclusion, <em>i. e., </em>some \u201cmisfit.\u201d The question, rather, is whether the differences between those burdened and those not burdened by a law are substantial enough to justify treating the two classes differently.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Here, the legislature has not unreasonably concluded that a larger proportion of the natural parents of adopted children than of non-adopted children would want to keep their identities private. That is enough to make the statutory classification constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-7\">Moreover, we note that the provision for release of adoption records \u201con good cause shown\u201d substantially mitigates the possible overbreadth of the statute. The New York courts have granted access for aid in psychiatric or psychological treatment, <em>In re \u201cAnonymous,\u201d </em>92 Misc.2d 224, 399 N.Y.S.2d 857 (Surr.Ct.1977); <em>In re Maxtone-Graham, </em>90 Misc.2d 107, 393 N.Y.S.2d 835 (Surr.Ct.1975), and for information about genetic conditions. <em>In re Chattman, </em>57 A.D.2d 618, 393 N.Y.S.2d 768 (1977). Thus this case presents an entirely different situation from what it would have if the State permitted no access on any ground. The permitted showing of good cause promotes individualized treatment, a form of structural justice. <em>See Crawford v. Cushman, supra; </em>L. Tribe, <em>supra, </em>ch. 17. Appellants do not suggest that the New York courts have been overly reluctant to find good cause; we certainly must assume the contrary. Indeed, the cases to which' the parties have referred us indicate that some New York courts have appropriately recognized good cause in a variety of circumstances. We find, in short, no basis, even under the intermediate scrutiny standard, for holding that the New York statutes violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">\n<em>Thirteenth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">Appellants make the novel argument, one concededly not based on the decided cases, that the Thirteenth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of slavery and involuntary servitude gives them an <em>absolute </em>right to release of their adoption records. Appellants first assert that what rights the Thirteenth Amendment protects it protects absolutely, that is, there is no balancing test and no interest of any kind that can preclude enforcement of the proscriptions where they apply. Second, appellants assert that the Thirteenth Amendment does in fact apply here. The argument is, as we have suggested, that in abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude the Framers also intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>to abolish five \u201cnecessary incidents of slavery.\u201d We address only the second point because we find that the Amendment is entirely inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Appellants refer us particularly to the speech of Senator James Harlan of Iowa of April 6, 1864, in which he set forth a number of such incidents. The second named was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-6\">the abolition practically of the parental relation, robbing the offspring of the care and attention of his parents, severing a relation which is universally cited as the emblem of the relation sustained by the Creator to the human family. And yet, according to the matured judgment of these slave States, this guardianship of the parent over his own children must be abrogated to secure the perpetuity of slavery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">1 B. Schwartz, <em>supra, </em>at 72. Appellants go so far as to say that the New York sealed record system is \u201cless humane\u201d than New Mexico peonage, under which system a child contracted into peonage ceased to be bound upon obtaining the age of majority, <em>see Jaremillo v. Romero, </em>1 N.M. 190 (1857), because New York adoptees are subject to a <em>\u201clifelong </em>denial of knowledge of their natural origins.\u201d Appellants liken their situation also to that of the antebellum South where a slave child was \u201csold off\u201d while too young to remember his parents and grew up separated from them by inability to communicate as well as by distance. The analogy according to appellants is that however literate they may be, they cannot write to their natural parents, cannot visit them, and thereby wear a \u201cbadge or incident\u201d of slavery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">This Thirteenth Amendment argument simply does not conform to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations of the Thirteenth Amendment. The Court has never held that the Amendment itself, unaided by legislation as it is here, reaches the \u201cbadges and incidents\u201d of slavery as well as the actual conditions of slavery and involuntary servitude. <em>See Palmer v. Thompson, </em>403 U.S. 217, 226-27, 91 S.Ct. 1940, 29 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971); <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 439, 440, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968); <em>Plessy v. Ferguson, </em>163 U.S. 537, 542, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896); <em>The Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. 3, 20-21, 23, 24, 25, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883); <em>The Slaughter-House Cases, </em>83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36, 69, 72, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873). Indeed, all indications are to the contrary. Notwithstanding Congress\u2019s broad authority to legislate under \u00a7 2 of the Amendment, <em>Palmer, supra; Jones, supra; The Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. at 20-21, the Court has directly invoked the Amendment only to strike down state laws imposing the condition of peonage. <em>See Pollock v. Williams, </em>322 U.S. 4, 64 S.Ct. 792, 88 L.Ed. 1095 (1944); <em>Bailey v. Alabama, </em>219 U.S. 219, 31 S.Ct. 145, 55 L.Ed. 191 (1911). Moreover, the Court has indicated that for purposes of judicial enforcement under the express prohibition of the Amendment itself \u2014 \u201c[n]either slavery nor involuntary servitude . shall exist\u201d \u2014 the Court will define \u201cslavery\u201d narrowly. <em>Palmer, supra. </em>Abolition of the badges and incidents the Court has left to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-10\">Appellants do not argue that the denial of complete access to and disclosure of their adoption records constitutes the imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude. Rather, appellants\u2019 argument is that \u201cNew York\u2019s sealed records laws impose upon them [an] incident of slavery\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Thirteenth Amendment . all by itself and without any aid from an act of Congress abolished and destroyed \u2018the incidents of slavery.\u2019 \u201d The decided cases show that we must reject this absolutist view of the Thirteenth Amendment. Even as the first Mr. Justice Harlan dissented in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson, supra, </em>on the ground that the Louisiana statute which required separate railway accommodations for white and black passengers infringed \u201cthe personal liberty,\u201d 163 U.S. at 557, 16 S.Ct. 1138, guaranteed under the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, he indicated that the Thirteenth Amendment alone could not have required such a result. Although he wrote that the Amendment \u201cprevents the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>any burdens or disabilities that constitute badges of slavery or servitude,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 555, 16 S.Ct. at 1145, still he did not adopt the absolutist position urged herein. Rather, he stated that the Amendment was \u201cinadequate to the protection of the rights of those who had been in slavery\u201d; and so \u201cit was followed by the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the Thirteenth Amendment had by its own force and effect abolished all badges and incidents, all vestiges, of slavery, it would not have been inadequate. So, too, in his dissent in <em>The Civil Rights Cases, supra, </em>Mr. Justice Harlan advanced the position not that the Thirteenth Amendment itself had abolished the \u201cburdens [and] disabilities [which] constitute badges of slavery and servitude,\u201d 163 U.S. at 555, 16 S.Ct. at 1145, but that Congress had the authority under its power to eradicate the badges and incidents to require equal accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The problem, then, with appellants\u2019 argument is that it proves too much. Abolition under the Amendment itself of all of the \u201cincidents\u201d to which Senator Harlan referred would incorporate into the Thirteenth Amendment the privacy interests in the conjugal and parental relation, the right to hold property, the right to bring suit in court, the right to testify, freedom of speech and of the press, and the right to an equal education. <em>See </em>1 B. Schwartz, <em>supra, </em>at 72-74. Such a result would be inconsistent with the explicit or implicit rationale of many Supreme Court cases dealing with these rights. The Court would not have had to incorporate the First Amendment in the Fourteenth to make it applicable to the States in, <em>e.g., Fiske v. Kansas, </em>274 U.S. 380, 47 S.Ct. 655, 71 L.Ed. 1108 (1927), or <em>Near v. Minnesota, </em>283 U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931), if the Thirteenth Amendment had already done so; nor in fact would state action be required for a First Amendment violation, see <em>Hudgens v. NLRB, </em>424 U.S. 507, 513, 96 S.Ct. 1029, 47 L.Ed.2d 196 (1976), because the Thirteenth Amendment reaches private conduct. <em>See Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 104-05, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971); <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra. </em>The Court\u2019s privacy decisions, <em>see </em>notes 9-10 and accompanying text <em>supra, </em>would have rested on the Thirteenth Amendment and not some combination or penumbra of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, <em>see Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 484-86, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965); and, perhaps, there would have been no dispute over the equal funding of public school systems. <em>See San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). Moreover, appellants\u2019 absolutist view of the Thirteenth Amendment would render largely superfluous the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the civil rights statutes now codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 <em>et seq. </em>We are appropriately reluctant to reach such a result. The Supreme Court has never considered that the \u201cbadges or incidents\u201d went beyond those listed in the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, <em>viz., </em>a lack of \u201c \u2018the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, </em>392 U.S. at 441 n. 78, 88 S.Ct. at 2204 n. 78, <em>citing The Civil Rights Cases, supra, </em>109 U.S. at 22, 3 S.Ct. 18; <em>see Griffin v. Breckenridge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">As an additional matter, we point out the doubtful applicability of the second incident of slavery, upon which appellants rely, to the sealed records laws. Although it is doubtless true that an \u201cincident\u201d of slavery (in the original sense) was the abolition of the parental relation, <em>i. e., </em>the offspring of a slave was deprived of the care and attention of parents, <em>see </em>1 B. Schwartz, <em>supra, </em>the New York sealed records laws do not deprive appellants of their parental relation. It is the New York adoption laws themselves and not the sealed records laws that recognize the divestment by natural parents of their guardianship because of formal surrender, abandonment, or forfeiture by unfitness or jeopardy of the child\u2019s best interests; and it is the adoption laws that create a new parent-child relationship between appellants and their adoptive par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>ents. Appellants do not challenge the constitutionality of the adoption laws; thus their challenge to the sealed records laws, even if cognizable under the Thirteenth Amendment in the absence of congressional legislation, is misdirected. Appellants are left to their remedies under the New York statute or with the New York legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ah0\">.

Appellant\u2019s argument appears to invoke disproportionate impact analysis. But the Supreme Court has held, in the context of racial discrimination, that the disproportionate impact of state action upon a suspect class does not, by itself, warrant strict scrutiny. <em>Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). Similarly, the disproportionate impact of New York\u2019s policy upon illegitimates does not by itself warrant the intermediate scrutiny that an explicit discrimination against illegitimates would justify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1322-11\">. In arguing that the adoptees here are an even more \u201csuspect\u201d group than illegitimates, appellants allege that adoptees are treated more unfairly than illegitimates because adop-tees do not know their natural parents\u2019 identities. To the extent that this argument emphasizes appellants\u2019 interest in securing that knowledge, it is better understood as an argument for fundamental interest status than for suspect category status. But we do not believe that such an interest should be considered fundamental, largely for the reasons given in our discussion of the substantive due process argument. Even if the interest is \u201cquasi-fundamental\u201d and subject to intermediate scrutiny, the classification is not invalid, as the text <em>infra </em>indicates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">.
