An employer and its insurer petition us to review the December 29, 1978 order of the Benefits Review Board, [BRB], United States Department of Labor affirming the order of the administrative law judge [ALJ] awarding compensation to Thomas Shaughnessy [hereinafter \u201cclaimant\u201d] pursuant to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. 44 Stat. 1424; 86 Stat. 1251. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1976) [LHWCA].</p>\n<p id=\"b759-27\">The petition assigns no specific error. (App. la). Petitioners\u2019 brief (p. 2), reciting that \u201cthe sole question presented is whether the claimant\u2019s injury \u2022 . . . meets the jurisdictional requirements (status) of the Act,\u201d discusses only whether plaintiff was an \u201cemployee\u201d within \u00a7 2(3) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The employee question is also the only issue discussed by respondents\u2019 briefs. However, as will appear, we are of the opinion that we can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>not avoid another question \u2014 whether the respondent Walter Tantzen, Inc. was an \u201cemployer\u201d within \u00a7 2(4) of LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The AU made the following brief findings <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as to the nature of the employer\u2019s business and of the claimant\u2019s work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeu-dedup-0\">Employer was engaged in the business of weighing, sampling, and inspection of various imported commodities, including rubber, the material being handled by Claimant on October 21, 1974. Employer is hired by the importing dealers or their agents. The particular material being handled is unloaded from the ship by longshoremen and placed inside the pier. From that point Employer\u2019s personnel move the commodity in position to be weighed, after which the bale is opened by means of pry bars and a cutting instrument to be inspected. The container is reclosed by Employer\u2019s men, and then the commodity is moved by longshoremen to its ultimate destination to be accepted by the consignee. Employer\u2019s main functions are weighing, reconditioning, and sampling the commodity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">On the basis of his limited findings the AU stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\">I find and conclude that Employer is engaged [sic] in maritime employment, and that at the time of his injury Claimant was doing [sic] likewise. It is clear that the weighing, sampling, and reconditioning of the cargo prior to delivery to the consignee is [sic] an integral and essential part of the process of unloading and movement of the commodity to the point where it is turned over to the consignee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">Accordingly, the AU entered a compensation order for claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">Upon appeal by the employer and its insurer, a majority of three members of the BRB concluded that the claimant was \u201cengaged in longshoring operations\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(3) which was a \u201ctype of maritime employment within the meaning of \u00a7 2(3) of the Act\u201d (App. 17a. Compare App. 15a) and, therefore, the BRB entered its December 29, 1978 order affirming the AU\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">We do not find it necessary on this inadequate record<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to decide whether Shaugh-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>nessy was indeed \u201cengaged in longshoring operations.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">An examination of the record reveals no evidence that Shaughnessy or any other employee of Tantzen was ever upon actual, as distinguished from statutorily defined, navigable waters of the United States (hereinafter sometimes called \u201cactual water\u201d). Nor do either the ALJ or the BRB say that Shaughnessy or any other employee of Tantzen was on actual water. What they do say or imply is that the fact that Shaughnessy was engaged in longshoring operations means that he was in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d within the meaning of both \u00a7 2(3) and \u00a7 2(4) and that it follows that Tantzen was an employer within \u00a7 2(4). In our opinion, this reasoning involves a <em>nonsequitur, </em>a misconstruction of \u00a7 2(3), an incorrect interpretation of the term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d as used in both \u00a7 2(3) and \u00a7 2(4), a misapplication of the cases holding that once it has been determined that a claimant is engaged in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d it follows that his employer is an employer within \u00a7 2(4), and a result squarely contrary to a declared Congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In <em>Fusco et al. v. Perini et al., </em>601 F.2d 659 (2nd Cir. 1979) we explained that, as used in \u00a7 2(3), the phrase a \u201cperson engaged in maritime employment\u201d is to be read geographically as meaning a person engaged in employment upon actual water. When \u00a7 2(3) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman,\u201d \u00a7 2(3) uses the word \u201cincluding\u201d inexactly; as there used \u201cincluding\u201d means \u201cas well as.\u201d \u00a7 2(3) does not say, what obviously is not the case, that every longshoreman is engaged in employment upon actual water. Hence the <em>mere </em>fact that employment is longshoring operations is a type of employment within \u00a7 2(3) does <em>not </em>make it a type of \u201cmaritime employment\u201d as those two words are used in \u00a7 2(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Nor is employment in longshoring operations on land \u201cmaritime employment\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 2(4). As <em>Fusco v. Perini, supra, </em>details at length, and as <em>Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962) finally settled, the term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d as used in \u00a7 2(4) means employment seaward of the line drawn by <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, </em>244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1917). There is no showing that Shaughnessy or any other Tantzen employee ever spent any part of any working day seaward of the <em>Jensen </em>line.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The cases to which the BRB refers, such as <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348 (1977) and <em>Handcor Inc. v. Director, </em>568 F.2d 143, 144 (9th Cir. 1978), and cases like <em>I.T.O. Corp. of Baltimore v. Benefits Review Board, </em>529 F.2d 1080, 1083 (4th Cir. 1975), <em>modified en banc on other grounds, </em>542 F.2d 903 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>vacated and remanded sub nom. Adkins v. I.T.O. Corp. of Baltimore, </em>433 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 2967, 53 L.Ed.2d 1088 (1977), <em>rev\u2019d on remand on other grounds, </em>563 F.2d 646 (1977), as well as texts such as 4 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1979) \u00a7 89.27 p. 16-178, and Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty (2d ed., 1975), p. 429, lines 14-16, which indicate that once the claimant\u2019s status as an \u201cemployee\u201d is established the employer automatically becomes an \u201cemployer\u201d failed to consider the problem presented by the instant case\u2014 where a worker claims the status of a statutory \u00a7 2(3) \u201cemployee\u201d because he is a longshoreman but is not himself in maritime employment. What those authorities say about the claimant\u2019s proving that his employer is a statutory \u00a7 2(4) employer by proving that he is a \u00a7 2(3) employee is true if and only if the employee also proves that he is employed over actual water.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">That the foregoing statement is sound is convincingly shown by the Congressional Committee Reports which accompanied the 1972 amendments to the 1927 LHWCA. See S.Rep.No.92-1125, 92 Cong. 2 Sess. (1972) and H.R.Rep.No.92-1441, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4698. The Committees were explicit in their intention to exclude from LHWCA liability any employer who had no employees on actual water:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">Likewise the Committee has no intention of extending coverage under the Act to individuals who are not employed by a person who is an employer, i. e., a person at least some of whose employees are engaged, in whole or in part, in some form of maritime employment. Thus, an individual employed by a person none of whose employees work, in whole or in part, on navigable waters, is not covered even if injured on a pier adjoining navigable waters. S.Rep. 13; H.R.Rep. 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Although we must set aside the BRB\u2019s December 29,1978 order because there is no proof that the employer Tantzen is subject to the LHWCA, we, in remanding the case, leave the BRB free in its turn to remand the case to an ALJ to hear any evidence that shows that in fact Shaughnessy or any other Tantzen employee was employed in maritime employment in the sense of employment upon actual water. Such a reopening of the case may seem fair in view of a misunderstanding so generally shared in this case by all, and not even exposed in the briefs or at the oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">If the case is re-opened it might be appropriate to take further evidence and to make more specific findings as to (1) Shaughnes-sy\u2019s own duties, (2) what, if any, duties longshoremen perform in connection with weighing, opening, inspecting, and reconditioning the contents of bales or other packages of individual consignees, and (3) what form of report, if any, a scaleman like Shaughnessy makes to the longshoremen who pick up bales when the scaleman has finished his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">\n<em>Petition granted.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">\n<em>The December 29, 1978 Benefits Review Board order is set aside and the case is remanded to the Benefits Review Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-17\">. The relevant statutory section defining \u201cemployee,\u201d with italics indicating the material added to the original statute by 1972 amendments, 86 Stat. 1251, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3) (1970 ed., Supp. V) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-18\">The term \u2018employee\u2019 <em>means any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harbor-worker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker, but such term </em>does not include a master or member of a crew of any vessel, or any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\">. \u201cEmployer\u201d was defined in . 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">The term \u2018employer\u2019 means an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment, in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States [including any dry dock],</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\">. We deprecate the course followed by the BRB in supplementing the ALJ\u2019s findings with its own findings, especially on contested matters. Congress provided that \u201cthe findings of fact [by the ALJ] in the decision under review by the [Benefits Review] Board shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d \u00a7 21(b)(3) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3) (Supp. III, 1973). <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maintenance Service, </em>529 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Potenza v. United Terminals, </em>524 F.2d 1136, 1137 (2nd Cir. 1975). If additional findings are necessary the BRB may \u201cremand a case to the administrative law judge\u201d to make additional findings. \u00a7 21(b)(4) of the LHWCA; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(4). Except with respect to uncontested matters, the BRB is not entitled to make its own findings of fact, nor are we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-10\">. The inadequate record makes it difficult, if not impossible, to know what duties longshoremen customarily perform. We repeat the suggestion of Judge Friendly in <em>Pittston Stevedoring Corp. v. Dellaventura, </em>544 F.2d 35, 47 (2nd Cir. 1976), approved on appeal by the Supreme Court, <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 272-273, note 34, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 53 L.Ed.2d 320, that the BRB prepare a study of what work longshoremen perform. We, apparently like Judge Friendly and Mr. Justice Marshall, would regard it as appropriate for the BRB, even though it is not a fact-finding body (see 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 21(b)(3)) and has only review functions, to use such a study in later reviews of orders of ALJ\u2019s. This would amount to an exercise of judicial notice with respect to facts \u201ceither generally known,\u201d or \u201ccapable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d This would be in accordance with Fed.R.Evidence 201(a), which, although not controlling BRB or other tribunals acting in an appellate capacity, as is evident from Fed.R.Evidence 1101, nonetheless sets a standard appropriate for an appellate tribunal which contemplates taking judicial notice of any matter. <em>United States v. Casson, </em>140 U.S.App.D.C. 141, 148, 434 F.2d 415, 422 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">. On the record as it now stands we cannot tell whether Shaughnessy\u2019s case is distinguishable from Blundo\u2019s case decided in <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977). Blundo in opening containers, checking the contents, stripping from the containers the cargo, marking the separate shipments destined for different consignees, and placing those shipments in a bonded warehouse was performing in a new setting work which was the <em>functional equivalent of </em>what longshoremen had previously done. It was for that reason that the Court held that Blundo was engaged in longshoring operations. <em>Ibid, </em>pp. 270-271, 97 S.Ct. 2348. Until we know more about what longshoremen customarily do we cannot tell whether there is a similar equivalency with respect to Shaugh-nessy\u2019s duties in weighing bales which belong to an individual consignee, opening them, inspecting them, reconditioning their contents, and reclosing them. Obviously, what Shaugh-nessy does is directed at the weighing of n particular consignee\u2019s shipment and the inspection and reconditioning of its contents, and we are uninformed as to what longshoremen do with respect to individual shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"AS3\">Moreover, the present findings of the ALJ do not show clearly whether after Shaughnessy has finished his inspection he, in effect like a switchman, directs a gang of longshoremen whether to take the bales to the consignee\u2019s truck or to take them to a storage warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"A4gq\">In pointing to these <em>lacunae, </em>we have not indicated whether we agree with Shaughnes-sy\u2019s contention and the BRB\u2019s view that the word \u201cengaged\u201d in the phrase \u201cengaged in longshoring operations\u201d means merely \u201cdirectly involved.\u201d See <em>Brady-Hamilton Stevedore Co. v. Herron, </em>568 F.2d 137 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Texports Stevedore Co. v. Winchester, </em>554 F.2d 245, 247 (5th Cir.), <em>second pet. for rehearing on other grounds granted, </em>569 F.2d 428 (1978); <em>J. A. McCarthy, Inc. </em>v.
