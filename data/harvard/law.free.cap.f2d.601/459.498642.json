WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A4F\">Castillo-Felix petitions for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order denying him discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1976). He asserts that the Board incorrectly interpreted the statutory phrase \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Petitioner, a citizen and native of Mexico, illegally entered this country in 1963. Shortly thereafter, he commenced a common law relationship with a woman alien who had been admitted for permanent residence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They now have five children, all born in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Petitioner was apprehended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in November, 1969, and was given leave to depart voluntarily, at government expense, in lieu of deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g) (1976). He left the country for one day, then illegally returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">In October 1970, petitioner married his common law wife. He was apprehended the same year and again was granted voluntary departure, this time at his own expense. He remained in this country, however, because the INS proceeded to grant him a series of extensions of his voluntary departure date pending his receipt of a permanent resident visa. The visa was granted and he lawfully entered this country on April 7, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">In August of 1975, petitioner was convict-' ed of knowingly inducing the entry of two illegal aliens into the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(4) (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He began serving two consecutive three-year terms<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the INS commenced deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">In those proceedings, petitioner conceded deportability but applied for discretionary relief under \u00a7 1182(c). In June of 1977, the Immigration Judge denied the requested relief because petitioner had not been continuously domiciled in this country for seven years subsequent to his admission for permanent residence in 1972. The judge added that, even if petitioner had met the domicile requirement, he would exercise his discretion to deny relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-20\">The BIA affirmed the judge\u2019s decision on the statutory ineligibility ground alone. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>declined to address whether the Immigration Judge could have properly exercised his discretion to deny relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Aliens who seek admission may be excluded if they fall within any of the categories enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). Section 1182(c) waives the exclusion provisions for certain aliens with established roots in this country. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab4\">Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (l)-(25), (30), and (31) of subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1976). Although originally applicable only to exclusion proceedings, \u00a7 1182(c) has been extended to deportation proceedings when deportees meet the requirements of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">According to the literal language of this provision, it applies only to aliens who are (1) \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence,\u201d (2) returning to a \u201clawful unrelin-quished domicile of seven consecutive years,\u201d and who (3) \u201ctemporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Petitioner concededly meets the first requirement. He was lawfully admitted for permanent residence in 1972. The third requirement, actual departure, was not addressed below, and we cannot reach it here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The BIA found petitioner ineligible for relief because he failed to meet the second requirement, returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">\n<em>LAWFUL UNRELINQUISHED DOMICILE:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">The INS maintains that an alien cannot be lawfully domiciled in this country unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d It has consistently applied \u00a7 1182(c) only to aliens domiciled in this country for seven or more years <em>after </em>their admission for permanent residence. <em>Matter of Anwo, </em>Interim Decision # 2604 (BIA 1977), <em>affirmed sub nom. Anwo v. INS, </em>No. 77-1879 (D.C.Cir. June 19,1979);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Matter of S, </em>5 I&amp;N Dec. 116 (BIA 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Petitioner argues that aliens may be lawfully domiciled in this country without having been admitted for permanent residence. In his view, because admission for permanent residence is separate from the lawful domicile requirement, aliens who have lived here lawfully for seven or more consecutive years can obtain \u00a7 1182(c) relief, regardless of when they were admitted for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">He relies primarily on <em>Lok </em>v. <em>INS, </em>548 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1977), in which the Second Circuit rejected the INS interpretation of \u00a7 1182(c). The INS argues that <em>Lok </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The <em>Lok </em>court first examined the language of \u00a7 1182(c). It noted that \u201cadmission for permanent residence\u201d is carefully defined,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile\u201d is not defined anywhere in the Act. It also noted that some nonimmigrant aliens may be lawfully domiciled in this country without having been admitted for permanent residence. From these facts, it reasoned that lawful domicile could not be equated with admission for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The court then examined the legislative history of \u00a7 1182(c), which is an amended version of the 7th Proviso to \u00a7 3 of the Immigration Act of 1917. That Proviso reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">[Ajliens returning after a temporary absence to an unrelinquished United States domicile of seven consecutive years may be admitted in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, and under such conditions as he may prescribe:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">Act of Feb. 5,1917, ch. 29, \u00a7 3, 39 Stat. 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">The 7th Proviso gave the Secretary virtually unfettered discretion to grant relief to long-time resident aliens returning to the United States after a temporary absence. In the amended version, \u00a7 1182(c), Congress clearly limited that discretion by adding new requirements: that the aliens be (1) lawfully admitted for permanent residence, and (2) returning to a <em>lawful </em>unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">The <em>Lok </em>court concluded that Congress did not intend the seven years of lawful domicile to follow admission for permanent residence. The court noted that the Senate Judiciary Committee apparently rejected a version of \u00a7 1182(c) which would have explicitly required accumulation of the seven years of domicile after admission for permanent residence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also pointed to other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>provisions of the act in which Congress clearly expressed its intention that a period of domicile follow admission for permanent residence, <em>e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1427(a)(1), 1430(a) (1976), and reasoned that Congress would have done so here, had it intended that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The <em>Lok </em>court acknowledged that interpretations of an Act by the agency responsible for administering it are usually accorded great deference, citing <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). Nevertheless, it reversed the agency, impelled by a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">heavy responsibility to set aside administrative decisions that are inconsistent with a statutory mandate or which frustrate the congressional policy underlying legislation, <em>see N. L. R. B. v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 290-92, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">548 F.2d at 40. We cannot agree that the INS interpretation of \u00a7 1182(c) is \u201cinconsistent with a statutory mandate or . frustrate^] the congressional policy\u201d behind this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The statutory mandate in \u00a7 1182(c) is ambiguous. The language of the section could support either the INS interpretation or that adopted in <em>Lok. </em>The fact that the phrase \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d is carefully defined elsewhere in the act does not negate the possibility that Congress intended to establish permanent resident status as the prerequisite for \u201clawful\u201d domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">Similarly, the fact that a small group of nonimmigrants could conceivably qualify as \u201clawfully\u201d domiciled within this country without acquiring permanent resident status does not persuade us that \u201clawful\u201d should be defined without reference to the phrase \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">We emphasize first that most non-immigrants must have a residence in a foreign country which they do not intend to abandon, or must be here for a temporary purpose, or both.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To establish domicile,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> aliens must not only be physically present here, but must intend to remain. If aliens are here for a temporary purpose, they cannot establish domicile. Conversely, if they intend to stay, they violate the terms of their admission and are no longer here lawfully. <em>See Anwo v. INS, </em>No. 77-1879, slip op. at 6-7 and n.8 (D.C.Cir. June 19, 1979), quoting <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>Moreno, </em>435 U.S. 647, 98 S.Ct. 1338, 1349, 55 L.Ed.2d 614 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">The INS concedes that a small group of nonimmigrants including diplomats, foreign government representatives and their retinues, treaty traders, and media representatives,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> are not required to maintain a foreign residence, and may be here for other than temporary purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>It is not reasonable to conclude, however, that by using the term \u201clawful unrelin-quished domicile\u201d in the same statute with the phrase \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence,\u201d Congress intended to benefit only this small and rather exclusive group of nonimmigrants in addition to aliens with permanent resident visas.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such an interpretation strains the language of the statute. Had Congress intended that result, it would have said so more clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The <em>Lok </em>court found support for its conclusion in the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s apparent rejection of language which would have clearly required admission for permanent residence before establishment of lawful domicile. Unfortunately, we can only speculate about the Committee members\u2019 reasons for not including this language. They might have considered it superfluous, believing that the enacted version adequately conveyed their intent that admission for permanent residence precede the seven years of domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We are left with an ambiguous provision with little legislative history to clarify how Congress intended it to be applied. The INS, the agency charged with interpreting the immigration laws,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> first interpreted \u00a7 1182(c) in 1953<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and has adhered to its position for 26 years. We stated in <em>Baur v. Mathews, </em>578 F.2d 228, 233 (9th Cir. 1978):<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">The administrative agency clothed with responsibility for implementing congressional pronouncements is generally well acquainted with the policy of the statute it administers. This is particularly true when the agency has long been involved in the construction and administration of a given statute or its predecessors. Where, as here, the agency has extensive experience, has relied on the common meaning of the relevant statute\u2019s specific language, and can point to important congressional purposes furthered by its interpretation, only a clear showing of a contrary intent by Congress will justify overruling the agency\u2019s regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-11\"><em>See also DHL Corp. v. C. A. B., </em>584 F.2d 914, 919-20 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Nazareno v. Attorney General of United States, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 26, 512 F.2d 936, 940 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">In <em>Matter of Anwo, </em>Interim Decision # 2604 (BIA 1977), <em>affirmed sub. nom. Anwo v. INS, </em>No. 77-1879 (D.C.Cir. June 19, 1979), the BIA set forth the \u201cimportant congressional purposes furthered by its interpretation.\u201d It acknowledged that the 7th Proviso, the predecessor to \u00a7 1182(c), is a humanitarian statute designed to mitigate the harsh effects of the immigration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Such a provision is normally read liberally to effectuate its ameliorative purpose. <em>Wadman v. </em>INS, 329 F.2d 812 (9th Cir. 1964). The BIA stresses, however, that Congress enacted \u00a7 1182(c) primarily to limit the class of aliens eligible for relief,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and in fact considered deleting the provision entirely.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It asserted that its interpretation furthers Congress\u2019 restrictive intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The BIA also cautioned, in <em>Matter of Anwo, </em>against adopting an interpretation of \u00a7 1182(c) that will undermine other provisions of the Act, particularly \u00a7 1254(a) dealing with relief from deportation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">Suspension of deportation under section 244(a) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)] of the Act is potentially available to the class of aliens, whether in illegal, nonimmigrant, or resident status, who satisfy the seven or ten-year United States residence requirements. However, the applicant for section 244(a) relief must also meet strict qualitative requirements. He must establish that he has been a person of good moral character throughout the statutory period. He must establish that his deportation would cause an extreme degree of hardship to himself or to specified relatives who are United States citizens or lawful permanent residents. In short, whether the applicant is illegal, a nonim-migrant, or a lawful permanent resident, his mere residence in the United States for a period of seven or ten years will not entitle him to relief from deportation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoO-\">By contrast, section 212(c) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c)] imposes no strict standards which must be met before an applicant is able to escape deportation. The alien applying for section 212(c) relief has only to show that he is a lawful permanent resident and that he has maintained a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile\u201d in the United States for a period of seven consecutive years. In light of the lesser standards which must be met before relief from deportation can be accorded under section 212(c), the class of aliens to which it applies must therefore be distinct from, and possess a stronger rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tionship with this country than, the class of aliens eligible for suspension of deportation. Otherwise, the hardship and good moral character requirements of section 244(a) as this section applies to deportable lawful permanent resident aliens would be rendered nugatory. We conclude, therefore, that if the strict standards embodied in section 244(a) are not to be read out of the Act, section 212(c) cannot be interpreted to apply to lawful permanent residents who have not been in such status for a period of seven years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Interim Decision # 2604 at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We cannot agree with the <em>Lok </em>court that the INS interpretation of \u00a7 1182(c) is \u201cinconsistent with a statutory mandate.\u201d The language of the statute and its legislative history are simply inconclusive on this point. Nor do we find that the INS interpretation would \u201cfrustrate the congressional policy underlying [the] legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the contrary, considering the act as a whole, we find the INS interpretation preserves the overall statutory scheme of discretionary relief in deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">For this reason, and because of the deference which we must give to the INS\u2019 longstanding and consistent interpretation, we hold that, to be eligible for \u00a7 1182(c) relief, aliens' must accumulate seven years of lawful unrelinquished domicile after their admission for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\n<em>EQUAL PROTECTION:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">After the <em>Lok </em>decision, the BIA announced that the INS would observe the <em>Lok </em>interpretation of \u00a7 1182(c) in the Second Circuit. <em>Matter of Anwo, </em>Interim Decision # 2604 at 8. Believing that interpretation to be incorrect, however, the BIA added that it would adhere to its own interpretation outside the Second Circuit. <em>Id. </em>Petitioner argues that this disparate application of \u00a7 182(c) violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment due process clause. <em>Cf. Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Aliens are entitled to the equal protection of the laws. <em>Sugarman v. Dougall, </em>413 U.S. 634, 641, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 37 L.Ed.2d 853 (1973); <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 371, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971). However, \u201cthe right of a permanent resident alien to remain in this country has never been held to be the type of \u2018fundamental right\u2019 which would subject classification touching on it to strict judicial scrutiny, . . . <em>Francis v. INS, </em>532 F.2d 268, 272 (2d Cir. 1976). Consequently, the INS has not violated petitioner\u2019s equal protection rights if it has a rational basis for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The discriminatory effect arising from the agency\u2019s decision results entirely from the independence of federal appellate courts. It is elementary that the decisions of one Court of Appeals cannot bind another. The INS is not compelled to obey the <em>Lok </em>ruling outside geographical jurisdiction of the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Although the INS could refuse to adopt the <em>Lok </em>interpretation in the Second Circuit and thereby achieve consistency of application, to do so would only invite appeal and reversal. The agency\u2019s decision to apply the <em>Lok </em>interpretation in the Second Circuit avoids futile appeals, costly to both the agency and to petitioners seeking relief. We find avoidance of this unnecessary process of appeal to be a sound and rational basis for the agency\u2019s action. Adherence to the law of the circuit only within that circuit does not violate petitioner\u2019s equal protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">The decision of the BIA is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\">. Petitioner\u2019s spouse was admitted for permanent residence following her marriage to a United States citizen in 1963. She divorced her first husband in 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-13\">. Petitioner was also convicted of aiding and abetting the counterfeiting of alien registration receipt cards, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a) (1976), but those counts were reversed on appeal to this court because of insufficient proof that the criminal acts occurred in the United States. <em>United States v. </em>Castillo-Felix, 539 F.2d 9 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">Petitioner\u2019s spouse was also convicted of selling and disposing of a counterfeit alien registration receipt card to an alien, knowing it to be false. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison and served one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-22\">. Petitioner served approximately one year of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-23\">. In his oral opinion, the judge noted that petitioner was not eligible for voluntary departure because of his incarceration for more than six months within the last five years, which precluded him from establishing good moral character. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-24\">[B]ecause of his restraint since August of 1975, he is unable to establish to me that he has rehabilitated himself. Therefore, I do not feel that at this point he is a good risk . . .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">. Three rationales have been used to extend \u00a7 1182(c) relief to deportation proceedings. Aliens who committed deportable offenses, then left the United States but were not excluded upon returning, could request \u00a7 1182(c) relief \u201cnunc pro tunc.\u201d The INS reasoned that the discretionary relief which would have been available to them on reentry could be granted at the later deportation hearing. <em>E. g., Matter of Tanori, </em>Interim Decision # 2467 (BIA 1976); Matter of S, 5 I&amp;N Dec. 392 (BIA 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Alternatively, aliens eligible for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation could obtain advance determinations of their eligibility for \u00a7 1182(c) relief, to apply to their future reentry. <em>See Matter of Anwo, </em>Interim Decision # 2604 (BIA 1977), <em>affirmed sub nom. Anwo v. INS, </em>No. 77-1879 (D.C.Cir. June 19, 1979); <em>Matter of S, </em>1 I&amp;N Dec. 116 (BIA 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Finally, the INS allowed deportees to apply for \u00a7 1182(c) relief in connection with an application for adjustment of status, reasoning that aliens applying for adjustment of status stand in the same position as those entering this country with a permanent resident visa. <em>Matter of Smith, </em>Interim Decision # 1510 (BIA 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\">. The BIA did not base its decision on failure to meet the actual departure requirement, but on petitioner\u2019s failure to accumulate seven years of consecutive domicile in this country after his admission for permanent residence. It is well-established that \u201can agency\u2019s order must be upheld, if at all, \u2018on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>FPC v. Texaco, Inc., </em>417 U.S. 380, 397, 94 S.Ct. 2315, 2326, 41 L.Ed.2d 141 (1974), <em>quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962), and <em>citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"A5y\">Consequently, we need not resolve an apparent conflict between this circuit and the Second Circuit. In <em>Francis v. INS, </em>532 F.2d 268 (2d Cir. 1976), the Second Circuit ruled that the nunc pro tunc extension of \u00a7 1182(c) (see note 5, supra) violated equal protection. The court held that it was irrational to extend \u00a7 1182(c) relief to deportees who had fortuitously departed after committing a deportable offense, but deny it to deportees who had not. The INS acquiesced in the Francis ruling and no longer requires actual departure by deportees requesting \u00a7 1182(c) relief. Matter <em>of Silva, </em>Interim Decision # 2532 (BIA 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"Arn\">This circuit, however, continues to recognize the actual departure requirement. <em>Arias-Uribe v. INS, </em>466 F.2d 1198 (9th Cir. 1972); followed in <em>Nicholas </em>v. <em>INS, </em>590 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Dunn v.

Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>548 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1977) that the requisite residency need not have accrued after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">As the opinions in <em>Lok </em>and the present case aptly point out, the legislative history is shrouded in confusion and uncertainty, challenging the perceptiveness of its examiners. It is, therefore, not surprising that two diametrically opposed conclusions were reached. I, however, am persuaded by the humanitarian aspects and the fact that Congress considered and rejected harsher language.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u201cDeportation is a sanction which in severity surpasses all but the most Draconian criminal penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. It is the recognition of the devastating impact which is the genesis of discretionary forms of relief enacted by Congress, including \u00a7 212(c). Section 212(c) was enacted \u201cto provide the Attorney General the flexibility and discretion to permit worthy aliens to continue their relationships with family members in the United States despite a ground for exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief, however, was not extended to all aliens. Rather, it was limited to worthy individuals who could establish that they had maintained a residency in this country for a period of seven consecutive years. This residency requirement, which must initially be met before the Attorney General need exercise his discretionary powers, undoubtedly represents a presumption that an alien facing deportation could possibly suffer such a devastating impact so as to justify an examination by the Attorney General. Deportation and its consequences, however, are oblivious to the life situation of an alien. Having come to this country and established their roots into the land, the repercussions of deportation are not diminished by the mere fact that the seven year period follows admittance for permanent residency. Rather, the emotional, familial, and financial repercussions which flow from deportation of those who have settled in this country, touch equally those aliens who were admitted as permanent residents prior to the running of the seven year requirement as well as those aliens who were admitted at some point during the seven year duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">This reasoning may have prompted Congress to reject harsher language which would have certainly supported the INS\u2019s position. In 1950, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered a suggestion which would have limited the availability of the 7th Proviso to section 3 of the Immigration Act of 1917,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the precursor to \u00a7 212(c), in a manner which would be consistent with the position taken by the respondents. The suggestion to insert the words \u201cestablished after a lawful entry for permanent residence,\u201d was, however, ultimately rejected by the Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Section 212(c) was enacted a few years later, incorporating much of the language in the Seventh Proviso to section 3 of the Immigration Act of 1917. Omitted, however, was any explicit language limiting relief to aliens who had been domiciled in this country for th\u00e9 requisite amount of years after being admitted for permanent residence, despite the fact that such language was considered a few years before. In its place was inserted a cryptic passage defying any inexorable interpretation, leading the court in <em>Lok </em>to observe and state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">If Congress ultimately had determined that such constriction of the class of aliens entitled to the beneficial considerations under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) was warranted, it could have expressed its intention explicitly, as it did on other occasions . . The fact that the legislators did not so limit Section 212(c), coupled with the obvious purpose of the statute to mitigate the hardship that deportation poses for those with family ties in this country, impel us to grant the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"air-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">I find such reasoning persuasive and supported by the established rule of law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>statutes affecting deportation decisions be construed in favor of the alien, <em>Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, </em>333 U.S. 6, 10, 68 S.Ct. 374, 92 L.Ed. 433 (1948); <em>Lennon v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>527 F.2d 187, 193 (2nd Cir. 1975); <em>Errico v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>349 F.2d 541, 547 n. 3 (9th Cir. 1975). It is my position that the seven year residency requirement need not follow admittance for permanent residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">I am not convinced otherwise by the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) argument in <em>Matter of Anwo, </em>Interim Decision # 2604 (BIA 1977), <em>affirmed sub nom. Anwo v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>No. 77-1879 (D.C.Cir. June 19, 1979), that such an interpretation of the seven year statutory requirement will undermine other provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. The BIA suggests that the provisions of \u00a7 244(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> regarding suspension of deportation, are more stringent than those under \u00a7 212(c) because an alien need \u201conly\u201d be a lawful permanent resident and establish a domicile for seven years for \u00a7 212(c) relief, whereas \u00a7 244(a) requires scrutiny into an alien\u2019s moral character and hardship circumstances. Such a view certainly ignores the difficult standard that must be met to even qualify for permanent resident status. For example, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, an alien must have been, <em>inter alia, </em>previously inspected, admitted or paroled, subjected to the discretion of the Attorney General in addition to being required to satisfy other procedural requirements. The broad discretionary powers available to the Attorney General in granting lawful permanent residence could, and presumably do, serve a function equal in stringency to the establishment of good moral character and extreme hardship under \u00a7 244(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Likewise, even if an alien meets the initial requirements for \u00a7 212(c) relief, he must still be considered worthy of relief in the discretion of the Attorney General. That this discretionary exercise of power can be used to safeguard the relief process is evident from the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">It must also be remembered that \u00a7 212(c) originally applied only to excludable aliens who w\u00e9re seeking admission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was through judicial decision, and not legislative action, that the provisions later became applicable to other classes of aliens. <em>Lok, </em>548 F.2d at 39 n. 1; <em>Francis v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>532 F.2d 268 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Matter of G. A., </em>7 I &amp; N Dec. 274 (BIA 1956). Merely because both provisions can be applied to lawful permanent residents does not render the hardship and good moral character requirements nugatory; instead, they can be regarded as repetitious or explanatory of the discretionary powers already available. If there is a question of undermining, it has already occurred with the extension of \u00a7 212(c) relief to other classes of aliens. There are no real differences in the standards, but only greater articulation of them in \u00a7 244(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">In view of the similarities between \u00a7 244(a) and \u00a7 212(c), the current INS posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tion regarding the seven year residency requirement in \u00a7 212(c) cases appears unnecessarily harsh. Aliens who can apply for \u00a7 244(a) relief need only live in the United States between seven and ten years before relief can be granted. Yet an alien in a position similar to Castillo-Felix, who began establishing roots in this country in 1963, who independently supports his family, has purchased a home, and satisfied government officials in 1972 of his potential as an American citizen, must add seven years to the nine already spent as a productive individual. Such a result is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">A more logical interpretation of the requirement is that an alien with permanent residence status meets the minimum requirements evident in other provisions by having spent <em>at least </em>seven years developing ties to this country. This interpretation is strengthened by circumstances which permit aliens to be <em>immediately </em>eligible for lawful permanent residence status when, for example, they marry an American citizen, <em>see e. g., Lok, supra. </em>Without the seven year requirement, an alien could meet \u00a7 212(c) requirements after spending only a short period of time in the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Even an affirmation in <em>Lok </em>will not entirely resolve the problem because it is still unclear when the period should run <em>prior to </em>attaining lawful permanent resident status. This inquiry is crucial to the present factual situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The few opinions that have discussed \u00a7 212(c) requirements have concentrated on the interpretation of the domiciliary period and the voluntary departure provisions, with little attention paid to the requirement that an alien \u201c[be] lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d The phrase, defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20), means the \u201cstatus of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">As noted in <em>Matter of Anwo, supra, </em>at 5-6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">The lawful permanent resident has met extensive quantitative and qualitative standards at time of entry as an immigrant. He-has, legally and properly, established ties to this country. He may work. He normally looks toward citizenship and will have that privilege in time. He enjoys greater rights than the nonim-migrant alien and assumes commensurate responsibilities and duties</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Although nothing in the record indicates the exact circumstances under which Castillo-Felix was granted admission, it will be presumed that any decision allowing an alien to reside permanently in the United States is an administrative task not taken lightly, and that the individual deserves the deference accorded him. An exercise of the discretionary authority vested in the Attorney General in this manner has the effect of transforming an otherwise improper entry into a lawful one. Under the general doctrine of <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>this corrective measure applies retroactively to the time of the entry. \u201cSuch action, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>amounts to little more than a correction of a record of entry, which is a frequent and indispensable practice in many and varied situations,\u201d <em>Matter of L., </em>11 &amp; N Dec. 1, 6 (1940); <em>In re Kempson, </em>14 F.2d 668 (D.C.1926) (court distinguished those aliens that had been inspected and erroneously admitted from those who had never been inspected allowing <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief in the former situation only).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">This view that a previous unlawful entry can be corrected retroactively is strength<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ened by the conceptual tool used in <em>Kaplan v. Tod, </em>267 U.S. 228, 230, 45 S.Ct. 257, 69 L.Ed. 585 (1925) in which an alien who had not been lawfully admitted was \u201cregarded as stopped at the boundary line and kept there unless and until her right to enter should be declared.\u201d Even though she was allowed to live in the United States, she \u201cwas still in theory of law at the boundary line and had gained no foothold in the United States.\u201d <em>See Yuen Sang Low v. Attorney General of United States, </em>479 F.2d 820 (9th Cir. 1973). It follows from this somewhat metaphysical appraisal of the immigration process, coupled with <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief, that when a right to enter is finally declared, the alien retroactively crosses the boundary into the United States and assumes the cloak of legality with all its attendant rights and responsibilities. Going one step further, it follows quite simply that if lawful entry has been made, all the years spent living in the United States subsequent to that time are also made lawful retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Applying this view to Castillo-Felix, it would appear that upon achieving his status as a lawful permanent resident, his last entry<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> into the United States marks the first day of lawful residency. According to the facts of the case, this was in 1969 after his initial voluntary departure and return.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Having resolved the question of when lawful residency commences for purposes of \u00a7 212(c), Castillo-Felix clearly fulfills the residency requirement, having been lawfully domiciled for over seven years. Under \u00a7 1101(a)(20), an alien is accorded the status of lawful permanent resident unless his status changes. Until the resolution of deport-ability of an alien is finalized, an alien retains his status. In the present case, the decision of deportability was rendered on June 29, 1977, which is over the seven year residency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Finding that Castillo-Felix is eligible for relief does not of course entitle him to such relief. The Attorney General must exercise his discretion in order to circumvent the deportation order. Accordingly, this case should be remanded to the BIA for further consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-13\">.
