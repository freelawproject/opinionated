Both contentions lack substantial merit and, accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Hawkins pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) and was tried and convicted of kidnapping, transporting the victim\u2019s vehicle across state lines, and using firearms in the commission of the kidnapping in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1201(a), 2312 and 924(c), respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment on the kidnapping charge, three years for transporting the stolen vehicle and two years for possession of the firearm, both to run concurrently to the ten year sentence, and five years on the charge of use of the firearm in a kidnapping, to run consecutively to the other sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">After careful review of the record in this ease, we are convinced that there is ample testimony, both lay and expert, of Hawkins\u2019 sanity to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>450 F.2d 1106 (8th Cir. 1971); <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>295 F.2d 743 (8th Cir. 1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 998, 82 S.Ct. 625, 7 L.Ed.2d 536 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Although Hawkins contends that the sentence was excessive, there is no claim that the sentence imposed exceeded the statutory maximum. The district court did not manifestly or grossly abuse its discretion in sentencing Hawkins to fifteen years imprisonment. Consequently, we refuse to alter the sentence. <em>See Woosley v. United States, </em>478 F.2d 139, 147 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">The conviction and sentence of Hawkins are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"anq-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"axh-dedup-1\">. The Honorable Warren K. Urbom, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, presided and pronounced sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
