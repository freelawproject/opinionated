(Surgicenters), brought this action against appellee, Medical Dental Surgeries Co., dba Medical Dental Surgicenters (Medical), under the Trademark Act of 1946 as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq., </em>for infringement of its registered service mark, \u201cSurgicenter.\u201d The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, based upon agreed facts, 45 exhibits, answers to interrogatories, and two depositions. The district court denied appellant\u2019s motion and granted appellee\u2019s motion, finding \u201cSurgicenter\u201d was not a lawfully registered service mark. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">The basic facts are undisputed, both parties accepting a summary contained in the opinion of the district court. In March, 1970, a month after operating a \u201cfacility for one-day surgical care\u201d in Phoenix, Arizona, Surgicenter, Inc., applied for registration of the service mark \u201cSurgicenter\u201d for \u201cservices rendered in an in and out surgical facility.\u201d On August 31, 1971 the mark \u201cSURGICENTER\u201d was registered to Surgi-center, Inc. \u201cFor: PROVIDING FACILITIES FOR DOCTORS TO PERFORM OPERATIONS ON PATIENTS\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 6,1971, the registration was assigned to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-15\">Since the registration of the service mark, Surgicenters has licensed use of the mark in other states.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The doctors who formed the original corporation have worked since 1968 to popularize their concept of economical one-day surgical care to insure its acceptance by major insurance carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-16\">In 1962 Medical, an Oregon corporation, filed the assumed business name \u201cMedical Dental Hospital Co.\u201d and did business under that name until December, 1972, when the name was changed to \u201cMedical Dental Surgeries Co.\u201d In January, 1975, Medical changed its name to \u201cMedical Dental Surgi-centers\u201d and filed this business name with the Oregon Corporation Commission. Medical provides facilities for out-patient surgical procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-17\">On January 28,1975 Surgicenters notified Medical that Medical\u2019s use of the name \u201cSurgicenter\u201d infringed Surgicenters\u2019 mark. On June 13, 1975, Surgicenters filed this action to enjoin Medical from further use of the term, to require an accounting and payment of profits for its use since notification, and for damages for infringement</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-18\">\n<em>Opinion of District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-19\">The district court, in its opinion granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, held that the mark \u201cSurgicenter\u201d was not a lawfully registered service mark because it was \u201cgeneric\u201d and thus not registrable. The court concluded further that if the term were considered \u201cdescriptive\u201d rather than \u201cgeneric\u201d, it had not \u201cdeveloped a secondary meaning in this area in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>Medical operates\u201d. In a judgment based upon its opinion, the court denied the injunction and demand for an accounting and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">In determining that the term \u201cSurgicen-ter\u201d is generic the court concluded that \u201cSurgicenter\u201d is a \u201ccoined word of the combination and abbreviation type which clearly connotes a center for surgery\u201d. Since the term \u201csurgery center\u201d obviously \u201cwould not be capable of registration because it is quite clearly generic\u201d, the term \u201cSurgicen-ter\u201d was likewise found to be generic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">The district court held further: \u201cAlthough there are undoubtedly those who connect \u2018Surgicenter\u2019 with the Arizona corporation, the consuming public generally understands the word to mean exactly what it says. This is amply demonstrated in the exhibits.\u201d Among the exhibits upon which the court relied was a proposed rule of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare appearing in 38 Fed. Reg. 313-81 (1973) defining \u201cHealth Care Facilities\u201d. The definition included \u201cfacilities providing surgical treatment to patients not requiring hospitalization (surgi-centers), which are not part of a hospital but which are organized and operated to provide medical care to out-patients\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other exhibits included magazine and medical journal articles, letters and a television transcript which used the term \u201csurgicen-ter\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">\n<em>Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">Appellant contends that it \u201ccoined an arbitrary and fanciful word through the combination of two common or ordinary words\u201d and that the trademark Surgicenter is neither generic nor descriptive. It argues that the district court erred in failing to address properly the issue of genericness, used an analysis of descriptiveness to conclude that the word is generic, used \u201ca scalpel technique\u201d as a method of analysis, misapplied the burden of proof, and its opinion is contrary to case law with respect to combination of an abbreviated word.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-15\">Summary judgment is appropriate where no material issues of fact exist and where a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), F.R.Civ.P. Here the parties made cross-motions for summary judgment following extensive discovery. As appellant states in its reply brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>The ease was submitted on stipulated facts and the parties agreed that there were no genuine issues of material fact. Where the matter is submitted to the court based upon affidavits, exhibits and certain stipulated facts, and where no testimony was taken, the determination by the court is a question of law, readily reviewable by the appellate court. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1A\">It is this legal proposition [the conclusion that two abbreviated, ordinary words into a single word created a generic term] which appellant requests this court to review along with other issues of law raised in appellant\u2019s opening brief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">In other words, this was a trial on a stipulated record and was so intended by the parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There are no genuine issues of material facts. It is a proper case for disposition through summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">\n<em>Validity of the Service Mark</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Atx\">(a) Effect of Registration</p>\n<p id=\"Aei4\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1057(b) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-7\">A certificate of registration of a mark . shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration, registrant\u2019s ownership of the mark, and of registrant\u2019s exclusive right to use the mark in commerce in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate, subject to any conditions and limitations stated therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">The district court properly recognized that a \u201cproperly registered service mark is presumed to be valid\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">(b) Categories of Marks</p>\n<p id=\"A6gq\">The cases identify four categories of terms with respect to trademark protection: (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or fanciful. As the district court correctly noted, the lines of demarcation are not always clear, and the \u201centire area of trade or service marks . is fraught with difficulties and ambiguities\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-15\">The basic principles of trademark law, including a description of the four categories of mark, are set forth in <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 9-11 (2 Cir. 1976). The different categories may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-16\">A \u201cgeneric\u201d term is one that refers, or has come to be understood as referring, to the genus of which the particular product or service is a species. It cannot become a trademark under any circumstances. <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, supra, </em>537 F.2d at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-17\">A merely \u201cdescriptive\u201d term specifically describes a characteristic or ingredient of an article or service. It can, by acquiring a secondary meaning, i. e., becoming \u201cdistinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods\u201d, become a valid trademark. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-18\">A \u201csuggestive\u201d term suggests rather than describes an ingredient, quality, or charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>teristic of the goods and requires imagination, thought, and perception to determine the nature of the goods. A suggestive term is entitled to registration without proof of secondary meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">An \u201carbitrary or fanciful\u201d term is usually applied to words invented solely for their use as trademarks and enjoys all the rights accorded to suggestive terms \u2014 without the need of debating whether the term is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d and with ease of establishing infringement. <em>Id. </em>at ll.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">(c) Determination of Genericness</p>\n<p id=\"Aq1d\">In concluding that the term \u201cSurgicen-ter\u201d is generic the district court found \u201cmost pertinent\u201d the case of <em>Cummins Engine Company, Inc. v. Continental Motors Corp., </em>359 F.2d 892, 894, 53 CCPA 1167, 1169 (1966), where the court affirmed a decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board canceling the registration of the mark \u201cTurbodiesel\u201d. In that case the court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-6\">We rely primarily upon the 1935 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary definitions of \u201cturbine,\u201d its combining form \u201cturbo,\u201d and of \u201cdiesel,\u201d and a March 1953 \u201cFlight\u201d magazine article, all of which are reproduced in the board\u2019s decision as reported, 132 USPQ at 557. In our view, the definitions alone indicate that \u201cturbodiesel\u201d is a word which by its nature will convey a specific and correct meaning which is such that it cannot become a trademark as a result even of origination and first use. . . The term \u201cturbodiesel,\u201d as we. see it, is a natural composite form for a class of engines into which appellant\u2019s engines fall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">The district court here similarly concluded from dictionary definitions that appellant has \u201ctaken two generic terms and combined them into a term which is still generic\u201d. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-12\">\u201cSurgical\u201d is an adjective defined as \u201crelating to, or concerned with surgeons or surgery.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1966). \u201cCenter\u201d is a noun defined as \u201ca place, area, person, group, or concentration marked significantly or dominatingly by an indicated activity, pursuit, interest, or appeal: a concentration of requisite facilities for an activity, pursuit or interest along with various likely adjunct conveniences,\u201d as, \u201cmedical center\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-13\">The court concluded that the challenged service mark \u201cSurgicenter\u201d was simply an \u201cabbreviation of surgical functions as an adjective to identify a center as a concentration of facilities relating to surgeons or surgery\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-14\">The district court also relied upon the decision of this court in <em>Rohr Aircraft Corporation v. Rubber Teck, Inc., </em>266 F.2d 613, 623 (9 Cir. 1959), where the court held that \u201ca generic name, or a name merely descriptive of an article of trade cannot ordinarily be employed as a trademark\u201d. The court concluded accordingly that where one party used the mark \u201cDuo Seal\u201d and the other party used \u201cLock O Seal\u201d, the word \u201cseal\u201d described both devices and could not be appropriated as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-15\">Appellant attempts to distinguish both <em>Cummins Engine </em>and <em>Rohr Aircraft </em>on the ground that the courts in those cases did not find the mark generic but descriptive. As the district court noted, however, courts often have difficulty in distinguishing between generic and descriptive terms. This is well illustrated in <em>Application of Sun Oil Co., </em>426 F.2d 401, 403, 57 CCPA 1147, 1149 (1970) where the majority opinion found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>term \u201cCustom Blended\u201d descriptive, without a secondary meaning being established, while a concurring opinion found the term so \u201chighly descriptive\u201d that it could not be accorded trademark rights even if a secondary meaning were established. Other courts have distinguished between a \u201cgeneric or common descriptive term\u201d and a \u201cmerely descriptive term\u201d. See, e. <em>g., Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Helleman Brewing Co., supra, </em>561 F.2d at 79. In <em>Rohr Aircraft, </em>this court referred to \u201ca generic name, or a name merely descriptive of an article of trade\u201d. Reading the opinion as a whole we conclude that the court intended to hold that the term in question was generic. Likewise in <em>Cummins Engine, </em>while the court did not use the word \u201cgeneric\u201d, it did find the word \u201cturbodiesel\u201d by its nature conveyed a specific and correct meaning such that it could not \u201cbecome a trademark as a result even of origination [or] first use\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The district court and both parties recognize that in making the sometimes elusive determination of genericness courts have consistently followed the test stated by Judge Learned Hand in <em>Bayer Co., Inc. v. United Drug Co., </em>272 F. 505, 509 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1921): \u201cWhat do the buyers understand by the word for whose use the parties are contending?\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If buyers take the word to refer only to a particular producer\u2019s goods or services, it is not generic. But if the word is identified with all such goods or services, regardless of their suppliers, it is generic and so not a valid mark. <em>King-Seeley Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., </em>321 F.2d 577, 579 (2 Cir. 1963).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">The test was sharpened by the Supreme Court in <em>Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. 111, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938). \u201c. . . [T]o establish a trade name ... the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. It must show that the <em>primary </em>significance of the term <em>in the minds of the consuming public </em>is not the product but the producer.\u201d 305 U.S. at 118, 59 S.Ct. at 113 [emphasis added].<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">In <em>J. Kohnstam, Ltd. v. Louis Marx and Company, Inc., </em>280 F.2d 437, 440, 47 CCPA 1080, 1084 (1960), the court held that the trademark \u201cMatchbox Series\u201d, as applied to toys packaged in small boxes was descriptive rather than indicative of origin, and was not registrable. The court concluded that even if the applicant for registration had by advertising over a period of some two and one-half years developed a secondary meaning as indicating the origin of the goods, such circumstance could not \u201ctake the <em>common descriptive </em>name of an article out of the public domain and give the temporarily exclusive user of it exclusive rights to it, no matter how much money or effort it pours into promoting the sale of the merchandise\u201d. See also <em>CES Pub. Corp. v. St. Regis Publications, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 11 (2 Cir. 1975), where the court held that the term \u201cConsumer Electronics\u201d, as used in the title of a trade magazine within the electronics industry, was generic, and not subject to trademark protection. The court held further that unlike \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d terms which can be registered as trademarks by proof of secondary meaning, a \u201cgeneric\u201d word cannot be validly registered as a trademark even if there is proof of secondary meaning. \u201cThe reason is plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>enough. To allow trademark protection for generic terms, i. e., names which describe the genus of goods being sold, even when these have become identified with a first user, would grant the owner of the mark a monopoly, since a competitor could not describe his goods as what they are.\u201d 531 F.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\">Appellant argues that there is no \u201ccompetent evidence as to what potential customers, i. e., doctors or patients understood or identified by the mark \u2018Surgicenter\u2019 \u201d. The district court recognized that while \u201cthere are undoubtedly persons who connect \u2018Sur-gicenter\u2019 with the Arizona corporation,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the consuming public generally understands the word to mean exactly what it says: This is amply demonstrated in the exhibits\u201d. From our examination of the 45 exhibits offered by the respective parties, we agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">As appellant recognizes, the consuming public is composed primarily of doctors and their patients, as is true with a hospital or other medical facility. The exhibits contain letters from appellant and its counsel to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Library of Congress, the Superintendent of Documents, medical schools and other medical facilities,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Blue Cross organizations, news and medical publications,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and a physician who had used the term \u201cSurgi-center\u201d in a book entitled \u201cOut Patient Surgery\u201d, and his publisher.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Typical of many responses received by appellant is a letter from L. H. Hughes, M.D., President of Walnut Creek Surgicenter, Walnut Creek, California, dated September 17, 1973: \u201cI was not aware that this name was restricted in any way and we used it in a generic sense only.\u201d While Dr. Hughes and other doctors recognized the registration of the mark, it is clear from their letters that they had considered the word a generic term.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record to indicate that any potential consumer considered the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d to mean anything other than a surgical center.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The district court properly found that the consuming public connected the term \u201cSur-gicenter\u201d with the service rather than the server.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">We recognize that words \u201cwhich could not individually become a trademark may become one when taken together\u201d. <em>Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number><em>Carbide v. Ever-Ready, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366, 379 (7 Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 830, 97 S.Ct. 91, 50 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976), and cases there cited. In <em>Union Carbide </em>the court concluded that the word \u201cEVERREADY\u201d had \u201cacquired a secondary \u2018meaning\u2019 and on that basis the mark was valid\u201d. The district court here properly concluded that the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d had not acquired a secondary meaning.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Application of ADA Milling Co., </em>205 F.2d 315, 317, 40 CCPA 1076, 1078 (1953) is a good example of a combination of words resulting in a valid mark. In that case the court found that the trade mark \u201cStartgrolay\u201d for use on poultry feed, \u201cviewed in its entirety\u201d, was a valid mark, even though if the mark were dissected, the \u201cStart\u201d, \u201cgrow\u201d and \u201clay\u201d separately would be nonregistrable. We find no case, however, which holds that the mere combination of words is sufficient in itself to make a mark registrable. There is a clear distinction between the word \u201cStartgrolay\u201d as applied to poultry feed and \u201cSurgicenter\u201d which obviously means surgical center. <em>ADA Milling </em>was distinguished in <em>Cummins Engine, supra, </em>where the court said: \u201cWe do not find the term here (Turbodiesel) to be such a deviation from a natural usage or an unusual unitary combination as to permit registration, in contrast to the terms in <em>In re Ada Milling Co.\u201d </em>359 F.2d at 895, 53 CCPA at 1170.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The same is true with respect to the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">In Warner <em>&amp; Co. v. Lilly &amp; Co., </em>265 U.S. 526, 528, 44 S.Ct. 615, 616, 68 L.Ed. 1161 (1924) the Court held names such as \u201cCoco-Quinine\u201d and \u201cQuin-Coco\u201d could not be appropriated as trademarks, the Court saying in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-5\">The name \u201cCoco-Quinine\u201d is descriptive of the ingredients which enter into the preparation. The same is equally true of the name \u201cQuin-Coco.\u201d A name which is merely descriptive of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of an article of trade cannot be appropriated as a trademark and the exclusive use of it afforded legal protection. The use of a similar name by another to truthfully describe his own product does not constitute a legal or moral wrong, even if its effect be to cause the public to mistake the origin or ownership of the product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">(d) Descriptive Marks</p>\n<p id=\"aq5-dedup-0\">While a \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d term is not generally entitled to protection (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e)), if the applicant for registration can show that a \u201csecondary meaning\u201d has attached to the mark, so that the consuming public connects the mark with the producer rather than the product, the mark can be protected. Carter-Wallace, <em>Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Company, </em>434 F.2d 794 (9 Cir. 1970). The district court found that even if the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d were considered \u201cdescriptive\u201d rather than \u201cgeneric\u201d, \u201cit has not developed a secondary meaning in this area in which Medical operates\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">The history and policy behind the doctrine of \u201csecondary meaning\u201d and relevant factors to be considered were well summarized in <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready, Inc., supra. </em>In that case the court assumed the correctness of the finding of the district court that Carbide\u2019s name \u201cEverready\u201d was descriptive, but held that Carbide had \u201cclearly established the validity of its mark on the basis of secondary meaning\u201d. Substantial direct consumer testimony and consumer surveys demonstrated that \u201can extremely significant portion of the population associates Carbide\u2019s products with a single anonymous source\u201d. 531 F.2d at 381.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> There was also substantial evidence of confusion on the part of the consuming public. <em>Id. </em>at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">The district court properly recognized that one of the indicia of secondary mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>ing is the likelihood of confusion among buyers, citing <em>Norm Thompson Outfitters, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>448 F.2d 1293 (9 Cir. 1971). As the district court noted, the parties agree that there has been no actual confusion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court found that there was \u201cno likelihood of confusion\u201d, saying in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-4\">The only contact Surgicenters has made with Portland is a letter of inquiry concerning the possibility of establishing a facility. This does not establish any likelihood of confusion. No consumer surveys or extensive advertising campaigns have been presented to prove that consumers connect out-patient surgical centers with Surgicenters\u2019 sponsorship only. Indeed, as indicated in footnote 4, (see note 3, supra) the evidence is to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">(e) Suggestive and Arbitrary and Fanciful Marks</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">In pointing out the distinction between a \u201csuggestive\u201d term and a \u201cdescriptive\u201d term, the court in <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., supra, </em>quoted from <em>Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., </em>295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-7\">A term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods. A term is descriptive if it forthwith conveys an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">In applying this test to the service mark \u201cSurgicenter\u201d, it is clear that the term is descriptive rather than suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">The court in <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., </em>also cited <em>General Shoe Corp. v. Rosen, </em>111 F.2d 95, 98 (4 Cir. 1940), where the court distinguished between terms which are \u201cdescriptive\u201d and terms which are \u201carbitrary or fanciful\u201d, saying in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-12\">Under the well established rule of trade mark law, a word or phrase which is primarily descriptive of the article to which it is attached may not be appropriated by any one as his exclusive trade mark, (citing cases) On the other hand, an arbitrary or fanciful name, which has no relationship to the product, may be lawfully adopted and monopolized. <em>Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. &amp; Co., </em>240 U.S. 251, 36 S.Ct. 269, 60 L.Ed. 629.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"alu-dedup-0\"><em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch </em>recognized also that a word may be in one category for a particular product, and in quite a different one for another, noting, for example, that \u201cIvory\u201d would be \u201cgeneric when used to describe a product made from the tusks of elephants but arbitrary as applied to soap\u201d. 537 F.2d at 9, n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-13\">The cases upon which appellant relies in support of its contention that the word \u201cSurgicenter\u201d is neither \u201cgeneric\u201d or \u201cdescriptive\u201d, but rather \u201csuggestive\u201d or \u201carbitrary and fanciful\u201d are distinguishable. In <em>Coca-Cola Company v. Seven-Up Company, </em>497 F.2d 1351, 1353 (C.C.P.A.1974) the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals held that the words \u201cThe Uncola\u201d were not merely descriptive of soft drinks. The court quoted as applicable the language employed in <em>Vita-Var. Corp. v. Alumatone, </em>83 F.Supp. 214, 215 (S.D.Cal.1949) \u2014 \u201ca combination which has enough deviation from the common use of words and parts of words to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>make its registration as a trade mark valid\u201d. The court found a \u201ctotal failure of the record to indicate that THE UNCOLA is or ever was merely descriptive of, or a common descriptive term for, the product\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Similarly in <em>Maremont Corporation v. Air Lift Company, </em>463 F.2d 1114, 1116-1117, 59 CCPA 1152, 1156-1157 (1972), the court found that the word \u201cLoad-Carrier\u201d, while suggestive of the function of the class of goods produced (load supporting and dumping units for automobiles, automobile trailers, and small trucks) was \u201cequally suggestive of many other things \u2014 e.g., wheel barrows, dump trucks, freight cars, steamships and elevators\u201d. There is no evidence in the record in this case that the term \u201csurgicen-ter\u201d is suggestive of anything except a surgical center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Finally, appellant relies heavily on <em>Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastics Co., </em>294 F.2d 694 (2 Cir. 1961), where the court held that plaintiff had a valid common-law trademark in the term \u201cPoly Pitcher\u201d. The court there recognized that the initial test was \u201cwhat the expression meant to the purchasing public. If it meant a pitcher made of polyethylene it could claim no validity as a trademark; but if its connotation was arbitrary or fanciful, it met the test of a valid trademark.\u201d The clear distinction between the evidence here with respect to the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d and the evidence relating to the term \u201cPoly Pitcher\u201d appears from the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Blisscraft:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjTn\">The record is devoid of any worthwhile evidence to show that at the time when plaintiff first began to use the \u201cPoly Pitcher\u201d labels the public generally understood \u201cpoly\u201d to be synonymous with polyethylene or that \u201cPoly Pitcher\u201d meant a pitcher which was made of polyethylene. Indeed, it would have been astonishing if it had any such understanding of terminology so essentially technical. We have been referred to no dictionary, general or scientific, which indicates that \u201cpoly\u201d meant polyethylene. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed. 1958) defines \u201cpoly\u201d as \u201cconsisting of many,\u201d \u201ca plurality,\u201d \u201ca number above the normal.\u201d In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we cannot assume that to members of the public at large the word \u201cpoly,\u201d either alone or in combination with \u201cpitcher,\u201d had any meaning other than that attributed to it by the lexicographer. Unless a word gives some reasonably accurate \u2014 some tolerably distinct knowledge \u2014 as to what the product is made of, it is not descriptive within the meaning of trademark terminology. 294 F.2d at 699-700.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">In contrast, the district court here, on the basis of a careful analysis of the term \u201cSur-gicenter\u201d through dictionary definitions and substantial evidence of its generic use by the consuming public, found the term generic, or if not generic, descriptive without having acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">We conclude that the district court properly found that (1) the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d is generic and not registrable as a trademark; and (2) in the alternative, if the term is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of the service, it has not developed a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"aso-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">.

But this merely indicates that neither decision uses the correct test, buyer understanding of the disputed term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\"><em>Cummins </em>is at odds with the far more numerous and better-reasoned decisions that eschew a scalpel technique in favor of the required inquiry into what the words, together, mean to the consuming public. <em>E. g., Blisscraft of Hollywood v.

The Second Circuit did not even find the dictionary test urged upon it \u201cworthwhile evidence\u201d of the public\u2019s understanding of the term. \u201cIn the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we cannot assume that to members of the public at large the word \u2018poly,\u2019 either alone or in combination with \u2018pitcher,\u2019 had any meaning other than that attributed to it by the lexicographer.\u201d 294 F.2d at 699.

I do not dispute that, were the disputed term itself in the dictionary, its generic character might thereby be established. <em>Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Helleman Brewing Co., </em>561 F.2d 75, 80-81 (7th Cir. 1977) (presence of word \u201clight\u201d in dictionary one indication that word is generic); <em>Henry Heide, Inc. v. George Ziegler Co., </em>354 F.2d 574, 576 (7th Cir. 1965) (presence of \u201cjujube\u201d in dictionary evidence that word is generic). But the parties admit that plaintiff coined the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">This also impeaches the district court\u2019s holding as a strictly logical matter. The parties stipulate that there was no such thing as a \u201cSurgicenter\u201d until plaintiff invented the name. Yet the district judge held that the mark was generic <em>ab initio. </em>He held that defendant had <em>proved </em>that consumers automatically identified the made-up name, admittedly never used before, with a whole class of services produced by plaintiff, defendant, and others from the moment of the word\u2019s conception. This seems logically impossible to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">What buyers understand by the term \u201cSurgicenter\u201d is a question of fact. <em>Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., </em>272 F. at 509; <em>Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastics Co., </em>294 F.2d at 701. Because it shoulders the burden of proof, defendant must \u201cmake a rather clear and convincing showing that the principal significance of the word * * to the public\u201d was generic. <em>E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Yoshida International, Inc., </em>393 F.Supp. at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">Defendant has not met its burden here. There is reason to believe that the \u201cconsuming public\u201d, whose understanding of the term is all-important under <em>Bayer, </em>includes both patients and doctors. As to the latter, defendant presented statements from doctors that the term was generic; plaintiff had statements from physicians that the term was not generic. Further, plaintiff has undertaken many activities to promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>its name, linking the term coined to itself and distinguishing its product from that of others. These activities are apparently successful, as many corporations are paying plaintiff for the right to use its name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">The evidence concerning doctors was hardly \u201cclear and convincing\u201d. More important, however, none of defendant\u2019s evidence came from the ultimate consumers of the services plaintiff and defendant provide. Much of it was from trade sources like medical journals and magazine articles that are irrelevant to what patients think of the term.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-5\">\u201cIn attempting to determine what the buying public understood by \u2018Poly Pitcher\u2019 when the defendants began to use the mark, the manner in which the plaintiff and others used the words in trade magazines must be disregarded, for they were not intended for, and presumably did not reach, the eyes of the ultimate purchaser.\u201d <em>Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastics Co., </em>294 F.2d at 701.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">The same is true of defendant\u2019s evidence on the use of \u201cSurgicenter\u201d by the Library of Congress, NBC News and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">I find no case in which a mark was held generic without strong proof by the challenger of what the ultimate consumers\u2014 those who pay for the product \u2014 understand by the term. (Indeed, any such holding would violate the unchallenged rule of <em>Bayer, </em>which the majority opinion claims to follow.) In <em>Zajicek v. KoolVent Metal Awning Corp., </em>283 F.2d 127, 133 (9th Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 U.S. 859, 81 S.Ct. 827, 5 L.Ed.2d 823 (1961), we said that where evidence established that a term was understood as generic in the trade but not by consumers it was a valid mark. In <em>Bayer, </em>those in the trade realized that the contested term referred to plaintiff\u2019s product, but to the public it was generic. In selling to the public, therefore, defendant was free to use plaintiff\u2019s trademarked name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">Defendant has not an iota of evidence about what patients and prospective patients understand by the word \u201cSurgicen-ters\u201d. Neither does plaintiff, but it is defendant that carries the burden. It may be that the public would, in fact, view \u201cSurgi-center\u201d as the district court claims, synonymously with \u201csurgical center\u201d. But defendant\u2019s merely saying so is not enough. \u201cWe have said, so often as not to require citation of authority, that marks must be viewed as the public sees them, i. e., in their entireties. In the present case, the record is devoid of evidence that the buying public would employ the scalpel technique\u201d, as claimed by appellees here. <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Seven-Up Co., </em>497 F.2d at 1353.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">. Plaintiff here has shown ample diligence in opposing others\u2019 use of its registered, pre-sumedly-valid mark, including the bringing of this suit. It has protested those uses of \u201cSurgi-center\u201d that defendant has offered as proof the name is generic. Following plaintiffs objections, at least one clinic that had adopted the name \u201cSurgicenter\u201d changed its name, and the Government Printing Office suspended sales of a publication using the term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">. \u201cThe manner in which the alleged mark has been used in magazines, newspapers, books, <em>dictionaries, </em>patents, and other publications, is significant as to how it is regarded <em>by the writers thereof. * * * </em>One reason that it would not be determinative [of validity] could be that the writers of those publications would not be representative of the purchasers of the goods or services.\u201d E. Vandenburgh, Trademark Law and Procedure 271 &amp; n.19 (2d ed. 1968). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"A255\">The district court does not claim that the author of Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, on which it relied, is somehow representative of \u201cSurgicenter\u201d users.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">. I confine my dissent to the district court\u2019s holding that \u201cSurgicenter\u201d is generic and do not discuss its dictum that, were it not generic, the name would be descriptive without secondary meaning. If \u201cSurgicenter\u201d is invalid, it is because the term is generic: it defines the service. There is nothing descriptive about the term. <em>See Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 9-10 (2d Cir. 1976); E. Vanderburgh, Trademark Law and Procedure 86-89 (2d ed. 1968). \u201cFor example, while \u2018cellophane\u2019 might be a * * * generic name for a sheet of transparent regenerated cellulose, words such as \u2018tough,\u2019 \u2018strong,\u2019 \u2018shiny,\u2019 \u2018transparent,\u2019 etc. would be descriptive terms with respect to that product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
