The request was denied. In March 1976 the Association filed a new application to develop a 31 acre site in the same area. On July 21, 1976, the second permit request was denied. The Commission adopted findings of fact concerning the denial on August 10, 1976. On September 30, 1976, the Association filed substantially similar complaints in state and federal court charging the Commission with violations of state and federal law. The district court issued the following order on March 9, 1977:</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">\u201cThis court . . . finds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-7\">(a) There is another action, filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, between the parties. Said action was filed on the same day as the instant action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-8\">(b) In the state court action plaintiffs are attempting to adjudicate the same issues as those involved in their federal claim for relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-9\">IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AS FOLLOWS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-10\">1. The instant action is stayed in all respects pending either final determination or plaintiff\u2019s dismissal of said state court action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">At the Association\u2019s request, on March 29, 1977, the superior court dismissed the state suit without prejudice. The Association returned to the district court on March 30, 1977, and sought dissolution of the March 9, 1977 stay order and reinstatement of the federal proceedings. The Commission countered with a motion to dismiss based, <em>inter alia, </em>on the abstention doctrine. On May 11, 1977, the district court granted the motion to dismiss, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-14\">\u201cThis court having read and considered all submissions of the parties as well as having heard oral argument by the parties finds that this action is inextricably interwoven with issues involving state law, policy and regulations. This court, therefore, abstains from exercising further jurisdiction in this action. Accordingly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-15\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-16\">The stay order be dissolved and this action be dismissed. The court finds, however, that Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the court order of March 9, 1977, and their reliance thereon in dismissing their State Court action, was not unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-17\">On appeal the Association argues that the dismissal order violated its members\u2019 due process rights because it deprived them of any forum in which to litigate the various federal and state law causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-18\">The Association\u2019s argument is based upon a false premise. It claims the state suit, which was dismissed without prejudice, cannot now be re-filed because the state statute of limitations has expired. This simply is not correct. After the Commission denied the Association\u2019s second permit application on July 21,1976, the Association had 60 days within which to seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s action. Former Cal. Pub.Res.Code \u00a7 27424 (now \u00a7 30801).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Association filed suit in federal and state court on the 61st day after the Commission\u2019s denial of the second permit request, but both suits were timely because the 60th day, September 19, 1976, was a Sunday. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7\u00a7 12a, 12b. The timely filing of the federal suit tolled the running of the state limitation period. <em>Addison v. State, </em>21 Cal.3d 313, 146 Cal.Rptr. 224, 578 P.2d 941 (1978). The instant appeal further tolled the period. <em>See Hoover v. Galbraith, </em>7 Cal.3d 519, 102 Cal.Rptr. 733, 737, 498 P.2d 981, 985 (1972). There is nothing in <em>Addison </em>or <em>Hoover </em>which sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>gests that the tolling effect of the federal suit was diminished by the Association\u2019s filing and subsequent dismissal of the state suit. Accordingly, we conclude that the state forum is still available to the Association. Provided the Association files suit in state court before expiration of the 60 day limitation period (which period will start running again after this opinion is filed), appellants can obtain full and adequate judicial review of the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">In addition to the remedy just described, the Association is free to file another permit application with the Commission. If the new request is denied, judicial review may be sought in state court by way of a writ of mandate. We take judicial notice of the fact that the Association filed a third permit application, and the Commission\u2019s ruling on that application is now the subject of litigation in the state courts. In light of the obvious availability of state remedies, we hold that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Association\u2019s federal suit did not violate its members\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Some form of abstention was plainly justified. We are troubled, however, by the district judge\u2019s decision to use <em>Burford</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>abstention, under which the court dismisses the federal action altogether even though non-frivolous federal causes of action are alleged, instead of <em>Pullman </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> abstention, under which the court retains jurisdiction but abstains from deciding the case until the parties have had an opportunity to litigate the issues of state law in state court. <em>Pullman, </em>but not <em>Burford, </em>abstention gives litigants the option of submitting all issues\u2014 both state and federal \u2014 to the state tribunal for final adjudication or reserving the federal questions for decision by the federal court should the outcome of the state proceedings not render those questions moot. <em>England v. Louisiana State Bd. of Medical Exam., </em>375 U.S. 411, 84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">For the reasons set forth in <em>Rancho Palos Verdes Corp. v. City of Laguna Beach, </em>547 F.2d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 1976), we hold that <em>Burford </em>abstention was not proper in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-10\"><em>\u201c[Burford] </em>involved the regulatory system devised by Texas for conservation of oil and gas, and problems involving common tapping of oil pools and reservoirs by adjoining surface owners. Texas had established an elaborate unified administrative system for handling disputes, with direct judicial review of administrative orders concentrated in the state courts of a single county \u2018to prevent the confusion of multiple review of the same general issues.\u2019 319 U.S. at 326, 63 S.Ct. at 1103. The Court held that dismissal of the suit without retention of jurisdiction was proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-11\">In our judgment, this case is inappropriate for abstention under <em>Burford. </em>Unlike <em>Burford </em>or <em>Alabama Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Southern R. Co., </em>341 U.S. 341, 71 S.Ct. 762, 95 L.Ed. 1002 (1951), California has not sought to concentrate challenges to the actions of any of the agencies involved here in a particular court or set of courts. Here the federal questions, if any, that survive state adjudication can readily be identified and reserved without colliding with what are essentially state claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">As was true for the land use planning scheme at issue in <em>Rancho Palos Verdes, </em>California has not sought to concentrate challenges to the actions of the Coastal Zone Conservation Commission in a particular court. Rather, aggrieved parties may seek review by way of a writ of mandate in \u201cany court, except a municipal or justice court.\u201d Cal.Code Civ.Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1085, and 1094.5; Cal.Pub.Res.Code \u00a7 27424 (now \u00a7 30801), <em>supra, </em>n.1. The federal questions in this case (due process and just compensation) are readily identifiable and separable from the state law issues, which chiefly involve procedural matters such as the number of commissioners\u2019 votes required to take a given action. <em>Burford </em>abstention was, therefore, unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number><em>Pullman </em>abstention, on the other hand, was entirely appropriate. <em>Canton v. Spokane School Disk No. 81, </em>498 F.2d 840 (9th Cir. 1974) stated that <em>Pullman </em>abstention applies where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-5\">(1) The complaint \u201ctouches a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to its adjudication is open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-6\">(2) \u201cSuch constitutional adjudication plainly can be avoided if a definitive ruling on the state issue would terminate the controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-7\">(3) The possibly determinative issue of state law is doubtful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 845 (footnote omitted). The three tests have been satisfied here. First, it is settled that land use planning is a sensitive area of social policy for purposes of the <em>Pullman </em>doctrine. <em>Sederquist v. City of Tiburon, </em>590 F.2d 278, 281-82 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Rancho Palos Verdes Corp. v. City of Laguna Beach, supra, </em>547 F.2d at 1094. Second, resolution of one or more of the state, questions in the Association\u2019s favor will obviate the need for federal constitutional adjudication. Third, as was pointed out in <em>Sea Ranch Ass\u2019n v. Cal. Coastal Zone Cons. Comm\u2019n, </em>396 F.Supp. 533, 538-40 (N.D.Cal.1975), <em>aff\u2019d as to that ground, </em>537 F.2d 1058 (9th Cir. 1976), the California Coastal Zone Conservation Act of 1972, Cal. Pub.Res.Code \u00a7 27000, and its successor statute have not yet been definitively interpreted by the California courts. This comprehensive land use regulatory scheme presents complex and difficult issues of state law. \u201c[I]n order to avoid needless conflict with the administration by a state of its own affairs,\u201d C. Wright, Handbook of the Law of Federal Courts \u00a7 52, p. 218 (3d ed. 1976), state rather than federal courts should ordinarily be the first to construe the provisions of an integrated state regulatory program. Deference to state courts does not deprive the plaintiff of his right to choose a federal forum for the litigation of federal rights, for he may file an <em>England, supra, </em>reservation if he wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Association\u2019s suit and remand the case for further proceedings. On remand the district court should retain jurisdiction but stay the federal action pending adjudication of the state issues in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">.
