Schatz, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b431-5\">SCHATZ, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered on a jury verdict awarding damages for breach of contract. The issue presented is whether the district court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to strike from the record the testimony of an accountant regarding plaintiff\u2019s measure of damages. Finding no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s action, and no. prejudice to the defendant, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Plaintiff-appellee, Phil Crowley Steel Corporation (Crowley), entered into two separate contracts with the defendant-appellant, Macomber Incorporated, under which Macomber was to supply fabricated steel products to Crowley for use in certain construction projects. Macomber did not deliver and Crowley was forced to find replacement goods. Crowley bought some of the replacement goods from third parties and manufactured the remainder in its own fabricating plant. Thereafter Crowley brought this action against Macomber to recover damages for non-delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Crowley calculated its damages to be the cover price of the goods purchased from third parties, plus its lost profits on the goods it manufactured itself, less its contract price with Macomber. Crowley\u2019s costs for the goods purchased from third parties, and its raw material costs for the self-manufactured goods, were capable of direct computation and were not seriously controverted at trial. However, the labor and other variable costs of manufacture were the subject of varying interpretations. Crowley evolved several .theories for estimating this figure accurately, the last of which gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">In its original complaint, filed March 31, 1977, Crowley alleged damages for the two contracts in a total amount of $263,880.87. In February of 1978, Crowley filed its answers to Macomber\u2019s first set of interrogatories. By its answer to one of the questions, Crowley asserted that the damage calculation reflected in its complaint was inaccurate and that its total damages amounted to $295,063.65. This latter figure was arrived at by Crowley\u2019s assistant treasurer, Roger Pochon. Pochon\u2019s formula for estimating labor costs attributable to the two disputed contracts involved computing the percentage of Crowley\u2019s total labor costs equivalent to that percentage of Crowley\u2019s total billings represented by the same two contracts. Pochon\u2019s deposition was taken by Macomber and the case proceeded toward a trial date of July 24, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Thereafter, approximately one week before trial, Crowley revised its damage estimate again, this time based upon a formula supplied by Crowley\u2019s accountant, Lloyd Barnwell. A letter advising Macomber of this revision was mailed by Crowley\u2019s counsel on July 18, 1978, and was received by defense counsel July 20. No motion for a continuance was made and the trial commenced as scheduled on the 24th. On July 25, the second day of trial, Crowley filed with the Clerk\u2019s office a document entitled \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Amended Answer to Question No. 3 of Defendant\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories.\u201d This document, employing Barn-well\u2019s formula, contained Crowley\u2019s revised damage calculation, which now stood at $254,191.53, or approximately $40,000 less than the earlier answer to Macomber\u2019s interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Lloyd Barnwell was called as a witness for plaintiff Crowley on the afternoon of July 25. Following cross-examination, Ma-comber moved to strike Barnwell\u2019s testimony. As grounds for the motion, Macomber\u2019s counsel asserted unfair surprise in that Barnwell\u2019s method of computing damages was \u201cradically different\u201d from the earlier formula used by Roger Pochon. Macom-ber\u2019s own expert, it was claimed, had prepared his testimony based on the Pochon formula. In addition, Macomber\u2019s counsel claimed that use of the revised damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>formula contravened the pretrial order, which required that discovery be completed ten days before trial. Responding to questions from the trial judge, Macomber\u2019s counsel acknowledged that Barnwell\u2019s calculations were based on documents which had been previously supplied to Macomber, and that Macomber had received Crowley\u2019s letter explaining the new calculation no later than July 20. With the understanding that Macomber\u2019s expert would be prepared to testify the following day, the motion to strike was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">On appeal, Macomber asserts that denial of its motion to strike was prejudicial error warranting a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e) sets out the circumstances under which a party is required to supplement or amend answers previously given in response to the other party\u2019s discovery requests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Determining the existence of this duty and imposing sanctions for its breach are matters properly committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. On review this court is guided by the rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">[a] district court has very wide discretion in handling discovery and we are most unlikely to fault its judgment unless, in the totality of the circumstances, its rulings are seen to be a gross abuse of discretion resulting in fundamental unfairness in the trial of the case. <em>Voegeli v. Lewis, </em>568 F.2d 89, 96 (8th Cir. 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7p5\">In the instant case, Macomber claims that the method by which Crowley calculated its damages was a matter of such grave concern to both parties that the substitution of the Barnwell for the Pochon formula was subject to the supplemental disclosure requirements of Rule 26. For purposes of this appeal, we will assume that proposition to be sound.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From there, Ma-comber insists that Crowley breached its duty to make a timely disclosure because the trial court had ordered that discovery be completed ten days before trial, whereas Crowley did not inform Macomber of the. change in its calculation until approximately five days before trial. Again, we will assume that the district court might validly have treated Crowley\u2019s conduct as a breach of the discovery rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These assumptions, however, do not end the inquiry. The heart of the issue before this court is whether the striking of Barnwell\u2019s testimony was so clearly required to prevent undue prejudice to Macomber that the district court\u2019s refusal to do such amounted to an abuse of discretion. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">On the record presented to this court it is apparent, as it was to the district court, that the documents upon which Crowley\u2019s damages were calculated were made available to Macomber well in advance of trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Macomber was apprised that Crowley had revised its formula for computing those damages no later than July 20, four days before trial. Macomber was also informed that the source of this revision was Lloyd Barnwell. No continuance was sought. No effort was made by Macomber to discover the basis of Barnwell\u2019s theory nor was there any move to prevent him from testifying. It was not until after Barnwell had testified and been cross-examined that Macom-ber sought to exclude the evidence by means of a motion to strike. At the hearing on said motion, Macomber\u2019s counsel gave the trial judge no indication that Ma-comber\u2019s own expert would not be able to deal with Barnwell\u2019s testimony, or that he needed more than a day to prepare himself to do so. No such suggestion is now made to this court. It is simply urged by Macom-ber, and conceded by Crowley, that Roger Pochon\u2019s original cost formula was erroneously conceived, the result of which was an inflated view of Crowley\u2019s damages. During oral argument in this.court, Macomber\u2019s counsel candidly acknowledged that he preferred Pochon\u2019s higher damage estimate to Barnwell\u2019s lower one because Macomber\u2019s expert could cast greater doubt on the former than he could on the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Under all the circumstances of this case, we conclude that no showing has been made that there was any abuse of discretion by the trial judge or any showing that Macom-ber suffered any prejudice from the denial of its motion to strike. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\">. Rule 26(e) reads in pertinent part as follows: (e) Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement his response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">(2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if he obtains information upon the basis of which (A) he knows that the response was incorrect when made, or (B) he knows that the response though correct when made is no longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">.
