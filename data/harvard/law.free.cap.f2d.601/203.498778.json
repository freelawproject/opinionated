MORGAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A8Ry\">Appellant, William E. Welliver, former president of Bay National Bank and Trust Company, Panama City, Florida (Bay National), was convicted of violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 656<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 1005<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pertaining to \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d of funds and the making of false entries, respectively. On appeal Welliver presents a number of arguments for the reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">The case revolves around two similar business transactions involving standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>banking practices for the handling of certain loan transactions. In the first transaction, on November 19, 1974, Welliver, while president and under the direction of John Christo, Jr., chairman of the board and majority shareholder of the bank,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> telephoned Lewis State Bank, Tallahassee, Florida, where Bay National had a correspondent account, and instructed them to charge Bay National\u2019s correspondent account with approximately $341,000 and use the amount attained thereby to pay off a loan which Lewis State Bank had on account with A. I. Christo.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, a charge ticket from Lewis State Bank, dated November 20, 1974, was received by Bay National\u2019s bookkeeping department showing that Bay National\u2019s correspondent account had been so charged. Bay National\u2019s auditor promptly reconciled this charge by entering it on the bank\u2019s reconcilement ledger.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no specific offset made to Bay National\u2019s general ledger, however, until February 13, 1975. This delay was due to certain bank accounting procedures. These procedures required that before a specific entry could be made indicating that the bank had paid out a certain sum, there had to be available funds or an account against which the sum could be offset. The delay for roughly three months in the making of this entry was, in effect, a three month loan of approximately $341,000 to A. I. Christo for which interest at the market rate was paid in full. In the second transaction, on February 3,1975, Welliver, while president and again under the direction of John Christo, Jr., instructed that the Florida National Bank of Jacksonville (Florida National) transfer approximately $150,000 out of Bay National\u2019s correspondent account through the Federal Reserve System to the First National Bank of Fort Walton (First National). This money was then used by First National to pay off a loan taken out by the BALBI Corp.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Within a few days a charge ticket dated February 3, 1975, was received by Bay National\u2019s bookkeeping department from Florida National showing that Bay National\u2019s correspondent account had been charged approximately $150,000. This charge was entered on Bay National\u2019s reconcilement ledger. Again, due to the bank\u2019s accounting procedures, no specific offset was made to Bay National\u2019s general ledger until several months later on April 4, 1975, this delay being, in effect, a loan which was later repaid in full with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The government\u2019s position in this case has been that Welliver unlawfully misapplied bank funds in contravention of \u00a7 656 when he paid out approximately $150,000 on one occasion and $341,000 on another occasion and allowed these amounts to remain outstanding without a written obligation for repayment for a matter of months. Additionally, the government argued that, until specific offset entries were made to reconcile the transfers, the bank\u2019s Daily Statement of Condition and the Call Report of the Comptroller of the Currency<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contained false entries in violation of \u00a7 1005. The alleged false nature of these entries was due, the government asserts, to the fact that they indicated more money was due and owing to Bay National from its correspondent accounts with Florida National and Lewis State Bank than was actually due at that time. Welliver was convicted for both the \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d and the \u201cfalse entry\u201d offenses and instituted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>We first address Welliver\u2019s argument that the \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d counts <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were insufficient because the statutory language of \u00a7 656 is not sufficient, in and of itself, to charge an offense, due to the unsettled meaning of the phrase \u201cwillful misapplication.\u201d More particularly, Welliver asserts that the indictment failed to show how the funds were illegally and unlawfully applied. It is well settled that an indictment must set forth the offense with sufficient clarity and certainty to apprise the accused of the crime with which he is charged. <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 765, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962); <em>United States v. Bearden, </em>423 F.2d 805, 810 (5th Cir. 1970). This standard is applied using two criteria: (1) whether the indictment contains the elements of the offense charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant so that he will not be misled while preparing his defense; and (2) whether the defendant is protected against another prosecution for the same offense. <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. at 763-764, 82 S.Ct. 1038; <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 82, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). We find that the counts here called into question are sufficient under the criteria set forth above. Each count, following the language of the statute; set forth all the elements of the offense: (1) that the accused was an officer of a bank, (2) that the bank was connected in some capacity with a National bank, (3) that the accused willfully misapplied the funds of said bank, and (4) that the accused acted with intent to injure and defraud said bank.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, the counts specified the date of the offenses, the amounts involved and the name of the bank. <em>United States v. Mann, </em>517 F.2d 259, 267 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Scho-enhut, </em>576 F.2d 1010, 1024 (3rd Cir. 1978). Moreover, this court has held that \u201c[i]n a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656, where the offense is set out in the language of the statute, the omission of the means by which the offense was committed does not render the indictment insufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Bearden, </em>423 F.2d at 810, <em>citing United States v. Fortunato, </em>402 F.2d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 1968). Finally, the phrase \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d is not of such vague and uncertain application so as to require supplemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tation by further averment. <em>United States v. Mann, </em>517 F.2d 259, 267 (5th Cir. 1975). Accordingly, we hold Counts I and VIII of the indictment to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Next we address Welliver\u2019s contention that, because there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to support the charges, the trial judge was in error in denying Welliver\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. First, Welliver argues that as pertains to the \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d offense, there was insufficient evidence of an intent to defraud because there was no showing of a wrongful or improper transfer of funds. The rule in this circuit, however, is that \u201cthe government, in prosecutions under \u00a7 656, proves the requisite intent to defraud and injure by showing \u2018an unlawful act voluntarily done, the natural tendency of which may have been to injure the bank.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>United States v. Killian, </em>541 F.2d 1156, 1160 (5th Cir. 1976). See <em>United States v. Southers, </em>583 F.2d 1302, 1305 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Tidwell, </em>559 F.2d 262, 265 (5th Cir. 1977). We believe that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is sufficient to show that Welliver\u2019s voluntary manipulations left the bank in the position of having paid out large sums of money without obtaining a legally binding obligation for repayment, an act the natural tendency of which would be to injure the bank. See <em>United States v. Killian, supra. </em>Accordingly, we find no error in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant the motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial in regards to the \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d offense. Welliver also argues, that as to the \u201cfalse entry\u201d offenses, the evidence was insufficient to prove that the entries were actually false nor was there any evidence indicating that it was Welliver\u2019s responsibility to modify or correct such an entry. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we find that it was sufficient to withstand Welliver\u2019s motions. The essence of a \u00a7 1005 offense is the intentional making or causing to be made a bank entry which represents what is not true or does not exist. Here there was testimony by Bay National\u2019s auditor that he had spoken to Welliver several times regarding the preparation of an offset entry and that Welliver had replied that he was working on it. Thus, the jury could have concluded that Welliver both had responsibility for making of the offset entries and knew the entries were misrepresenting the true facts,</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Welliver next argues that he did not receive a fair and impartial trial because of the prejudicial questioning and comments by the trial judge. As Judge Hill stated in <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>572 F.2d 535, 541 (5th Cir. 1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">Although a trial court judge may interrogate a witness to clarify his testimony or to insure that a case is tried fairly, <em>Man-chack v. S/S Overseas Progress, </em>524 F.2d 918, 919 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Curd v. Todd-Johnson Dry Docks, </em>213 F.2d 864, 866 (5th Cir. 1954), the court in the case on appeal overstepped the bounds of appropriate judicial intervention. When a judge interjects himself into a trial by questioning witnesses, the judge places the opposing counsel in a disadvantageous position. The attorney may hesitate to object to the judge\u2019s examination for fear of creating a conflict, or appearing to create a conflict between the judge and himself. Therefore, when the attorneys are competently conducting their cases, it is improper for the trial judge to question the witnesses. <em>Gomila v. United States, </em>146 F.2d 372, 373-76 (5th Cir. 1944).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Accord, <em>Bursten v. United States, </em>395 F.2d 976, 982-83 (5th Cir. 1968). In the present case the judge repeatedly usurped the questioning of witnesses from counsel who were competently conducting the examination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Consequently, the jury may have been inadvertently led to believe, from the judge\u2019s repeated questioning and from his comments, that he was of the opinion that the defendant was guilty and should be convicted. Accordingly, we find that the trial judge improperly interjected himself into the trial below in such a manner and to such an extent as to deny Welliver a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AYI\">Welliver also argues that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that a \u201creckless disregard of the interest of the bank is the equivalent of intent to injure or defraud the bank\u201d for purpose of both \u00a7\u00a7 656 and 1005.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An essential element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>a violation of either of these statutes is that the defendant acted with an \u201cintent to injure or defraud.\u201d This requirement is contained within the language of \u00a7 1005. The language of \u00a7 656, however, merely prohibits a \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d of funds with the requirement of an \u201cintent to injure or defraud\" having been judicially imposed. <em>United States v. Mann, </em>517 F.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">As pertains to \u00a7 656, this court has held that a \u201c\u2018reckless disregard of the interest of a bank is, for purpose of \u201cwillful misapplication,\u201d the equivalent of intent to injure or defraud.\u2019\" <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>573 F.2d 242, 244-45 (5th Cir. 1978) <em>quoting United States v, Wilson, </em>500 F.2d 715, 720 (5th Cir. 1974). Consequently, the trial judge\u2019s instruction was correct as to \u00a7 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">As pertains to \u00a7 1005, however, this court has never held \u201crecklessness\" to be sufficient to satisfy the specific intent requirement, nor do we think it should. We agree that \u201crecklessness\u201d may be a reasonable basis in some cases for punishing the making of a \u201cfalse entry,\u201d such as where it appears that there has been a deliberate attempt to avoid knowing whether the entry is fraudulent or deceptive. However, it does not necessarily follow that in all cases proof of a specific intent to injure or defraud should be eliminated by a vague generalization equating recklessness with intent to defraud. <em>See generally, Berkovitz v. United States, </em>213 F.2d 468 (5th Cir. 1954); <em>Wardlaw v. United States, </em>203 F.2d 884 (5th Cir. 1953). When a trial judge in his instructions refers to \u201crecklessness\u201d, no more is necessarily implied than such mere negligence, carelessness, thoughtlessness, or inadvertence as could not be regarded as the equivalent of an intentional wrong. We believe that the instruction given by the trial judge was in error with respect to the alleged violations of \u00a7 1005. The instruction should either have contained a definition of \u201crecklessness\u201d requiring that more than mere negligence, carelessness, thoughtlessness, or inadvertence be found before the entry could be found to have been made with an \u201cintent to defraud\u201d, or it should have been made apparent to the jury that it did not have to find an intent to defraud merely because the defendant acted recklessly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Finally, Welliver contends the trial judge erred in refusing to allow his witnesses to testify concerning the acquiescence of the bank\u2019s board of directors in the actions of the appellant, such consent being a matter of defense. We disagree. Determinations of the relevance and admissability of evidence lie largely in the discretion of the trial court. Its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. 110 Bars of Silver, 3 Crucibles of Silver, 11 Bags of Silver Coins, </em>508 F.2d 799, 802 (5th Cir. 1975). We find no such abuse here. The evidence was concerning an acquiescence which occurred after the transactions in question and, as such, was of dubious value in establishing the intent of the defendant at the time the transactions took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">In order that a new trial, free from prejudicial error, may be accorded the appellant, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-12\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 656 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALb\">Theft, embezzlement, or misapplication by bank officer or employee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aey\">Whoever, being an officer, director, agent or employee of, or connected in any capacity with any Federal Reserve bank, member bank, national bank, or a receiver of a national bank, or any agent or employee of the receiver, or a Federal Reserve Agent, or an agent or employee of a Federal Reserve Agent or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, embezzles, abstracts, purloins or willfully misapplied any of the moneys, funds or credits of such bank or any moneys, funds, assets or securities intrusted to the custody or care of such bank, or to the custody or care of any such agent, officer, director, employee or receiver, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both; but if the amount embezzled, abstracted, purloined or misapplied does not exceed $100, he shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-21\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1005 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGR\">Bank entries, reports and transactions . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-22\">Whoever makes any false entry in any book, report, or statement of such bank with intent to injure or defraud such bank, or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to deceive any officer of such bank, or the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any agent or examiner appointed to examine the affairs of such bank, or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-23\">Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-4\">.

Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlN\">THE COURT: And was not a true statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alt-dedup-0\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzM\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t say otherwise? You told me something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZJ\">A. Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b297-42\">. The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-43\">\u201cYou will note that the words \u201cintent to injure or defraud\u201d appear as an essential element in each of these counts of the indictment. To act with \u2014 in fact every count of the indictment. To act with intent to defraud means to act willfully and with a specific intent to deceive or cheat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-44\">\u201cThe requirement that the defendant intended to injure or defraud the bank may be shown by an unlawful act, voluntarily done, the natural tendency of which may have been to injure the bank. It is not necessary, however, that actual injury to the bank be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-45\">\u201cA reckless disregard of the interest of the bank is the equivalent of intent to injure or defraud the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-46\">\u201cIt is reasonable to infer that a person ordinarily intends the natural and probable consequences of his knowing acts. The jury may but is not required to draw the inference and find that the accused intended all the consequences which one standing in like circumstances and possessing like knowledge should reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>have expected to result from any intentional act or conscious omission. Any such inference drawn is entitled to be considered by the jury in determining whether or not the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the requisite criminal intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. In a somewhat analogous situation this court and others have recognized that although a jury may find an intent to defraud from the fact that a person presumably intends the natural consequences of his actions, an instruction to that effect should not require the jury to make such a finding, or even shift the burden of proof to the defendant. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>473 F.2d 439, 443-44 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v.
