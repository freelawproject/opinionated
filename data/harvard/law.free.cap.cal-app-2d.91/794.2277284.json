The original pleadings filed by the plaintiffs were conventional quiet title complaints. When the cases came on for trial plaintiffs asked leave to file amendments setting up a second cause of action but permission to do so was denied and the cases proceeded to trial on the original complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">According to the answer filed in the first case, \u201cone Agnes J. Krupp de Celle, named as a defendant herein, from her separate funds purchased the lands and premises described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint (about June 9, 1932) and caused the title thereto to be taken in the name of Elly Ebbesen May, Ane Margrete Ebbesen and Edel Ebbesen, to be held by them in a secret trust for said Agnes J. Krupp de Celle and the said Agnes J. Krupp de Celle was the owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>whole of the beneficient interest\u201d therein. It is then alleged that\u201c at the time of the purchase of said real property by the said Agnes J. Krupp de Celle and at the time of the execution of the Deed conveying title thereto to Elly Ebbesen May,\u201d et al., the Alhambra Building &amp; Loan Association was a creditor of Agnes J. Krupp De Celle and on June 12, 1933 recovered judgment against said De Celle and husband in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County for the sum of $6,785.43, recording an abstract of such judgment in that county. There were similar allegations in the Klara Sorensen action.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Thereafter, and about November 5, 1937, the Alhambra Building and Loan Association, referred to as \u201cAlhambra,\u201d filed an action to set aside the above mentioned deeds by De Celle, and on February 8, 1940, judgment was rendered invalidating the deeds on the ground that said conveyances were fraudulent and void as to creditors, and subjecting said lands to the lien of the Alhambra Judgment. On appeal (47 Cal.App.2d 409 [118 P.2d 19]), this judgment was modified; setting the deeds aside only \u201cto the extent necessary to liquidate said judgment, \u2019 \u2019 instead of <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">On October 2, 1937, Alhambra filed an action to renew the original judgment against De Celle, and on February 6, 1940, recovered judgment therein, in the sum of $9,943.65. No appeal was taken from the latter judgment and on April 16, 1940, execution was levied upon all the right, title and interest of De Celle in the property in question; there was a sheriff\u2019s sale and on July 11, 1941, a sheriff\u2019s deed was executed to the Alhambra Building &amp; Loan Association. Thereafter Alhambra\u2019s successor, First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Alhambra, conveyed the property to Roy Rosen and other defendants; these defendants then secured a judgment quieting title as against De Celle on November 16, 1944, and Agnes J. Krupp De Celle executed to said defendants a quitclaim deed to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In the present quiet title action by Elly Ebbesen May et al., and Klara Sorensen, the trial court found in favor of defendants, reciting the previous history of the controversy hereinbefore mentioned, and decreeing that plaintiffs had no interest in the property. It was further found that the former judgment secured by Alhambra, setting aside the De Celle deeds, was res judicata so far as the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The first ground urged by appellants as justifying a reversal is \u201cThe failure of the trial court to grant a continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>anee until the written interrogatories (taken in Denmark) arrived constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d On this point appellants\u2019 brief states that \u201cAll of the plaintiffs were residents of Denmark and the Court (in the present actions) was so informed that the written interrogatories had not arrived and that the plaintiffs\u2019 entire testimony consisted of matters covered by the interrogatories, and that their only other witness was possibly Mrs. De Celle, named in the action as a defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">It is further averred that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had encountered many difficulties, including language and translation problems, and were unable to prepare and send the written interrogatories at an earlier date.\u201d Prevailing war conditions are also mentioned with the statement that \u201cthe trend appears to be that the courts will continue the cause until the parties have had full opportunity to come into court and offer their testimony.\u201d It is urged that the failure of the depositions to arrive in time for the trial \u201cplaced plaintiffs in an unexpected situation wherein they were injured without fault or negligence on their part,\u201d and that the denial of a continuance \u201cwas not in accordance with the Anglo-Saxon conception of justice and fair play.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Answering this contention, respondents\u2019 brief points out that on October 9, 1947, the date of trial was advanced from August 8, 1948, to January 29, 1949, of which fact appellants had due notice; that the appellants\u2019 notice of motion to take the depositions in Denmark was not served or filed until December 12, 1947, some two months after the trial date had been advanced. In denying appellants\u2019 motion for continuance the trial court stated that it would \u201cconsider whether these depositions are to be introduced at a later date, and if they are material the court will be very liberal in permitting their reception.\u201d During the trial the interrogatories were submitted and the trial court said: \u201cI have grave doubt\u2014 this is an offhand opinion. After having gone through these questions whether any answers here that could be given would present competent testimony to establish the claim.\u201d So, respondents\u2019 brief avers, \u201cthe effect was practically the same as if the deposition had been returned and an attempt had been made by counsel for plaintiffs to read the same in evidence.\u201d Respondents also take the position that \u201cthe depositions would be inadmissible in a collateral attack on the Alhambra judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The granting or refusing of a continuance is, as appellants \u2019 brief concedes, a matter of discretion with the trial court. Except in the case of a clear abuse of such discretion, appellate courts will not interfere with the exercise thereof,  In the instant controversy appellants have entirely failed to present any evidence of abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretioh. Nor does the record disclose anything which might reasonably lead to such a conclusion. Indeed, it is reasonable to believe that, had appellants acted with more promptness in instituting proceedings to take the depositions, such evidence would have been available at the time of trial. Moreover, as respondents have pointed out, since the Alhambra judgment was res judicata, and not subject to collateral attack, depositions attempting to impeach the validity of such judgment would be inadmissible and could avail appellants nothing. Regardless of these matters, however, since abuse has not been established, no appellate interference with the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion is here warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">It is argued by appellants that the judgment in the Alhambra action against appellants is void because of want of jurisdiction for the reason that the Danish defendants (appellants herein) \u201cdid not authorize counsel to appear for them in the trial of the case.\u201d It is claimed that Agnes De Celle signed the answer as agent for appellants but without authorization from such parties. The trial court found, however, that \u201csaid plaintiffs and each of them (appellants herein) were represented by counsel during the trial of said (Alhambra) action,\u201d and also that appellants were likewise \u201crepresented by counsel in the appeal which was taken from said judgment\u201d; that the ownership of the property \u201cwas adjudicated and the matter is res adjudicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Respondents\u2019, brief contends that appellants were properly represented by counsel, relying on the fact that \u201cAn attorney is an officer of the court, and the presumption is that he has acted within the scope of his employment, \u2019 \u2019 quoting from 3 California Jurisprudence, page 644. It is further argued that \u201cwhether counsel was authorized to appear for Klara Sorensen and the Ebbesens is immaterial because these persons were served with summons.\u201d Respondent also points out that \u201cA judgment cannot be collaterally attacked on the ground that the attorney for the attacking party was not authorized to represent him.\u201d In a reply brief, appellants contend that the attack on the Alhambra judgment is proper since the defect is not apparent on its face; that the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>is not res judicata; and that \u201cThe attack on the judgment is not a direct attack on the judgment nor is it collateral, but it is an indirect attack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In the case of <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>119 Cal.App. 214, 217 [6 P.2d 281], the court said: \u201cIt is also contended that the judgment-roll in the action shows a lack of jurisdiction because the attorney who instituted the action was not the attorney who signed the stipulation. There is no merit in this, as the attorney appearing and acting for a party is presumed to have authority, and the validity of his acts cannot be called in question collaterally\u201d citing various earlier California cases. The court there defined a \u201ccollateral attack\u201d as \u201can attempt to impeach a judgment by matters dehors the record in an action other than that in which it was rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">And in <em>Parkside Realty Co. </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>167 Cal. 342 [139 P. 805], is found the following statement: \u201cnothing that we have said is to be taken as intimating that a judgment valid on its face may be collaterally attacked on the ground that the attorney who appeared for the party against whom it runs was not authorized to appear for such party.\u201d As said in respondents\u2019 brief, \u201cIt would be a strange situation, indeed, if a plaintiff in a case was required to determine, at his peril, whether or not counsel appearing for the defendant was authorized to make the appearance where there is a vigorous and able presentation by the counsel appearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Appellants \u2019 further contention that no jurisdiction was acquired under the constructive service employed in the action by Alhambra, is predicated on the admitted fact that the affidavit of mailing recited that, pursuant to the order of publication, affiant mailed to the foreign defendants, \u201ca copy of the Summons and Amended Complaint in this suit,\u201d whereas the original summons \u201chad been supplemented by a Summons on an Amended Complaint. \u2019 \u2019 Appellants insist that \u201cstrict compliance with the statute respecting constructive service must be followed in acquiring jurisdiction,\u201d and that service of the original summons was a nullity since it had been superseded by a summons issued on an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Respondents\u2019 brief answers the above argument by observing that although the affidavit was defective in not specifying that the summons served was the later one issued on the amended complaint, appellants do not claim \u201cthat they did not receive a copy of the Amended Complaint and a copy of the Summons issued on the Amended Complaint. All that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>they claim is that the <em>affidavit of service </em>is defective\u201d; that \u201cThe fact of service and not the proof of service is the important element,\u201d citing to that effect <em>Vail </em>v. Jones, 209 Cal. 251, 255 [287 P. 99], and other cases so holding. Still other cases hold that great liberality is allowed to show the fact of service, and that slight discrepancies not capable of misleading the defendant are immaterial. As pointed out in respondents\u2019 brief, H. S. Farrell, who made the affidavit of mailing in question, testified that the summons referred to in the affidavit was \u201cthe summons on the Amended Complaint,\u201d and stated that a copy of the summons issued on the amended complaint was mailed to each of the foreign defendants. Under the holding in <em>Vail </em>v. Jones, 209 Cal. 251, 255 [287 P. 99], hereinbefore referred to, \u201cIt cannot avail appellant that the proof of service . . . differed from the fact of service. . . . Jurisdiction does not depend upon proof of service but upon the fact that service was made. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The trial court found that the defendants Roy Rosen, et al., \u201care the owners in fee by adverse possession\u201d which had continued for more than five years preceding the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 action. This title is controverted by appellants who advance the proposition that a state of war between countries \u201cis effective to suspend the running of statutes of limitations.\u201d This theory, say appellants, \u201cis carried into California law in the form of Code of Civil Procedure, Section 354: \u2018When a person is, by reason of the existence of a state of war, under a disability to commence an action, the time of the continuance of such disability is not part of the period limited for the commencement of the action whether such cause of action shall have accrued prior to or during the period of such disability. \u2019 \u201d However, regardless of the law on this subject, there is no merit in appellants\u2019 contention; the principles contended for are inapplicable. As respondents have pointed out, since it had been judicially determined in the case of <em>Alhambra Bldg. &amp; L. Assn. </em>v. <em>DeCelle, </em>47 Cal.App.2d 409 [118 P.2d 19], that \u201cappellants were never seized or possessed of the real property herein involved . . . they obviously cannot now, nor could they ever have maintained an action.\u201d And respondents\u2019 brief further mentions the fact that \u201cappellants did not file any complaint until June 11, 1947, although the German Armies had surrendered in May of 1945. The period of adverse possession of respondents Rosen and Elstein was continuous from February 13, 1942, and was not completed until February 13, 1947. The appellants therefore, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>seized or possessed, had they exercised due diligence, could have filed an action between May, 1945, and February 13, 1947, during which period Denmark was no longer occupied.\u201d Appellants\u2019 closing brief contains no negation or explanation of such facts other than apparent reliance upon the \u201cstill unsettled conditions in Europe and other unforeseen difficulties involving language, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">There is substantial evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s findings, and no reversible error is apparent in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
