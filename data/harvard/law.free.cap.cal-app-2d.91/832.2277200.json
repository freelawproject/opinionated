Lockert, deceased, instituted the within action against decedent\u2019s brother, Robert S. Anderson, and one Quincy Cass, for the purpose of quieting title to and impressing a trust upon an undivided one-half interest in certain corporate stocks. As set forth in the complaint, the stock certificates in question stood \u201cin the combined names of Minnie A. Anderson (mother of Jessie P. Lockert and Robert S. Anderson), Jessie P. Lockert (now deceased) and Robert S. Anderson (defendant herein) as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, and not as tenants in common. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">On February 3, 1946, a written instrument, referred to in the briefs as the \u201cBrother-Sister Contract,\u201d was executed by Jessie P. Lockert and Robert S. Anderson, brother and sister, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\">\u2018 \u2018 This is a Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement by and between the undersigned Robert S. Anderson and Jessie P. Lockert, brother and sister, in relation to the personal estate of their mother, Mrs. Minnie A. Anderson, widow, all residents of the City of Los Angeles, State of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">\u201cSaid estate consists of shares of capital stock in sundry corporations and money deposits in bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">\u2018 \u2018 The estate originated in the bequest by will of Charles II. Anderson, our father, deceased in October, 1932, whose will provided, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-8\">\u201c \u2018I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Minnie A. Anderson, all of the estate of which I may die possessed both real and personal wheresoever situated for her use and benefit during her life, and at the death of my said wife all the remainder of said estate shall be divided equally between my daughter, Jessie P. Anderson, and my son, Robert S. Anderson, share and share alike. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-9\">\u201cIn accordance with the terms, letter and spirit of said bequest, and notwithstanding the estate is now partly in monies in bank, but mainly represented by certificates of capital stocks issued in joint tenancy in the names of Minnie A. Anderson, Jessie P. Lockert, and Robert S. Anderson; and that said certificates are in the possession and custody of said Robert S. Anderson solely as representative and agent of his mother\u2019s estate; and that likewise he has authority jointly with her to receive, deposit in bank, and disburse therefrom for her account, in her name, all monies derived from her estate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">\u201cIt is hereby agreed that in the event our mother shall pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>decease both of us, all her estate left at such time shall be, as soon as legally possible, divided, share and share alike between us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvM\">It appears from the pleadings as summarized in appellant\u2019s brief, that the mother, Minnie A. Anderson \u201cdied on March 10, 1947, slightly over a year subsequent to the date of the Brother-Sister Contract. . . . Jessie P. Loekert died on May 27, 1947, two months and 24 days after the death of the mother. ... At the time of the mother\u2019s death . . . there was, and ever since said date there have been, standing in the names of Minnie A. Anderson, Jessie P. Loekert and Robert S. Anderson, as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the stocks (here in question). . . . Robert S. Anderson has had possession of the certificates representing said stocks, either in person or through his agent, Quincy Cass, ever since the death of the mother. \u2019 \u2019 The said Quincy Cass, made a defendant because in actual possession of the stock certificates, filed a disclaimer, alleging that said stocks were held solely as agent for the other defendant, Robert S. Anderson. It appears that Anderson had been adjudged incompetent and the answer was filed by a guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The parties stipulated that the action might be set for trial on the short cause calendar, and \u2018 \u2018 That at the trial of the said action no testimony will be taken, but the action will be submitted on the pleadings and argument of counsel.\u201d Pursuant thereto, after argument the cause was submitted for decision without any evidence having been offered. The trial court found in favor of plaintiff (appellant herein). Thereafter, defendant\u2019s (respondent\u2019s) motion for a new trial on the stated grounds of \u201cInsufficiency of evidence to justify the decision, \u2019 \u2019 and \u201cThat the decision of the Court is against law, \u2019 \u2019 was granted. The plaintiff has appealed from the order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Appellant\u2019s brief presents \u201ctwo alternate theories concerning the purposes and effect of the Brother-Sister Contract.\u201d The first theory is \u201cthat the record title to the corporate shares was taken in the names of the three persons not with any intent to create a joint tenancy tenure with all its incidents, but solely as a measure deemed convenient . . . and (b) that the Brother-Sister Contract was drawn and executed to evidence the true status.\u201d The second theory is that \u201ceven though the corporate shares had been taken in the name of the three persons with the intent to create therein a joint tenancy with all its legal incidents, the contract operated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>a mutual waiver by the brother and sister of their respective rights of survivorship\u2014a waiver, under the authorities hereinafter cited, effective to break up the joint tenancy between them and establish a tenancy in common.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The respondent\u2019s position is that the trial court was justified in granting a new trial and nullifying the original judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, for the reason that there is no evidence showing that the stocks in question were at any time a part of the mother\u2019s estate or a part of the estate of Jessie P. Lockert; that the brother and sister contract in no way affected the legal status of the stocks held in joint tenancy, which, upon the deaths of the mother and daughter, became the sole property of the surviving joint tenant, Robert S. Anderson, defendant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The original conclusion of the trial court \u201cThat the brother-sister agreement . . . destroyed the right of survivorship between said parties, and that from and after the death of Minnie A. Anderson (the mother) on March 10, 1947, Jessie P. Lockert and Robert S. Anderson were the owners in equal shares, as tenants in common and not as joint tenants, of the stocks listed,\u201d finds justification both in law and under the undisputed facts of the instant case. Therefore the subsequent granting of a new trial from which order the present appeal is taken, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"AOG\">That joint tenants may by agreement change the nature of the estate from that of joint tenancy with rights of survivorship to a tenancy in common carrying no survivorship rights, cannot be doubted. \u201cIt has been held,\u201d says the court in <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>McArthur, </em>30 Cal.2d 512, 515 [183 P.2d 1], \u201cthat an agreement between two joint tenants whereby they agree to a different disposition of the property than that of survivorship terminates the relationship,\u201d citing <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>15 Cal.2d 409, 412 [101 P.2d 690, 129 A.L.R. 810]. In the McDonald case, it was said \u201cAt the time when Mr. and Mrs. McDonald made their agreement, they held title to the property \u2018as joint tenants.\u2019 Such an estate requires unity of interest, unity of title, unity of time, and unity of possession. ... A distinguishing incident of it is the right of survivorship. . . . But by their contract the parties specifically provided that if either one of them died, the interest of that one should not go to the survivor but to the daughter. This is entirely inconsistent with an estate in joint tenancy, which was thereby terminated. . . . Thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. McDonald were tenants in common with separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>descendible interests.\u201d The applicability of the above mentioned decisions is questioned in the respondent\u2019s brief, which points out the factual differences from the instant controversy. \u201cIn the case at bar,\u201d respondent avers, \u201cthere is no provision contained in the brother-sister contract that if either or one of them should die, the interest of that one should not go to the survivor. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">It is doubtless true that the brother-sister agreement could have been couched in more definite and appropriate terms. The purpose which the signatory parties had in mind, however, appears to be clear enough, and is definitely stated in the agreement. By its own terms, the document is \u201ca Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement\u201d between brother and sister, concerning what is described as \u201cthe personal estate of their mother,\u201d consisting of \u201cshares of capital stock,\u201d etc. The agreement further identifies the so-called \u201cestate\u201d as having \u201coriginated in the bequest by will of Charles H. Anderson, our father,\u201d which will left all property to Minnie A. Anderson (the mother) \u201cfor her use and benefit during her life, and at the death of my said wife all the remainder of said estate shall be divided equally between (the brother and sister) . . . share and share'alike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The exact purpose of the brother-sister agreement is none other than that of insuring that the \u201cestate\u201d originating in the father\u2019s will, described as \u201cmainly represented by certificates of capital stocks issued in joint tenancy in the names of Minnie A. Anderson, Jessie P. Lockert, and Robert S. Anderson; ... in the possession and custody of Robert S. Anderson solely as the representative and agent of his mother\u2019s estate,\u201d should be handled \u201cIn accordance with the terms, letter and spirit of said bequest.\u201d Notwithstanding the fact that nominally such stocks were standing in the joint names of the three parties interested with rights of survivor-ship, the brother and sister specifically \u201cagreed that in the event our mother shall predecease both of us, all her estate left at such time shall be, as soon as legally possible, divided <em>share and share alike between us.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) In other words, since the father\u2019s will had not provided for a joint tenancy between the two children with right of survivorship, but directed that the estate should, at the mother\u2019s death, be divided \u201cshare and share alike,\u201d it was the intention of the brother and sister that this \u201cshare and share alike\u201d arrangement should prevail regardless of the nominal joint tenancy aspect of the stock certificates. The mother did pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>decease the two children about one year after execution of the brother-sister contract; some two months later the sister, Jessie P. Lockert died. The brother-sister agreement had not been revoked or modified in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Respondent\u2019s contention that the stocks here in question are not sufficiently identified with those mentioned in the brother-sister agreement, is without substantial merit. The stocks held in joint tenancy, their derivation and the facts connected therewith, were specifically described in the complaint. In the answer \u201cthis defendant admits that he has been in possession of <em>said stock certificates, </em>either personally or through his agent, since the death of Minnie A. Anderson and that no change was made in the registered ownership of said stock certificates prior to the death of Jessie P. Loekert, nor has any change in the registered ownership of said stock certificates been made to the date of filing this answer.\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court\u2019s finding that \u201csaid stocks are part of the property which is the subject matter of the agreement\u201d cannot be said to have been an unreasonable deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">It is further insisted by the respondent that it does not appear that the mother, Minnie A. Anderson, left any \u201cestate\u201d to which the brother-sister agreement could apply. It is to he noted, however, that this agreement was executed during the mother\u2019s lifetime; that under the father\u2019s will the mother had but a life estate, the remainder going to the brother and sister, \u201cshare and share alike.\u201d Obviously, all these facts were known to the parties when the brother-sister agreement was signed. Under the circumstances, therefore, it is but a reasonable inference that the term \u201cestate\u201d was not employed in the technical, legal sense contended for by respondent, as meaning a probate \u201cestate\u201d left by the mother, but was rather used in a general sense to designate the \u201ccertificates of capital stock held in joint tenancy,\u201d referred to in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">According to Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, the word \u201cestate\u201d may mean \u201cproperty,\u201d or \u201cThe degree, quality, nature and extent of one\u2019s interest in, or ownership\u201d of property, real or personal. The very purpose of the brother-sister agreement as therein expressed, was to determine and set at rest \u201cthe degree, quality, nature and extent\u201d of the children\u2019s interests in the stocks which, for convenience or other reason, had been nominally issued in joint tenancy. The respondent\u2019s contentions are all untenable; the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>original decision properly effectuates the obvious intent expressed in the brother-sister agreement. The motion for a new trial was therefore improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 2, 1949, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 14, 1949. Carter, J., and Schauer, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
