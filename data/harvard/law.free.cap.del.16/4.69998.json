By the fifth section of the act it was provided that any person charged with violation of its provisions should have a right of appeal to the Superior Court of the county wherein the hearing took place. Such appeal to be allowed at any time within fifteen days from the date of the judgment. Under that section an appeal was entered with surety that the same should be prosecuted with effect and also that any judgment which should be rendered against the said William L. Morrow or his executors or administrators on said appeal should be satisfied. The appeal so taken was pending in the Superior Court for New Castle County. On motion of the Attorney- General a rule was granted upon the defendant below appellant to show cause why the appeal should not be stricken from the record and the writ of summons therein quashed and the cause remanded to the justice below from whom the appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-8\">At the hearing of the rule on March 9, 1895, the following order was entered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-9\">\u201c Whereupon, said Superior Court, in and for New Castle County, considering that the question, whether it had or had not jurisdiction tc hear and determine the said appeal, ought to be decided before all the judges, it is on the application of both parties, ordered and directed by the Court that the said question, whether or not the said Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>and determine said appeal, be reserved and heard in the Court of Errors and Appeals.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">Accordingly at the June term, 1895, the case was heard in the Court of Errors and Appeals before Wolcott, Ch., Lore, C.

D. 1895, at Wilmington Hundred, sell two rabbits and two dozen partridges, in violation of Chapter 207, Volume 17, Laws of Delaware. This charges a public offence to have been committed in violation of a law forbidding it, and for the doing of such act' the law attaches a punishment of fine, and in default of payment thereof, imprisonment in the County Jail; Rev.

The Superior Court neither has nor can have any jurisdiction over crimes and misdemeanors, therefore the General Assembly when it enacted Section 5, of Chap. 655, Vol. 19, Laws of Delaware, conferring jurisdiction on the Superior Court of the State, acted without authority and beyond the powers delegated to it by the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-10\">The appeal to the Superior Court in this case was taken and granted under and by force and virtue of the. provisions of Section 5, Chapter 655, Vol. 19, Delaware Laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>In enacting this section the General Assembly exceeded the powers conferred on it, and therefore it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-6\">The whole judicial power of this State is vested in the Courts enumerated in the first section of Article 6 of the amended constitution of 1832. For the purpose of this argument, however, we only have to do with three of said Courts, viz: the Superior Court, the Court of Oyer and Terminer and the Court of General Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">I. The Superior <em>Court.\u2014\u201c </em>This Court shall have jurisdiction of all causes of a civil nature, real personal and mixed, at common law, and all other the jurisdiction and powers vested by the laws of the State in the Supreme Court or Court of Common Pleas. Constitution, Art. 6, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">The ease before the Court, being criminal in its nature, is not included in the first clause of the above paragraph, <em>i. e., </em>is not \u201c of a civil nature.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-9\">If, therefore, there is any jurisdiction in the Superior Court over the subject matter involved in the case now before it, it must be derived from the jurisdiction and powers vested by the laws of this State, at the time of the adoption of the present Constitution, \u201c in the Supreme Court or Court of Common Pleas.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-10\">In examining these two sources of jurisdiction, I will first consider that derived from the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-11\">This Court was created about the year 1737, its jurisdiction was purely civil in its nature, and expressly so declared and defined. 1 Del. Laws, Chap. 54, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-12\">The Constitution of 1792 refers to this Court, but it does not define its jurisdiction, other than by the provision, that all laws of the State in force at the time of adoption of the Constitution, not inconsistent with it, remain in force, unless altered by future laws, etc. Constitution 1792, Art. 6, \u00a7 1, Art. 8, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-13\">Its jurisdiction continued to be a purely civil nature up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>adoption \u2022 of our present constitution in 1832.

Hall\u2019s Dig. 102.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">So that the Superior Court did not inherit or derive any criminal jurisdiction from the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-8\">This leaves only one source from which the Superior Court has, or can derive any criminal jurisdiction. I now contend that the Superior Court has not derived from said Supreme Court .jurisdiction which will enable' it to hear these 'appeals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-9\">The Supreme Court was created about the year 1737, its jurisdiction, which was both original and appellate, was also both criminal and civil. The appellate jurisdiction only was both civil and criminal. 1 Del. Laws, Ch. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13, and 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-10\">This act was repealed and .supplied (so far as it established this court) in 1760 by Chapter 167, 1 Del.

Laws, Ch. 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-11\">The constitution of 1792, while it mentions this Court by name, does not define its jurisdiction, but it does say that its Judges shall be Justices of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery. Constitution 1792, Arts. 6-7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-12\">As has been seen, in reference to the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, that said constitution preserves \u201c all existing laws, etc.\u201d Art. 8, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-13\">In the year-1793, by 2 Del. Laws, Ch. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 4-5-8, the Supreme Court was stripped of the most of its criminal jurisdiction; 2 Del. Laws, 1089. See <em>id. </em>1191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-14\">Again in 1829, all its criminal jurisdiction was taken away and vested in the Court of \u201c Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery \u201d and the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and General Jail Delivery ; 7 Del. Laws, 410. See Hall\u2019s Digest, 104-105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-15\">The law continued to exist in this condition up to, and did so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>exist at the time of, the adoption of the constitution of 1832, 7 and 8, Del. Laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">It is submitted, therefore, that at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1832, by which the Superior Court was created, there was no criminal jurisdiction or power in either the Court of Common Pleas, or the Supreme Court, except the power in the Judges of the Supreme Court to deliver the jails of all persons committed for \u201c murders, treasons and such other crimes as now are, or hereafter shall be made capital or felonies of death,\u201d and this latter power is only exercised by the Judges of said Court sitting as a Court of Oyer and Terminer, and not in the Superior Court; Constitution 1792, Art. 5, \u00a73; Hall\u2019s Digest, 104, 105 J Barker\u2019s Debates, Convention, 1832, 170, 171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">So that the only jurisdiction and powers in criminal matters that were formerly vested in the Supreme Court, and by the constitution of 1832, transferred to the Superior Court were that \u201cthe Judges of the Supreme Court shall, by virtue of their offices, be Justices of the Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery in the several counties, in the exercise of which, they were confined to capital felonies and manslaughter, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-8\">By 1 Del. Laws, Chapter 54, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 a Court of General Quarter, Sessions of the Peace and ' Jail Delivery was created, and its powers defined about the year 1737; 1 Del. Laws, 121.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-9\">It was given jurisdiction over the sale of intoxicating liquors and the regulating inns, taverns and other public house keepers in 1740; 1 Del.

Laws, Ch. 249, p. 1036.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-11\">It was named a Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery in 1792; Const. Art. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1-19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-12\">By 2 Del. Laws, Chapter 19c, \u00a7 8, its jurisdiction was greatly enlarged in 1793, by curtailing that of the Supreme Court. 2 Del.

Laws, 1304.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">In 1826 and 1829, when the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was again curtailed by 6 Delaware Laws, Chapter 362, Section 12, this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over criminal matters was extended so as to include all crimes and misdemeanors that were not punishable with death; 6 Del. Laws, 740. Eeference should also be made to 7 Del. Laws, Ch. 190; and also to 7 Del. Laws, 410.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-7\">The jurisdiction of this Court continued the same, and existed with these identical powers at the time of the convention of 1832. 7 and 8 Del. Laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-8\">At the time of the adoption of our present constitution, therefore, the jurisdiction and powers of these three Courts were divided, separate and distinct, and were vested in said courts as follows, viz:</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-9\">1. The Court of Common Pleas was vested with original jurisdiction over all manner of \u201caction, suits and causes, civil, real personal and mixed.\u201d Hall\u2019s Dig. 102.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-10\">2. The Court of the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and Goal Delivery, was vested with original and final jurisdiction over \u201c all crimes and offences not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Goal Delivery.\u201d The offences cognizable in the latter Court were \u201c every crime punishable with death, and of the crime of manslaughter and of the offences of being an accomplice, or accessory to any such crime.\u201d 6 Del. Laws, 740; 7 Del. Laws, 410.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-11\">3. The Supreme Court was vested with the following jurisdiction :</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-12\">\u201c The Supreme Court of this government shall be held and kept twice in every year in each county of this government, which said Court shall be called and styled, the Supreme Court of the government of the counties of Hew Castle, Kent and Sussex, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Delaware. (And there shall be four persons of known integrity and ability commissioned by the Governor for the time being, by several distinct patents or commissions, under the Great Seal of this Government, to be Judges of the said Court; one of whom shall be distinguished in his commission by the name of Chief Justice). And each of the said Judges shall have full power and authority, when, and as often as there shall be occasion, to issue forth writs of <em>habeas corpus, certiorari, </em>and all remedial writs, or other process necessary for bringing the causes in the said Court to trial, and for carrying the judgments or decrees of said Court into execution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">\u201c Sec. 3. The said Judges, or any two of them shall have full power and authority to hold the said Court, and to examine, correct and punish the contempts, omissions, neglects, favors, corruptions and defaults, of all or any of the Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Coroners, Clerks and other officers within this government ; and also shall award process for levying all such fines, forfeitures and amerciaments, as shall be taxed, imposed or set, in the said Supreme Court, or estreated there, and generally shall minister justice to all persons, and exercise the jurisdictions and powers hereby granted them concerning all and singular the premises, according to law and equity as fully and amply to all intents and purposes whatsoever, as the Justices of the King\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas, at Westminster, or the Chancellor of England may or can do.\u201d Hall\u2019s Digest 104; Barker\u2019s Debates, Convention, 1832, 167, 176. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">The Constitution of 1832 respecting the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, created by it, declares, \u201c this Court shall have jurisdiction of all causes of a civil nature, real, personal and mixed, at common law, and all other the jurisdiction and powers vested by the laws of this State in the Supreme Court or Court of Common Pleas,\u201d Art. 6, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">Respecting the jurisdiction of the Court created by it and called \u201c the Court of General Sessions of the Peace and Jail De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>livery,\u201d it declares, \u201cthis Court shall have all the jurisdiction and powers vested by the laws of this State in the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-6\">And respecting the jurisdiction of the \u25a0 Court of Oyer and Terminer, it declares, \u201cthis Court shall have the jurisdiction now vested by the laws of this State in the Court of Oyer and Terminer.\u201d Art. 6, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\">These provisions of our organic-law undoubtedly speak with reference to the law as it stood and existed at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and if there were no other provisions therein, there could be neither room for doubt as to how the legal, as contradistinguished from the equitable power of this State was divided; nor what Courts were provided for to exercise jurisdiction over the separate and distinct kinds or classes of cases. The entire jurisdiction of both the Common Pleas and the Supreme Court, would by said constitution, be vested in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-8\">Exclusive jurisdiction of felonies punished with death, manslaughter, and the crimes of being an accomplice or accessory thereto, would be vested in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, and the jurisdiction over all other crimes would be vested in the Court of General Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-9\">The constitution of 1832 provides for the establishment of other courts. Art. 6, \u00a7 1. And in addition to this provides:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-10\">\u201c The General Assembly may by law give to any inferior Courts by them to be established, or to one or more Justices of the Peace, jurisdiction of the criminal matters following; that is to say, assaults and batteries, keeping without license a public house of entertainment, tavern, inn, ale house, ordinary or victualing house, retailing or selling without license, wine, rum, brandy, gin, or whiskey or spirituous or mixed liquors, contrary to law, disturbing camp meetings \"held for the purpose of religious worship, disturbing other meetings for the purpose of religious worship, nuisances, horse racing, cock fighting and shooting matches, larcenies committed by negroes or mulattoes, and the \"offence of knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>buying, receiving or concealing by negroes or mulattoes, of stolen goods and things the subject of larceny, and of any negro or mulatto being accessory to any larceny.

There is no conflict in its provisions as to our several Courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-8\">It will be contended that Section 12 of Article 6 of the Constitution is in conflict with the idea of separate Courts, each with its own peculiar kind of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-9\">That section reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-10\"><em>\u201c </em>Sec. 12. The General Assembly, notwithstanding anything contained in this article, shall have power to repeal or alter any act of the General Assembly, giving jurisdiction to the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery, or to the Supreme Court, or the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery, or the Court of Common Pleas, or the Orphan\u2019s Court, or to the Court of Chancery, in any matter or giving any power to either of said Courts. Until the General Assembly shall otherwise direct, there shall be an appeal to the Court of Errors and Appeals in all cases in which there is an appeal, according to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>act of the General Assembly, to the High Court of Errors and Appeals.\u201d Constitution, Art. 6, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">The above section of the Constitution by express terms only grants to the General Assembly \u201c power to repeal or alter any act of the General Assembly giving jurisdiction to the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery, or to the Supreme Court, or the Court of Common Pleas, or the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery, or the Orphans\u2019 Court, or the Court of Chancery in any matter, or giving any power to either of said Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">It does not mention either the Superior Court, the Court of Oyer and Terminer, or the Court of General Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery, the three new Courts created by the Constitution of 1832.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-9\">This section has been construed and passed upon in our State; the Court said \u201c that the Legislature may <em>establish </em>other Courts, and give them criminal jurisdiction, either concurrent with our present criminal Courts, or in exclusion of their jurisdiction.\u201d \u201c That though the Legislature may repeal any law giving criminal jurisdiction to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, and thus in effect abolish the cognizance of the offences comprised in such law, they cannot transfer the jurisdiction of such offences to any inferior Courts to be established by them, except the offences enumerated in the 15th section of Article 6; <em>Gray vs. State, </em>2 Harring. 72.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-10\">The Court inclined to the opinion in that case, \u201c that in the creation of other Courts, such as are contemplated by the first section of the sixth Article, the Legislature has the power to transfer the criminal jurisdiction, of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, to such Courts; <em>Gray vs. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-11\">Ho argument can be drawn from this decision in favor of the power of the General Assembly to vest in the Superior Court criminal jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals in this State declared that \u201cthe Superior Court exercises jurisdiction in respect to all matters purely legal, whether of common or statute law, the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of which is not vested in other tribunals.\u201d <em>Knight vs. Ferris, </em>6 Houst. 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">I most respectfully submit that Section 12, of Article 6, does nothing more than grant power to the General Assembly to confer jurisdiction on other courts, to be thereafter created by the Legislature, in pursuance of the power granted in the last two clauses of Article 6, Section 1, of the Constitution. John M. Clayton in Convention 1832; Barker\u2019s Debates 158-200; <em>Gray vs. </em>State, 2 Barring. 88.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\">The Superior Court, the Court of Oyer and Terminer and the Court of General Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery are all Constitutional Courts, the essential qualities of which are indestructible and unalterable by the Legislature.

Morrow from the judgment of the Justice of the Peace against him, upon, his conviction for a violation of the provisions of Chapter 507, Volume 17, Laws of Delaware. Section 1, together with Section 11 of said Chapter 507, creates an offence of a criminal nature, specifies the penalty for its commission and prescribes the mode of trial by a Justice of the Peace, without either indictment or jury trial, in accordance with the provisions of Section 15, of Article 6 of the Constitution of this State, authorizing the Legislature to give to one or more Justices of the Peace such summary jurisdiction of nuisances and the other minor criminal matters therein enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Pursuant to the provisions \u00f3f said Chapter 507, the said William L. Morrow was tried and adjudged guilty of selling two rabbits and one dozen partridges in violation thereof, and sentenced by the Justice of the Peace to pay a fine of five dollars for each of said rabbits and partridges, besides the costs of his prosecution. Thereupon the said defendant, upon giving the required security, took an appeal to the said Superior Court, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of Chapter 655, Volume 19, Laws of Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Afterwards the counsel for the State, at the hearing in said Superior Court, of a rule to show cause why said appeal should not be stricken, from the record and the cause remanded to the Justice, etc., contended that the said Court had not jurisdiction to hear and determine said appeal, as it was a criminal action, and that therefore said rule should be made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Whereupon the Superior Court directed that the question whether or not said Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine .said appeal, be reserved and heard here in the Court of Errors and Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Our determination of this question of law will be confined to the requirements of the case presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Said Chapter 507, Volume 17, has prescribed and authorized what is virtually a summary proceeding before a Justice of the Peace for the enforcement of a forfeiture for the violation of the provisions of a statute for the protection of game in this State, and which unlawful act the General Assembly has therein declared to be a common nuisance, with the view of bringing it within the class of minor criminal matters which are enumerated in said Section 15, Article 6 of the Constitution, and excepted and excluded from the constitutional requirement of procedure by indictment and trial by jury. Chapter 655, Volume 19, has given to the party charged with such violation of the game law, a right of appeal to the Superior Court from the judgment rendered by the Justice for the recovery of the prescribed forfeiture, and the Superior Court is authorized by said chapter to render upon such appeal a judgment for the recovery of said forfeiture, against the said party or his executors or administrators. As the act has not provided to the contrary, the proceeding in the Superior Court, upon the appeal, may be of a summary nature and according to such regulations as may be appropriate and necessary to the execution of the appellate power conferred upon said Court by the General Assembly. .</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">It has not been contended by counsel on either side, that the summary jurisdiction provided by Chapter 507, Volume 17, has not been constitutionally conferred by the General Assembly and lawfully exercised by the Justice who rendered the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The sole objection, or contention, is that the General Assembly had not constitutional power to confer, nor the Superior Court to exercise, the appellate jurisdiction given by Chapter 655, Volume 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The present is not a case of an appeal from the Court of Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>eral Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery, and therefore within .the inhibition of Section 10 of the Schedule of the Constitution. This is simply an appeal from the judgment of a Justice of the Peace rendered in a summary proceeding for the recovery of a forfeiture for the violation of a game law enacted by the Legislature of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">There is no constitutional provision expressly prohibiting such an appeal; nor, indeed, expressly prohibiting an appeal from Justices of the Peace in any case\u2014civil or criminal\u2014lawfully within their jurisdiction, Mor do we find that there is any constitutional provision which by necessary implication inhibits or precludes the General Assembly from conferring, or the Superior Court from exercising the jurisdiction by appeal authorized and prescribed by said \u25a0Chapter 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">It is true that Section 15, Article 6 of the Constitution, which provides that the General Assembly may by law give to any inferior Courts by them to be established, or to one or more Justices of the Peace, jurisdiction of nuisances and the other criminal matters therein enumerated, also further declares thatthe General Assembly may by law regulate this jurisdiction, and provide that the proceedings shall be with or without indictment by grand jury, or trial by petit jury, and may grant or deny the privilege of appeal .to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace. But we do not consider that this provision, viewed in connection with other provisions of the Constitution, and with reference to the origin and gradual development of the judicial system of this State, absolutely and exclusively restricts and confines to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over the summary jurisdiction and procedure under said Section 15 of Article 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">It must be observed that all the authority vested in the Legislature under Section 15 of Article 6, is entirely discretionary and nowhere mandatory. Therefore the denying or granting of jurisdiction over the criminal matters therein enumerated, the regulation of such jurisdiction and whether or not the proceedings shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>be with or without indictment by grand jury, or trial by petit jury, and the granting or denying of the privilege of appeal to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, are all absolutely subject to the judgment and pleasure of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Because said Constitutional provision, in express language, gives the Legislature the discretionary power to confer original jurisdiction of the criminal matters therein enumerated upon a Justice of the Peace, or upon any inferior Court by them established for such purpose, it does not thereby preclude or prohibit the granting by the General Assembly of such original jurisdiction to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace. Hor does said provision, by its express grant of merely discretionary power to authorize an appeal from such original jurisdiction to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, thereby exclude or inhibit the granting by the Legislature of such an appeal to the Superior Court as it has given in the present instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The provisions of said Section 15, Article 6, of themselves, unaided by other constitutional language or implication of clearer and stronger negative import, are not sufficient to exclude and prohibit the legislative power from conferring summary jurisdiction, either original or appellate\u2014and whether concurrent or exclusive\u2014 of the criminal matters therein enumerated, upon either the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, or the Superior Court in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">From the earliest period of our colonial history to the present, both the granting and the regulation of criminal jurisdiction have been entrusted exclusively to the legislative judgment and action.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Indeed, under our Colonial charters and until the adoption of our first State Constitution of 1776, even the creation and composition of the Courts, civil and criminal, as well as the apportioning, granting and regulating of their respective jurisdictions and powers, were uniformly left entirely and exclusively to statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Whilst our present Constitution of 1831, in its sixth article, expressly creates and prescribes the composition and organization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the several Courts thereby established, yet its framers deliberately abstained from directly conferring, defining and regulating the jurisdiction and powers (save as to territorial extent) of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace and of the Justices of the Peace, as well as of the Superior Court\u2014-except as to the latter\u2019s original civil jurisdiction at common law, and its appellate jurisdiction over the Orphans\u2019 Court and Register\u2019s Court\u2014and designedly entrusted this authority and duty to the legislative power where it had always theretofore been left under all of our previous State Constitutions and colonial charters.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Section 4 of Article 6, of the said Constitution of 1831, at the time of its adoption, expressly conferred upon the present Court of General Sessions of the Peace all the jurisdiction and powers then vested by the laws of this State in the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace theretofore established by the prior Constitution of 1792. And Section 3 of said Article 6, also expressly conferred on the present Superior Court \u201cjurisdiction of all causes of a civil nature, real, personal and mixed, at common law, and all other the jurisdiction and powers vested by the laws of this State in the Supreme Court or Court of Common Pleas,\u201d which were also established under said preceding Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">That the jurisdiction and powers vested in said pre-existing Courts by the statutes subsisting at the adoption of the present Constitution of 1831, and thus transferred to the said present Courts, were not to remain unchanged and unchangeable, but might be modified, divested, supplanted or transferred from time to time, as the General Assembly might thereafter deem conducive to the general welfare, is manifest by examination of Section 12 of said Article 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">It provides that \u201c the General Assembly, notwithstanding anything contained in this article, shall have power to repeal or alter any act of the General Assembly giving jurisdiction to the * * Supreme Court, or the Court of Common Pleas, or the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery * * * in any matter, or giving any power to either of said Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Careful consideration of this Section, and of Sections 3 and 4 of said article, in connection with the fact that the framers of the present Constitution abstained from conferring and defining by specific constitutional provisions the jurisdiction and powers of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace and of the Superior Court, other than the latter Court\u2019s aforesaid excepted civil jurisdiction, clearly discloses that the Constitution has confided to the Legislature the power and duty of conferring by statute the jurisdiction of each of said Courts, other than the Superior Court\u2019s original civil jurisdiction at copimon law, and its appellate jurisdiction over the Orphans\u2019 Court and the Register\u2019s Court\u2014as heretofore observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">If this view be correct, then it follows that the General Assembly may, by legislative enactment from to time, confer upon the Superior Court such new and additional jurisdiction and powers as have been granted in the present instance, and regulate the exercise thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">As already stated, the Constitution nowhere specifically defines the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace. It therefore leaves the granting and regulating of both their criminal and civil jurisdiction to the legislative discretion, subject of course to such limitations as may be found in that instrument. In the case before us, .the General Assembly has deemed it proper to confer upon Justices of the Peace summary jurisdiction of a criminal nature in the matter of a violation of the statutory provisions for the protection of game in this State, under Section 15 of Article 6 of the Constitution, and to give like jurisdiction thereof by appeal, to the Superior Court. In giving this appellate, jurisdiction of such a criminal matter, the Legislature has not divested any Court of this State of any jurisdiction hitherto exclusively vested therein by the Constitution, or actually conferred thereon by statute. It has merely conferred a new and additional jurisdiction upon the Superior Court by giving it appellate powers over a summary proceeding of a criminal nature before an inferior tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The Superior Court is now, by Statute, as was, from a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>early period, the pre-existing Supreme Court which it superseded, the tribunal especially charged with supervisory jurisdiction and authority over inferior tribunals and officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The old Supreme Court formerly had jurisdiction of criminal offences, by removal thereto from the Court of General Quarter Sessions, etc., until this power was abrogated, as to indictments therein for other than capital offences, by the act of June 14,1793, Volume 2, Delaware Laws, 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In 1829 another statute was enacted, and which is still subsisting and incorporated in Chapter 94, Amended Code, page 702, vesting jurisdiction of all criminal offences not cognizable by the Court of Oyer and Terminer, in the Court of General Quarter Sessions (now General Sessions) of the Peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">But there does not appear to be any valid Constitutional reason why a criminal jurisdiction, whether appellate or original, which has heretofore been divested by statute, may not now be restored by statute under the power vested by the Constitution in the Legislature to confer upon the Superior Court as explained, either new or renewed jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In the present instance, the General Assembly has exercised this Constitutional power and discretion by conferring upon the Superior Court the appellate jurisdiction in question. Having done so, it is considered and adjudged by this Court that the Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine said appeal, and that this opinion be so certified to that Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
