In a suit to recover back the amount of taxes paid without protest on an illegal assessment, the plaintiff is entitled to interest from the time of demanding repayment, or from the date of the writ, when no previous demand has been made, but vrhen such taxes are paid under protest, the plaintiff is entitled to interest from the date of payment; <em>Boston &amp; C.
