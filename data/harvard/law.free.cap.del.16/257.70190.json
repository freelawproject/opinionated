It is therefore much larger than is sufficient to pay the cost of merely issuing a license.

If an ordinance be susceptible of two constructions, that one must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>prevail which will preserve its validity in preference to a construction that will render it invalid, and this must be done although the construction adopted may not be the most obvious or natural or literal one; <em>Johnson vs. Philadelphia, </em>60 Pa. 445; <em>Rosevelt vs. Godard, </em>52 Barb. 533; <em>Coldwell vs. Landing Co., </em>19 N.

The power of a Court to declare an ordinance unreasonable and therefore void, is practically restricted to cases in which- the Legislature has enacted nothing on the subject-matter of the ordinance, and consequently to cases in \u2022which the ordinance was passed under the supposed incidental power of the corporation merely ; <em>Coalfloat vs. Jeffersonville, </em>112 Ind. 19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">The presumption is always in favor of reasonableness of the ordinance; 2 Am. &amp; Eng.

Under this principle it can be fairly implied from express provisions of the charter that it was intended that the Council might impose a sufficient fee in connection with the inspection of milk and cream to pay the costs of regulation and inspection. It is an occupation which requires police regulation, because of its peculiar character, in order that harm might not come to the public. The Legislature and the City Council recognize it as such. It is an occupation which is regulated by health or police laws, or ordinances in most of the States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-8\">An occupation may be licensed and regulated if harmful, or if it threatens to become harmful; Tiedman, Pol.

Y. 65; <em>People vs. Mulholland, </em>82 N. Y. 326; and in <em>Ash vs. People, </em>11 Mich. 347, it was held that the health of the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>demanded that the power to license and regulate the vending of meats and vegetables should exist, the license was for protection and regulation, and that the exaction of five dollars was not a tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">If a municipal regulation be lawful when intended for one purpose, and unlawful if for another, the presumption is, that the purpose was lawful unless it clearly appear otherwise; <em>Johnson et al. vs. Phila. et al., </em>60 Pa. 445; <em>Commonwealth vs. Plaisted, </em>148 Mass. 375; <em>Welch vs. Hotchkiss, </em>39 Conn. 140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-7\">The power of a municipality to charge license fees to railways, telegraph companies, and telephone companies, cannot be questioned so long as such license is a police regulation and tends to accomplish the purpose sought; <em>W. U. Tel. Co. vs. Phila., </em>21 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Corp. Cas. 44-46, and cases cited. The fact that the license fee is payable into the treasury of the municipality does not make such a license a tax, when the fee is reasonable and tends to promote the object of the ordinance; <em>East St. Louis vs. Wehrung, </em>46 Ill. 392; <em>Johnson vs. Phila., </em>60 Pa. 445; <em>P. R. R.

The ordinance provides that a license fee of $10 shall be paid by every person engaging in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>occupation, exempting, however, all persons who sell less than twenty quarts per day if engaged in a merchandise business. It is apparent, from the provisions of the ordinance, that the license fee exacted is not a tax or means of revenue to the city. It cannot be claimed that it is in any sense prohibitory of the business of selling milk and cream. It is clearly an inspection fee in the nature of a license, intended to cover as near as possible the cost of the inspection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">Property in an article is the right to have and use it subject to law. The right of sale is not an essential ingredient that may not be separated from the ownership; and a law regulating or prohibiting the sale does not take away any vested right of property; <em>State vs: Allmond, </em>2 Houst. 612.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">License laws are of two kinds: thdse which require the payment of a license fee by way of raising a revenue, and are therefore the exercise of the power of taxation; and those which are mere police regulations, and require the payment only of such license fee as will cover the expense of the license and of enforcing the regulation; Cooley, Const. Lim. 723; <em>Ash vs. People, </em>11 Mich. 347.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-8\">The Courts have sustained, as being constitutional, acts providing for the marking of oleomargarine packages with plain \u00a1Roman letters; <em>Price vs. State, </em>63 Md. 592; <em>Commonwealth vs. Tobias, </em>141 Mass. 129; for the marking of substitutes for lard ; <em>State vs. Aslesen, </em>50 Minn. 5; <em>Palmer vs. State, </em>39 O.

Hack drivers in a city may be required, for the better protection of the public, to take out licenses and wear a number or badge for identification, and all this under the exercise of police or regulation powers; 2 Beach, Mun. Corp. 1259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\">The fact that the second section of the ordinance exempts persons selling less than twenty quarts of milk per day from the payment of the license fee, does not render it unfair, or partial, for the exemption only applies to those persons who are at the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>time engaged in a merchandise business, who under existing laws are already required to take out a State license, and it is only the class of persons who are engaged in business who are exempt from the payment of the fee. In all other respects every one engaged in the sale of milk must conform to the law. The object of the-exemption is plainly for the purpose of avoiding the imposition of double fees on those selling less than twenty quarts of milk or cream per day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVB\">The laws of our State furnish many illustrations of exemptions, which might seem to be <em>imequal </em>and <em>partial </em>legislation such as exemption from license to retailers of goods and peddlers of\" <em>feme sole </em>and <em>feme eovert </em>traders, trading in their own name, whose-purchases are under one thousand dollars per annum; Rev. Code 548; the exemptions in favor of widows; laws for the benefit of\" mechanics and other labors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">The construction of the provisions of the Constitutions of the several States requiring \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cuniformity\u201d of taxation,. are generally held not to apply to license taxes or taxation on privileges and occupations; Desty, Taxation \u00a7\u00a7 35, 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\">If the law be otherwise unobjectionable, all that can be required in these cases is, that they be general in their application to the \u25a0 class, or locality to which they apply; Cooley, Const. Lim. 480,. 483.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\">A statute regulating the charges of grain elevators, and providing such regulations shall not apply to cities having a population of less than 130,000 does not deprive persons owning elevators \u2022 in cities of 130,000 population, or more, of the equal protection-of the laws; <em>Budd vs. People, </em>143 U. S. 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-9\">It is well settled that invalid provisions in an ordinance do not necessarily render the ordinance totally void. The rule to be-applied is that if a part of a law be void, other essential and connected parts are also void, but where that part which is void is independent and not essentially connected with the remainder, the law-will stand; Dillon, Mun. Corp. \u00a7 421, n; Beach, Mun. Corp. \u00a7 518; <em>State vs. Ernhard, </em>32 Am. &amp; Eng. Corp. Cas. 378 , Wilcock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Mun.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6e\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The exception relied upon is that there was no authority vested by the charter of Wilmington, in the City Council to impose or require a license from persons engaged in the sale of milk. The authority vested in the City Council by the City Charter is a provision which forms a distinct and independent sentence, authorizing the city to provide against the adulteration of milk or cream sold, or bought to be sold, in the said city and provides for the proper inspection of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">That is all that we find, or that has been shown, in the charter relating to the subject, and it confines the right of the City Council to provide against adulteration and for proper inspection. We do not see, and certainly it has not been shown, that the right to demand a license is in any way a necessary part of that power. It certainly is not expressly granted, nor can we see how, by any necessary implication, that power could be implied. In fact, we think that on the face of the ordinance, it appears that it is not necessary, and unless expressed, we must hold that the power does not exist; under the act the entire machinery for the inspection of the milk and for preventing its adulteration is restricted in its operation so as to except all persons selling less than twenty quarts. Therefore on the face of the ordinance it is shown that the power is not necessary. In order for us to say it is necessary it ought to be either express or by necessary implication; we think it is not either. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Then, there is this further objection. Here is a general ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>nance for an entire class of people, which licenses those of them who sell more than twenty quarts and exempts them who sell less than twenty quarts. Section 31 of the municipal charter says, \u201c The Council shall not have power to pass any ordinance exempting any person from the operation of any ordinance or municipal regulation.\u201d They cannot discriminate. We think both judgments ought be reversed, and so order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
