Samuel B. Bendler who was about to engage in employment under David Garrick &lt;fe Company took a blank agreement or contract for said employment on a Sunday to Alvan R. Morrison, at his residence in the city of Wilmington, at the foot of which was a guarantee in the following language: \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u25a0do hereby become responsible to for the faithful performance of the covenants or agreements in the above contract, \u25a0covenanted to be done and performed by the said Samuel B.

Some time in the week following the agreement was filled out and signed in Philadelphia by David Carrick Company and Samuel B. Bendler. Morrison had no notice that the blank contract had been filled up and executed until after Bendler had failed to. account.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-8\"><em>P. L. Cooper, Jr., </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXo\">contended that the guarantee was executed on a Sunday and was therefore void, and asked the Court to instruct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-9\"><em>Ward, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqS\">contended that although the contract of guarantee was made on a Sunday, if not delivered until a week day it was good and binding in law; Baylies, Sureties and Guarantors 97; Brandt, Suretyship 25; <em>Commonwealth vs. Kindig, </em>2 Pa. 448; 24 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. Law 738; <em>Hall vs. Parker, </em>37 Mich. 593; <em>Plate vs. Young, </em>23 Minn. 561; <em>Lovejoy vs. Whipple, </em>18 Vt. 148; <em>Hilton vs. Houghton, </em>35 Me. 143.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-10\">Again, if signed in blank, it was simply an offer, which took1 effect when it was received by David Carrick <em>&amp; </em>Company; 24 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Encyc. Law 566; <em>Quirk vs. Thomas, </em>6 Mich. 109.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-11\"><em>Cooper, </em>for the defendant, replied.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzZI\">If it is to be considered as an offer, there is no evidence that Alvan R. Morrison was ever notified of the acceptance. He signed in blank on Sunday and heard nothing more of the agreement or the guarantee until called upon to make good the losses caused by Samuel B. Bendler\u2019s failure to account. No liability could therefore attach.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Lore, C.
