Security for Costs.\u2014The statute providing for security for costs by a non-resident contemplates residence with reference to service of legal process, and is practically independent of the intention with which he takes his abode.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-9\">Same.\u2014A party who has not \u201c a usual place of abode in this State \u2019 \u2019 at which the copy of process may be left, is a non-resident.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-10\">Same.\u2014The time of the application for security for costs, and not the date of bringing suit is the time to which non-residence is to be tested.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-11\">This was an application for a rule upon a non-resident plaintiff to enter security for costs or suffer non-suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-12\">The facts which were found by the Court, as established by the proof, were substantially as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-13\">On December 3d, 1895, the defendant filed an affidavit avering that the plaintiff was a non-resident, that the defendant has a legal and just defence to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, the nature and character of which is, that the injuries complained of were caused by the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHp\">On this affidavit a rule for security for costs by Monday, December 9th, 1895, was granted or that non-snit be entered, the Court considering that the averments of the affidavit, were <em>prima facie </em>sufficient to authorize the granting of the rule; subject to the right of the plaintiff, to ask for the discharge of the rule, on proof that any of the material allegations of the affidavit were not true, but the Court would not interrupt a jury trial, then on, to hear proof at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-15\">On the 4th day of December, 1895, the plaintiff was sworn and testified substantially as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-16\">That being unable to procure work in Wilmington, work there being slack, in June, 1895, he went to Philadelphia and secured a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>job of work there. His wife also was employed there, and they together boarded in Philadelphia. Before going to Philadelphia he had stored his goods in a building in the City of Wilmington, where they are still stored. He intended to return to Wilmington as soon as he could get work there., That he considered Wilmington his place of residence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">On this proof, <em>G. L. Ward, </em>for the plaintiff, asked for the discharge of the rule, for the reason :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">First. That the plaintiff in fact is not a non-resident; he went away \"only to get work in Philadelphia, with the intention of returning to Wilmington as soon as he could get work here. He had his goods stored here and had not voted any where in ten years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">Second. That he was not such at the time the suit was brought, even if he is now.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-9\"><em>L. C. Vandegrift, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_W\">contended \"that residence means an abode; <em>In re Thompson, </em>11 Wend. 44; <em>Hanson vs. Graham, </em>82 Cal. 631; <em>Burcalow vs. Trump, </em>1 Houst. 363; <em>Buckmaster vs. Buckmaster et ux., </em>2 Harring. 158; <em>Quinby vs. Duncan, </em>4 Harring. 383.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-10\"><em>E.

Here the plaintifl was a resident of Philadelphia, not of Wilmington; <em>State vs. Frist, </em>4 Harring. 559.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b167-12\">Lore, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACP\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The language of the statute is, \u201cIn all actions at law wherein the plaintiff is a non-resident, in <em>qui tarn </em>actions, in actions upon administration or official bonds, and also in all actions where the plaintiff after suit brought has been discharged under any bankrupt or insolvent law, the defendant, upon motion and affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>davit filed, that he has a legal and just defence to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s demand therein, and stating the nature and character of such defence, the sufficiency whereof shall be determined by the Court, may have a rule for security for costs by a certain day, or that non-suit be entered.\u201d (Rev. Code 791.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The purpose of the statute is to secure costs, and seems to contemplate the time for the application for such security, and not the time of the commencement of the suit. For it expressly provides for such security \u201cin actions where the plaintiff after suit brought has been discharged under any bankrupt or insolvent law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">To hold that the date of the commencement of the action, is the time as to which non-residence is to be tested would be to limit and narrow the general language of the statute, which reads, \u201c In in all actions at law wherein the plaintiff is a non-resident,\u201d etc., and to make it read, in all actions at law where the plaintiff is a non-resident, etc. <em>at the inception of the action. </em>This would practically be making law and not interpreting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">In <em>Townsend vs. Houston, </em>2 Houst. 157, an order to give security for costs was made, where the plaintiff left the State after after suit brought, under an equitable construction of rule 38, which only required the plaintiff to give security when he was a non-resident at the time his suit was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Manifestly therefore the time for the application for security is the time as to which non-residence is to be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The second question remains, as to whether or not the plaintiff is in fact a non-resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The statute evidently contemplates residence with reference to service of legal process, and to the continuance of the person of the plaintiff within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">It is not a question of domicil, or of residence with respect to the exercise of the elective franchise. There the intention of the party controls and determines whether he has lost his residence or not. On the other hand, residence with reference to service of legal process, is where he has his abode or dwelling place in fact, and is practically independent of the intention with which he took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>such abode. Our statute relating to service of process, furnishes a rule for interpretation, where it provides, that a summons may be served on the defendant, \u201c by leaving a copy at his usual place of abode, in the presence of some white adult person, six days before the return thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The rule would therefore seem to be, that when the party has not <em>\u201c </em>a usual place of abode in this State,\u201d at which the copy of process may be left, he is a non-resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Applying this rule to the case in hand, manifestly the plaintiff by his own testimony does not come within its terms. He has no dwelling place or abode in this State; but only has his goods stored here, while he lives and has hie abode in the City of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">We think the rule should not be discharged, and so order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
