It appears that -the respondent, prior to the 27th day of July, 1913, was engaged in the restaurant business at Brook-ings, and on said date sold and disposed of -his restaurant busin-es-s, under an agreement not to engage in such business in Brookings for the period of one year; that on the 6th day of September, 1913, respondent broke up housekeeping in Brookings, rented 'his residence for the period--of one year, stored his household goods in a room reserved in his residence, and removed with his family to Decorah, la., where he purchased a restaurant business and thereafter conducted such business and assumed a lease of the premises in which the same was conducted; that respondent rented a flat in the city of Decorah in which he resided with his family; that thereafter on the 23rd day of September, 1913, appellant caused a warrant of attachment to be issued and levied upon the property of respondent found within the state, upon the ground that respondent was then a nonresident of this state. Respondent moved to vacate such attachment upon the ground that he had not ceased to be a resident of this state, but was in Decorah only temporarily; that he intended to return to this state after operating said restaurant in Decorah for the period of four months; and that it never was his intention -to remove permanently from this state. We are of the opinion -that the attachment should not have been vacated, \u2014 that for the purposes of such attachment respondent was a non-resident of -this state within the meaning of the attachment laws. When construing statutes relating to attachment proceedings against non-residents, a clear distinction has been recognized between actual residence and legal residence, the latter having been generally, deemed the domicile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>and not the residence contemplated. Lawson v. Adlard, 46 Minn. 243, 48 N. W. 1019; Hanson v. Graham, 82 Cal. 631, 23 Pac. 56, 7 L. R. A. 127. It seems to be \u2018generally held that a debtor cannot preserve a residence in the state, so\u2018 as to' defeat attachment proceedings, by virtue of a general intention to return, when he in fact resides in another state. This rule does not apply as to one on a mere- transient journey for business or pleasure; but where one has a settled abode for the time being in another state for business -purposes we are of the opinion that he should be treated as a non-resident of this state, within the meaning of the attachment law.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Respondent had no dwelling place within this state, where process could be left in the presence of one or more of the members of his family, nor a place of abode in the family of another where process could be left, as provided in section no Code Civ. Pr. This seems to be a matter properly -to be taken into consideration when considering who is a non-resident within the meaning of the -attachment laws. Pech. Mfg. Co. v. Groves, 6 S. D. 504; 62 N.

We do- not decide that question as it is not one -that properly arises upon a motion to dissolve an attachment. Pech. Mfg. Co. v. Groves, 6 S. D. 504, 62 N. W. 109. We do not decide that residence under exemption proceedings is measured by the same rule as in attachment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
