Defendant now moves to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the grounds that all causes of action are not pled with the specificity required by Rule 8 and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Doc. No. 31 (\"SAC\"), \u00b6 7. The SAC states that Plaintiff was the manager of the two entities that owned those properties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the course of that litigation, Plaintiff alleges he uncovered the information underlying this action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the instant case, Plaintiff asserts thirteen claims against Defendant County of San Diego under the FCA, and requests damages and civil penalties.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , SAC. Plaintiff alleges Defendant made false statements to the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") in applying for grants for the maintenance and development of the Palomar-McClellan Airport located in Carlsbad, County of San Diego, California. SAC, \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the FAA makes funding \"available to improve American airports,\" and provides funds to recipients \"primarily to ensure the safety of airports, the surrounding areas, and the people in or around the airports.\" SAC, \u00b6 9. In order to obtain federal funds through the FAA, Plaintiff alleges applicants must \"make statements and promises, and give assurances regarding, inter alia, how the land surrounding the airport is being controlled by the applicant to protect airport operations from hazards on the ground, and conversely to protect people and property on the ground from hazards inherent to airport operations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, the SAC states that \"[u]pon approving a grant, the FAA requires the applicant to make certain statements, assurances, and promises regarding how the airport and surrounding areas will be operated, maintained, improved, or acquired\" for safety purposes. SAC, \u00b6 10. Then, Plaintiff alleges, \"a grantee is required to file applications for payment to the FAA in the form of receipts or vouchers,\" which \"impliedly or expressly recertify all the promises, assurances, and statements previously made in the grant applications and agreements.\" SAC, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In particular, Plaintiff alleges Defendant applied, was approved, and obtained funding for use in relation to the McClellan-Palomar Airport.

Plaintiff contends that, in 1995, Defendant knew that certain properties were in the Runway Protection Zone (\"RPZ\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and obtained federal funds from the FAA in order to acquire those properties. SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23. Plaintiff alleges that later in 1995, Defendant reprioritized \"its projects because it determined the cost of acquisition was more than it was willing to pay\" and \"reallocated [the] funds granted by the FAA for such acquisition to other airport improvements.\" SAC, \u00b6 22. The SAC asserts that the County knew that it was required under federal regulations to \"acquire interests in the non-airport owned RPZ property sufficient to prevent or eliminate incompatible development.\" SAC, \u00b6 23. Plaintiff alleges that, since its 1995 postponement, Defendant has not \"taken any step to acquire any interest at all in said lots, much less an interest sufficient to prevent or eliminate incompatible uses in the RPZ.\" SAC, \u00b6 24. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant \"did nothing to prevent the development of Lot 24 with an office building in 2004 ... and has done nothing since that time to eliminate this office building from the RPZ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges this safety hazard continues to the present time, despite Defendant's assertions in its grant applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiff alleges Defendant, on multiple occasions between 2005 and 2014, made misrepresentations to the FAA in applying for, entering into agreements for, or making claims for federal funds.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , SAC.
