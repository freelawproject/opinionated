(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 8.) MuckRock filed the instant lawsuit on June 10, 2014, after the CIA both missed the statutory deadline for issuing a final determination regarding certain document requests and refused to process others. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) MuckRock's ten-count amended complaint primarily claims that the CIA improperly failed to respond to various requests for records, but MuckRock also takes aim at the CIA's purported \"per se\" policy of refusing to process\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   FOIA request for email records that does not contain four specific pieces of information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 79-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The CIA has now completed the processing of all but two of MuckRock's FOIA requests, and the parties have otherwise narrowed the issues in this case such that only four of the counts in MuckRock's complaint (Counts 2, 4, 5, and 7) are presently disputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The disputes in these four counts implicate two searches, three documents, and the CIA's purported \"per se\" email policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before this Court at present are the parties' cross-motions for partial summary judgment with respect to the remaining disputes. As far as Counts 2, 4, and 5 are concerned, the CIA asserts that it has conducted adequate searches for the records MuckRock has requested, and the agency also argues that it has properly withheld certain information pursuant to FOIA Exemption 3, which permits an agency to withhold responsive records that a statute specifically exempts from disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Def.'s MSJ Mem.\"), ECF No. 14, at 12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the alleged per se email policy, the CIA asserts that MuckRock lacks standing, that the issue is not ripe, and that MuckRock is seeking relief that is not available under the FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-47.) MuckRock contests these contentions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot for Partial Summ. J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   and in Supp. of Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s xMSJ Mem.\"), ECF No. 22, at 11-14, 16-23, 27-32), and for the reasons explained below, this Court finds that both parties' cross-motions for summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court finds that, with respect to Counts 2 and 4, the CIA has established that the agency conducted adequate searches for responsive records, and with respect to Counts 4 and 5, the CIA has properly invoked FOIA Exemption 3 and the National Security Act of 1947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1) (\"National Security Act\"), to withhold, in whole or in part, the three responsive records that remain at issue. As a result, the CIA is entitled to summary judgment on Counts 2, 4, and 5. But MuckRock is entitled to summary judgment on the email-policy claims in Count 7. MuckRock has presented a ripe challenge to an alleged document-processing policy of the CIA that MuckRock has standing to pursue in order to seek a remedy that the FOIA authorizes, and because the record evidence leaves no doubt that the CIA does, in fact, employ an email-request policy that requires the agency to reject certain requests for identifiable records in a manner that contravenes the FOIA, MuckRock is entitled to declaratory relief. A separate order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. MuckRock's FOIA Requests And The CIA's Pre-Litigation Responses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   MuckRock describes itself as a representative of the news media and claims that, \"[t]hrough its imprint MuckRock News, MuckRock gathers information of potential public interest, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work free of charge to its audience[ ]\" through its website. (Compl. \u00b6 3.) MuckRock obtains some of the information that it processes through FOIA requests that it submits to various government agencies. To that end, between July of 2013, and June of 2014, MuckRock submitted a series of FOIA requests to the CIA seeking various agency records. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Four of the categories of records that MuckRock sought during this time frame are relevant here and are described below, along with the CIA's initial responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Request No. F-2014-00381\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 5, 2013, MuckRock submitted a FOIA request to the CIA asking for \"[a]ll information in [the CIA Automated Declassification Review Environment ('CADRE') ] about the 110 records responsive to [MuckRock's prior FOIA request], FOIA Request No. F-2010-00600[,]\" other than those 110 records themselves. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) CADRE is the CIA's \"repository for documents reviewed under the [agency's document] release programs\"-such as its FOIA and Privacy Act document releases-and the CADRE database also contains the administrative-processing files that are associated with such requests for documents. (Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 13 n.2.) In addition, CADRE is the computer application that the CIA's Information Management Services (\"IMS\") uses to process documents when responding to FOIA requests and conducting other information-access searches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 18, 2014, the CIA informed MuckRock that it had accepted Request No. F-2014-00381 for processing, and would waive the minimal processing fees\n   associated with this request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Martha Lutz (\"Lutz Decl.\"), ECF No. 14-1-14-4, \u00b6 22.) At the time that MuckRock filed its complaint in the instant case, the CIA had not issued its final determination regarding this FOIA request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Request No. F-2014-00753\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a letter to the CIA dated February 4, 2014, MuckRock requested \"(1) [t]he Classification Management Tools User Manual and (2) all Quick Reference Guides\" that CIA staff uses \"to do classification and declassification review.\" (Compl. \u00b6 44-45.) On February 14, 2014, the CIA informed MuckRock that its request for the Manual was duplicative of another request that MuckRock had submitted (and the CIA had denied) in 2013, and that the agency would therefore not be processing that aspect of the request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz Decl. \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding the Quick Reference Guides, the CIA informed MuckRock that it was \"processing a request for the same records from another requester ( [MuckRock's] counsel), and that once processing of that request is complete, the Agency would forward [MuckRock] any releasable records[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This processing was still ongoing when MuckRock filed the instant complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Request Nos.

After the CIA informed MuckRock that this request was too broad for the agency to process, MuckRock submitted an amended request on November 4, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 39-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CIA deemed the amended request overly broad as well, and thereafter, apparently suggested various ways in which MuckRock could narrow its request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 41-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) At the time that MuckRock initiated the instant lawsuit, the agency had not completed processing this FOIA request.

(Compl. \u00b6 73.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CIA allegedly declined to process these four requests unless and until MuckRock provided additional information regarding the emails that MuckRock was requesting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    \u00b6 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MuckRock filed the initial nine-count complaint in the instant matter on June 10, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Eight of the counts pertain to the CIA's alleged failure to either process or respond timely to MuckRock's FOIA requests, as noted above, and with respect to those counts, the complaint requests that this Court order the CIA \"to release all requested records to MuckRock[.]\" (Compl. at 20.) One count (Count 7) further alleges that the CIA employs an illegal \"per se test\" when it responds to requests for emails, as evidenced by the agency's initial response to the four FOIA requests for emails that MuckRock had submitted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    \u00b6 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 80, 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   MuckRock amended its complaint on July 8, 2014, before the CIA had filed an answer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.) The sole difference between MuckRock's initial complaint and its amended complaint is the addition of Count 10, in which MuckRock challenged the agency's failure to respond to FOIA Request No. F-2014-01732, which requested a personal electronic copy of the CIA Records Search Tool (\"CREST\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 105-12; Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 18.) CREST is a database that houses approximately 11.8 million pages of records that have been declassified under Executive Order No. 13256,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%20707\">\n    75 Fed. Reg. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 29, 2009) -a Presidential mandate that requires federal agencies to declassify automatically any historical records of value that are otherwise nonexempt and are 25 years or older. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 12.) In January of 2017, the CIA made the CREST database available to the public over the internet by posting the entire database on the agency's website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Suppl. Br., ECF No. 39, at 1.)\n   <em>\n    See also CREST: 25-Year Program Archive\n   </em>\n   , Central Intelligence Agency,\n   <em>\n    https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/crest-25-year-program-archive\n   </em>\n   , which mooted the issue for the purpose of MuckRock's amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The CIA filed an answer to MuckRock's amended complaint on August 20, 2014 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Answer to First Am. Compl., ECF No. 11), and subsequently reported that the agency was continuing to search for, and review, records with respect to two of MuckRock's FOIA requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CIA also represented that it had completed processing and producing records with respect to six of MuckRock's FOIA requests, including MuckRock's request for certain emails\n   that the agency had previously refused to process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Status Report (\"1st Status Rpt.\"), ECF No. 12, at 1-2 (stating that the CIA has completed processing and production for Counts 2, 8, and 9); Joint Status Report (\"2d Status Rpt.\"), ECF No. 13, at 1-2 (stating that the CIA has completed processing and production for Counts 4, 5, and 6).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With respect to five of the six FOIA requests that the agency categorized as completely processed, the CIA withheld information, purportedly under applicable FOIA exemptions. For example, in response to MuckRock's request for CADRE information regarding documents that the agency had previously released pursuant to a prior FOIA request, the \"CIA produced two documents with portions redacted under FOIA exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3) and/or (b)(5).\" (1st Status Rpt. at 1.) Additionally, with respect to MuckRock's request for classification-guidance records, \"[t]he CIA produced two documents in full and eight documents with portions redacted under FOIA exemption (b)(3), [and] withheld one document in full under exemption (b)(3)[.]\" (2d Status Rpt. at 1.) The agency also \"withheld one document in full pursuant to exemption (b)(3)\" in response to MuckRock's request for the objections to data gathering practices that the CIA had received from telecommunications and web service providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 16, 2015, the CIA moved for summary judgment with respect to Count 2 and Counts 4 through 10 of MuckRock's Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem.;\n   <em>\n    see also supra\n   </em>\n   n.9.) As relevant here, the CIA's motion asserts that it conducted a reasonable search for records responsive to MuckRock's requests and that it properly withheld information pursuant to applicable FOIA exemptions, and thus it is entitled to summary judgment on Counts 2, 4-6, 8, and 9. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Lutz Decl. (explaining the CIA's searches and withholdings); Ex. EE to Lutz Decl.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 40-43.) The motion further contends that any such claim is not only unripe insofar as it is not based \"on any final action taken by the CIA on a particular FOIA request\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44), but can also be remedied in the context of any future FOIA request that MuckRock submits (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47 (\"[T]here is no reason to believe that judicial review of a future FOIA request will be an inadequate remedy.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   MuckRock filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on June 12, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s xMSJ Mem.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pertinent part,\n   MuckRock's cross-motion contends that the CIA conducted inadequate searches for documents responsive to the FOIA requests at issue in Counts 2 and 5.

MuckRock's motion also argues that the CIA improperly invoked Exemption 3 to withhold information with respect to the FOIA requests at issue in Counts 4 and 5. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 16-22 (challenging the withholdings in the documents produced in response to Requests No. F-2014-00753, F-2013-02200 and F-2013-02572, as described in Parts I.A.2, I.A.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the \"per se\" email policy at issue in Count 7, MuckRock points to the CIA's response letter, and maintains that the agency is being disingenuous in arguing that no such policy exists. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 28.) MuckRock further contends that this Court can, and should, declare that the agency's email policy violates the FOIA and enjoin the CIA from enforcing that policy. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This Court held a hearing on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on February 17, 2016. After that hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing on three discrete issues (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order Requiring Suppl. Br. (\"Suppl. Br.

The agency also expressly reaffirmed its decision to redact information from Document 9-a document titled \"the CIA National Security Classification Guide\"-under the National Security Act, on the grounds that the redacted information \"identifies a different CIA component whose name and purpose have not been previously identified.\" (Def.'s Suppl. Br. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   (\"The name of this entity would reveal the methods [CIA] uses in accomplishing its mission.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).)

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After two complaints, countless pages of briefing, and two hearings before this Court, only three issues remain for this Court's consideration: (1) whether the CIA conducted adequate searches for records in response to certain MuckRock FOIA requests (Counts 2 and 5); (2) whether the CIA properly invoked FOIA Exemption 3 and the National Security Act to make withholdings with respect to three documents that are responsive to MuckRock's FOIA requests (Counts 4 and 5); and (3) whether MuckRock's claim that the CIA has a \"per se\" policy with respect to FOIA requests seeking emails must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or qualifies as the basis for an award of summary judgment to MuckRock because there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of such a policy and its unlawfulness under the FOIA (Count 7). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Status Report, ECF No. 41, at 1-2; Notice of Recent Development, ECF No. 42, at 1; Def.'s Response to Pl.'s Status Report, ECF No. 43, 1-5.) As explained fully below, this Court will grant summary judgment in the CIA's favor on the first two issues, because the agency conducted adequate searches for documents and properly withheld information that falls within the ambit of Exemption 3. As for the purported email policy, this Court rejects the CIA's contention that MuckRock's claim must be dismissed\n   on jurisdictional or form-of-remedy grounds, and will award summary judgment to MuckRock, because broad equitable relief is available under the FOIA, and because MuckRock has presented unrefuted evidence that demonstrates that the CIA employs an email policy that violates the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The CIA Conducted Adequate Searches For Documents Responsive To The FOIA Requests At Issue In Counts 2 and 5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In Counts 2 and 5, MuckRock raises distinct adequacy challenges with respect to the CIA's searches for documents responsive to MuckRock's FOIA requests. In regard to Count 2, MuckRock challenges the sufficiency of the CIA's search based on\n   <em>\n    the results\n   </em>\n   of the search. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 11-12.) MuckRock's challenge in Count 5 centers on\n   <em>\n    the search terms\n   </em>\n   that the CIA used to conduct its inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.) Neither of these challenges is successful, for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The CIA's Declarations Are Sufficient To Establish That The Agency Conducted A Reasonable Search For Records Responsive To Request F-2014-00381 (Count 2)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In the FOIA request at issue in Count 2, MuckRock seeks \"[a]ll information in CADRE about the 110 records responsive to FOIA Request No. F-2010-00600.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 23.) The CIA produced two redacted CADRE screenshots in response to this request (Response C06206271, Ex. A to Pl.'s xMSJ, ECF No. 22-1; Response C06206272, Ex. B to Pl.'s xMSJ, 22-2), and MuckRock assails the adequacy of the CIA's search because, in its view, the two CADRE screenshots are \"\n   <em>\n    completely unlike any CADRE documents previously released through FOIA\n   </em>\n   \" (Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 11 (emphasis in original)). To be specific, MuckRock asserts that the CADRE printouts that it has received in prior cases have been in \"portrait\" orientation, while those it received in response to this request are in \"landscape\" orientation. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl's Sur-Reply in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. &amp; Reply in Supp. of Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 30, at 3-5.) Based on these formatting differences, and also because the CIA allegedly failed to produce the other documents that MuckRock expected to receive in response to this request (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 11-12), MuckRock surmises that the CIA has improperly construed the FOIA request narrowly and in a manner that permitted the agency to withhold as \"non-responsive\" certain information that exists in CADRE (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). This Court finds that MuckRock's speculation falls far short of the showing required to thwart an award of summary judgment in the CIA's favor on this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The CIA has submitted a sworn affidavit from Martha M. Lutz, the Chief of the agency's Litigation Support Unit, that explains why the documents that the CIA produced were not what MuckRock expected. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Suppl. Decl. of Martha M. Lutz (\"Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl.\"), Ex. A to Reply in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. &amp; Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 24-2.) In her declaration, Lutz states that, due to advancements in technology, the agency has more recently been able to capture CADRE screen shots in landscape format-also known as \"task info\" format-while the agency had previously been limited to portrait orientation-referred to as \"hypersnap[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) Furthermore, according to Lutz, \"the use of [the task info] print function within CADRE yields\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   information than the previous standard hypersnap printout[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lutz also maintains that, \"[w]hile task info printouts are the current IMS standard printing format for release, different offices within IMS have the discretion to print CADRE tasking information in either format ... according to the CADRE user's preference.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Thus, Lutz testified that it is not surprising that MuckRock previously received-and may yet continue to receive-hypersnap printouts in response to the FOIA requests that MuckRock routinely submits to the CIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This Court must afford the agency's declaration a presumption of good faith,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   , 25 F.Supp.3d at 137 (citing\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs., Inc. v.

Cir. 1991) ), and even MuckRock admits that, \"[t]aken on its face, this explanation would appear to resolve the issue\" (Pl.'s Reply at 4). But its counsel points to a declaration that Lutz submitted in another FOIA matter ten months prior to filing this statement, and in the prior declaration, Lutz purportedly declared that it was only possible to capture CADRE information in hypersnap format. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Suppl.

K to Pl.'s Reply, ECF No. 30-1, \u00b6 6 (\"The documents provided to plaintiff here are the best available copies of these materials and reflect all of the information that can be viewed in a CADRE entry short of having actual access to the system. The screenshots are the only way to capture and generate the processing details contained within CADRE in their native format.\").) Based on this alleged inconsistency, MuckRock asserts that it would be premature to grant the agency summary judgment on the issue of whether it conducted an adequate search for records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 5-6 (\"[I]t is clear that CIA has provided mutually exclusive explanations regarding the nature of the CADRE system to two different judges within a year, and the Court should not award summary judgment to the Agency until it has provided a satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While the Court appreciates that MuckRock is \"a frequent FOIA requester\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 83), and thus has a frame of reference that can facilitate many such 'gotcha' comparisons, Lutz's prior declaration provides no basis for forestalling summary judgment, as MuckRock requests. On its face, Lutz's prior statement merely explains why the responsive records that the CIA produced in\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   matter were CADRE \"screenshots\" and were not produced in some other (non-screenshot) format that might have captured any additional stray text. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz 2014 Decl. \u00b6 6.) And, the prior declaration does not distinguish between, or even discuss, landscape-versus-portrait orientation with respect to CADRE screenshots; therefore, with respect to the question at issue here, there is no apparent inconsistency between Lutz's current representation and her prior one. MuckRock also appears to ignore Lutz's\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   statements about the form and scope of the screenshots produced in this case, and this conspicuous omission may well be because MuckRock can hardly be heard to complain that the documents that were produced in response to the instant FOIA request contain\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   information than the alternative format that MuckRock has identified. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   MuckRock's argument that the CIA did not provide other types of documents that MuckRock expected to see in response to its FOIA request fares no better. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 11-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sample Cadre Records (Notes), Ex.

As an initial\n   matter, it is clear beyond cavil that \"the adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.\"\n   <em>\n    Iturralde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n    315 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1200 ;\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in her declaration, Lutz explains that the type of documents to which MuckRock points-called Requester Reports-are not routinely created in response to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the FOIA requests that the CIA receives, and indeed, no such report was generated in response to this FOIA request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10 (explaining that Requester Reports are \"lists of previously-released documents on certain broad or frequently-requested topics ... [that] may be provided to a FOIA requester in certain cases where the requester seeks only a subset of available, previously released documents\").) MuckRock's missing-documents argument therefore amounts to nothing more than a \"purely speculative claim[ ] about the existence and discoverability of other documents,\"\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1200 -an argument that has long been deemed insufficient to support the contention that an agency's search is inadequate under the FOIA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morley v.

Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For all these reasons, this Court easily concludes that the CIA's motion for summary judgment in regard to the search that is the subject of Count 2 of MuckRock's complaint must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The CIA's Declarations Are Sufficient To Establish That The Agency Conducted A Reasonable Search For Records Responsive To Requests F-2013-02200 &amp; F-2013-02572 (Count 5)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   MuckRock's search-adequacy argument with respect to the documents at issue in Count 5 takes a different tack. In this regard, MuckRock assails the agency's purported search in response to its request for \"any objections to agency data gathering practices received by this agency from telecommunications and web service providers\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 55);\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   MuckRock argues both that \"none of the [search term] combinations [that the CIA used] are reasonably likely to yield responsive records\" (Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 12), and that the CIA relied on a pre-selected set of search terms instead of tasking a professional CIA employee with locating responsive records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   According to the Lutz declaration, to respond to this FOIA request, the CIA identified three Directorates as the divisions most likely to have responsive documents, and then tasked each with conducting both an electronic and a manual review of their files. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.) These searches revealed one responsive document, which the CIA withheld in its entirety based on Exemption 3. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Notably, in describing the full-text electronic searches that the Directorates conducted in regard to this request, Lutz identified some of the search terms that were used. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz Decl. \u00b6 47 (listing search terms such as \"objection\" and \"practice\"; \"objection\" and \"data gathering\"; \"email\" or \"telecommunication\" and \"complaint\"; \"web\" and \"provider\" and/or \"service\"; and \"web service provider\" or \"telecommunication\" and \"complaint\").) This listing is not comprehensive, however, because, according to Lutz, \"each Directorate had the latitude to search any additional terms it deemed most likely to return responsive documents[, and] the Directorates\n   [also] conducted searches by hand of hard copy files so that all potentially relevant and responsive material would be located.\" (Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 14.) The CIA further represented during this Court's hearing on the pending summary judgment motions that additional information regarding these Directorate searches could be provided, even though the agency believed its initial declaration was sufficient (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 56:24-57:12), and this Court subsequently ordered the CIA to \"supplement its submissions by providing a reasonably detailed explanation of how these additional searches were conducted\" (Suppl. Br. Order at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In response to the Court's order, the CIA followed up with the individual Directorates regarding the details of the searches, but the agency \"was unable to confirm whether the Directorates tasked with the searches had used any additional search terms.\" (Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner (\"Shiner Decl.\"), ECF No. 36-1, \u00b6 8.) The agency therefore\n   <em>\n    undertook to reprocess MuckRock's FOIA request entirely\n   </em>\n   , using the search terms it had initially employed and also vesting the subject matter experts within the relevant Directorates with \"the latitude to add additional terms they deemed most likely to return responsive documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) But \"the subject matter experts did not add any additional terms to the search, as they judged that the suggested terms were the ones most likely to return documents responsive to the request.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, as with the first search, the subject matter experts also conducted hand searches of hard copy files in the Office of the General Counsel and certain Policy Staff records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The CIA did not locate any additional records as a result of reprocessing the request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This Court has little doubt that the (multiple) searches the CIA has engaged in as a result of MuckRock's FOIA request were adequate under the FOIA. As explained above, the touchstone when evaluating the adequacy of an agency's search for records in response to a FOIA request is reasonableness, and in particular, whether the agency made \"a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   68 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Physicians for Human Rights v.

For example, in its cross-motion for\n   summary judgment, MuckRock insists that \"none of the listed combinations [of search terms] are reasonably likely to yield responsive records[.]\" (Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 12.) Apparently expecting that this Court will undertake to evaluate this contention\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , MuckRock offers nothing to support this bald contention and certainly fails to demonstrate the unreasonableness or ineffectiveness of the agency's use of search terms such as \"telecommunication,\" \"objection,\" \"practice,\" and \"complaint.\" And to the extent that MuckRock castigates the CIA for dictating any search terms\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   -calling it a \"hypersemantic search strategy\" that \"blindly rel[ied] on search terms instead of 'allowing a professional employee of the agency who was familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the records' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13)-the Court is at a loss to understand how it could possibly violate the FOIA for an agency to provide reasonable guidance to those employees who are conducting the search for records, and MuckRock seems to suggest that an agency must conduct its search in a particular manner, when all that the FOIA requires is that the contours of the search are reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberation Newspaper v.

The Lutz declaration specifically explains that IMS forwarded a copy of the FOIA request to the Directorates that were reasonably likely to possess responsive records-i.e., the professional employees who had familiarity with the records-and that IMS further instructed those Directorates to search \"their electronic and hard copy files for '\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   documents that voice objections to agency data gathering practices[.]' \" (Lutz Decl. \u00b6 46 (emphasis added).) And another agency declarant confirms that the CIA permitted subject matter experts within the Directorates to identify the search terms that\n   <em>\n    they themselves\n   </em>\n   deemed most likely to locate responsive records when the searches were re-run. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shiner Decl. \u00b6 9.)

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Lutz Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-96; Shiner Decl. \u00b6 12(b).) This Court finds that, in so doing, the agency has carried its burden of establishing that the information that has been withheld constitutes protected intelligence sources and methods. Specifically, the Court credits the agency's assertion that the name of the entity redacted from Document 9 constitutes an intelligence method, because the name would reveal the means by which the entity gathers intelligence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shiner Decl. \u00b6 12(c).) Regarding the redaction in Document 13 pertaining to \"a set of checkboxes [on one page] relating to different Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") dissemination control markings\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Status Report \u00b6 1), the Court credits the CIA's persuasive assertion that disclosure of this information would \"give foreign governments, foreign intelligence services, or other adversaries hostile to the interests of the United States insight into the Government's collection and dissemination of FISA information, almost all of which is highly classified.\" (Suppl. Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner, ECF No. 43-1, \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court also finds that the CIA properly invoked the National Security Act and Exemption 3 to withhold Document 14, which is correspondence with a web services company that the CIA's declarant avers \"discuss[es] certain covert capabilities of the CIA.\" (Shiner Decl. \u00b6 12(d);\n   <em>\n    see also Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 10.) MuckRock offers no specific response to this withholding (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 7-8), and thus has failed to rebut the presumption of good faith that attaches to the agency's declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n    314 F.Supp.2d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In short, this Court is satisfied that the CIA is entitled to withhold the material in Documents 9, 13, and 14 under FOIA Exemption 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    C. MuckRock's \"Per Se\" Email Policy Claim Is Not Subject To Dismissal On Jurisdictional Grounds Or Otherwise\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The only issues left for the Court to resolve at this time pertain to MuckRock's claim that the CIA improperly employs \"[a] per se policy of arbitrarily refusing to process any requests for electronic communications that do not include [ ] four specific pieces of information\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 82)-\" 'to' and 'from' recipients, time frame, and subject\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81). The CIA contends that the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this policy-or-practice claim under the FOIA, and that, at the very least, this claim must be dismissed for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 40, 45.) The crux of these arguments relates to the processing procedures that the agency has employed regarding the FOIA requests for emails at issue in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case, and stems from the fact that, at the time that MuckRock filed the initial complaint in this matter, the CIA had refused to process MuckRock's four requests seeking email records because the requests did not \"reasonably describe\" the records sought without these four pieces of information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 75 (quoting from the agency's denial letter, which states that the CIA \" 'require[s] requesters seeking any form of 'electronic communications' such as emails, to provide the specific 'to' and 'from' recipients, time frame and subject[, and w]e note that you have provided the senders and the time frame' \");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 40-41.) But the CIA apparently changed its mind after MuckRock commenced the instant litigation; it re-reviewed MuckRock's requests for emails and processed them, \"even though [the requests] contained only three of the four purported required elements.\" (Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Thus, the CIA now questions whether MuckRock has suffered any actual or imminent injury that can support its standing to challenge the agency's purported email policy (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n    42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and even if so, the CIA further questions whether the FOIA actually authorizes the prospective injunctive relief that MuckRock seeks here (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"MuckRock's speculation that the CIA will automatically deny [future] unspecified requests is predicated on its erroneous assumption that CIA has a per se policy, which the CIA does not have.\")). The CIA also flatly denies that any such \"per se\" email policy exists.

And the agency also maintains that, because MuckRock's policy claim is based on speculation about future agency action rather than an actual policy that the agency will necessarily apply, the claim is not ripe for review. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n    at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Furthermore, and finally, the CIA insists that this Court's hands are tied in any event, because \"if the CIA were in the future to deny a FOIA request for electronic emails on the grounds that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, MuckRock may obtain judicial review by filing a FOIA lawsuit regarding\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   specific request\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45), and thus, there is an alternative remedy for any future harm such that equitable relief is inappropriate in this case (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Most, if not all, of these various contentions are species of jurisdictional defects\n   that would require the Court to dismiss MuckRock's email-policy claim without reaching its merits. But as explained fully below, none of the CIA's contentions is availing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    A Plaintiff Can Have Standing To Challenge An Allegedly Illegal FOIA Policy Even If The Defendant Disputes Having Such A Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As framed by the CIA in its briefing, the critical question of whether MuckRock has standing to bring its email-policy claim turns on whether the CIA has conceded, at the outset, that it has any such policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ at 41-42 (arguing that MuckRock cannot establish any injury-in-fact because its \"assertion regarding the existence of the purported policy is not based on a CIA regulation or any other formal interpretation by the CIA\" and because the agency otherwise denies the policy exists).) To be specific, the agency asserts that, in the absence of \"a CIA regulation or [ ] other formal interpretation by the CIA\" (Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 41), or unless the CIA otherwise concedes that the alleged policy exists, no entity can bring a policy-or-practice claim under the FOIA, regardless of how many times the agency has acted in accordance with the alleged policy (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241287\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/1/#p8\">\n    at 42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (arguing that\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Washington v.

Furthermore, says the CIA, to the extent the agency deviates from the purported policy when responding to a particular plaintiff's FOIA request, not only does such agency action belie the contention that any such policy exists, but any claimed injury is speculative and insufficient to establish standing (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-43;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Lutz 2d Suppl.

To begin with, as far as the requirement of standing to bring a policy-or-practice claim under the FOIA is concerned, it is well established that \"[a] plaintiff is only required to put forth a plausible, more than nebulous assertion of the existence of an ongoing pattern or practice [in order] to establish standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

Plausible allegations with respect to the agency's conduct when handling FOIA requests will most certainly do, for the D.C.

MuckRock's policy-related assertions include the following specific allegations: (1) that the CIA declined to process four FOIA requests that MuckRock submitted seeking emails; (2) that the CIA justified this declination using uniform language that plainly indicated the agency's reason for not processing the requests; (3) that the agency's proffered reason specifically referenced the CIA's \"require[ment]\" that \"requesters seeking any form of 'electronic communications' such as emails, ... provide the specific 'to' and 'from' recipients, time frame and subject\"; and (4) that the agency noted that MuckRock's FOIA requests were not being processed because they did not contain all of this information. (Compl. \u00b6 75 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 30-31.) Indeed, the agency went so far as to aggregate the requests and respond to them using a single letter.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. I to Pl.'s xMSJ, ECF No. 22-9, at 3-4, 6-8.) And if that is not enough, MuckRock has also placed into the record a copy of an email template that the CIA has admittedly used when responding to some FOIA requests for email records-a template that states that the CIA \"require[s] requesters seeking any form of electronic communications such as emails, to provide the specific 'to' and 'from' recipients, time frame and subject[,]\" and that the agency declines to process the request at issue in the absence of each piece of information. (Ex. J to Pl.'s xMSJ Mem.

Cir. 2006) (\"Anyone whose [FOIA] request for specific information has been denied has standing to bring an action.\"). Here, the CIA nevertheless maintains that MuckRock has no such injury, because after initially refusing to process MuckRock's FOIA requests for emails in accordance with the agency's alleged \"per se\" policy of requiring certain information on the part of a requester, the agency in fact processed MuckRock's FOIA requests and produced the resulting records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1st Status Rpt. at 1-4; 2d Status Rpt. at 1-2.) Therefore, according to the CIA, MuckRock is presently uninjured, and any claim that MuckRock might be injured by the alleged email policy in the future is both unripe and incapable of being remedied by declaratory relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 42.) Unfortunately for the CIA, the D.C.

With respect to the latter, the Circuit held that \"even though a party may have obtained relief as to a specific request under the FOIA, this will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   moot a claim that an agency policy or practice will impair the party's lawful access to information in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citation omitted).

For example, the CIA fails to explain why the fact that the Air Force\n   <em>\n    acknowledged\n   </em>\n   the existence of the challenged policy in\n   <em>\n    Payne Enterprises\n   </em>\n   , whereas here the CIA refuses to concede that it employs such a policy (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 46), makes any difference as far as the jurisdictional questions are concerned. Regardless, so long as the plaintiff has made plausible allegations that an illegal policy exists, and that the plaintiff has not only been subjected to it at some point in the past but also likely will be subjected to it again in the future, there is a justiciable case or controversy that the plaintiff can pursue in federal court. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.1.) Nor can the CIA successfully maintain that MuckRock has failed to establish that it will suffer any future injury from application of this policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 41-42.) MuckRock's status as a serial FOIA requester that has pending FOIA requests (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. Hr'g Tr. at 22:12-16) is sufficient to establish that MuckRock \"will be subjected in the near future to the particular agency policy or practice that it challenges under FOIA[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Tipograph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265000\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/169/#p174\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   175 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

The D.C.

And it is crystal clear that an agency's practice of illegally enforcing an administrative policy at the outset, and then forcing a FOIA requester to bring individual lawsuits in the context of each FOIA request, causes \"unreasonable delay[ ] in disclosing non-exempt documents [that] violate[s] the intent and purpose of the FOIA[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Payne Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    837 F.2d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Indeed, the very injury that a FOIA policy-or-practice lawsuit seeks to remedy\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the unreasonable\n   delay that results from an agency's seriatim application of an unlawful policy or practice during the processing of FOIA requests, so the CIA's insistence here that individual lawsuits to remedy future harm are available to MuckRock as a plaintiff who is perpetually aggrieved by the alleged illegal FOIA policy makes little sense. In other words, as far as the delay injury is concerned, individual FOIA lawsuits concerning an agency's treatment of particular requests do not provide\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   remedy, let alone an\n   <em>\n    adequate\n   </em>\n   one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In sum, this Court has little doubt that the D.C.

And nothing in the CIA's summary judgment brief in this case convinces this Court that it lacks jurisdiction (on standing, mootness, or ripeness grounds, or otherwise) to review MuckRock's plausible allegations that the CIA is abusing the FOIA process by imposing an unlawful \"per se\" policy with respect to FOIA requests for emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Because There Is No Genuine Dispute That The CIA Employs An Email Policy That Violates The FOIA, MuckRock Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On Count 7, And The Court Will Order Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   MuckRock argues that this Court must enter summary judgment in its favor on Count 7 of the amended complaint, because the record \"evidences a policy or practice of delayed disclosure or some other failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Payne Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    837 F.2d at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s xMSJ Mem. at 28-29.) This Court has reviewed the record evidence, and has considered the CIA's contention that it has no such policy but considers requests for email records on a \"case-by-case\" basis (Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 30), and the Court agrees with MuckRock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   First of all, there can be no dispute that the CIA treated four of MuckRock's requests for emails in exactly the same way; the agency aggregated the requests and responded with a single letter in which it refused to process the requests because \"[w]e require requesters seeking any form of 'electronic communications' such as emails, to provide the specific 'to' and 'from' recipients, time frame and subject.\" (Ex. U to Lutz Decl., ECF No. 14-10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Lutz Decl. \u00b6 49 &amp; n.15.) MuckRock has also submitted unrefuted evidence that the CIA has a \"template\" to this effect (Ex. J to Pl.'s xMSJ Mem., ECF No. 22-10), and the CIA has apparently used similar rationale when it refused (at least initially) to process at least eight other FOIA requests that MuckRock submitted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. I to Pl.'s xMSJ Mem., ECF No. 22-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The CIA does not deny that it has, in fact, used the template that MuckRock points to as evidence of the policy, although it couches this admission with the bald assertion that the letter template itself \"has been used on a case-by-case basis[.]\" (Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 31.) The CIA further maintains that, \"over time, CIA's electronic search capabilities have improved,\" such that the agency \"is now usually able to accept and process requests that contain only the name of either the sender or the recipient\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32), but this purported advancement in the manner in which the agency approaches requests for emails says nothing about whether the agency routinely employed a policy of not processing emails for the reasons stated in the letter template previously, or whether the agency could again opt to employ such a policy to MuckRock's pending or future\n   email requests, which are the only pertinent questions at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    837 F.2d at 491-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the Air Force's \"promise to desist from following the challenged practice\" was insufficient to thwart judicial review of the practice). It is also notable that, in striking contrast to MuckRock's evidence regarding the existence of a \"per se\" email policy, the CIA has not presented\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence predating the commencement of this case that demonstrates that the agency processed a single FOIA request for email records that did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   satisfy the policy that MuckRock alleges exists. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-37 &amp; Ex. B (discussing and attaching two FOIA responses that post-date the complaint in this matter).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The CIA spends much of its energy denying the existence of any such policy, presumably because it cannot credibly dispute that such a policy violates the FOIA. By its express terms, section 552(a)(3) sets forth only one standard for the categorical rejection of a request for records based on its substance: that the documents sought are not \"reasonably described.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dale v.

It is well established that, in order to \"reasonably describe\" the records sought for the purpose of this statutory provision, a FOIA request must be such that \"a professional employee of the agency who was familiar with the subject area of the request [could] locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort.\"\n   <em>\n    Kenney v.

Sept. 21, 2017). And in the context of the instant dispute, the CIA has done nothing to demonstrate that the agency's employees need all four pieces of information-the sender, recipient, subject, and time frame-in order to locate email records in the agency's information systems; indeed, by its own admission, the CIA can often determine what email records are being sought, and can conduct a search for those records,\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   having all four of the pieces of information that the alleged policy delineates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lutz 2d Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 32 (explaining that the CIA's system \"is usually now able to accept and process requests that contain only the same of either the sender or recipient\").)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yeager v.

Cir. 1982) (holding that whether a request reasonably describes the records sought turns on \"whether the agency is able to determine precisely what records are being requested\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). This means that the FOIA does not authorize the CIA to deny a FOIA email request categorically, simply and solely because the request does not reference the sender, recipient, subject, and time frame.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 93-854, at. 10 (1974) (noting that Congress intended the \"reasonably described\" language to be interpreted liberally, and that this standard \"should not be used to obstruct public access to agency records\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   All things considered, then, this Court easily finds that there is no genuine dispute that the CIA has employed a policy of categorically refusing to process MuckRock's FOIA requests for email records that do not specify \"to\" and \"from\" recipients, time frame, and subject, and it concludes that this policy violates the FOIA. Therefore, this Court will enter summary judgment in MuckRock's favor on Count 7's policy-or-practice claim, and will declare that this per se policy violates the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Notably, insofar as MuckRock has requested\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   declaratory\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   injunctive relief on this aspect of its complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 85), this Court cannot oblige. To be sure, in addition to the aforementioned declaratory relief, MuckRock is eligible for prospective injunctive relief that bars the CIA from applying its email policy when responding to any future FOIA requests for email records that MuckRock submits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141511\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/1235/#p1242\">\n    846 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1246 ;\n   <em>\n    Payne Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n    837 F.2d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, this Court will limit its award of equitable relief to a declaration that the CIA's email policy violates the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The CIA has established that it conducted an adequate search for responsive records with respect to Counts 2 and 5, and that it properly invoked FOIA Exemption 3 and the National Security Act with respect to its withholding of the three records that remain at issue in Counts 4 and 5. Therefore, the agency is entitled to summary judgment on Counts 2, 4, and 5. Liewise, MuckRock has shown that the CIA has enforced a processing policy with respect to requests for emails that contravenes the FOIA, and thus, MuckRock is entitled to summary judgment on Count 7. Accordingly, as set forth in the accompanying Order, both parties' motions for summary judgment are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Counts 2, 4, and 5 challenge the agency's response, or lack thereof, to MuckRock's requests for the following documents: records relating to the agency's processing of a particular prior FOIA request (Count 2) (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 21-29); a copy of an agency user manual and certain reference guides (Count 4) (\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 41-53); and a copy of any objections that the CIA received from telecommunications providers regarding CIA data-gathering practices (Count 5) (\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 54-70).

With respect to Document 14 in particular, which the agency withheld in full, the Lutz declaration explains that the CIA reviewed the document line-by-line and determined that release of any nonexempt information \"would produce only incomplete, fragmented, unintelligible phrases composed of isolated, meaningless words\" or that \"no nonexempt information remains.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 105.)
