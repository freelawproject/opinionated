This matter is before the Court on the defendants' motion to dismiss. For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants the defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (\"CSI\") is a publicly traded company that primarily develops and manufactures medical devices for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease. Defendant Laurence Betterley has been CSI's Chief Financial Officer since April 2008. David L. Martin, recently deceased, was CSI's CEO and one of its directors during the relevant time period. Plaintiffs are shareholders of CSI who allege that Defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"). Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of shareholders who \"purchased or otherwise acquired\" CSI's common stock between September 12, 2011 and January 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around 88% of CSI's business comes from the sale of devices used to treat\n   peripheral arterial disease (\"PAD\"). PAD \"typically refers to the chronic obstruction of the arteries supplying the lower extremities due to plaque deposition on the walls of the arteries resulting in inadequate blood flow to the limbs.\" (Doc. Nos. 55-70 (\"Luken Decl.\") \u00b6 11, Ex. 10 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Medical devices are heavily regulated, including under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (\"AKS\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AKS is a criminal statute that prohibits, among other things, \"knowingly and willfully offer[ing] or pay[ing] any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person\" either to refer an individual to the person for medical services or to purchase any good that that will be repaid in whole or in part by a federal health care program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(B). In short, a violation of the AKS requires: (1) a remuneration to a person or entity in a position either to purchase goods subject to reimbursement by a federal health care program or to refer a patient whose care will be reimbursed by a federal health care program; and (2) that the remuneration could reasonably induce such referral or such purchase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones-McNamara v.

A violation of the AKS may also be a violation of the federal False Claims Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"FCA\") where a claim submitted to the government includes items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1320a-7b(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Qui Tam Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 15, 2013, a former district sales manager, who worked for CSI from 2012 until February 2013, filed a qui tam\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   action against CSI. (Doc. No. 48-2 (\"Qui Tam Complaint\") \u00b6 9.) The Qui Tam Complaint alleged that CSI had illegally promoted its PAD devices for off-label purposes and had given illegal kickbacks to physicians for prescribing the PAD devices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Specifically, the Qui Tam Complaint alleged that CSI gave illegal kickbacks to physicians in the form of free trips to training programs at desirable locations in exchange for the physicians buying PAD devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-52.) Additionally, CSI allegedly marketed the PAD devices as a revenue generator for physicians as compared to less expensive alternatives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) CSI also allegedly encouraged physicians to use the PAD devices when they were not medically necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) In addition, the Qui Tam Complaint alleged that CSI gave illegal kickbacks in the form of free products, such as deals where physicians would buy six devices and get one free. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) CSI also allegedly offered illegal kickbacks in the form of referrals to doctors in exchange for use of PAD devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 80-81.) Finally, the Qui\n   Tam Complaint alleged that CSI selected physicians to be paid speakers for CSI's Speaker Bureau based on which physicians used the most PAD devices and who would drive others to use PAD devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At first, the Qui Tam Complaint was filed under seal, concealing its existence from CSI. On May 9, 2014, CSI announced that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina had sent CSI notice that it was investigating the Qui Tam Complaint. On July 8, 2015, the Qui Tam Complaint was unsealed. On June 29, 2016, CSI settled the Qui Tam Complaint in exchange for $8 million and agreeing to a Corporate Integrity Agreement. CSI did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. (Doc. No. 74 (\"Robinson Decl.\") \u00b6 12, Ex. 5 (\"Settlement Agreement\") at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Class Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the aftermath of the announcement of the Qui Tam Complaint, CSI's stock price fell. Shareholders filed suit in the Central District of California and in the District of Minnesota. On March 26, 2016, this Court appointed Plaintiffs as Co-Lead Plaintiffs. (Doc. No. 25.) And on June 28, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint. (Doc. No. 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In Plaintiffs' consolidated complaint, they claimed that in early 2012, Kevin Kenny (Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing) and Jim Breidenstein (Vice President of Sales) implemented a scheme whereby CSI began violating the AKS and the FCA by: (1) providing kickbacks to physicians for using PAD devices, which took the form of either referrals, discounted products, or assistance in establishing office-based laboratories; (2) encouraging physicians to use PAD devices when they were not medically necessary; (3) hiding products so they would be reordered or channel stuffing;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) promoting the product for off-label uses. The scheme was allegedly in place from when Breidenstein joined CSI in 2012 until May 9, 2014, when CSI received notice of the Qui Tam Complaint. The consolidated complaint included statements from fourteen confidential witnesses allegedly corroborating Plaintiffs' complaint. On August 29, 2016, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the Court granted with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") (Doc. No. 86), they adopt an entirely new theory of misconduct: CSI provided marketing services for doctors in exchange for referring others who will purchase CSI devices. Plaintiffs draw their new theory from an employee whistleblower case in California (\"Babyak Action\"). In the Babyak Action, the employee was allegedly retaliated against for complaining of illegal and unsafe conduct, including illegal kickbacks for referrals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The marketing-for-referrals scheme was allegedly hatched by an Area Sales Director, Todd Goldberg, who was hired on April 30, 2014 (9 days before CSI announced the Qui Tam Complaint). Goldberg allegedly directed CSI district sales managers to offer marketing services for doctors who referred CSI devices, which he called the Triangle Offense. In discovery for the Babyak Action, different CSI employees stated that the Triangle Offense was Goldberg's idea. Plaintiffs allege that the referral scheme was slowly phased out between May 9, 2014 and August 2015. But when CSI executives learned about the Triangle Offense, they reprimanded Goldberg on April 30, 2015, for failing to obtain approval. (Doc. No. 86-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to the discovery from the Babyak Action, Plaintiffs rely on two confidential\n   witnesses. The first confidential witness was a district sales manager in Los Angeles, California, from September 2014 until August 2016 who heard Goldberg talk about the Triangle Offense. The second confidential witness was a district sales manager in Arizona (\"Arizona DSM\") from 2008 until 2013, and \"confirmed CSI's referral-marketing practices.\" (FAC \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Alleged Misstatements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that CSI made various misstatements and omissions each premised on the same factual predicate: CSI engaged in widespread illegal activity. Broadly, Plaintiffs allege six categories of misstatements:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) Statements about past sales growth that Defendants falsely attributed to legitimate practices;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) Statements about future sales growth that were falsely attributed to legitimate practices;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) Statements about CSI's revenues made while omitting the truth about the Company's illegal referral marketing scheme;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (4) Statements about CSI's legal and regulatory compliance;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (5) Falsely signed Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"SOX\") certifications guaranteeing the accuracy of the Company's financial statements; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (6) Statements and omissions about losses that CSI suffered after discontinuing its illegal referral marketing schemes, as well as costs incurred from sales-force reorganizations necessitated by ending the illegal activities. These include both affirmative falsehoods as to the causes of those losses as well as omissions as to their true causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Opp. at 13 (internal citations omitted).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court assumes all facts in the complaint to be true and construes all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the complainant.\n   <em>\n    Morton v.

Thus, Plaintiffs theory of scienter requires that the AKS violations be widespread and not isolated. Otherwise, it is much more plausible that Martin and Betterley had no idea about isolated, technical violations of the AKS, and therefore Defendants did not act with scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Axis Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8447155\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/456/576/#p585\">\n    456 F.Supp.2d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the misconduct by two brokers could not impute knowledge of the misconduct onto the company). Again, Plaintiffs rely on the Qui Tam Complaint, the DOJ settlement and corporate integrity agreement, the Babyak Action, and two confidential witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, Plaintiffs point to the Qui Tam Complaint as a basis to show a violation of the AKS. In the Qui Tam Complaint, CSI was accused of paying doctors in the form of trips and speaking fees. Plaintiffs allege that CSI began phasing out its referral scheme on May 9, 2014, after it received notice of the Qui Tam Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs point to the DOJ settlement and Corporate Integrity Agreement as evidence of widespread misconduct. Plaintiffs cite to\n   <em>\n    Minneapolis Firefighters' Relief Association v. Medtronic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a whistleblower settlement and corporate integrity agreement can be used to support inferences of scienter and misconduct even though the settlement denies wrongful conduct. Civ. No. 08-6324,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011469576\">\n    2010 WL 11469576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Minn. Feb. 3, 2010). In that case, however, Medtronic settled the whistleblower case before the class period started.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The shareholders in\n   <em>\n    Medtronic\n   </em>\n   alleged that despite a $40 million settlement, Medtronic continued to illegally promote its device for off-label use, which accounted for 85% of that device's sales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiffs make no similar allegations. Indeed, Plaintiffs contend that the wrongful conduct was phased out due to the DOJ investigation. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Medtronic\n   </em>\n   cannot be used to show that CSI was aware of or engaged in widespread misconduct based on its settlement and corporate integrity agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs point to the Triangle Offense described in the Babyak Action. But if anything, the Babyak Action confirms that the misconduct here was not widespread because the complaining employees stated the Triangle Offense was all Todd Goldberg's idea, and CSI reprimanded Goldberg for failing to vet the program through company executives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Goldberg was hired nine days before CSI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   learned of the Qui Tam Complaint and allegedly began phasing out its referral-for-marketing scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Last, Plaintiffs point to the statements from the two confidential witnesses. Unlike other factual allegations in a complaint, courts are not required to wholly accept as true statements from a confidential witness.\n   <em>\n    Minneapolis Firefighters' Relief Ass'n v. MEMC Elec. Materials, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205811\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1023/#p1028\">\n    641 F.3d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1030 (8th Cir. 2011) (citing\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham v. Baxter Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562748\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/753/#p757\">\n    495 F.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757-58 (7th Cir. 2007) ). Here, the confidential witnesses fail to demonstrate that the AKS violations were widespread. The first confidential witness was hired in September 2014, after CSI began allegedly phasing out the illegal conduct. Additionally the first confidential witness worked in Los Angeles, California-the same area as Babyak. Thus, the first confidential witness, at best, repeats the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Babyak\n   </em>\n   regarding the Triangle Offense. The Court concludes that the first confidential witness does not support the conclusion that AKS violations were widespread.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The other confidential witness, the Arizona DSM, alleges that sales representatives would cause podiatrists to refer patients to physicians who used CSI products and cut off the referrals if the physicians did not use CSI products. For example, the sales representatives would leave referral sheets with podiatrists who would then refer patients. While the second confidential witness provides details of an alleged AKS scheme, there is no basis to impute the scheme beyond his sales area. Thus, the Arizona DSM does not support the conclusion that AKS violations were widespread.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs' allegations amount to a patchwork of alleged misconduct. There is the Qui Tam Complaint that alleges trips and speaking fees for referrals; the Babyak action that alleges the Triangle Offense; and the Arizona DSM allegations of leaving referral sheets of doctors who used CSI products. The competing inferences are either that these were isolated incidents or part of more widespread misconduct. The Court concludes that the more plausible explanation is that the conduct was isolated. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to state a claim because they cannot show that Defendants knew about the AKS violations or were severely reckless in not discovering them. Thus, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' \u00a7 10(b) claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
