Also before the Court are Plaintiff Kam T. Tam's Response in Opposition to, (\"Opp'n,\" ECF No. 6), and Defendant's Reply in Support of, (\"Reply,\" ECF No. 7), Defendant's MTD. The Court vacated the hearing on the motion and took the matter under submission pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1). (ECF No. 8.) After considering the parties' arguments and the law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's MTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises from a dispute between Plaintiff Kam Tam and his employer Qualcomm. Tam worked as a patent attorney for Qualcomm starting in 2004 and was promoted to Senior Patent Counsel in 2008. (\"Compl.\" \u00b6 5, ECF No. 1-2.) As a Senior Counsel, Tam was responsible for prosecuting Qualcomm's patents at the U.S. Patent Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff states that he received positive ratings in his\n   feedback from his supervisors and his legal knowledge was well-recognized in his department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff states that licensing patents was a significant area of business for Qualcomm, constituting approximately three quarters of Qualcomm's profits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2008, Qualcomm hired a new Chief Patent Counsel, Katherine Umpleby, and as part of the department's reorganization, an attorney senior to Plaintiff, Mr. Peng Zhu, specifically requested that Plaintiff be assigned to his team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff initially resisted this request because Plaintiff believed Mr. Zhu's group \"merely crank[ed] out patents, without regard to quality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff believed that Mr. Zhu's practice was harmful to the long-term success of the company. In September 2010, Plaintiff alleges that he shared this belief with the Chief Patent Counsel and Mr. Zhu's supervisor, but they declined Plaintiff's suggestions to improve work quality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) In October 2010, Plaintiff utilized an \"Open Door Policy\" run by the Human Resources Department to report the same concerns previously expressed to the Chief Patent Counsel and Mr. Zhu's supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff then alleges that in response to his use of the Open Door Policy the Patent Department was reorganized again and Plaintiff began reporting to Mr. Larry Moskowitz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Soon after this second reorganization, conflicts arose between Plaintiff and Mr. Moskowitz leading the latter to issue Plaintiff a written \"Expectation Memo\" for \"performance improvement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) This memo included warnings to Plaintiff of further discipline and possible termination-warnings that Plaintiff had not previously received. Plaintiff asked to be reassigned to a different supervisor, which was granted, and no problems were reported concerning Plaintiff for approximately one year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) In December 2012, the Chief Patent Counsel, Ms. Umpleby, announced that she was leaving Qualcomm and reassigned Plaintiff back to Mr. Moskowitz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Plaintiff protested this arrangement and Human Resources told him that he would likely be transferred to a different supervisor once a new chief counsel was in place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime around June 2013, Plaintiff requested transfer and reiterated to the new Chief Patent Counsel, Tim Loomis, his previous reasons why he was requesting transfer, namely the perceived lack of quality in Qualcomm's patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) The new Chief Patent Counsel denied the request and Human Resources denied a similar request to transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) In October 2013, Mr. Moskowitz presented Plaintiff with a negative review and Human Resources offered Plaintiff a separation package, which Plaintiff did not accept. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In January 2014, Plaintiff was informed that he was being placed on a \"Performance Improvement Plan\" (\"PIP\") and again offered a separation package, which he did not accept. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The terms of the PIP included goals for Plaintiff including \"improve the quality of the work product\" and \"take accountability for his performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff states that the PIP did not give him any explanation on how to achieve the plan or metrics to evaluation the plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The PIP required Plaintiff to attend weekly meetings and take online training, which Plaintiff characterizes as harassing and retributive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Moskowitz blamed him for others' errors and held him to standards no one else was held to. In February 2014, Plaintiff took \"FMLA leave\" and was placed on anxiety and depression medication, which he states was a result of his work issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff returned to work in May 2014 and was told by Mr. Moskowitz that the terms of the PIP remained in\n   effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Moskowitz transferred all Plaintiff's cases to other attorneys during the FMLA leave and thus he was unable to meet the PIP requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff went to Human Resources to complain and was urged to take a severance package, which he declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Moskowitz gave Plaintiff three tasks to complete including preparing a presentation, assisting another attorney in holding a meeting, and take over filing a patent application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff alleges that he attempted to comply with the tasks, but Mr. Moskowitz was not satisfied with his performance. Specifically, Plaintiff states he had filed the patent he was assigned and had scheduled but not given his presentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The attorney with whom Plaintiff was to hold a meeting did not respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff was terminated on May 23, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff originally filed this action in San Diego Superior Court on June 13, 2016, alleging various causes of action under state and federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 28.) Defendant removed the action on April 7, 2017 to this Court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction, (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) permits a party to raise by motion the defense that the complaint \"fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\" generally referred to as a motion to dismiss. The Court evaluates whether a complaint states a cognizable legal theory and sufficient facts in light of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which requires a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Although Rule 8\"does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' ... it [does] demand more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Plaintiff simply restates the general rule for a\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -attorney attempting to recover under a wrongful termination tort. Plaintiff offers no argument to rebut\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   ' teachings or its application to his particular facts. The Court finds that Plaintiff is an in-house counsel working for a corporation, Qualcomm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 5 (\"Mr. Tam began working as a Patent Counsel in 2004.\").)

Plaintiff cites the following ethical code and statutes in support of his wrongful termination claim: California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-600, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78U-6, California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200, California Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5, and California Labor Code \u00a7 232.5. (Opp'n 2.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show he engaged in an affirmative act required by any of these ethical codes or statutes or resisted a demand by Defendant that is \"unequivocally barred\" by the professional code. (MTD 10.) The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, Rule 3-600 does not require an affirmative act; by its plain language it says \"a member\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   take such actions as appear to the member to be in the best lawful interest of the organization.\" Cal. R. Prof'l Conduct 3-600 (emphasis added). By Plaintiff's own admission, the Rule's remedial actions are permissive not mandatory. (Opp'n 2.) Rule 3-600 is not mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78U-6 do not include any mandatory ethical disclosure requirements, but rather prohibit employers from retaliating against an employee for certain disclosures. For example, \u00a7 1514A (\"Sarbanes-Oxley\") begins by stating: \"No [publicly-traded] company ... may discharge ... or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the employee.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A. Section 78U-6 (\"Dodd-Frank\") contains similar language: \"No employer may discharge\n   ... or in any other manner discriminate against, a whistleblower in the terms and conditions of employment ... because of any lawful act done by the whistleblower.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78U-6(h)(1)(A). Neither federal statute mandates an in-house counsel to disclose confidential communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Third, California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200 prohibits unfair competition, which is \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal.

There is no mandatory or permissive disclosure language in the unfair competition statutory sections. Thus, this provision does not help Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Fourth, California Labor Code section 1102.5 prohibits employer retaliation against employees who disclose \"a violation of state or federal statute or regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201102.5\">\n    Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, this provision prohibits employers from taking action against employees in certain circumstances, but does not mandate an attorney to break confidentiality. Likewise, California Labor Code section 232.5 only prohibits an employer from taking certain actions, but does not address mandatory disclosure by an employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 232.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Tellingly, Plaintiff does not maintain that any of these provisions provides a mandatory duty to disclose confidential communications. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Opp'n.) Instead, these provisions prohibit employer retaliation in various circumstances. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met the first prong of\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

First, an in-house attorney, suing under a wrongful termination claim, must show the employer's conduct is of the kind that would give rise to a retaliatory discharge action by a\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -attorney employee under\n   <em>\n    Gantt\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   , 7 Cal. 4th at 1189,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%201\">\n    32 Cal.Rptr.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20P.2d%20487\">\n    876 P.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Gantt v.

Second, an attorney-plaintiff must show that some statute or ethical rule, such as the statutory exceptions to the attorney-client privilege codified in the Evidence Code specifically permits the attorney to depart from the usual requirement of confidentiality with respect to the client-employer and engage in the \"nonfiduciary\" conduct for which he was terminated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=824%20P.2d%20680\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In order to satisfy the first element, Plaintiff cites the following statutes as the public policy bases for his wrongful termination claim: Rule 3-600, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A (Sarbanes-Oxley), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78U-6 (Dodd-Frank),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal.

The statutes would, according to Plaintiff, support his claim that Qualcomm's actions would give rise to a retaliatory discharge claim for a non-attorney employee. The Court declines to decide whether these statutes support a tort claim for wrongful termination contrary to public policy. Instead, the Court finds that Plaintiff's entire cause of action fails, as a matter of law, to meet the second element of the\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   ' standard requiring a statute or ethical rule\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   permitting departure from the usual requirement of confidentiality. Plaintiff's Complaint and Opposition briefing fails to identify any ethical rule or statute that specifically permits an in-house attorney to depart from the normal confidentiality rule. The Court first considers statutory grounds and then ethical rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether Statutory Grounds Specifically Permit Disclosure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff cites no statute that permits disclosure of confidential communications in Plaintiff's situation, as currently pled. For example, the California Evidence Code provides the applicable standards for privileged communications. A communication made in confidence during the course of an attorney-client relationship is presumed to be privileged.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20917\">\n    Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Plaintiff does not advance any argument why his facts meet an exception to the privilege.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20917\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 956 (crime-fraud exception). Therefore, the Court finds that, as pled, Plaintiff does not meet any statutory grounds that permits disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    2. Whether California Rules of Professional Conduct Specifically Permit Disclosure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The only other potential ground to disclose confidential communications is by a professional rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   , 7 Cal. 4th at 1189,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%201\">\n    32 Cal.Rptr.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20P.2d%20487\">\n    876 P.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Defendant, an attorney must resign rather than disclose privileged communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff counters that the possible remedial actions described in subparagraphs B and C are permissive, not mandatory. (Opp'n 2.) Therefore, he did not have to resign, as required by 3-600(C), and instead could disclose confidential information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206076-77\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A plain reading of Rule 3-600(B) does not support Plaintiff's position.

R. Prof'l Conduct 3-600. This is an affirmative duty to protect all confidential information. The cross-reference to Business and Professions Code section 6068, subdivision (e) further bolsters the plain reading because that section requires an attorney to \"maintain inviolate the confidence ... of his or her client.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206068\">\n    Cal.

Furthermore, the only remedy provided by Rule 3-600(C) is resignation.

Nor does Plaintiff invoke any statute or rule of professional conduct that specifically permits departing from the normal confidentiality standard. As currently pled, Plaintiff fails to meet either of\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   ' two bases for allowing a wrongful termination tort claim. However, the Court is mindful that the\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   court stated that dismissing a suit in the interest of preserving the attorney-client privilege at the motion to dismiss stage will seldom if ever be appropriate. 7 Cal. 4th at 1190,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%201\">\n    32 Cal.Rptr.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20P.2d%20487\">\n    876 P.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot assert this cause of action because of section 1102.5(g). (MTD 14.) Section 1102.5(g) provides: \"This section does not apply to rules, regulations, or policies that implement, or to actions by employers against employees who violate, the confidentiality of the lawyer-client privilege of Article 3 ... of, Chapter 4 of Division 8 of the Evidence Code.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201102.5\">\n    Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Defendant argues that all of Tam's protected disclosures involve attorney-client privilege or attorney work product. (MTD 14.) Therefore, Plaintiff's 1101.5 claim fails due to 1102.5(g). Plaintiff offers no argument rebutting section 1102.5(g). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court largely agrees with Defendant. The plain language of section 1102.5(g) exempts the whistleblower scheme in section 1102.5(b) if an employee would violate the confidentiality of the lawyer-client privilege. Thus, in order to prevail Plaintiff would need to establish an exception to the lawyer-client privilege found in Article of Chapter 4 of the Evidence Code in order to proceed with a section 1102.5 claim.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   section II.B.1 (discussing exceptions to lawyer-client privilege). The Court finds that Plaintiff has not established an exception to privilege and therefore his section 1102.5 claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   However, the Court declines to hold that all of Plaintiff's claims are per se barred by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product. The California Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   made two critical observations: first, \"the contours of the statutory attorney-client privilege should\n   continue to be strictly observed\" and second, \"trial courts can and should apply an array of ad hoc measures from their equitable arsenal designed to permit the attorney plaintiff to attempt to make the necessary proof while protect from disclosure client confidences subject to privilege.\" 7 Cal. 4th at 1190-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%201\">\n    32 Cal.Rptr.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20P.2d%20487\">\n    876 P.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This reasoning is persuasive for Plaintiff's state law claims. The Court finds there is no per se bar to maintaining the suit. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Complaint as to his fourth cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD 14.) Section 232.5(d) provides \"[t]his section is not intended to permit an employee to disclose proprietary information, trade secret information, or information that is otherwise subject to a legal privilege without the consent of his or her employer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20232.5\">\n    Cal.

Qualcomm has not agreed to disclose any communications protected by attorney-client privilege nor any other proprietary information, which Plaintiff would necessarily need to prove his claim. (MTD 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiff replies that there is no reason to think discussions of working conditions would ever implicate confidential information. (Opp'n 4.) \"A discussion of working conditions could easily involve regular lines of communications unimpeded by attorney-client privilege.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As with Plaintiff's other claims, the Court finds that Plaintiff's claim is not per se barred by attorney-client privilege or proprietary information restrictions in section 232.5(d).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   section V.A. It is possible that Plaintiff could plead facts to state a claim that does not implicate any proprietary or privileged information. This does not answer the question of whether Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to plausibly state a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiff's section 232.5 cause of action fails because Plaintiff does not allege any facts supporting the statute's requirement that an employee disclose information about the employer's working conditions. As a court in this district recently observed, the California Legislature did not define the phrase \"working conditions\" and there is a dearth of case law on the issue.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

As previously mentioned, Plaintiff makes no effort to explain which working condition was at issue or who he reported it to. For example, Plaintiff went to his supervisors and then Human Resources in September and October 2010 complaining about the quality of patents. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Plaintiff alleges no facts showing how a discussion about work quality was a condition of employment at Qualcomm. Further, Plaintiff was not fired until May 2014, which undermines any sort of causality between the alleged disclosure of a working condition and the termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark Cnty.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 15 (\"HR informed Mr. Tam that his request for reassignment to a new supervisor was formally denied.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff simply has not pleaded plausible facts to support a violation of section 232.5(c). Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Complaint as to his fifth cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Promissory Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff asserts a promissory estoppel claim against Defendant. Specifically, he argues that the Open Door Policy and the Qualcomm Way were designed to allow employees to raise concerns without fear of retaliation, Plaintiff relied on that representation, and Defendant terminated Plaintiff based on his complaints using those programs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   California follows the Restatement's definition of promissory estoppel. \"Under [the promissory estoppel] doctrine a promisor is bound when he should reasonably expect a substantial change of position, either by act or forbearance, in reliance on his promise, if injustice can be avoided only by its enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Youngman v.

The California Supreme Court has also explained that the purpose of promissory estoppel \"is to make a promise binding, under certain circumstances, without consideration in the usual sense of something bargained for and given in exchange. If the promisee's performance was requested at the time the promisor made his promise and that performance was bargained for, the doctrine is inapplicable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Raedeke v.

The fundamental issue here is not whether the statute of limitations applies, but rather whether the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies at all. The Court finds that it does not. Plaintiff describes that under the Open Door Policy \"Qualcomm promised that it would not retaliate against employees for using the policy to report work-related issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) This is a bargained-for exchange. Qualcomm promised that it would not retaliate. Plaintiff promised to report a work-related issue that he might not otherwise do.

Alternatively, if Plaintiff alleges an implied in fact contract based on the Open Door Policy then promissory estoppel is not appropriate.
