HOWELL, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Invoking both the First Amendment and common law rights of access to judicial records, Jason Leopold, an investigative journalist, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press initially petitioned the Court to unseal almost twenty years of sealed government applications, and related orders, to obtain information about, and the contents of, electronic communications in criminal investigations now closed.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pet. Unseal Records (\"Pet.\"), ECF No. 1; Appl. to Unseal and for Other Appropriate Relief (\"Intervenor's Pet.\"), ECF No. 18. These petitions commenced a constructive effort among the petitioners, U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (\"USAO\"), and Clerk of this Court to consider mechanisms for allowing greater transparency in the judicial review process for such applications and orders, while maintaining the secrecy of information implicating both legitimate individual privacy and law enforcement interests, and navigating the practical difficulties posed by evolving internal technological tools and administrative\n   practices within the USAO and the Clerk's Office for processing and docketing these records. The parties' commendable willingness to work together, in good faith, to identify areas of common ground and compromise has substantially narrowed the legal dispute and resulted in a largely collaborative rather than an acrimonious litigation. For the reasons set out below, the petitions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is not the only court with a significant volume of sealed government surveillance records on secret dockets that remain inaccessible to the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The progress of this litigation is outlined in some detail because the lessons learned and issues confronted inform the relief available, and may be instructive to other courts confronting similar issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jason Leopold, a journalist currently employed by BuzzFeed News, filed a petition in July 2013 to unseal government applications and related orders for the following types of statutorily authorized surveillance: \"pen registers, trap and trace devices [collectively \"PR/TT devices\"], tracking devices, cell site location, stored email, telephone logs, and customer account records from electronic service providers, except for those which relate to an ongoing investigation.\" Pet. at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Resp. to Pet. (\"Gov't's Resp.\") at 1, ECF No. 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These records, along with the docket numbers assigned by the Clerk's Office and docket sheets identifying all documents filed on each docket for such matters, typically remain under seal indefinitely. In view of this fact, Leopold also sought a list of all docket numbers, in closed investigations, associated with government applications and orders relating to PR/TT devices and the compelled disclosure of electronically stored communications and records, pursuant to the Stored Communications Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"SCA\"). Pet. at 4. In addition to this retrospective relief in the form of unsealing docket numbers and PR/TT and SCA materials in closed criminal investigations, Leopold requested prospective relief in the form of a presumptive 180-day expiration date for all sealing or non-disclosure orders for such materials, extendable for ongoing investigations or in exceptional circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to the petition, the USAO acknowledged, in December 2013, \"that applications and orders relating to electronic surveillance methods need not necessarily be permanently sealed.\" Gov't's Resp. at 2. Nonetheless, asserting that the requested relief was overbroad, the USAO identified several obstacles to the wholesale unsealing and disclosure that Leopold sought.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the USAO could not provide a complete list of docket numbers associated with all PR/TT and SCA applications and/or orders filed in this Court because other components of the U.S. Department\n   of Justice (\"DOJ\"), applied for and obtained such surveillance orders, without USAO involvement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, limiting the requested unsealing to \"closed\" investigations posed administrative burdens in (1) identifying the appropriate USAO personnel and law enforcement officials to verify the status of the investigation, and, (2) where an aspect of an investigation was closed, assessing whether the need for secrecy remained due to concerns over witness safety, national security, or jeopardizing ongoing investigations growing out of closed investigations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the USAO criticized the petition's suggested protocol of a presumptive 180-day expiration date for sealing and non-disclosure orders as \"arbitrary on its face,\" as that presumptive limit gave short shrift to the interests justifying the initial sealing and unduly cabined judicial discretion, in conflict with governing statutes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While taking no position on whether the First Amendment or common law established a right of access to the materials at issue, the USAO pointed out, correctly, that \"the decision whether, and if so how, to establish a protocol to identify more accurately, track, and ultimately terminate sealing orders is a matter that falls within the administrative responsibility of this Court,\" and offered, as an institutional litigant, to \"assist the Court in whatever manner the Court might deem appropriate towards the aim of formulating appropriate guidelines\" in this area.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 nn.2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nothing more transpired in this matter for over two years, until the matter was reassigned to the undersigned in March 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At subsequent status hearings, Leopold's counsel clarified that the petition sought no personally identifying information concerning investigative targets, Hr'g Tr. (\"May 2016 Tr.\") at 9:5-25, 10:1-21 (May 4, 2016), ECF No. 20; Hr'g Tr. (\"June 2016 Tr.\") at 9:14-17 (June 24, 2016), ECF No. 21, and agreed, at the Court's suggestion, to limit the scope of requested relief to only those PR/TT and SCA applications filed by the USAO, June 2016 Tr. at 12:2-5, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The USAO provided additional detail on the practical challenges presented by the petition, some of which, ironically, were exacerbated by the limitations agreed to by Leopold. In particular, determining whether the USAO or a different DOJ component had filed a PR/TT or SCA application would be challenging, as the USAO maintained no lists of docket numbers for PR/TT and SCA matters initiated by USAO prosecutors, and because the USAO's internal tracking system for criminal investigations did not correspond to the Miscellaneous (\"MC\") docket numbers assigned by the Clerk's office. June 2016 Tr. at 12:15-22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, even the\n   USAO lacked access to the sealed MC dockets and, thus, could not determine which PR/TT and SCA applications were filed by the USAO or a different DOJ component or the status, as open or closed, of the investigations in connection with which those applications were filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 12:23-25, 13:1-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While acknowledging that the petition was \"quite broad,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 5:24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Leopold's counsel explained that the relief sought would reveal changes over time in the types of surveillance requests the government made pursuant to particular statutory authorities, as well as the government's evolving legal arguments in support of particular surveillance applications, citing, as an example, the government's argument that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) allowed the government to obtain historical cell cite data.

Similarly to the USAO, Leopold expressed willingness \"to work with the Court to narrow it down to the things that we're specifically interested in.\" June 2016 Tr. at 5:24-25, 6:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court directed the parties to propose a future course and, given the breadth of relief the petitioners sought, to refine the scope of Leopold's request to \"a manageable time period where we have records that are electronic and so more easily accessible to review and to track.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    at 18:13-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the parties\n   were directed to identify any \"information the parties would need from the Court to help facilitate moving forward.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    at 18:16-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The parties requested that the Clerk's Office prepare a list of the docket numbers for PR/TT matters that the USAO initiated in 2012, and explained that the USAO would then file a motion to partially unseal the dockets for these PR/TT matters for the limited purpose of obtaining and using this list of docket numbers to match them with the relevant internal USAO criminal investigation files.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once an actual investigation was identified, the USAO would then determine which Assistant U.S. Attorney (\"AUSA\"), law enforcement agent, and law enforcement agency had been assigned to that investigation, and query whether a particular PR/TT matter concerned a pending, closed, or related pending investigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The limited scope of the petitioners' claim is significant-the petitioners seek access only to PR/TT, SCA warrant and \u00a7 2703(d) materials from closed criminal investigations, and only to those portions of such materials that do not reveal personally identifying information. As such, the USAO does not contend that disclosure would impede an ongoing criminal investigation or reveal information that would impinge on personal privacy. For the reasons that follow, the\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of a prospective common law right of access to the materials to which the petitioners seek access, in light of administrative changes recently adopted by both the USAO and the Clerk's Office. The significant burdens on the USAO and Clerk's Office that would attend recognizing a common law right of access to previously initiated PR/TT and SCA matters, however, properly are cognizable as particularized interests that weigh heavily against further retrospective relief than has already been provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

The type of information sought can be divided into three categories: (1) docket information, including the matter number and caption, the dates the application was filed and entered onto the docket, the assigned case type (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MC, CV, CR, MJ) and event type (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"Application for Pen Register\"), and the assigned Magistrate Judge,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Order and Notice to the Parties, Attach.

The retrospective relief sought, however, involves to a much greater extent than the prospective relief the imposition of substantial burdens on the USAO and the Clerk's Office in complying with any order requiring the unsealing and extraction of information from over two thousand PR/TT matters, and compilation of docket information for over two thousand 2703(d) matters. This burden, cognizable as a particularized\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factor, weighs firmly against allowing the petitioners additional retrospective access to the PR/TT and SCA materials at issue beyond the significant access already granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c.

To be sure, docket information from PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant matters perhaps are less important to judicial proceedings than are the actual materials\n   themselves.

Specifically, as to retrospective relief, the petitioners seek: (1) to supplement the docket information already provided for PR/TT matters for the nine-year period of 2008 through 2016 with similar docket information over the same period for \u00a7 2703(d) matters; and (2) to compel the USAO to extract and disclose, as to all USAO-filed PR/TT matters during the years 2008 through 2016, the fifteen categories of information that the USAO provided as to the sampling of 2012 PR/TT matters. Pet'rs' Mem. at 35-38. The petitioners do not seek extracted information concerning historical \u00a7 2703(d) matters, and seek no retrospective relief whatsoever as to SCA warrants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, 42-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   's generalized factors weigh in favor of retrospective access to PR/TT extracted information and \u00a7 2703(d) docket information for essentially the same reasons they weigh in favor of prospective relief, as discussed above. For example\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the process of manually extracting specified categories of information from closed PR/TT matters and providing such information in chart form substantially eliminates any risk that information properly left under seal, such as information bearing on personal privacy or law enforcement investigative prerogatives, will inadvertently be disclosed due to a human redaction error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Nevertheless, that\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   's generalized factors weigh favorably toward retrospective unsealing and disclosure is not dispositive. The retrospective relief inquiry also implicates a particularized consideration that the petitioners' claim for prospective relief does not implicate as much, due to operational and administrative changes adopted recently by the USAO and Clerk's Office-namely, the enormous burden that complying with an order granting the retrospective relief sought would impose on the USAO and Clerk's Office. Under\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , a district court must consider any \"particularized ... interests\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   that a party may assert in support of maintaining documents under seal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These burdens are described below for the two parts of retrospective relief the petitioners seek: (1) extracted information from the 2,248 PR/TT matters filed by the USAO over nine years from 2008 through 2016; and (2) docket information from the roughly 2,636 \u00a7 2703(d) matters filed by the USAO and DOJ components over the same period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    i. Estimated Burden of Extracting Information From 2,248 PR/TT Matter\n   </em>\n   s\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The USAO estimates that completing the extraction process for one hundred percent of PR/TT matters that it initiated between the years 2008 through 2016, minus the twenty-four 2012 PR/TT applications from which information has already been extracted, would take roughly 720 hours. 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Jt.

According to the Clerk's Office, the USAO filed a total of 2,248 PR/TT applications during this period.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   PR/TT Lists. Assuming the USAO can extract information from twenty-four PR/TT matters in eight hours-a simplifying assumption made by the USAO, 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Jt. Rpt. \u00b6 10 n.2-extracting categories of information from all 2,248 matters the USAO filed over nine years, minus the 24 sample 2012 PR/TT matters already extracted, would take over 741 hours. Moreover, the USAO represented to the Court that extracting information from the 24 sample PR/TT matters actually took roughly eight and a half, rather than eight, hours-an estimate the Court has no reason to doubt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Assuming the USAO can extract information from twenty-four PR/TT matters in eight and a half hours, extracting categories of information from 2,248 matters, minus the 24 sample PR/TT matters from 2012 already extracted, would take approximately 788 hours-nearly 33 days working around the clock nonstop, or nearly twenty 40-hour workweeks. Complying with such a mandate would divert significant amounts of valuable AUSA time and resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Estimated Burden of Producing \u00a7 2703(d) Docket Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Producing requested lists of \u00a7 2703(d) matter docket information for the relevant nine year period, meanwhile, would impose similarly significant resource burdens on the Court and Clerk's Office by consuming substantial amounts of staff time-in particular, time necessary to ensure that information properly left under seal is not inadvertently disclosed. The petitioners appear to assume that unsealing docket information for 2,636 \u00a7 2703(d) matters,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 2703(d) Notice, is a trivial clerical task, as easily performed as pressing the \"print\" button for a list of CM/ECF matters generated by the search criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In reality, the process is substantially more time- and resource-intensive than that. The task of assembling lists of historical \u00a7 2703(d) matters would require multiple Court and Clerk's Office staff members to scrutinize meticulously every entry on each page of every list released to purge these lists of any information bearing on personal identification or law enforcement investigative concerns. Completing this painstaking process of examination and redaction for the PR/TT Lists took several Court and Clerk's Office personnel days to complete. The lack of standardized case names or captions on applications and orders filed during the relevant nine-year period makes this task particularly challenging, as these captions have sensitive information bearing on personal identification peppered throughout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Moreover, prior to the standardization of \u00a7 2703(d) captions,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.D, such captions not infrequently would reference not \u00a7 2703(d) itself but only\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202705\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), the SCA's delayed notice provision. As a practical consequence, providing accurate and comprehensive \u00a7 2703(d) docket information would require carefully reviewing each \u00a7 2705(b) application that the USAO had filed to ascertain whether the application actually pertained to non-disclosure of a \u00a7 2703(d) order, a task fraught with peril given that \u00a7 2705(b)'s nondisclosure provision is available for both \u00a7 2703(d) orders and to grand jury subpoenas, which reveal \"matter[s] occurring before the grand jury\" and therefore are protected by Rule 6(e)'s secrecy protections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2). Ensuring that disclosure of \u00a7 2703(d) materials would not inadvertently reveal confidential grand jury matters would require Court and Clerk's Office staff to undertake additional manual, time-consuming review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   These practical challenges should be minimized in future efforts to disclose docket information from USAO-initiated PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant matters. The standardization of caption information adopted by the USAO for new PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant applications and administrative steps taken by the Clerk's Office in assigning different CM/ECF case type designations to various sealed criminal investigative matters, described in further detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.D, is intended to facilitate the unsealing and disclosure of docket information by predictably placing specified categories of information in designated locations within the caption and by enabling retrieval of specific types of sealed materials from CM/ECF. Yet, such administrative burdens are unavoidable as to disclosure of docket information concerning historical \u00a7 2703(d) and SCA warrant applications, and unwarranted in light of the unreliability and under-inclusiveness of the identification of these materials by the Clerk's Office, as detailed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.A;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Jt. Rpt. \u00b6 15 (acknowledging that a list of SCA warrant matters \"would be under-inclusive,\" given the limitations of the CM/ECF system and other administrative challenges). Thus, the same reason that the petitioners give for not requesting retrospective docket information for SCA warrant materials,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   note 23, and for eschewing extracted information for ten percent of PR/TT materials,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.2.d.iii-that the results would fall short of \"provid[ing] the public meaningful insight into government electronic surveillance practices,\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 41-42-applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Considering Burdens On Clerk's Office and USAO As\n   </em>\n   Hubbard\n   <em>\n    Specialized Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As described above, the burdens on the Clerk's Office and the USAO of the petitioners'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   requested retrospective relief, delimited as it is, remains considerable. At the same time, this burden is not evaluated on a blank slate but instead against the backdrop of the amount of information already publicly disclosed during the course of this litigation. Specifically, to date, the petitioners and the public have been provided with (1) the total numbers of USAO-filed PR/TT matters during the period of 2008 through 2016; (2) the total numbers of \u00a7 2703(d) and SCA warrant matters, retrieved using certain search criteria, filed by the USAO and DOJ components during this period; (3) certain docket information concerning PR/TT matters the USAO initiated during this period; (4) over 100 pages of redacted documents from four representative sample PR/TT matters from 2012; and (5) fifteen categories of extracted information from a representative sample of ten percent of USAO-filed PR/TT matters from 2012. These disclosures have already provided an unprecedented level of transparency into the process of judicial review of the USAO's use of PR/TT and SCA authorities to collect evidence in criminal investigations, and enables the petitioners to inform and educate the public. The question now is whether the common law right of access, as mediated through application of the\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   particularized interests, requires more?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The petitioners argue that any administrative burden on the USAO or Clerk's Office that would attend granting the full scope of the retrospective relief sought \"is not a compelling or countervailing interest sufficient to overcome the public's ... common law rights of access.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 30.\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , however, specifically instructs district courts to consider any \"particularized ... interests\" asserted against unsealing,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and such interests may, under appropriate circumstances, include the burden that complying with an order granting such relief would impose.

The petitioners also assert that providing extracted information from less than one hundred percent of PR/TT matters would have little to no public value.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Leopold Decl. \u00b6 13 (\"A larger sample size would not solve this problem.

Yet, the administrative burden on the USAO and Clerk's Office that would be triggered by compelling the USAO to fulfill the petitioners' request for unsealing and disclosure of fifteen categories of extracted information in all PR/TT matters filed over nine years, would be unduly significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Accordingly, upon consideration, under\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , of the USAO's and Clerk's Office's particularized interest in avoiding undue administrative burden, the common law right of access does not entitle the petitioners to any additional retrospective relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The agreement entered into by the Clerk's Office and USAO provides the public with a significant degree of information about this Court's judicial review process for such USAO-initiated matters that, in many respects, addresses substantial parts of the prospective relief the petitioners seek.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CLERK'S OFFICE, U.S. DIST.

Pet'rs' Mem. at 32, 38, 41. The petitioners further ask that the \"USAO and other government entities that file [these sealed materials] in this District should be encouraged to adopt uniform, standardized case captions and document titles ... that do not include, for example, target names, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33, 39, 42.

The MOU provides the written authorization from the Clerk of the Court, required under revised Local Criminal Rule 49(e)(4), for the USAO to file such applications electronically.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In addition, the MOU requires case captions for sealed applications and orders to follow standardized formats. MOU at 2. The standardized captions will contain no personally identifying information, such as the targeted email account, telephone number, or subscriber name, but, depending on the type of application, generally will include pertinent information about the number of targeted accounts, the service provider and the primary offense statute applicable to the criminal activity under investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The captions for PR/TT applications, for example, must contain: (1) the number of target telephone lines, subscriber accounts, and/or devices that are the application's subject or subjects; (2) the type of target or targets (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a landline, cellular, or mobile telephone; email account; cell tower; or other facility or device) subject to the application; (3) the service provider to which the order would be directed; and (4) the primary offense statute(s) under investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This standard case caption containing the variable information detailed above must be used by the USAO when initiating or making successive applications in a sealed PR/TT matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Such standardized captions will enable the Clerk's Office periodically to generate reports on the CM/ECF system reflecting the total number, matter docket numbers, and case captions associated with sealed matters, which reports may be unsealed and made publicly accessible, without undertaking the burdensome task of redacting personally identifiable or target information that may otherwise-and historically has been-placed in the caption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, while the petitioners seek prospective relief about only PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant materials, the MOU will facilitate the unsealing and disclosure of limited information revealing the numbers, case captions and filing dates of additional categories of sealed surveillance materials, as such materials are added to coverage under the MOU.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Clerk's Office has also adopted new CM/ECF case types to more readily identify the type of criminal investigative matter being initiated. Thus, rather than assigning general MC numbers to many different types of sealed criminal investigative matters, the Clerk's Office will assign more specialized docket numbers reflective of the matter at hand. For example, \"PR\" will be used for PR/TT applications and \"SC\" for SCA applications, with special designations within the SC case type for SCA warrant and \u00a7 2703(d) materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The petitioners would have both the Clerk's Office and the USAO take two additional steps in providing prospective relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the petitioners request real-time unsealing and public posting on PACER, upon initial filing of sealed PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant materials, of each matter's \"case number and certain associated docket information,\" including \"case name, date of application, and magistrate judge to whom the matter is assigned.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 33, 39, 41. This information, petitioners explain, would \"allow[ ] the public to know the number of applications for PR/TT devices filed by the government and pending at a given time in this District, and gives the public an opportunity to request that judicial records in particular matters be unsealed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   This request for real-time reporting by the Clerk's Office on the filing of PR/TT,\n   \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant materials represents a significant shift in the petitioners' position. Over the course of this five-year litigation, the petitioners have insisted that they do not seek access to pending, open and active criminal investigations, which this real-time reporting would necessarily provide. To the contrary, the original petitions in this case sought information only about closed investigations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pet. at 1 (disclaiming access to materials \"which relate to an ongoing investigation\"); May 2016 Tr. at 5:10-11 (\"[W]e're not asking for anything involving an ongoing investigation.\"); Sept. 2016 Tr. at 22:14 (reaffirming that the petitioners seek disclosure of information from only investigations that are \"completely closed\"); Dec. 2016 Tr. at 26:16-17 (\"[W]e understand the open investigations issue, and we have stayed away from it.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:3-5 (reiterating that the petitioners do not seek to \"expos[e] an ongoing investigation\" and have \"limited [thei]r requests to closed investigations\"); Feb. 2017 Tr. at 16:13, 38:15-16 (disclaiming \"access to the documents\" in \"an ongoing investigation\" and emphasizing that the petitioners seek access to materials \"only ... for closed investigations\"). On this basis alone, the petitioners' demand for prospective relief in the form of real-time reporting of sealed matters for pending, open, and active criminal investigations is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Instead, the Clerk's Office, as set out in the MOU, plans to provide biannual docket reports about various types of sealed criminal investigative matters filed twelve through six months prior to each report's publication. While some of these matters will remain open, the six-month delay in reporting somewhat reduces the risk to an ongoing criminal investigation. These reports will provide information about the total numbers of such matters and, as reflected in the standardized caption for each matter, the number and type of target accounts (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , landline telephone, cellular telephone, and/or email), the providers' names, and the primary offense statutes under investigation. This information on the sealed applications subject to judicial review will provide additional transparency as to the processing of these sensitive matters, without jeopardizing either privacy or law enforcement interests. Indeed, this information is far more robust than that seemingly sought by the petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Second, the petitioners would require the USAO or other government entity initiating a sealed matter \"to promptly move to unseal or partially unseal\" upon \"the close of the related criminal investigation,\" and, if a matter remains sealed \"six months (180 days) after the date it was initially filed,\" that the Court be prepared to issue \"an order to show cause why it should not be unsealed in its entirety.\" Pet'rs' Mem. at 34-35, 39, 42. As the USAO correctly indicates, adoption of \"a system that calls for the Court to issue show cause orders in each of the hundreds of PR/TT and SCA matters that are filed each year would be labor-intensive for the Clerk's Office and would require the USAO[ ] to expend resources to review each matter and respond to each show cause order.\" Gov't's Opp'n at 41 n.18. This is simply unworkable. Instead, periodic reports by the Clerk's Office concerning sealed criminal investigative matters and dockets will serve the public interest by providing additional transparency regarding the judicial review of sealed criminal investigative matters in a manner that is less burdensome to the Court, the Clerk's Office, and the USAO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Moreover, the very reasons that the petitioners cite as the public value in obtaining public access to redacted PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant materials-making the public aware of the USAO's use of (1) novel legal theories to obtain\n   orders allowing for particular types of surveillance, and/or (2) techniques \"to compel a service provider to provide novel or unusual technical assistance,\" Pets.' Mem. at 13 (quoting CIS Decl. \u00b6 10 (alterations omitted) )-are the reasons disclosure may be detrimental to ongoing law enforcement investigations. Such disclosure could tip off targets and subjects of ongoing criminal investigations to the existence of investigative methods and techniques, the very efficacy of which may rely, in large part, on the public's lack of awareness that the USAO employs them. This, in turn, would enable targets and subjects to structure their communications so as to evade detection or to spoliate, through tampering or outright destruction, potential evidence already in existence, to the prejudice of ongoing criminal investigations and the concomitant increased risk to public safety. Imposing such burdens on law enforcement investigations cannot be justified, notwithstanding the public value that disclosure of redacted PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant materials may have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   A court's \"decision as to access is one best left to the sound discretion of the trial court, a discretion to be exercised in light of the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2497\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/589/#p597\">\n    435 U.S. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2497\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/589/#p597\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The additional steps demanded by the petitioners as prospective relief would impose significant administrative and other burdens on the Clerk's Office and USAO, but would do little to increase transparency compared to the information that will be made publicly available under the MOU. For these reasons, the information and access afforded by the steps outlined in the MOU on a going-forward basis provide all the prospective relief to which the common law entitles the petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   This litigation illustrates that \"changing technology affects the public's appetite for information concerning court proceedings,\" and \"[t]his in turn changes and affects the requirements for judicial transparency.\" Hon. T.S. Ellis III,\n   <em>\n    Sealing, Judicial Transparency and Judicial Independence\n   </em>\n   , 53 VILL. L. REV. 939, 942-43 (2008). Indeed, \"[t]ransparency is a function of both technology and public expectations, and both of these factors vary over time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 941. While judicial independence is embedded in our constitutional framework, this critical feature of our federal government is bolstered by transparency in how the courts review and resolve the matters presented to them. Otherwise, \"[s]ecret proceedings, including unwarranted or excessive sealing of court records, engender suspicion, mistrust and a lack of confidence in the judicial process and, if not rare and well understood as necessary, such proceedings will likely lead to attempts to limit judicial authority and independence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 940. Thus, taking stock of where transparency may be improved as to records originally sealed to good purpose, is not just a fruitful exercise that may be prodded by litigation such as the one at bar, but a necessary administrative endeavor for the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In this case, the sealed judicial records at issue are sensitive government applications seeking authorization to collect, for use in ongoing criminal investigations, certain types of information about electronic and telephonic communications. The parties are in agreement that information in these sealed judicial records implicate myriad considerations, including the sensitive personal privacy and reputational interests of the customers or subscribers, about whom the information was sought; important public safety and law enforcement interests in avoiding any disruption\n   of, or loss of evidence in, ongoing criminal investigations; and, finally, the Court's interest in ensuring the administrative feasibility of providing meaningful, rather than misleading, information and imposing no more than manageable burdens on the Clerk's Office and the USAO. These weighty interests of protecting privacy and public safety, and providing additional transparency for these sealed judicial records in an administratively workable manner, exist in significant tension with providing the public access sought by the petitioners. Nonetheless, this Court has striven to articulate a common law right of access to sealed judicial records regarding the government's exercise of statutory surveillance authorities that strikes a workable balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   To that end, while the First Amendment extends no right of access to these judicial records, the Court identifies a prospective right of access, due to the significant administrative and operational reforms undertaken in tandem by the Clerk's Office and the USAO, to certain categories of information, which will be disclosed on a periodic basis, regarding the total number of PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant applications filed by the USAO, the number and type of accounts that such applications target, the names of the providers to which these applications are directed, and the primary criminal offense under investigation for these applications. The prospective right of access articulated here is designed to minimize any risk of revealing information about ongoing law enforcement investigations or the individuals targeted, but will enable the public to know, albeit on a limited basis, more about what this Court is doing in reviewing these types of surveillance applications. No retrospective right of access is recognized, in consideration of the significant administrative burdens that retrospective disclosure would impose on the Clerk's Office and USAO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the petitioners' petitions to unseal are granted in part and denied in part.

A, Sealed Applications and Orders Subject to Electronic Filing MOU (Sept. 14, 2017), but this MOU and the attachment will be updated to authorize the electronic submission of other sealed government surveillance applications as administrative operations within both the Clerk's Office and the USAO allow. As stressed above, the common law entitles the petitioners to prospective relief only because recently-adopted administrative and operational changes to the USAO and Clerk's Office's processing of sealed government surveillance applications in criminal investigative matters, as reflected in the MOU, reduces, to an administratively manageable level, the burdens that providing such disclosure would impose. These administrative and operational reforms include allowing the USAO to file PR/TT, \u00a7 2703(d), and SCA warrant applications electronically. The\n    <em>\n     Hubbard\n    </em>\n    factor analysis favoring prospective relief presupposes that the USAO can file such applications electronically with standard templates, which remove from application and case captions any personally identifiable or other information properly remaining under seal. Otherwise, the particularized\n    <em>\n     Hubbard\n    </em>\n    factor of administrative burden on the USAO and the Clerk's Office would outweigh the generalized\n    <em>\n     Hubbard\n    </em>\n    factors that weigh toward disclosure, and the common law would provide no right of access. Thus, a prospective right of access to information regarding SCA warrant matters shall not come into being until the MOU is updated to authorize the USAO to file such applications electronically.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"38\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    The petitioners' extraordinary complaint that the MOU represents an \"an end-run around [p]etitioners and this litigation,\" Pets.' Reply to Gov'ts' Opp'n (\"Pets.' Reply\") at 5, ECF No. 52, is both misplaced and short-sighted for several reasons. First, as the USAO correctly observes, \"the decision ... how[ ] to establish a protocol to identify more accurately, track, and ultimately terminate sealing orders is a matter that falls within the administrative responsibility of this Court,\" Gov't's Resp. at 3 n.3-a responsibility that stands entirely independent of any particular litigant or case. Second, the MOU does not apply to the petitioners' requests alone, and the petitioners are far from the only persons who may benefit from the MOU. Going forward, the additional transparency as to the judicial review process for sealed criminal investigative matters that the MOU provides will have benefit to the public far broader than merely to the litigants in this case. The petitioners simply have no unique status among the public to be made privy to \"private negotiations with the Clerk's Office,\" Pet'rs' Reply at 5, regarding administrative and operational matters, as they demand. Finally, and most importantly, as made clear in the text, the petitioners' success in prevailing on their common law right of access claim as to prospective relief is due entirely to the advances outlined in the MOU and adopted by both the USAO and the Clerk's Office in processing the sealed criminal investigative matters at issue. In this respect, \"[s]ome people might call\" the petitioners' accusation-that the MOU's entry was improper and constituted some sort of \"end-run\" around them, Pets.'
