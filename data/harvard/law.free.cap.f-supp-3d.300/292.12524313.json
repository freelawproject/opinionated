BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As we enter a new year, a top priority is often to get in better shape. Plaintiff Valerie McMullen had that same goal in 2010 and (unlike so many of us) actually followed through. After her favorite trainer left her gym, however, she sought a refund for unused sessions. What she received instead were two bills with new personal-training charges she claims she never incurred. After unsuccessfully trying to straighten out these alleged errors, Plaintiff brought this action against the two creditor banks-Chase and Synchrony-as well as various individuals and companies associated with the gym. The Court previously granted in part the banks' Motion to Dismiss, but left intact McMullen's counts against them alleging fraud, conspiracy to defraud, and violations of D.C. consumer-protection law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMullen v. Synchrony Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n    164 F.Supp.3d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98 (D.D.C. 2016). Plaintiff and Defendant Chase now cross-move for summary judgment on these remaining claims. Finding no genuine issue of material fact for trial, the Court will grant Chase's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In cross-moving for summary judgment here, the parties largely agree on the material facts. The Court, accordingly, recounts those that are undisputed, while noting specific disagreements about others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although Chase is the only Defendant implicated in this Opinion, some background regarding the others is helpful. In 2008, Chase rolled out a program, ChaseHealthAdvance, which offered a revolving line of credit \"for the purpose of financing and facilitating the payment of the medical costs of various ... procedures.\" Def. MSJ, Exh. 1-B (2008 Chase Provider Agreement) at 1;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh. 1 (Declaration of Jennifer Heald), \u00b6 5. \"ChaseHealthAdvance offered accountholders no-interest financing to obtain services from Chase-accepted providers.\" Heald Decl., \u00b6 6. As part of the application to become a provider, a business listed a doctor's name and valid medical-license number,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9, and also agreed to adhere to certain terms and conditions, including promptly submitting to Chase an invoice for all customer purchases financed through ChaseHealthAdvance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2008 Provider Agreement at 1; Heald Decl., Exh. D (2011 Chase Provider Agreement) at 2. The provider could either mail such invoice with the customer's signature, or (as is often the case in the digital age) remit it electronically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2008 Provider Agreement at 1. If a provider chose the latter route, it agreed to \"retain a copy of the original, signed Invoice for a period of four years from the date of completion or delivery set forth on the Invoice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the event of a customer dispute regarding a transaction, providers had to submit the signed invoice within ten business days or pay Chase the full amount of the disputed charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 10, 2008, Chase entered into a provider agreement with Bullen Wellness, a joint venture between two business associates, Karim Steward and Wayne Bullen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Attach. 2 (Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts), \u00b6 3. Steward owned a gym, One World Fitness, and Bullen owned a chiropractic practice, Washington Chiropractic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ, Attach. 3 (Plaintiff Statement of Undisputed Material Facts), \u00b6 17. Bullen Wellness's provider-enrollment form listed Dr. Bullen's chiropractor license number and the same address and phone number associated with One World Fitness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24. It should be noted, however, that Chase had no official relationship with the gym.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SUMF, \u00b6 78; Def. Reply, Exh. 19 (Deposition of Valerie McMullen) at 259-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2010, McMullen began attending personal-training sessions at One World Fitness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SUMF, \u00b6 63. She purchased 54 sessions in advance at a cost of $5,040 and decided to apply for a ChaseHealthAdvance account to pay for them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 63. Steward asked her a series of questions, answers to which he entered into the electronic application on his computer's Chase portal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McMullen Depo. at 78. McMullen was approved with a credit limit of $12,000 and signed a purchase-verification form, per Chase policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82-83. The following month she received a billing statement from Chase with a charge of $5,040 from Bullen Wellness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McMullen Depo. at 109-10. Plaintiff made payments on her balance without issue. Having exhausted her 54 sessions by December 2010, she then purchased 150 additional training sessions (50 weeks), which she charged on a personal credit card.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SUMF, \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   All was well until September 2011. On September 21, McMullen had a conversation with Steward wherein she stated that\n   she would renew her membership for another year so long as her preferred trainer was working there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McMullen Depo. at 156:13-18, 161:5-22. (Defendant Steward disputes that this conversation happened, but Chase-the only Defendant in these Motions-does not.) The next day, however, One World Fitness terminated this trainer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McMullen Depo. at 147. Plaintiff promptly informed the gym the following day that she wished to cancel her membership and requested a refund for the remaining three months for which she had prepaid in December 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SUMF, \u00b6 73. Instead of obtaining a refund, however, when McMullen received her Chase bill the following month, she saw a new charge for $1,000 from Bullen Wellness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McMullen Depo. at 174:2-5, 182:9-22. Believing this was unauthorized, Plaintiff called Chase on November 1, 2011, to dispute it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Decl., Exh. U (Call Log). (The parties disagree as to whether McMullen authorized the charge in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply, Attach. 1 (Response to Plaintiff Statement of Undisputed Material Facts), \u00b6 1.) The Chase representative asked her for her email address so that he could email her a dispute form, which he did on November 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SUMF, \u00b6\u00b6 54, 58. McMullen never returned the dispute form or submitted to Chase any other written grievance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64. She continued making payments to Chase and paid off the $1,000 balance on June 8, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 12, 2014, Plaintiff filed this suit in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Notice of Removal) at 1. She named Steward and Bullen; their companies (One World Fitness, Bullen Wellness, and Washington Chiropractic); two banks, Synchrony and Chase; and a handful of unnamed individuals and corporate entities as Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Attach. 1 (Complaint), \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6-14. The Complaint raised a bevy of claims against these Defendants-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , violations of the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act, civil conspiracy, common-law fraud, conversion, breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, vicarious liability, and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 36-83. McMullen later amended her Complaint to include class-action claims, seeking relief on behalf of a putative class of \"all One World Fitness customers who received financing from the Bank Defendants.\" Notice of Removal at 2. Chase then successfully removed the suit to federal court pursuant to the diversity-removal provisions of the Class Action Fairness Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55 (Memorandum Opinion and Order denying remand).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 23, 2015, Chase moved to dismiss the claims asserted against it-specifically, violations of the CPPA, fraud and conspiracy under D.C. common law, and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 57 (MTD). Defendant Synchrony also joined this Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 63 (Notice of Joinder). Plaintiff opposed the Motion and sought leave to amend her Complaint a second time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 65 (Opposition to MTD), 70 (MTA). On February 16, 2016, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend her Complaint, but also granted Chase's Motion to Dismiss as to Count VII (punitive damages).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMullen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n    164 F.Supp.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Using the proposed Second Amended Complaint as the operative document, the Court determined that Plaintiff had stated a claim for the substantive counts against the banks-violations of the CPPA (Count I), and fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud (Count III). After nearly a year of discovery, Chase filed this Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff cross-moved, and the Motions are now ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

False Statements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff first contends that, by sending her a billing statement listing the September 21, 2011, $1,000 charge from Bullen Wellness, Chase falsely represented that she had authorized such charge and was legally obligated to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 75; Pl. MSJ at 23. The undisputed facts say otherwise. Both sides agree that: (1) Bullen Wellness submitted a charge for $1,000 on September 21, 2011, and (2) Chase sent a billing statement to McMullen reflecting that charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Nowhere, however, does the bill state that McMullen\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   the charge. In fact, she admitted as much in her deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McMullen Depo. at 181:19-21 (\"Q: Does it say anywhere [on the billing statement] that you authorized this charge? A: No.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A typical credit-account statement simply sets out \"the amount of the purchases ... charged to [an] account[ ] that month, the total balances outstanding in the account[ ] and any 'finance charges' levied on the balances.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryson v.

Lenders, such as Chase, that allow an accountholder to use a line of credit at a point-of-sale merchant, initially presume that charges submitted by the merchant are authorized. The billing statement reflects those purchases and provides the customer an opportunity to correct any mistakes. To wit, Plaintiff's credit statements and her Chase Account Holder Agreement both include a \"billing rights summary\" section, providing direction if she \"find[s] a mistake\" on the statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Decl., Exh. P (McMullen Account Agreement) at 6; October 2011 Billing Statement at 4. Chase is, in fact, required by law to provide customers a method by which they can dispute erroneous charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201637\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(10) (requiring creditors to disclose address on billing statements customers can use to assert billing errors). And a Chase customer who disputes a\n   charge is not legally obligated to pay it while the bank investigates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Account Agreement at 5. While Chase may have represented that Bullen Wellness charged her account $1,000, the bank never represented via the statement that such charge was\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   . Nor did Chase represent that she categorically had to pay the $1,000, as the statement provided clear and conspicuous instructions for disputing an incorrect charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff additionally maintains that Chase \"falsely represented to [her] through its marketing materials that One World Fitness was approved as a Chase Health Advance provider when it was not,\" based on a letter Steward gave her upon joining One World Fitness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Again, her contentions are not borne out by the record. The welcome letter, which included both the ChaseHealthAdvance and One World logos, offered new gym members a free preliminary chiropractic screening with Dr. Bullen. Certainly, the face of the letter suggests a relationship between Chase and One World Fitness when no such link existed. Yet it was\n   <em>\n    One World\n   </em>\n   , not Chase, that implied such a relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Welcome Letter (displaying ChaseHealthAdvance logo on top left of page but bearing Steward's signature). No evidence suggests that\n   <em>\n    Chase\n   </em>\n   encouraged, approved, or even knew of One World Fitness's use of its logo. True, the bank did provide a customizable welcome-letter template for its providers to use \"to inform [their] patients of the payment options available to them.\" Heald Decl., Exh.

Omissions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   According to McMullen, not only was the $1,000 charge itself a false representation, but Chase's handling of her dispute also led to several \"willful omissions,\" including that: (1) it \"had issued a line of credit\" in her name; (2) it did not \"possess any signed documentation permitting Chase to issue\" the second line of credit and process the $1,000 charge; (3) it ran a credit check on [her] on September 21, 2011, without her authorization; (4) \"One World Fitness was not an approved provider\" and; (5) \"personal training session could not be financed through the Chase Health Advance program.\" Pl. MSJ at 26-27. These allegations hold no water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As a threshold matter, none of these purported omissions are included in the Second Amended Complaint. Although Plaintiff pled willful omissions by Defendants Bullen and Steward, she listed only affirmative misrepresentations by Chase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 75. Adding omissions as a source of fraud via her Cross-Motion-which claim requires as an additional element a duty to disclose-\"amounts to a fundamental change in the nature of\" this count.\n   <em>\n    Teltschik v. Williams &amp; Jensen, PLLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3599843\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/683/33/#p42\">\n    683 F.Supp.2d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 (D.D.C. 2010). \"It is well established that a party may not\n   amend its complaint or broaden its claims through summary judgment briefing.\"\n   <em>\n    Dist. of Columbia v.

The Court could grant Chase summary judgment as to her willful-omission claims on that basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even if Plaintiff had properly alleged such conduct, she would still come up short on the merits. The first two purported omissions-that Chase opened a second unauthorized line of credit in her name and did so without any signed documentation-are the bases for several of McMullen's claims throughout the Complaint. The record, however, does not support that Chase approved, opened, or authorized a second line of credit. Plaintiff premises this allegation largely (if not solely) on a document generated from the ChaseHealthAdvance portal to Bullen Wellness (but not to her) on September 21, 2011, stating that her \"application for credit has been approved\" in the amount of $10,293.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ, Exh. 15 (Credit Approval Notification). Given that she denies ever giving authorization for a line of credit on that date and that Chase has been unable to produce any document with her signature showing that she did, the claim seems plausible at first blush. Indeed, the Court so found in the prior Opinion, noting that she had \"alleged enough facts to clear the motion-to-dismiss standard.\"\n   <em>\n    McMullen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n    164 F.Supp.3d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Discovery, however, has not put flesh on these bones, and there are no facts in dispute that would create an issue for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Chase's designee testified that, though the document uses the word \"application,\" it was not a \"new credit application.\" Heald Depo. at 81:15-20. Instead, because McMullen had an existing account older than 90 days, Chase \"would check the [customer's] credit before\" a new transaction would be processed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n    at 82:11-16, 111:6-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court may not, of course, weigh conflicting evidence on a motion for summary judgment, and, because it ultimately grants Chase's Motion, Plaintiff's \"evidence is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [her] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    477 U.S. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Extrapolating from this document that Chase opened a line of credit is, however, not a \"justifiable inference\" when looking at the totality of the record. Instead, the only reasonable inference is that the notification was the result of Chase's inquiry into McMullen's continued creditworthiness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   McMullen authorized Steward to apply for a ChaseHealthAdvance account in her name in September 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SUMF, \u00b6 63; McMullen Depo. at 75-79. Chase approved her for an account with a limit of $12,000 and assigned an account number ending in 5058.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Decl., Exhs. F (McMullen Approval), M (September 2010 Billing Statement). In September 2011, before Bullen Wellness submitted the $1,000 charge, her previous balance on the open account was $1,707, leaving her an available credit amount of $10,293.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh. Y (September 2011 Billing Statement). Her available credit in September 2011 corresponds to the amount listed on the controversial notification that was generated in response to Steward's September 21 charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Credit Approval Notification (listing approved amount as $10,293). The $1,000 charge was posted to the account McMullen concedes is authorized, the account ending in 5058.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 2011 Billing Statement at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The question remains, however, of why Bullen Wellness received a credit-approval notification. Creditors may request a consumer credit report for their current accountholders without their permission before processing certain transactions, which is what the record shows happened here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F) (credit-reporting\n   agencies may provide consumer-credit reports when requested \"(i) in connection with a business transaction that is initiated by the consumer, or (ii) to review an account to determine whether the consumer continues to meet the terms of the account\"). The only reasonable inferences to draw from the undisputed facts are that the notification to Bullen Wellness was the result of a credit check by Chase in response to the $1,000 charge, and that the only ChaseHealthAdvance account Plaintiff had was the one she authorized ending in 5058. The (perhaps inartfully titled) \"credit approval\" represents the bank approving the transaction, not a separate account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Depo. at 111. Given that there is no \"unauthorized\" line of credit from Chase, there can be no willful omission of such line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff's second alleged omission also appears to include a claim that Chase failed to tell her that it did not have documentation showing that she had authorized the $1,000 charge. Her position that the bank representative should have disclosed this information during the November 1 phone call with her,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 27, is, however, incorrect. Under Chase's policies, the provider was responsible for retaining a signed copy of the receipt, which the bank would request in the event it received a written dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Depo. at 166:4-10. Because McMullen never submitted her billing dispute in writing, any duty Chase had to disclose a receipt was never triggered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166:18-22;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawkins v.

Her claim that Chase committed fraud by omitting that it had checked her credit before approving the $1,000 transaction fails because the bank had no duty to disclose that information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sundberg v.

McMullen does not argue that either circumstance is present here. Federal law expressly permits a lender to obtain a consumer's credit report when it \"intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer ... and involving the ... review of ... an account[ ] of the consumer.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11564111\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/818/#p829\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F) (permitting credit check \"to review an account to determine whether the consumer continues the meet the terms of the account\"). Consumer authorization is not needed for such credit inquiries, and Plaintiff has not explained why a credit check would be material such that Chase should have disclosed it to her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

As to the former, Chase does not have a duty to disclose every entity with which it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have a business relationship. Chase's contractual relationship was with Bullen Wellness, not One World Fitness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Decl., Exh. A (Bullen Wellness Provider Enrollment Form). Bullen Wellness was the provider listed on ChaseHealthAdvance accounts, and all remitted money was deposited into Bullen Wellness's accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ, Exh. 16 (Chase Funding Report for Bullen Wellness); Steward Depo. at 34:1-12. Chase testified that it had no relationship with One World,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Heald Decl., \u00b6 22, and McMullen has not put forth anything beyond speculation from which a reasonable juror could infer one.

She bases her argument on a random selection of ten ChaseHealthAdvance accountholders that Chase produced for litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 29. Although five Bullen Wellness customers requested refunds, none of them alleged that they had not initially authorized the charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Decl., \u00b6 66.

Chase, like many credit-account issuers, requires that customers submit any disputes in writing. Federal law also sanctions this practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201666\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The Complaint alleges that McMullen \"justifiably relied on Defendant Chase's false representation that she was obligated to make payment, ultimately paying the full $1,000 demanded by [Chase].\" SAC, \u00b6 75. When Plaintiff noticed the $1,000\n   charge, however, she knew it was erroneous and thus promptly called Chase to dispute it. The representative told her that in order to investigate, she must submit a written dispute form, which he emailed to her. The same requirement was clearly spelled out on her billing statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Statement at 4 (\"If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us on a separate sheet at [address].... You must notify us of any potential errors\n   <em>\n    in writing\n   </em>\n   . You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.\").

Had she simply submitted her grievance in writing, she would not have had to pay anything pending an investigation by Chase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Statement at 4 (stating that Chase \"cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount\" while investigating).

MSJ at 20-21. As described above, however, that letter-which Defendant did not approve or have knowledge of-is not evidence that\n   <em>\n    Chase\n   </em>\n   represented any affiliation with One World.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1.a,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff nonetheless attempts to find a way to pin Steward's letter on Chase by stating that the bank stood idly by even as customers complained about unauthorized charges from One World.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 21-22. Unfortunately for her, she has her chronology backwards. Steward gave her the letter when she applied for the ChaseHealthAdvance account in 2010. None of the disputes appearing in the record regarding other complaints, however, appear before 2011-the same year that Plaintiff brought her own claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Decl., Exhs. Z-GG. McMullen cannot impute a duty on Chase to investigate unauthorized uses of its logo a full year before any recorded disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff next tries to tie her October 2011 billing statement to a \u00a7 (b) claim, alleging that \"Chase represented ... in the ... billing statement that the personal training services were approved of by the Chase Health Advance program, despite the clear internal mandate that personal training services could not be financed through the [program].\" Pl. MSJ at 22. The record is devoid of any \"clear internal mandate\" prohibiting gym services from being financed through ChaseHealthAdvance. Indeed, Chase testified to just the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Depo. at 188:12-14. Simply put, there is no genuine dispute for trial that Chase made a false representation of affiliation or approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    2. \u00a7\u00a7 28-3904(e), (e-1), (f-1), (p), (u)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court groups the next set of violations together, as they all deal with the same underlying issue: the October 2011 billing statement. Section 3904 imposes liability on a merchant who:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (e) misrepresent[s] as to a material fact which has a tendency to mislead;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (e-1) [r]epresent[s] that a transaction confers or involves rights, remedies, or obligations which it does not have or involve, or which are prohibited by law; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (f-1) [u]se[s] innuendo or ambiguity as to a material fact, which has a tendency to mislead; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (p) falsely state[s] or represent[s] that repairs, alterations, modification, or servicing have been made and receiving remuneration therefor when they have not been made ...; [or]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (u) represent[s] that the subject of a transaction has been supplied in accordance with a previous representation when it has not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   McMullen levels much the same argument here as with her common-law fraud claim discussed above. According to her, Chase misrepresented (1) \"in the October 2011 billing statement that [she] authorized a charge for 'Bullen Wellness Washington DC' on September 21, 2011, in the amount of $1,000\"; (2) \"that the charge was authorized and payment [was] due on that charge\"; (3) that she had \"received goods and services from Bullen Wellness on September 21\"; and that (4) it would help her \"disput[e] the charge and that a fraud investigation had been opened.\" Pl. MSJ at 17-23. As with the fraud claim, the allegations here rest on an inaccurate depiction of what a bill represents. A credit statement only details what charges have been submitted to the lender. It does not represent that the accountholder\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   a charge or that services were rendered, only that a merchant\n   <em>\n    charged\n   </em>\n   the borrower's account. If all bills simply were indisputable representations of obligations, there would be no need for billing-dispute mechanisms and procedures. True, the Court did note in the prior Opinion that a bill listing unauthorized charges \"undoubtedly tend[s] to mislead, as consumers generally\n   assume that the charges listed in billing statements they receive represent debt they previously authorized and now owe.\"\n   <em>\n    McMullen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339372\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/77/#p98\">\n    164 F.Supp.3d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That observation, however, was made in the context of a Motion to Dismiss, in which a court is typically limited to considering only the complaint and documents attached or incorporated therein.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

Cir. 1997). Now, with the benefit of discovery, the Court concludes that the billing statement at issue here would not have misled a reasonable consumer because it was accompanied by straightforward procedures explaining how customers could dispute mistakes on their bill and the bank did not demand payment for a disputed charge during any investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   McMullen's bill stated-as did the Chase representative with whom she spoke-that the only way for Chase to investigate a billing dispute is by Plaintiff's submitting it in writing. It strains credulity to think that a reasonable consumer would be misled by the billing statement in the way McMullen alleges given Chase's clear and visible dispute-resolution policies. The bank is thus entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's \u00a7\u00a7 28-3904(e) and (e-1) claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saucier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7308622\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/64/428/#p438\">\n    64 A.3d at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (summary judgment appropriate on \u00a7 28-3904(e) claim when plaintiff failed to established affirmative or implied misrepresentation).

That does not help McMullen, however, because the omissions of which she complains either concern factually inaccurate allegations or were incapable of misleading a reasonable consumer. The first three alleged omissions are grounded in the purported second, unauthorized line of credit. By now, it is clear that this \"second\" line of credit cannot support a CPPA violation because it never existed. The only charges Plaintiff incurred on her ChaseHealthAdvance account were for the account ending in 5058, which she admits to opening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The third omission also alleges that Chase never produced authorization for the $1,000 charge. Factually, McMullen is correct that Chase has not been able to provide documentation showing that she approved the charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Depo. at 106-107. As discussed above, however, a\n   disputed charge in the context of the entire statement does not \"tend[ ] to mislead.\" D.C. Code 28-3904 \u00a7 (f). Chase had clear procedures that accountholders could use to dispute charges, of which Plaintiff was aware but inexplicably did not follow. There is no genuine dispute for trial, therefore, about the first three alleged omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Next, Chase did check Plaintiff's credit without her permission before approving the $1,000 charge-which it is legally permitted to do. Again, however, McMullen never specifies what exactly was misleading about that practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 20 (noting only that \"[i]t is undisputed that Chase failed to disclose these material facts, all of which have a tendency to mislead\"). Conclusory allegations without more cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meijer, Inc. v. Biovail Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572416,4039457\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/857/\">\n    533 F.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff's final three omissions concern the relationship between One World Fitness and Chase. As the Court has already detailed, the bank never had, nor purported to have, such a relationship. It was Bullen Wellness that signed the provider agreement and submitted charges to Chase. In such a circumstance, there is nothing misleading about Chase's not stating that One World was not an approved provider. Similarly, McMullen does not explain how Chase's failure to disclose to her that Bullen Wellness had been approved to provide chiropractic services was material or misleading. Last, as discussed above, personal-training services could be approved under ChaseHealthAdvance, so the allegation about this purported omission is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    4. \u00a7 28-3904(q)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff's final endeavor to establish a cause of action under the CPPA rests on \u00a7 28-3904(q), which requires a merchant to \"supply to a consumer a copy of sales or service contract ... or other evidence of indebtedness which the consumer may execute.\" Chase first attempts to tread the well-worn path that it did not need to produce any documents regarding the second line of credit because it did not exist. That, however, does not completely resolve the issue, as Plaintiff also alleges that Chase violated \u00a7 (q) by not providing a signed receipt for the $1,000 charge. Setting aside that the plain language of this CPPA section mentions nothing about signed authorization, there is no dispute that Chase policy requires a customer to sign a purchase-acknowledgment form and receipt,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Provider Handbook at 6-7, and neither party has been able to locate a receipt for the $1,000 charge. ChaseHealthAdvance providers like Bullen Wellness were supposed to retain for at least four years a signed copy of every receipt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. If there were any disagreement about whether a customer authorized a charge, Chase would request a copy from the provider.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"[F]ailure to deliver it promptly w[ould] require the provider to immediately refund the total amount of the transaction in accordance with the refund policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chase avers that it never requested a receipt from Bullen Wellness because Plaintiff never submitted her dispute in writing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heald Depo. at 166: 18-22. Under a plain reading of the CPPA, nevertheless, Defendant's failure to produce the receipt is at least arguably a violation of \u00a7 (q). The Court need not hack its way through this thicket, however, because it concludes that McMullen's proposed interpretation of \u00a7 (q) is federally preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff's reading of \u00a7 (q) would require that credit issuers like Chase procure and retain signed receipts whenever charges are made against a customer from a point-of-sale merchant. The bank retorts that any such obligation is preempted by the federal National Bank\n   Act. Under the Supremacy Clause, federal law may expressly or impliedly preempt state law. Implied preemption can take two forms, conflict and field preemption. Conflict preemption, the type argued here, occurs when compliance with state and federal law is impossible or where state law may \"stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnett Bank of Marion Cty. v.
