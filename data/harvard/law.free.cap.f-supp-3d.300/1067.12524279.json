In light of the adoption of the \"What Law Governs\" provision,\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   are no longer persuasive. Finally,\n   <em>\n    Bianchi\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiffs' position. The\n   <em>\n    Bianchi\n   </em>\n   Court did not in any way hold that a claimant could pursue a state-law breach of contract claim based on an SFIP; instead, it concluded the NFIA preempted a state law claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    Bianchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220649\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/120/837/#p841\">\n    120 F.Supp.2d at 840-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs' state-law causes of action relating to the adjustment and payment-i.e., the \"handling\"-of claims made under their SFIP are expressly preempted. Having reached this conclusion, the Court need not address Defendant's argument regarding conflict preemption. The Court also will not address Plaintiffs' argument that state-law claims relating to the procurement of the SFIP would not be preempted, as no such claims have been pleaded in the FAC. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the state-law claims is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Homeowners Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs argue Defendant underwrote both the Homeowners Policy and the SFIP, and acted in bad faith in denying coverage under both policies. Opp'n at 11. Therefore, they contend that even if their claims under the SFIP are preempted, they state claims based on Defendant's denial of coverage under their Homeowners Policy, and the court may exercise jurisdiction over this diversity action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. However, the Homeowners Policy does not list Defendant as an underwriter, issuer, or insurer of the Homeowners Policy. The Homeowners Policy only references \"Your AAA Homeowners Policy\"-it does not refer to CSAA. Defendant is not listed in any capacity in the declarations page for that policy. Moreover, the FAC includes no allegations showing that Defendant is an underwriter or insurer of that policy, or that Defendant is legally responsible for AAA's denial of coverage under the Homeowners Policy. The FAC thus does not state any claim against Defendant based on the Homeowners Policy. Moreover, Plaintiffs offer no facts in their Opposition suggesting they can amend the FAC to state facts sufficient to show Defendant issued, underwrote, or is otherwise legally obligated to pay claims based on their Homeowners Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In their Opposition, Plaintiffs state that, \"[i]f the Court agrees with defendant and holds that the state law claims are preempted,\" they \"seek leave to allege a federal breach of contract claim as contemplated by the NFIA.\" Opp'n at 13. As amending the pleadings to assert such a claim would not be futile, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs leave to amend to do so. As the issue is not before it at this juncture, the Court does not at this point decide whether state-law claims based on the procurement of the SFIP are preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Motion to Dismiss, Defendant argues that mental and emotional distress damages, punitive damages, interest, and attorneys' fees are not recoverable in this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 10-11. First, Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n. They have therefore conceded the point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mariscal v.
