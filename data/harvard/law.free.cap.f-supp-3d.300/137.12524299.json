In the alternative, Venezuela seeks a stay of enforcement of the arbitral award in light of a pending appeal of the award in Paris. Unfortunately for Venezuela, its third time is not a charm and for the reasons that follow, this Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Venezuela's Motion to Dismiss Petition and to Deny Confirmation of the Arbitral Award or, in the Alternative, to Stay (\"Mot. to Dismiss\") [Dkt. # 16], and\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Rusoro's Petition to confirm the Award (\"Petition\") [Dkt. # 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rusoro Mining Limited (\"Rusoro\") is a Canadian corporation listed on the Toronto\n   Stock Exchange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rusoro Mining Ltd. v.

Its principal business is the exploration and production of gold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.

The Treaty governs investments between the contracting parties, providing protections against expropriation and establishing a mechanism for dispute resolution.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As relevant here, the Treaty provides for the resolution of disputes between an investor (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Rusoro) and a host contracting party (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Venezuela).

The Resolution's \"overarching principle\" was the \"liberty of export,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138, with only limited conditions imposed on companies seeking to export gold from the country. Namely, gold producers were required to (i) register with the Central Bank of Venezuela, (ii) obtain non-discretionary export authorization from the Central Bank of Venezuela, and (iii) sell at least 15% of their total annual gold production on the private domestic market.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Resolution No. 96-12-02 remained in place until Venezuela enacted the April\n   2009 BCV Resolution, which \"significantly altered the legal regime for the export of gold.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. As such, Venezuela now mandated (i) that 60% of each gold producer's quarterly gold production be sold to the Central Bank of Venezuela; and (ii) that gold producers export no more than 30% of their gold production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 144, 145, 147, 501. Subsequent measures, undertaken the same year, imposed further restrictions on foreign gold mining entities, while loosening restrictions on domestic ones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148-152. Under these measures, the Central Bank paid for the gold in local currency, tied to the Official Exchange Rate, which was consistently lower than the market rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145, 501. The Central Bank was also charged with approving all proposed exports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following year, Venezuela went one step further. It banned the use of the secondary currency exchange, known as the Swap Market, placing all foreign exchange transactions under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154. Shortly thereafter, Venezuela announced that Rusoro would be required to sell 50% of its gold production, and 50% of its foreign currency income, to the Central Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 156-59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   These measures finally came to a head with the government's complete expropriation of Rusoro's Venezuelan assets. On August 11, 2011, President Hugo Chavez declared the \"immediate nationalization\" of the Venezuelan gold mining sector.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160. Within one month, Venezuela adopted Supreme Decree No. 8.413 (\"Nationalization Decree\"), in which the State asserted control over the property and mining rights of all gold-producing companies in the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 160-62. On March 31, 2012, Rusoro \"formally withdrew from [its] mining areas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173. Rusoro's \"[m]ining [r]ights and other assets\" were taken by the Venezuelan Government shortly thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 17, 2012, Rusoro submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its request, Rusoro alleged multiple breaches of the Treaty by Venezuela, and sought an award of compensation plus interest, legal fees and costs, as well as any other relief the Tribunal considered appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. Rusoro claimed that Venezuela had expropriated its investment without payment of compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179. Rusoro sought compensation in the amount of approximately $ 2.3 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Venezuela raised jurisdictional and merits defenses.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 181-85, 187.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Tribunal was constituted on January 4, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 16. The parties, represented by counsel (many of whom appear on the briefs before this Court),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19, participated in multiple hearings before the Tribunal,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 66, producing witnesses, experts, and documents,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Tribunal declared the proceeding closed on June 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. The panel unanimously ruled on August 22, 2016 that Venezuela \"breached Art. VII of the BIT by expropriating Rusoro's investment in Venezuela without payment of compensation,\" and ordered that Venezuela pay Rusoro $ 966.5 million \"as compensation for\n   the expropriation of its investment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 904.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Tribunal explained its reasoning at length, devoting considerable discussion in the Award to the calculation of damages. The Tribunal acknowledged that the parties agreed that (i) the proper valuation date was September 16, 2011, the day when the Nationalization Decree was issued, and (2) that the term \"genuine value,\" as used in Article VII of the Treaty, \"equates with the traditional concept of 'fair market value.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 647. It noted two distinct features of the damages assessment in this particular case: (i) that Rusoro, as a publicly-traded corporation, was subject to accounting and disclosure requirements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 651, thereby enhancing the reliability of their balance sheet and trading price, and (ii) that Rusoro's enterprise was confined to a single industry, gold exploitation, in a single country, Venezuela,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 652. The Tribunal went on to discuss the nature of the international gold market and its correlation to the value of gold-producing companies,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 654-58; Rusoro's investment in Venezuela,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 659-82; the book value of that investment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 683-707; Rusoro's market capitalization,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 708-714; and Rusoro's valuation of its investments,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 715-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With this background established, the Tribunal acknowledged that the damages calculation was \"a hypothetical exercise\" because \"in real life, in September 2011 no buyer having good information about the gold sector in Venezuela would have been prepared to buy a gold producing enterprise in that country for a fair price.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 752. It explained that \"the value of gold companies is affected by the intensity of the regulatory measures adopted by host states,\" and it acknowledged that Venezuela's regulatory measures would have created a \"chilling effect\" sufficient to deter any prospective investor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 753-54. As such, in analyzing the Treaty's instruction to value an expropriated asset at the time \"immediately before the expropriation or at the time the proposed expropriation became public knowledge,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 756 (internal quotations omitted), the Tribunal reasoned that \"[t]he fair market value which the State must pay is that which an innocent, uninformed third party would pay, having no knowledge of the State's pre-expropriation (but post-investment) policy toward the expropriated company and its sector,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There were six valuations proffered on the record. First, the \"Investment Valuation\" assessed the value of Rusoro's acquisitions and investments in Venezuela. This number came to $ 774.3 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 763. Second, the \"Adjusted Investment Valuation\" revised the \"Investment Valuation\" amount to account for the increase in the value of gold internationally between the time of investment and the time of expropriation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 764. This inflated the $ 744.3 million number to $ 1.128 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, the \"Book Valuation\" reflected the net book value of Rusoro's assets, totaling $ 908 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 766. Fourth, the \"Maximum Market Valuation\" reflected Rusoro's peak stock market valuation, $ 700.6 million, taken February 28, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 768. Fifth, the \"Final Market Valuation\" reflected the decline in market capitalization following Rusoro's initial investment in\n   Venezuela.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 769. By this measure, Rusoro's investment was $ 125.6 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sixth, Rusoro's expert, Brent Kaczmarek, calculated the value of Rusoro's expropriated assets to be $ 2.23 billion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 770.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ultimately, the Tribunal relied on only three of the six methods: the Maximum Market Valuation, the Book Valuation, and the Adjusted Investment Valuation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reaching the \"genuine value\" of the expropriated investment, the Tribunal assigned a weight to each method. It accorded 25% to the Maximum Market Valuation, 25% to the Book Valuation, and 50% to the Adjusted Investment Valuation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 789. The weight assigned to each method reflected that method's \"strengths and shortcomings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, the Maximum Market Valuation had the advantage of reflecting \"no subjectivity in its calculation,\" based, as it was, on the stock market's independent assessment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Maximum Market Valuation had a shortcoming, however: Rusoro achieved this marker for only \"a very short period, in mid[-]2008, three years before the date of the expropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, the Book Valuation represented \"a conservative criterion,\" as it was taken directly from Rusoro's audited balance sheet, but did not account for increases in the price of gold during the relevant time period or the \"development of the mining properties\" under Rusoro's control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Adjusted Investment Valuation received the most weight, 50%, because it \"reflect[ed] the value the investment would have reached on the date of expropriation, simply as a direct consequence of the increase in the price of gold and of gold producing companies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When averaged and weighted, the Quantum for the expropriated assets totaled approximately $ 966.5 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 790.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 10, 2016, Rusoro asked this Court to confirm the arbitral award.

I disagree. To be sure, the Maximum Market Valuation, dated February 28, 2008, occurred more than three years prior to the date of expropriation, and therefore fell outside the Treaty's limitations period. But, as the Award explained, this measure was not intended as a stand-in for the value on September 16, 2011, the date of expropriation. The Maximum Market Valuation was simply one\n   <em>\n    input\n   </em>\n   in the Tribunal's calculation for the \"genuine value\" on September 16, 2011. Indeed, although it had the virtue of objectivity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Award \u00b6 789, the Maximum Market Valuation\n   <em>\n    predated\n   </em>\n   the substantial, global increase in the price of gold-a trend that, under ordinary economic conditions, would have increased Rusoro's trading price,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 764.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Venezuela also faults the Tribunal for its use of the Adjusted Investment Valuation, criticizing that method of valuation, the disparity between the valuation and the actual market capitalization on the date of expropriation, and the use of the price of gold to increase the valuation.

More than five years have passed since Rusoro initiated arbitration proceedings; Rusoro prevailed before the Tribunal; and Rusoro has yet to receive payment from Venezuela. Such circumstances strongly militate against the entry of a stay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gold Reserve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264731\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/112/#p120\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   135 ;\n   <em>\n    Chevron Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238791\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/949/57/#p71\">\n    949 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   72 ;\n   <em>\n    G.E.

Venezuela's contention that enforcement might, depending on the outcome of the foreign proceedings, simply beget more \"protracted and expensive litigation,\" Mot. to Dismiss at 30, is unavailing in light of the extensive proceedings to date, and the goal of \"immediate satisfaction of arbitral awards\" set out in the BIT, ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and New York Convention,\n   <em>\n    Gold Reserve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264731\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/112/#p120\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The second factor, the status of foreign proceedings and the estimated time for those proceedings to be resolved, likewise weighs in Rusoro's favor. It is unclear when the French appellate process will conclude, but, according to an uncontested statement in a declaration attached to Rusoro's Opposition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Stay (\"Opp'n\"), Deck of Elie Kleiman \u00b6 8 [Dkt. # 18-7], the Court of Appeal's decision is unlikely to be rendered prior to April of this year.

Venezuela points out that French courts have set aside, in part or in whole, arbitral awards on jurisdictional grounds. Mot. to Dismiss at 32. But Venezuela makes no mention of any factual similarities between those disputes and the case at bar. This factor therefore favors Rusoro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nor do the lesser\n   <em>\n    Europcar\n   </em>\n   factors fortify Venezuela's motion for a stay. The third factor, \"whether the award sought to be enforced will receive greater scrutiny in the foreign proceedings under a less deferential standard of review,\" militates only modestly in Venezuela's favor.\n   <em>\n    Europcar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1567118\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/310/#p317\">\n    156 F.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the (i) foreign proceeding (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the appeal in France) was brought to set aside an award, (ii) that appeal followed Rusoro's filing of the instant action in this Court, and (iii) those foreign proceedings were initiated by the party challenging the award. Last, in considering\n   whether \"the foreign proceedings were intended to hinder or delay resolution of the dispute,\" without impugning Venezuela's intentions, this Court notes that the appellate process in France has delayed enforcement of the award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gold Reserve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264731\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/112/#p120\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   So, too, with the fifth factor, the balance of hardships, and the sixth, \"any other [relevant] circumstances.\" As to the balance of hardships, Rusoro has not received any compensation from Venezuela, despite having had \"virtually its\n   <em>\n    entire business\n   </em>\n   expropriated by the Venezuelan state.\" Opp'n at 35 (citing Award \u00b6 652) (emphasis in original).

What more need one say!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In sum, Europcar factors one and two-the ones relied on most heavily within our Circuit-both favor Rusoro, and the totality of the other four factors collectively favor Rusoro as well.
