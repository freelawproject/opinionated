Now pending before the Court are competing motions for summary judgment. (Pls.' Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 81; Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Reno Housing Authority\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (hereinafter \"RHA\") is a municipal corporation established and operated to alleviate housing shortages and provide affordable housing options within the cities of Reno\n   and Sparks and throughout Washoe County, Nevada. RHA owns and manages 764 units of public housing in multiple locations throughout Washoe County, and offers subsidized housing to more than 2,500 low income families in the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area. (Jones Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-6, ECF No. 84-3.) At issue in this case are five of the apartment complexes managed by RHA: Essex Manor, Yorkshire Manor, Tom Sawyer Village, Silverada Manor, and Stead Manor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are five individuals who entered into \"Live-In Agreements\" with RHA. Under these Agreements, Plaintiffs received rent-free housing in exchange for undertaking the responsibility to perform certain regular work within the complexes they inhabited. From April 2010 until August 11, 2015, Plaintiff Joaquin Roces was the \"live-in\" responsible for the Essex Manor and Yorkshire Manor complexes, comprising 142 total housing units. (3:15-cv-408 Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 6, ECF No. 54; Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 5.) From October 2007 until July 31, 2013, Plaintiffs Juan and Judith Lopez were the live-ins at Tom Sawyer Village and Silverada Manor, comprising 250 units. (3:15-cv-408 Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, ECF No. 54; Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 5.) And from August 2012 until May 2016, Plaintiffs Jaime Villa and Melisa Chavez were the live-ins at Stead Manor, comprising 96 units. (3:16-cv-441 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, ECF No. 1; Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the Agreements, the duties of a live-in are as follows: The live-in must conduct a daily grounds inspection, paying specific attention to exterior light fixtures, the security of vacant housing units, and any vehicles or tenant activity in violation of RHA rules and regulations. (Agreement \u00b6 2B, ECF No. 83-4.) The timing of the daily inspection is flexible, however, and the live-ins are largely able to decide when to complete it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roces Dep. 89:22-90:16 (one inspection daily, any time between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m.), 149:14-16 (one inspection daily, any time before 11 p.m.), ECF No. 87-1; Villa Dep. 113:13-114:4, ECF No. 92-1 (one inspection daily, at varying times of day, with one \"late\" inspection over the weekend); Acosta Decl. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 84-4 (one inspection daily, at the live-in's convenience).) In conjunction with the daily grounds inspection, the live-in must complete a vehicle log report, and a building and grounds report (otherwise referred to as a property inspection report), each of which are turned in daily to RHA management. Incident reports may also be necessary, depending on the circumstances. (Roces Dep. 165:3-167:6, ECF No. 87-1.) Also, in conducting the grounds inspection, the live-in is expected to clean up the grounds as needed, by, for example, shoveling snow, throwing away trash or debris, clearing fallen tree branches, or picking up stray toys left in common areas. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 180:15-25; Agreement \u00b6 2C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Surely, the live-in's central duty is to be RHA's on-site \"eyes and ears\" outside of regular business hours. To that end, live-ins are required to be \"on-call\" to respond to emergencies every day from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., and around the clock on weekends and holidays. (Agreement \u00b6 2A.) During their on-call hours, live-ins must be \"available to answer, respond to and take appropriate action in a timely manner with respect to any emergency call\" received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Live-In Agreement clearly permits live-ins to leave the premises during on-call hours, but they must be reachable by telephone and must remain \"close enough to respond within no more than fifteen minutes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2D.) Live-ins\n   are not required by the Agreement to fulfill any affirmative duties during the on-call hours; rather, their purpose is to be near enough to respond quickly to emergency situations that may arise. Tenants experiencing an emergency are supposed to dial an RHA telephone number or contact Answer West-an answering service used by RHA for after-hours calls-and then the message is relayed to the live-in. The live-in is then expected to investigate the situation and abate minor emergencies if possible. If unable to abate the emergency, the live-in must report it to RHA's Asset Manager so a decision can be made regarding how and when to resolve the issue. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jones Dep. 43:4-47:6, ECF No. 86-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 11, 2015, Joaquin Roces filed a collective action complaint against RHA alleging failure to pay wages and overtime in violation of the FLSA and Article 15, Section 16 of the Nevada State Constitution (\"the Minimum Wage Amendment\" or \"the MWA\"). (3:15-cv-408 Compl., ECF No. 1.) His complaint alleged that Mr. Roces worked 153 hours a week for RHA (40 during regular business hours and 113 on call) without hourly compensation, and further alleged that his unit's maximum rental value is $600, resulting in an effective wage rate of $0.92 per hour. On September 29, 2015, Juan and Judith Lopez joined in Mr. Roces's wage-and-hour allegations, and Mr. Roces added individual claims of FLSA retaliation, discrimination and retaliation under Nevada law, and tortious discharge in violation of public policy. (3:15-cv-408 Am. Compl., ECF No. 16.) On January 26, 2016, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to circulate a notice of the pendency of collective action under the FLSA to putative class members, holding that Plaintiffs failed to make \"substantial allegations that they are similarly situated to the putative class members as victims of a single decision, policy, or plan.\" (Order, ECF No. 37.) Then on June 25, 2016, Jaime Villa and Melisa Chavez, represented by the same attorneys as the other three Plaintiffs, filed a separate action alleging the same wage-and-hour claims. (3:16-cv-441 Compl., ECF No. 1.) On September 19, 2016, the actions were consolidated under the first-filed case number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties have now moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

R. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those which may affect the outcome of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The moving party must first satisfy its initial burden. \"When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    C.A.R.

In contrast, when the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving party can meet its burden in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence to negate an essential element of the nonmoving party's case; or (2) by demonstrating that the\n   nonmoving party failed to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 323-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   If the moving party fails to meet its initial burden, summary judgment must be denied and the court need not consider the nonmoving party's evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adickes v. S.H.

If the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.

To establish the existence of a factual dispute, the opposing party need not establish a material issue of fact conclusively in its favor. It is sufficient that \"the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    T. W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v.

In other words, the nonmoving party cannot avoid summary judgment by relying solely on conclusory allegations unsupported by facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

It is undisputed that the Mr. and Mrs. Lopez terminated their contract with RHA as of July 31, 2013, and this action was filed on August 11, 2015. (Lopez Dep. 70:21-22, ECF No. 89-2.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 29-32, ECF No. 101.) Of course, the purpose of the live-in program is to kill two birds with one stone: maintain a \"management presence\" on the premises after hours while saving RHA the expense of additional staffing. To that end, the program offers a valuable benefit to both parties. The live-ins save money in the form of rent (which they would have to pay but for the Agreement), and RHA saves money in the form of wages (which it would have to pay but for the Agreement). Certainly, if the live-in program did not exist, RHA would have to bring in additional employees or independent contractors to perform the same functions. RHA does not argue the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, the fact that a live-in's duties would otherwise be completed by an employee is not alone sufficient to put RHA on notice that the live-in program implicates the FLSA. Indeed, former Executive Director David Morton, who established the live-in program, testified that he simply did not view the live-in arrangement as an employment-type relationship that would be subject to FLSA requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs' Counsel: Why did you create the live-in program?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Morton: Because I thought it would be a very useful and helpful way of ensuring that our residents lived in complexes where they felt comfortable after-hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: The live-in program, the live-in is not-I understand you don't believe that the person is an employee; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A: That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q: Why do you believe that person is not an employee?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A: Because they had a lease, a rental agreement that clearly spelled out their duties in return for the apartment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Morton Dep. 30:8-20, ECF No. 85-1.) In fact, other than two sections specifying the live-in's duties and certain days of the year on which the live-in would not be required to perform them, the Live-In Agreement reads much like a standard lease. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement, ECF No. 83-4.) For example, Section 1 contains RHA's promise to permit the tenant to occupy a particular unit, free of rent. Section 4 specifies that the Agreement will create a tenancy at will. Section 5 institutes a five-day notice period for a termination by either party, and provides that such notice, if given by RHA, will also represent a five-day notice of eviction in accordance with Nevada law. Section 7 imposes various rules and use restrictions that are common in residential lease agreements, such as a restriction on assignments and subleases, an obligation to abide by applicable housing codes affecting health and safety, and prohibitions on waterbeds and barbecues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reality, there is no evidence in the record of circumstances sufficient to put RHA on notice that it needed to inquire further into whether the live-in program was in compliance with the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20578.3\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 578.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). The mere nature of the program and governing Agreement is not enough. Whether Plaintiffs became employees of RHA by virtue of their Live-In Agreements is a complex question of law and fact-murky waters that even the attorneys in this case have thus far declined to wade into.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Morton testified that he believed RHA was entering into lease agreements with its live-ins, not employment agreements. There is certainly some nuance to the arrangement: Was RHA agreeing to provide free housing as an alternative to paying wages, or to accept certain specified services as an alternative to collecting rent? In Mr. Morton's mind, it was the latter. Plaintiffs have not offered any evidence to contradict Mr. Morton's testimony, and the Court does not believe a reasonable juror could conclude that his interpretation of the Live-In Agreement was so unreasonable as to support a claim of willful violation of the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because the parties' have not addressed it, the Court need not resolve the ultimate question of whether the Live-In Agreement created an employment-type relationship to which the FLSA applies. Nor does the Court need to answer the more difficult and fact-based question-assuming the Agreement did not create a relationship governed by the FLSA-of whether an employment relationship arose at any subsequent time by virtue of the level of control RHA may have exercised over Plaintiffs. The Court need only determine whether there is sufficient evidence that RHA was on notice that it had possible FLSA obligations and failed to take affirmative steps to ensure compliance. Mr. Morton's uncontradicted deposition testimony establishes that RHA believed it was entering into lease agreements with its live-ins under which the requirement of paying rent would be substituted by the lessee's agreement to provide certain services. No reasonable juror could find that RHA's failure to inquire into its possible FLSA obligations under what it determined to be a lease agreement was unreasonable, much less in reckless disregard for whether its conduct was prohibited by the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Of course, the Ninth Circuit has found that an employer's implementation of a new pay policy may itself be enough to put\n   the employer on notice of a need to inquire into FLSA compliance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/#p895\">\n    824 F.3d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, according to the cases the Court has found, such a conclusion has only been reached where the employment nature of the relationship was already established, i.e., where the employer knew the FLSA applied to the relationship. In\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's finding of willfulness where it was \"undisputed that the [employer] failed to investigate whether its exclusion of cash-in-lieu of benefits payments from the regular rate of pay complied with the FLSA at any time following its initial determination that the payments constituted a benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/#p895\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   is not similar to this case. The employer in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   was clearly on notice that its benefits payments needed to conform to FLSA requirements. Here, it was not at all clear to RHA that the FLSA even entered into the equation. Accordingly, the Court finds the mere nature of the relationship created by the Live-In Agreement was not enough to put RHA on notice of any possible FLSA requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This leaves only Plaintiffs' assertion that complaints they made to RHA while acting as live-ins were sufficient to give rise to RHA's obligation to inquire further into its FLSA compliance. Two of the Plaintiffs-Mr. Roces and Mrs. Lopez-claim they lodged complaints with RHA management regarding their compensation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roces Dep. 145:10-146:8, ECF No. 87-1; Roces Dep. Vol. II 92:8-93:15, ECF No. 88-2; Judith Lopez Dep. 62:3-63:14, ECF No. 89-2.) First, however, Mr. Roces's alleged complaints are not relevant to the timeliness of the Lopezes' FLSA claims. Plaintiffs' evidence establishes that Mr. Roces first complained about his compensation approximately six months prior to his termination. (Resp. 3, ECF No. 101.) This places his first complaint in or around early 2015. Mr. and Mrs. Lopez resigned from the live-in position in July 2013. Even if the complaints of Mr. Roces were sufficient to put RHA on notice of a possible FLSA violation, such notice came far too late to serve as a basis for establishing a willful violation of the Lopezes' FLSA rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The only other complaint was made by Mrs. Lopez herself, who testified that after a difficult night of dealing with a fight between tenants, which necessitated the presence of the Reno Police Department (a \"night of hell\"), she asked RHA Asset Manager Walter Dixon, \"When are we going to get paid for this job?\" In reply, Mr. Dixon laughed and said, \"You're not management.\" (Judith Lopez Dep. 62:3-63:14.) She never brought up the subject again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:16-22.) The Court finds that such an ambiguous and casual comment as this-which is inadequate not only to communicate the substance of a wage complaint but even to convey that the employee is raising a serious issue-is not sufficient to put an employer on notice of a possible FLSA violation. Mrs. Lopez's comment constitutes far less evidence of willfulness than has been rejected in other cases. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ikossi-Anastasiou v. Bd. of Supervisors of Louisiana State Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054481\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/546/\">\n    579 F.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2009), a Louisiana State University professor alleged willful violations of the Equal Pay Act (a part of the FLSA) on the basis that (1) her salary records showed she was paid less than many of her male colleagues, and (2) she filed formal grievances in 1995 and 1998 expressing dissatisfaction with her salary and requesting her pay be adjusted upward to match that of her male colleagues. The Fifth Circuit found this was \"not enough to raise a fact question as to whether LSU knew or recklessly disregarded that its pay scale was prohibited by the FLSA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054481\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054481\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/546/\">\n    at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so concluding, the court stated: \"[Plaintiff] has not provided evidence that LSU actually knew that the pay structure violated\n   the FLSA, or that LSU ignored or failed to investigate [plaintiff's] complaints. Without more evidence, [plaintiff's] allegations of willfulness cannot survive the summary judgment stage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054481\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have not proffered evidence that RHA intentionally violated the FLSA or recklessly disregarded its provisions. Therefore, the Lopezes' FLSA wage claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations, and are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    b. FLSA Wage Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court next turns to the merits of Plaintiffs' claims for unpaid wages under the FLSA.

Plaintiffs further argue that they must be compensated not only for hours of actual work, but for all hours during which they were required to be on call. Of course, RHA counters that it is entitled to an offset of its reasonable costs in providing lodging and that Plaintiffs' on-call time is non-compensable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Whether RHA is entitled to a wage offset based on the reasonable cost of providing lodging\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. RHA's failure to petition the Administrator\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs argue first that RHA is not entitled a wage offset under Section 203(m) because RHA failed to petition the Administrator of the DOL's Wage and Hour Division (\"the Administrator\") for a determination of the reasonable cost of providing lodging to Plaintiffs. This failure, Plaintiffs contend, is fatal to RHA's claim of offset. RHA does not dispute that it did not petition the Administrator for a determination of reasonable cost. (Resp. 4, ECF No. 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Section 203(m) reads: \" 'Wage' paid to any employee includes the reasonable cost,\n   <em>\n    as determined by the Administrator\n   </em>\n   , to the employer of furnishing such employee with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by such employer to his employees....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Section also provides that the Secretary of Labor is authorized to make determinations of the \"fair value\" of the board, lodging, or other facilities furnished by an employer in lieu of wages. According to the federal regulations interpreting Section 203(m), the Administrator may, \"[u]pon his motion or upon the petition of any interested person, ... determine generally or particularly the 'reasonable cost' to an employer of furnishing any employee with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer to his employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.4\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). However, this is not the only permissible way to determine reasonable cost under the regulations, and employers are expressly allowed to make such determinations in accordance with specific instructions provided within the same set of regulations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 3(m) directs the Administrator to determine \"the reasonable cost * * * to the employer of furnishing * * * facilities\" to the employee, and in addition it authorizes him to determine \"the fair value\" of such facilities for defined classes of employees and in defined areas, which may be used in lieu of the actual measure of the cost of such facilities in ascertaining the \"wages\" paid to any employee. Subpart B contains three methods whereby an employer may ascertain whether any furnished facilities are a part of \"wages\" within the meaning of section 3(m): (1)\n   <em>\n    An employer may calculate the \"reasonable cost\" of facilities in accordance with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 531.3 ;\n   </em>\n   (2) an employer may request that a determination of \"reasonable cost\" be made, including a determination having particular application; and (3) an employer may request that a determination of \"fair value\" of the furnished facilities be made to be used in lieu of the actual measure of the cost of the furnished facilities in assessing the \"wages\" paid to an employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.33\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Indeed,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.3\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   explains to an employer how exactly to make the determination of reasonable cost where such employer is not already subject to a determination by the Administrator:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Except whenever any determination made under \u00a7 531.4 is applicable, the \"reasonable cost\" to the employer of furnishing the employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale), the fair rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale) shall be the reasonable cost. The cost of operation and maintenance, the rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good accounting practices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   These provisions clearly indicate that the Administrator, in interpreting Section 203(m), did not intend to impose upon employers an obligation to petition the Administrator for a determination of reasonable cost as a prerequisite to claiming the wage offset permitted by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Regulations such as these are generally accorded substantial deference.\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

Here, the statute provides that the Administrator is to make determinations of the reasonable cost of furnishing employees with board, lodging, or other facilities. However, the statute does not provide guidance to the Administrator regarding how such a determination should specifically be made. In filling that gap, the Administrator permitted employers, subject to strict guidelines, to make their own determinations of reasonable cost where, as here, there has been no prior determination by the Administrator. The Court cannot conclude that these regulations are arbitrary or contrary to the statute. Further, Plaintiffs have cited no case law to support their argument that the failure to petition the Administrator for a determination of reasonable cost works as an absolute bar to a claim of offset.

Plaintiffs base their argument on two facts: first, that RHA does not provide lodging to its other, non-live-in employees; and second, that no other known housing authority within the United States provides lodging to employees under a similar live-in program. (Mot. Summ. J. 14-15, ECF No. 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court is not persuaded. Again, Plaintiffs do not cite any case law supporting their position. And neither the language of the statute nor the applicable regulations support so strict a requirement that employers must provide lodging to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of their employees, regardless of the disparate duties associated with different positions, in order to take any credit against wages based on the reasonable cost of such lodging. The far better reading of the statute and regulations-and the reading endorsed in the July 10, 1963 DOL Opinion Letter submitted by RHA-is that it suffices to provide such lodging, regularly and indiscriminately, to all of a particular class of employee. In its Opinion Letter, the Wage and Hour Division advised that lodging satisfies the requirement of being \"customarily provided\" where the employer (Northern Gas Company) provided such lodging consistently, over a period of four years, to a single employee designated as \"master mechanic.\" (ECF No. 110-3 at 3.) In so opining, Division stated: \"The fact that the employer does not customarily furnish houses to all of his employees does not warrant a contrary conclusion.\" The Court agrees. Here, RHA has consistently provided free lodging to all live-in tenants over the course of approximately 28 years. Under these circumstances, the Court rules as a matter of law that the lodging for which RHA claims a wage offset was \"customarily provided\" within the meaning of Section 203(m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

We think a somewhat different approach is necessary, however, in a case such as this one, involving a live-in domestic service employee.

In the Bulletin, the Division cited both\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , discussed above, and\n   <em>\n    Brock v. Carrion, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9205515\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/332/1320/\">\n    332 F.Supp.2d 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Cal. 2004). In\n   <em>\n    Brock\n   </em>\n   , the court based its finding of voluntariness on the fact that the plaintiff signed the employment agreement and never actually asserted that he was coerced into doing so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9205515\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/332/1320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1324 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, there is no question that \"living at or near the site of the work is necessary to performing the job\" of a live-in tenant. It is undisputed that an integral function of a live-in is to be the \"eyes and ears of management\" outside of regular business hours. This requires live-ins to be on call (i.e., \"on premises or close enough to respond within no more than 15 minutes\") from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. every night, and for twenty-four hours a day on weekends and holidays. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement \u00a7 2, ECF No. 83-4.) Mr. Morton testified that the purposes of the live-in position are to ensure management knows what is happening on the property after hours, to deal with emergency situations that arise after hours, and to maintain a presence on-site that will help tenants feel more comfortable after hours. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Morton Dep. 30:8-32:2, ECF No. 85-1.) All of these purposes are best served by a live-in tenant, especially considering that the job requires the employee to be on call for more than sixty consecutive hours each weekend. As was the case in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , RHA was concededly seeking to hire \"live-in\" employees when it hired Plaintiffs. Therefore, as in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , if Plaintiffs understood the live-in requirement when they accepted the job, and if their acceptance of the job was voluntary and uncoerced, then it is idle to inquire whether their initial acceptance of lodging was voluntary and uncoerced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, there is no evidence to suggest that Plaintiffs' acceptance of the live-in position was involuntary or coerced. Again, all the evidence points in the other direction. All of the Plaintiffs testified that they fully understood the Agreement prior to entering into it, and fully deliberated whether the arrangement would be beneficial to them prior to accepting it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 10-17, ECF No. 99.) Mr. Roces actively sought after the live-in position, understood the work he would be expected to do and how he would be compensated, and even testified regarding his initial acceptance of the Agreement: \"[I]t was my decision to sign or not.\" (Roces Dep. 70:10-71:20, ECF No. 87-1.) Subsequently, being fully aware of what the live-in position entailed, Mr. Roces renewed his one-year Agreement four times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:2-14.) Mr. and Mrs. Lopez also voluntarily accepted the Agreement, after initially feeling free to decline the opportunity. (Judith Lopez Dep. 49:18-50:6, ECF No. 89-2.) RHA contacted the Lopezes when the live-in position became available. After first turning it down, the Lopezes later proactively pursued the position by reaching out to RHA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They also renewed their Agreement five times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71:20-23.) Finally, Mr. Villa and Ms. Chavez voluntarily accepted the Agreement as well, after discussing the opportunity with one another. Both saw it as \"a good opportunity\" to save money, and Ms. Chavez testified: \"[O]ur dream was to buy a house, have our credit score fixed.\" (Villa Dep. 56:15-21, ECF No. 92-1; Chavez Dep. 28:12-29:24, ECF No. 94-1.) The live-in arrangement was a chance to achieve those goals. After their first year as live-ins, Mr. Villa and Ms. Chavez continued in the position for another three years. (Villa Dep. 108:14-109:14; Chavez Dep. 55:21-57:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Further, there is no indication that Plaintiffs would have resigned from the live-in position but for coercive conditions imposed upon them by RHA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688658,460180\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/668/1376/\">\n    668 F.2d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, the Lopezes, Mr. Villa, and Ms. Chavez all eventually resigned from the position of their own free will, and Mr. Roces acknowledged that he could have quit at any time, for any reason, simply by giving five\n   days' notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judith Lopez Dep. 73:20-74:16 (moved out to live with daughter and help daughter pay her bills); Villa Dep. 105:8-107:9 (moved out to provide children with more space and different living experience); Roces Dep. 99:6-100:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lastly, the Court notes that the case law Plaintiffs rely upon is inapposite. In their Motion, Plaintiffs cite to\n   <em>\n    Intraworld\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    New Floridian Hotel\n   </em>\n   , the two cases discussed in\n   <em>\n    Lopez.\n   </em>\n   (Mot. Summ. J. 16-18, ECF No. 81.) However, as the court observed in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]mplicit in the courts' decisions in each of those cases was a finding that 'living-in' was not a necessary condition of employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688658,460180\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/668/1376/\">\n    668 F.2d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Such examples include lodging that is substandard or not authorized for residential use, or for which necessary occupancy permits have not been obtained. These examples accord with the Court's understanding of the regulations, and also demonstrate the error in Plaintiffs' argument on this factor. The regulations require that the lodging itself comply with state law, not that lodging in general be a permissible form of compensation under state law. Of course, qualifying for a wage credit under the FLSA is not dispositive of whether any similar credit may be taken under Nevada law; that is an entirely separate question. An employer may well violate state wage-and-hour laws while fully complying with the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have not alleged that the lodging they were provided was itself deficient or unlawful in any way. Furthermore, they have not cited any case law to support the argument that their lodging would be \"in violation of state law\" under the FLSA simply because state law does not permit the same in-kind compensation permitted by the FLSA. And the case law the Court has found strongly suggests that the purpose of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.31\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is merely to ensure that the lodging provided in lieu of wages meets minimum standards for safe, healthful, and lawful housing conditions pursuant to all applicable laws and ordinances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balbed v.

Thus, their situation would seem to fall into the same category as others where the wage offset for housing costs has been disallowed. For example, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Schneider\n   </em>\n   were employed as resident managers of a storage facility in Aurora, Colorado. They agreed, as a condition of their employment, to inhabit an apartment at the facility they managed.\n   <em>\n    Schneider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20322590\">\n    2006 WL 322590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *28. With minimal analysis, the court held the provision of housing primarily benefitted the employer because the plaintiffs were required to live at the facility, their presence \"added an appearance of added security,\" and the arrangement \"allowed both plaintiffs and [the employer] more flexibility in maintaining the facility and allowed plaintiffs time off for slow periods.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20322590\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, however, Plaintiffs have not submitted sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the free housing provided by RHA was not primarily for their benefit. In this case, it cannot be said that Plaintiffs' free housing was a burden imposed upon them in furtherance of RHA's business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550128\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/1104/#p1110\">\n    833 F.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   requirement that Plaintiffs reside on RHA premises was not an incidental condition of their desired employment. On the contrary, free housing was the main attraction in accepting to do the related work. In other words, Plaintiffs did not accept the condition of on-site housing in order to be able to do a job at RHA; they accepted to do a job in order to obtain the substantial benefit of free housing. Indeed, Plaintiffs' own deposition testimony reveals that they knew their only remuneration for doing the work of a live-in would be free rent, and as discussed above, they voluntarily accepted this arrangement. In fact, four of the five Plaintiffs were already residing at their respective RHA apartment complexes, and paying rent, prior to becoming live-ins. Therefore, the apartments they inhabited as live-ins were at least in the same location and of a similar quality and kind as their prior apartments, which they chose for themselves and for which they paid monthly rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Furthermore, this case is distinguishable from others where courts have determined employees did not primarily benefit from free lodging. In\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , an employee was provided temporary sleeping quarters on a boat and in a shore-side station during seven-day periods of duty.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841335\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/406/1302/#p1309\">\n    406 F.Supp. at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Jiao\n   </em>\n   , a hotel employee, who claimed to have been required to remain at the hotel at all times other than Thursday afternoons, was sometimes provided a hotel room to sleep in (when occupancy permitted) and sometimes required to sleep on a sofa in the lobby.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204944767\">\n    2007 WL 4944767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. In\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff rest home employees were given a room at a convalescent center where they worked, although one of them had to remain on premises at all times unless they arranged for a substitute to cover for them.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1978%20WL%201705\">\n    1978 WL 1705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

Again, both the Lopezes and Villa-Chavez were already paying to rent similar apartments in the very same complexes at the time they entered into their first Live-In Agreements. Plaintiffs were free to use and enjoy their apartments to the same extent as any other paying tenant. They were also free to come and go at all hours of the day. During business hours, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, Plaintiffs had no obligation to remain at or near their apartments and had significant liberty in deciding at what time of day to complete their daily grounds inspection. This level of freedom even afforded them the possibility of maintaining other employment while serving as a live-in. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roces Dep. 40:8-22, 220:11-21 (employed full-time at Northern Nevada Veterans Resource Center from October 2012 to August 2014); Villa Dep. 30:6-35:12 (maintained full-time employment elsewhere during \"most of the time\" he was a live-in at RHA); Chavez Dep. 119:22-121:13 (began part-time employment with the Washoe County School District while still a live-in at RHA)). Even during their \"on-call\" hours, Plaintiffs were free to leave the premises, as long as they remained close enough to respond to emergency calls within fifteen minutes. This allowed them to engage in all manner of activities, including coaching in a youth soccer league, playing in an adult soccer league, going out to dinner, attending regular church services, going to the movies, visiting with friends, doing the shopping, and so on. (Villa Dep. 16:19-21:12, 137:12-138:8; Chavez Dep. 123:8-125:6; Judith Lopez Dep. 94:13-20; Juan Lopez Dep. 147:25-148:20, ECF No. 91-1; Roces Dep. 189:15-190:6; Roces Dep. Vol. II 49:9-50:21, ECF No. 88-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In addition, interruptions during on-call hours, the record indicates, were infrequent. Mr. Roces testified that he received two to four emergency calls per month, and that it took an average of thirty minutes to an hour to resolve each call. (Roces Dep. 153:15-18, 156:5-157:4, ECF No. 87-1.) Mr. Roces's \"pocket work orders,\" as well as the call logs of the Answer West answering service, show that he received an average of one call every 10.87 days. (Rosen Report, ECF No. 95-6 at 21-23.) Giving full credit to his deposition testimony, Mr. Roces spent about one hour of on-call time per week responding to emergency calls. The Lopezes received, on average, one call every 4.8 days. (Rosen Report, ECF No. 95-5 at 3.) For each call, the Lopezes completed a work order and recorded the amount of time spent to respond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Juan Lopez Dep. 53:20-24, ECF No. 91-1.) According to these records, each call took between twenty-five and thirty minutes. (Rosen Report, ECF No. 95-5 at 4.) Lastly, Mr. Villa claims he and Ms. Chavez received between ten and twenty calls each month, while Ms. Chavez testified that she remembers receiving approximately twelve calls per month. (Villa Dep. 121:6-19; Chavez Dep. 116:8-14.) In contrast, the Answer West call logs indicate that Mr. Villa and Ms. Chavez actually received an average of one call every 12.7 days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosen Report, ECF No. 95-6 at 54-60.) Giving full credit to Mr. Chavez's deposition testimony, he responded to less than one emergency call per day and spent a total of up to two hours per day performing all his contractual duties under the Live-In Agreement. (Villa Dep. 272:8-273:13, ECF No. 92-2 (one to two hours per day to complete all the duties required by paragraphs 2A through 2C of Agreement).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, the evidence does not support a finding that Plaintiffs' free housing was \"of little benefit\" to them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550128\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/1104/#p1110\">\n    833 F.2d at 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs were provided private residential apartments which they were generally free to enjoy to the same extent as any paying tenant. As the undisputed evidence demonstrates, the significant majority of their time was available to them to use and enjoy their homes as they saw fit. Plaintiffs have voiced no real complaint about the nature, quality, location, convenience, or cleanliness of their accommodations, except that Mr. Roces perhaps thought his three-bedroom apartment was too large (although it permitted him to have family members live with him), and Mr. Villa and Ms. Chavez perhaps thought theirs was too small (although becoming live-ins allowed them to relocate from a two-bedroom unit to a three-bedroom).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Of course, RHA also benefitted from Plaintiffs' presence on the work premises; the very nature of the job required Plaintiffs to be at or relatively close to RHA property during all on-call hours. However, this case is very different from the cases discussed above, where living in employer-provided lodging imposed substantial detriments on the employee. Here, the detriments associated with Plaintiffs' free housing are minor, while the advantages are great. Plaintiffs benefitted from the free housing arrangement at least as much as RHA, if not more so. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not produced substantial evidence to rebut the presumption that the lodging provided to Plaintiffs was primarily for their benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds as a matter of law that the rent-free lodging provided by RHA was primarily for the benefit and convenience of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Whether RHA has maintained adequate records substantiating the cost of furnishing the lodging (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20516.27\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs argue next that RHA is not entitled to a credit for rent-free lodging because RHA failed to \"maintain and\n   preserve records substantiating the cost of furnishing\" such lodging as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20516.27\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 516.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b). Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that RHA was required to \"maintain records showing on a workweek basis\" any deductions from wages. RHA concedes it did not maintain weekly payroll records for Plaintiffs (as it did not view Plaintiffs as employees), but that its failure to do so is not an absolute bar to receiving a lodging credit against Plaintiffs' wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Several courts have analyzed the recordkeeping requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20516.27\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and have ultimately disallowed the lodging credit based, in part, on an employer's failure to maintain adequate records. For example, in a case relied upon by Plaintiffs, the Eighth Circuit denied the lodging credit where an employer \"did not keep the required records and offered no evidence except its own statement as to what the company considered the worth of the [lodging] to be.\"\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

According to the Answer West call logs and the work orders completed by Plaintiffs, the average call frequency ranged from one call every 4.8 days (in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Lopez) to one call every 12.7 days (in the case of Mr. Villa and Ms. Chavez). Even the Plaintiffs' highest call frequency estimate, given by Mr. Villa, was ten to twenty calls per month, or roughly one call every other day. Because Plaintiffs are the nonmovants on this issue, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to them; therefore, the Court will accept Mr. Villa's estimate for purposes of summary judgment. But even the estimate of ten to twenty calls per month pales in comparison to the call frequencies at issue in cases where on-call time was found to be compensable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Renfro v.

Mr. Roces testified that it took thirty minutes to one hour to resolve each call, and that he received two to four calls per month. (Roces Dep. 156:5-8, 157:2-4, ECF No. 87-1.) Therefore, giving him credit for his highest estimates, during his 113 on-call hours each week, he performed a mere hour of actual work in responding to calls. The results are similar for the other Plaintiffs. Mr. and Mrs. Lopez received one call every 4.8 days, and logged their work time for each call, which averages out to 0.44 hours per call. (Rosen Report, ECF No. 95-5 at 3-6.) Therefore, the average time spent by the Lopezes in responding to calls each week accounts for roughly forty minutes of their 113 hours of on-call time. Lastly, Mr. Villa estimated that he and Ms. Chavez received ten to twenty calls per month, and testified that in a \"typical situation\" it took twenty to thirty minutes to respond to an emergency call and fill out all related paperwork.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Villa Dep. 121:6-14, 225:25-228:22, ECF No. 92-1.) Accepting Mr. Villa's high-end estimates of twenty calls per month and thirty minutes per call, he was engaged in work during approximately two hours and twenty minutes of his weekly on-call time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Also persuasive is the undisputed evidence showing that Plaintiffs actually engaged in substantial personal activities while on call. As discussed above, Plaintiffs were able to coach a youth soccer league team, play in an adult soccer league, socialize with family and friends, prepare and eat meals, dine out, shop, attend regular church services, go to the movies, read, watch television, sleep, write poetry, work in the yard, pursue hobbies, and so on, all during their on-call hours. This level of personal activity is similar to other cases where on-call time was held to be non-compensable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540356\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/934/671/#p674\">\n    934 F.2d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (employee able to carry on personal activities at home, shop and dine out);\n   <em>\n    Halferty v.

Thus, it is clear from the record that Plaintiffs did actually engage in personal activities, thereby effectively using on-call time for their own purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Of course, it is true that Plaintiffs were required to live on RHA premises. Thus, the first of the so-called\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   factors tends to fall in Plaintiffs' favor. However, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Armour &amp; Co. v. Wantock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229606\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/126/#p132\">\n    323 U.S. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229606\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/126/#p132\">\n    65 S.Ct. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229606\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/126/#p132\">\n    89 L.Ed. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944) -which is the case cited by the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   court in including an on-premises living requirement as a relevant factor-it is also not actually in dispute that Plaintiffs were free to leave RHA premises during on-call hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The very terms of the Agreement expressly permit it. (Agreement \u00b6 2D, ECF No. 83-4.) Accordingly,\n   the more useful factors in this case are those relating to applicable geographic limitations and call response times. As the Ninth Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   : \"As a practical matter, if an employee is not required to remain on the employer's premises, geographical restrictions are imposed according to the required response time for an employee to return to the employer's premises.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533358\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1174/#p1180\">\n    30 F.3d at 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Here, the Agreement required Plaintiffs to be close enough to RHA premises to respond within ten to fifteen minutes when called. In general, in cases where calls to work are not too frequent, required response times of fifteen to twenty minutes have been held not to be unduly restrictive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armitage v. City of Emporia, Kan.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"36385\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/982/430/#p432\">\n    982 F.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432 (10th Cir. 1992) (twenty minutes);\n   <em>\n    Bright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540356\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/934/671/#p674\">\n    934 F.2d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"approximately twenty minutes\");\n   <em>\n    Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545133\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/653/#p655\">\n    839 F.2d at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (fifteen to twenty minutes). However, the restrictiveness of a ten-minute response time, as required by the earlier version of the Agreement, is a closer question. The Wage and Hour Division, as evidenced in a September 1988 Opinion Letter, has endorsed response times as short as seven minutes, provided that employees are not called back to work on a \"frequent basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cutler Report 9-10, ECF No. 83-10.) However, the Opinion Letter also noted that these employees were firefighters in a small, rural community, \"easily traversed within the 7-minute response time.\" Also, RHA has not cited any case in which a response time of less than fifteen minutes was held not to be unduly restrictive under the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Certainly, a ten-minute response time may very well be too short to support a finding that employees were waiting to be engaged. However, two main considerations persuade the Court to conclude that the response times required by the Agreement were sufficient here. First, under\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   , the Court is not to ask simply how many minutes an employee had to respond to a call. The inquiry is whether, under the particular circumstances of the case, any fixed time limit for response was\n   <em>\n    unduly restrictive.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514755\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/347/#p350\">\n    971 F.2d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the uncontroverted evidence shows that Plaintiffs were, in fact, not unduly restricted from engaging in all manner of personal activities during their on-call hours. Second, the Ninth Circuit requires that no one factor be viewed in isolation, but that all factors be balanced \"to determine whether the employee is so restricted that he is effectively engaged to wait.\"\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533358\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1174/#p1180\">\n    30 F.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the ten-minute response time was not unduly restrictive in light of the facts that Plaintiffs' on-call time was interrupted by calls to work very infrequently, the calls to work consumed a very minimal amount of their on-call time, and Plaintiffs were able to, and did, use their on-call time effectively for their own purposes. After all, that is the dispositive question: An employee's idle time is compensable only when \"the employee is unable to use the time effectively for his own purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514755\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/347/#p350\">\n    971 F.2d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs were not so restricted during their on-call hours as to be effectively engaged to wait by RHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The agreement between the parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \"Another important factor in determining if the on-call time was spent predominantly for the benefit of the employer is whether the policy was based on an agreement between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514755\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/347/#p350\">\n    971 F.2d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this prong of the compensability analysis, the Agreement stands firmly in RHA's favor. The Agreement plainly spells out the precise hours during which live-ins are expected to be on call, and makes it clear that live-ins will be required to respond to all calls received during those hours. In addition,\n   the Agreement states that the only compensation paid to live-ins for their service, including all on-call hours, will be free rent. As analyzed above, Plaintiffs fully understood the Agreement prior to entering into it for the first time. Subsequently, all Plaintiffs, after actually doing the job and seeing what it entails, voluntarily renewed their Agreements over the course of several years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514755\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/347/#p350\">\n    971 F.2d at 354-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Similarly, the Plaintiff mechanics in the present case may not have liked the company's formal call-in system, but by continuing to work, they constructively accepted the new terms.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Accordingly, based on all the foregoing, the Court rules as a matter of law that Plaintiffs were \"waiting to be engaged\" during their on-call hours, and are only entitled to compensation for time spent actually performing work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

While Plaintiffs did not keep records of the hours they worked, they provided estimates related to each of the various tasks they completed. In rebuttal, RHA offers the expert opinions of William Cutler, a former employee of the Wage and Hour Division, who has calculated the Plaintiffs' work time based on various sources, including Plaintiffs' depositions, Plaintiffs' completed work orders, interviews with two other non-party RHA live-ins, and interviews with two members of RHA management. Mr. Cutler's estimates for the time it took Plaintiffs to complete their work diverge somewhat from Plaintiffs' deposition testimony. For example, Mr. Lopez estimated it took him from one to one-and-a-half hours to complete a grounds inspection as required by the Agreement. (Juan Lopez Dep. 66:18-67:9, 105:5-106:6.) However, rather than credit Mr. Lopez's testimony and adopt an average inspection time of 1.25 hours, Mr. Cutler also factors in estimates from non-party live-in John Fuji (he estimated it takes ten hours per week to complete fourteen inspections of the same properties inspected by Mr. Lopez), RHA Asset Manager Walter Dixon (who estimated it\n   should take fifty minutes to do one inspection), and RHA Director of Asset Management Sally Rosen (who estimated it should take thirty to sixty minutes to do one inspection). As a composite of all four estimates, Mr. Cutler applied an average time of 1.01 hours for each inspection Mr. Lopez did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In wage-and-hour cases, the number of hours actually worked by an employee is a question of fact best left to a jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mt.

And while the Court does not believe that Mr. Cutler's methodology is generally unsound, neither the methodology nor the ultimate estimates proposed by Mr. Cutler show Plaintiffs' estimates of their own work time to be clearly unreasonable. Accordingly, at the summary judgment stage, without the benefit of a factfinder, the best approach the Court can take is to give full credit to Plaintiffs' estimates of their actual hours worked. If any Plaintiff's average hourly wage-based on the reasonable cost of lodging divided by the number of work hours-falls above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 after accounting for all estimated work time, the Court will grant summary judgment for RHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

This average does not account for the fact that the Agreement allows for holidays, sick days, and two weeks of vacation each year; rather, it assumes Mr. Roces worked every day. Also, the calculation does not include any work Mr. Roces claims to have done for the resident council, because his own deposition testimony establishes he was not required to do this work under his Agreement, and voluntarily took on these\n   extra responsibilities as a \"favor\" to RHA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 211:14-212:14.)

Based on this valuation, Mr. Roces's average hourly wage during his time as a live-in is estimated to be approximately $9.38 ($873.58 / 93.17 hours = $9.38), well in excess of the federally-required minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Therefore, Mr. Roces has failed to present evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment, and his wage claims under the FLSA must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Also, this calculation likely double counts certain time spent completing paperwork, as Ms. Chavez testified that all paperwork takes her forty-five minutes to complete each day, but several of Mr. Villa's estimates already accounted separately for this paperwork time.

State-Law Wage Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   RHA also requests summary judgment on Plaintiffs' state-law wage claims, essentially arguing that Nevada often resorts to analogous federal law in wage-and-hour matters, and thus this Court should apply the same law to Plaintiffs' state-law claims as applied to their FLSA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The question of whether Nevada employers can satisfy a portion of the state minimum wage requirement with the reasonable cost of providing lodging is a novel one. The parties have not provided, nor has the Court found, any authoritative statement from any court or administrative agency regarding whether this type of in-kind compensation may be used to offset an employer's minimum wage obligation. To support its position that this practice is permitted under Nevada law, RHA cites to NRS 608.115, which reads, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    Records of wages.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   1.

However, this is simply a recordkeeping statute, instructing that an employer's payroll records need not reflect compensation paid to an employee in the form of services, food, housing, or clothing. While it demonstrates the Nevada legislature accepts the general practice of compensating employees with housing, it says nothing about whether the employer's cost of providing housing may be applied as an offset against the employer's minimum wage obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Plaintiffs also discuss NRS 608.155, which clearly permits a wage credit in the case of employer-provided meals, but makes no mention of lodging:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    Meals as part of wages or compensation; exception.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   1.

In no case shall the value of the meals consumed by such employee be computed or valued at more than 35 cents for each breakfast actually consumed, 45 cents for each lunch actually consumed, and 70 cents for each dinner actually consumed....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Plaintiffs argue there is \"no Nevada state law that allows for offsets for lodging or other 'in kind' payments to employees against the State Constitutional minimum wage. NRS 608.155 is limited to meals and does not apply to the constitutional minimum wage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   While NRS 608.155 does not provide a clear answer to the question raised here, its statutory history is relevant and quite informative. The statute that would become NRS 608.155 was originally found in the now-abrogated NRS Chapter 609, pertaining to the employment of women and minors. In 1975, ten years after the Nevada Legislature passed its state-law analog to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Assembly Bill 219 was introduced to eliminate Chapter 609 and merge certain of its provisions into Chapter 608, pertaining to compensation, wages, and hours generally. The bill was inspired by a December 1973 lawsuit brought against the State of Nevada by the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleged that \"certain Nevada statutes (in Chapter 609) require employers doing business in the State to establish and observe conditions of employment for females which are not required for males.\" Fact Sheet and Background Information for A.B. No. 219 at 3, available at https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Division/Research/Library/LegHistory/LHs/1975/AB219,1975.pdf. In preparing A.B. 219, Assemblymen Jean Ford and James Banner noted: \"In 1964, 40 states and the District of Columbia had maximum daily or weekly hours laws for women in specified occupations or industries. By 1973 all states but one (Nevada)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   had repealed the law or modified enforcement in light of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   There is no doubt that Chapter 609 discriminated on the basis of sex. Purposed as a set of \"protective\" labor laws, the Chapter restricted and mandated various practices in the case of women which were not so restricted or mandated in the case of men.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.030\">\n    Nev.

For example, the Chapter limited maximum work hours, mandated overtime compensation at time-and-a-half for all hours above eight in a thirteen-hour period, and required employers to ensure suitable seating, regular meal and rest periods, and a minimum hourly wage.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.030\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 609.040, 609.110, 609.120, 609.130. These same protections were not provided to men. However, women were not generally supportive of Chapter 609 either; the additional obligations it placed on employers made it more difficult for women to be hired in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Most relevant to this case is NRS 609.070, which provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    Payment of wages; food and lodgings as wages.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   2.

(citations omitted) (\"Statutory construction ... is a holistic endeavor. A provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme ... because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\"). In other words, it cannot be presumed that by including this provision in Chapter 609, the Legislature intended not to authorize credits against wages for food and lodging in the employment of men. Certainly, we do not read statutes to prohibit everything they do not expressly permit. Therefore, this type of in-kind compensation was surely permissible in the employment of men, only not subject to the monetary limitations prescribed in NRS 609.070.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   With the passage of A.B. 219 in 1975, paragraph 2 of NRS 609.070 was abrogated, its language was amended, and it was recast as NRS 608.155. The statute reads the same today as when originally enacted. The most, and only, significant change is the removal of any reference to lodging. The import of that change is open to interpretation. For example, it could be said that where a statute authorizes practices A and B, and is then amended to authorize only practice A, practice B is no longer authorized (i.e., is prohibited). However,\n   that conclusion is far less reasonable than the conclusion that the Legislature never felt it needed to authorize wage credits for food and lodging, but rather legislated on these matters purely for the purpose of imposing limitations on the practice, especially when viewed in light of the Legislature's original protective purpose in passing NRS 609.070.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The last piece of this statutory puzzle came last year, in 2017, when the Legislature amended NRS Chapter 608 with the passage of Senate Bill 232, styled as the Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights. The bill added a provision regarding wage credits for lodging, using substantially the same language as NRS 608.155 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   1.

In no case may the value of the lodging be computed at more than five times the statutory minimum hourly wage for each week that lodging is provided to the employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The bill also brought NRS 608.155 into the twenty-first century, by updating the monetary limitations on meal credits which had remained unchanged in the law since 1975.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20608.155\">\n    Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 608.155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (\"In no case shall the value of the meals be computed at more than 100 percent of the statutory minimum hourly wage per day.\"). The bill went into effect on January 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The passage of S.B. 232 lends further support to the Court's initial conclusion that these laws were never intended to authorize the taking of wage credits for food and lodging, but rather to place limitations on a practice that was otherwise generally accepted. These provisions first appeared in legislation designed to protect women in employment, and this latest addition comes in the context of a bill designed to provide greater protections to domestic workers. In the proper context, it makes little sense to read the lodging provisions of S.B. 232 as granting a new advantage to employers; the only reasonable interpretation is that these provisions are intended to help workers (i.e., to place new limitations on a form of compensation already in common usage). Therefore, the Court concludes that there is no Nevada law prohibiting an employer from satisfying a portion of his minimum wage obligation by providing food or lodging. Furthermore, from 1975 to January 1, 2018, there were no state-law limitations on the amount an employer could claim as a wage credit by virtue of providing free lodging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   S.B. 232 perhaps raises an additional question. The new wage credit statute pertaining to lodging, effective this year, limits the credit to no more than \"five times the statutory minimum hourly wage for each week that lodging is provided.\" Therefore, applying a minimum wage rate of $8.25, the maximum weekly credit an employer can now take is $41.25. Of course, RHA claims a much greater credit than that for the years during which Plaintiffs served as live-ins. However, the Court can easily dispose of the issue of S.B. 232's potential retroactive effect. In passing the bill, the Legislature clearly did not manifest an intent that its provisions be applied retroactively. The bill simply provides that it will become effective \"[o]n January 1, 2018, for all ... purposes.\" As the Nevada Supreme Court has noted, this type of statement \"does not even begin to approach the type of express legislative command necessary to rebut the presumption against retroactivity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sandpointe Apts. v.

There is certainly nothing in the Nevada Revised Statutes that would require a departure from federal law on this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v.
