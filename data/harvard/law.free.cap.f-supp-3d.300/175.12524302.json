Withers \"to discuss concerns regarding the process put into place for EEOC's adjudication of Plaintiff's then pending appeals.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 6. Ms. Menoken \"expressed concerns that her pending appeals were vulnerable to compromise because their processing was being controlled by headquarters officials unlikely to be impartial\" due to their involvement in her original 2001 OPM appeals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Ms. Menoken alleges that she had filed a motion with the EEOC requesting a neutral process for her appeals two years before her meeting with COO Withers but it had not been answered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Ms. Menoken informed COO Withers that she was concerned that OPM and EEOC were communicating about her position at EEOC and that she \"had reason to believe EEOC had agreed to monitor [her] work activities to accommodate OPM's demand that [she] not be involved in EEOC matters in which OPM may have an interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Ms. Menoken was concerned that this communication between OPM and EEOC had improperly linked her employment to her protected activity against OPM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Although Ms. Menoken was originally optimistic that her meeting with COO Withers would result in a more comfortable working environment, she later came to believe that those in EEOC headquarters were informed that she was not a valued employee, but instead a legal adversary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 11, 2012, Ms. Menoken requested a meeting with EEOC's Disability Program Manager to discuss her need for a reasonable accommodation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.

(Reasonable Accommodation Request) [Dkt. 8-3] at 000400.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an accommodation, Ms. Menoken asked for paid leave for 6 months or until her appeals were resolved, whichever proved to be longer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Menoken submitted a supportive doctor's letter two weeks later. The doctor diagnosed anxiety and depression since 2005, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) \"caused by cumulative trauma suffered as a result of her efforts to deal with EEOC as both her employer and the adjudicator of claims she\n   filed against the Office of Personnel Management 18 years ago.\" Ex. 2, Mot. (Dr. Kristin Huffer Letter) [Dkt. 8-4]. Ms. Menoken's superiors were allegedly told by COO Withers to delay any response to this request until further notice. Am. Compl. \u00b6 94. COO Withers met with Ms. Menoken in November 2012 to propose a settlement for Ms. Menoken's pending EEO complaints, which included granting in part the requested accommodation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96, but Ms. Menoken rejected the settlement offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, in December 2012, Ms. Menoken contacted the EEOC's Office of Equal Opportunity and later met with an EEO Counselor, as required by federal regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

The history of Ms. Menoken's own EEO activity demonstrates the uncertainty and potential duration of such administrative processing, without regard to later court litigation.

She further alleges that she filed an EEO complaint on September 26, 2014, which complained that the EEOC had violated the Rehab Act by \"disregard[ing] her right to medical privacy as well as her right not to be subjected to unwarranted medical inquiries,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42, and that, in \"early 2014, EEOC arranged for a stranger, not employed by the government, to repeatedly access and review medical information in [Ms. Menoken's Workers' Compensation] file.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The ADA, and by extension the Rehab Act, permits employers to make inquiries into an individual's disability and the nature and severity of the disability, if the inquiry \"is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity\" and relates to \"the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4)(A) and (B).

The problem with this alleged violation of the Rehab Act is one of timing. Ms. Menoken clearly alleges that the documents were considered and accessed without authorization as part of a workers' compensation claim in 2014. However, EEOC's investigation and consideration of Ms. Menoken's Rehab Act reasonable accommodation request began in September 2012, when she originally requested an accommodation, and concluded in April 2013, when the requested accommodation was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Walton Letter. The Amended Complaint includes no allegations to explain why purported unauthorized access to Ms. Menoken's medical records in early 2014 can be tied to EEOC's actions with regard to Ms. Menoken's Rehab Act reasonable accommodation request, which concluded almost a year before the records were allegedly accessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As a matter of logic and law, a later event cannot be the cause of an earlier one.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oetiker v.

A review of Ms. Menoken's Workers' Compensation file in 2014 could not have caused any impact on her request for a reasonable accommodation, almost two years earlier, or its denial, almost one year earlier.

She argues that since EEOC did not move to dismiss those claims, it waives any such arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 12. EEOC replies that the \"interference\" and \"medical inquiries\" claims identified by Ms. Menoken,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, are not cognizable as a matter of law under the Rehab Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4-5. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Qualified employees are entitled to reasonable accommodations and may challenge the result of the process identifying and providing or not providing an accommodation, which Ms. Menoken does here.

The settlement offer by COO Withers, alleged as \"interference\" with Ms. Menoken's rights to obtain a reasonable accommodation, is not cognizable as a separate claim under the Rehab Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ms. Menoken's \"medical inquiries\" claim also fails to constitute a legal claim under the Rehab Act. The statute allows federal employers to make medical inquiries necessary to assess an employee's ability to perform her duties and determine if a reasonable accommodation is available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walton Letter at 000398 (indicating that EEOC requested authorization for limited medical disclosure from Ms. Menoken, but she denied the request). The Amended Complaint includes no allegations that the EEOC made unlawful inquiries into Ms. Menoken's medical history; nor does it identify the provision of the Rehab Act authorizing suit for lawful inquiries. The mere fact that a contract employee accessed Ms. Menoken's file does not constitute a violation of the Act.

The three earlier acts did not involve the same types of employment actions, were not temporally close, and there is no allegation that the same individuals at OPM and/or EEOC were involved. The gap in time between these alleged acts saps them of any relatedness.

To the contrary, Ms. Menoken remained on leave for some additional time with no further complications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the Court finds that the Amended Complaint failed to allege sufficiently severe or pervasive hostile acts that could have interfered with Ms. Menoken's work, as needed to support a claim for hostile work environment, it will not address EEOC's remaining arguments. The Title VII claim in Count One will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and dismiss the Amended Complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Count One will be dismissed without prejudice. Count Two will be dismissed with prejudice. A memorializing Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Page citations to exhibits to EEOC's Motion are to the Bates Number located at the bottom of the exhibits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    An additional flaw in this confidentiality claim is the lack of alleged harm from an unauthorized access to her Workers' Compensation records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
