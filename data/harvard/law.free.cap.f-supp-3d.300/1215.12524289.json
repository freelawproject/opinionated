The decision in\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   was heavily influenced by policy concerns specific to the statute at issue; specifically, a policy of keeping firearms away from domestic abusers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2280, (\"Congress enacted [ 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 922(g)(9) in 1996 to bar those domestic abusers convicted of garden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors-just like those convicted of felonies-from owning guns.\"). The Court was also sympathetic that, at the time the statute was enacted by Congress, \"34 States plus the District of Columbia\" used a \"recklessness\" standard for misdemeanor domestic violence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   I agree with Judge Aiken's recent conclusion that the Ninth Circuit's prior decisions concerning reckless offenses are not \"clearly irreconcilable\" with\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The combination of the Court's policy consideration and severely limited holding, without any mention of the ACCA, does not demonstrate that\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   has effectively overruled this circuit's explicit holdings that ACCA predicate convictions must be intentional or knowing offenses. While\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   may present some \"tension\" with Ninth Circuit precedent, it is not \"clearly irreconcilable\" with those cases excluding reckless conduct as predicate offenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522803\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/284/1152/#p1158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (discussing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   does not mention the ACCA, the purpose and context of the ACCA may well bring Ninth Circuit cases discussing recklessness in that context into harmony with the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   . Because\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   is not \"clearly irreconcilable\" with\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Parnell\n   </em>\n   , those cases remain binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1159.
