(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28.) Swets is an Indiana resident who allegedly placed illegal telemarketing calls to Plaintiff in an attempt to sell Plaintiff insurance from the Foresters Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 29.) The Foresters Defendants allegedly delegated its marketing duties to the co-defendants, and ratified the conduct of the co-defendants by accepting the referrals and sales generated by the illegal calls on behalf of the Foresters Defendants, and actively participated in the telemarketing calls through the actions of its agents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33.) The co-defendants allegedly contacted, and/or caused to be contacted on their behalf, Plaintiff without his prior express written consent within the meaning of the TCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The co-defendants allegedly made autodialed and prerecorded message calls on behalf of the Foresters Defendants, who are legally responsible for ensuring that the co-defendants complied with the TCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 42, 46, 100, 104.) \"Foresters relies on a series of third parties ('Foresters agents') to promote its goods or services.

The Foresters Defendants allegedly knew that the telemarketers violated the TCPA on their behalf and failed to take effective steps within their power to force the telemarketers to cease that conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 47, 101-03.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 53-76.) The Foresters Defendants' agents solicit applications for insurance on the Foresters Defendants' behalf, and the co-defendants did so using pre-recording telemarketing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 61.) The Foresters Defendants directed\n   the quality, timing, geographic location and volume of co-defendants' applicants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2016, Plaintiff allegedly received over 40 unwanted automated calls to Plaintiff's cell phones. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) Many of the calls included the following message: \"Attention all seniors between the ages of 55 and 85 years of age who may not have life insurance or are concerned they may not have enough. You have been qualified for a plan that will never expire and premiums that will never go up. Press 1 now. There are no medical exams for this coverage and you can be insured as early as tonight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 79.) Agents of the telemarketers stated that the website for the company was oraclesig.com. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 80.) On some calls, Plaintiff was able to speak with agents in the call centers and determined that they were all selling final expense life insurance by the Foresters Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 81.) Plaintiff once spoke with an agent named Dave and asked him where he got the leads for these calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 81.) Dave responded, \"I think they go through a dialer,\" and indicated the calls were initiated using an automated telephone dialing system and that some demographic information was input into a dialer system, such as age, income, and state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 81.) Dave also stated, \"Its [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] a computer program we use, and it is programmed to make phone calls. There is nobody else involved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In another call that was a result of an automated telephone call with a pre-recorded message, Plaintiff spoke with Pugh, who was allegedly an agent/employee of IPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 88.) Plaintiff also received a call from Pugh's supervisor at her request and the supervisor indicated that they both worked IPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The supervisor indicated that they had several approved lead vendors for agents/employees of IPA to obtain leads, that IPA purchased leads, which are provided to their agents, indicating that IPA paid the telemarketers directly to call Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.) Pugh indicated to Plaintiff that she purchased leads from Oracle Senior Insurance Group, Inc., and that was the reason why Plaintiff had received a call for life insurance.
