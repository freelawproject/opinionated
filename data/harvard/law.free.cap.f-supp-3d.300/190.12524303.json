Sullivan, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Medicaid is a federal program that helps to cover the costs of providing medical care to qualified individuals. Some hospitals treat significantly higher percentages of Medicaid-eligible patients than others. Because Medicaid does not generally provide the same level of reimbursement as other types of insurance coverage, such hospitals are often at a financial disadvantage. To rectify this disadvantage, and thereby encourage hospitals to serve Medicaid-eligible patients, Congress has provided for supplemental Medicaid payments to such hospitals. The supplemental payments are subject to limits to ensure that no hospital receives payments that would result in a profit, rather than covering Medicaid-related costs to rectify the disadvantage. This case concerns the method of calculating the limit of these supplemental payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Specifically, this lawsuit challenges a final rule that defines how \"costs\" are to be calculated for purposes of determining the limit on the amount of the supplemental payment a hospital serving a disproportionate share of Medicaid-eligible individuals is entitled to receive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medicaid Program: Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments-Treatment of Third Party Payers in Calculating Uncompensated Care Costs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016114\">\n    82 Fed.

That section permits additional DSH payments to certain state-owned hospitals during a transitional period so long as the state certifies that the additional payments are used for \"health services.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(2).

That omission is significant. Indeed, it is well-settled that, \"[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Russello v.
