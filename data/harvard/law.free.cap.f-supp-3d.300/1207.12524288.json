The residual clause defined a \"violent felony,\" in part, as one that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" In\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   , the Court observed that the residual clause required courts \"to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in 'the ordinary case,' and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\" in determining whether certain crimes were \"violent felonies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).

Instead, he was sentenced under \u00a7 924(c), which defines a \"violent felony\" as an offense that is a felony and:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). Clause (A) of this definition is known as the \"force clause,\" and clause (B) is known as the \"residual clause.\" Dawson argues that under the new rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   , the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c) must also be struck down as unconstitutionally vague. Because he filed his claim within one year of this new rule being announced, Dawson argues, his claim is not time-barred. The government responds that Dawson's \u00a7 2255 claim is time-barred under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3) because it was filed more than one year after his sentence became final, and the constitutional rule that he asserts is not the same rule that was recognized in\n   <em>\n    Johnson II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government further argues that, even if Dawson's claim is not time-barred, his sentence was proper because unarmed bank robbery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is a crime of violence under the force clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Thus, any reliance by the sentencing court on \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) was harmless error. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Watson\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that \"bank robbery 'by force and violence, or by intimidation' is a crime of violence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275274\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/782/#p786\">\n    881 F.3d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786 (2017). Although\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   specifically considered whether\n   <em>\n    armed\n   </em>\n   bank robbery is a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c), the holding rested on the conclusion that unarmed bank robbery is also a crime of violence. Because \"[a] conviction for armed bank robbery requires proof of all the elements of unarmed bank robbery,\" the court reasoned, armed bank robbery cannot involve less force than unarmed bank robbery and is therefore a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275274\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/782/#p786\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, any attempt to distinguish unarmed bank robbery from armed bank robbery under\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   would be artificial. Because Dawson's petition must fail on the merits, this Court need not consider whether his petition was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There is, however, some tension in the\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   opinion's claim that \"a defendant may not be convicted [of bank robbery] if he only negligently intimidated the victim,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275274\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/782/#p786\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 785 (citing\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   argued, as Dawson argues in this case, that a defendant who merely negligently intimidated a victim could be convicted of bank robbery. Such negligent conduct, Dawson argues, does not rise to the Supreme Court's requirement that a crime of violence involve \"a higher degree of intent than negligence or merely accidental conduct\" with regard to the \"force\" element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leocal v.

If a conviction for bank robbery by intimidation includes conduct of lesser culpability than a felony committed by the \"threatened use of physical force,\" then under the categorical approach, bank robbery cannot be considered a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v.

When Dawson was sentenced, the rule in the Ninth Circuit was that sentencing courts could not take into consideration the mandatory consecutive sentence imposed under \u00a7 924(c) when calculating the length of the prison term for the predicate crime. In\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that neither 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a), which specifies the factors that courts are to consider in imposing a sentence, nor \u00a7 924(c) itself bars sentencing courts from considering mandatory consecutive sentences when calculating the duration of the predicate sentence. Thus, for example, a sentencing court may sentence a defendant to one day (for the predicate crime) plus 60 months (for the mandatory consecutive sentence under \u00a7 924(c) ) if that sentencing judge finds, taking into consideration all \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such an aggregate sentence is the just one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because Dawson was sentenced under \u00a7 924(c) in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   regime under which the Ninth Circuit restricted sentencing\n   courts' discretion, and because he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion within one year of\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   being announced, Dawson argues that he is entitled to a resentencing hearing.
