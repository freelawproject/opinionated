Engelmayer, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1993, a group of individuals from countries including Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Panama filed a putative class action in Texas state court against a number of\n   chemical manufacturers including, among others, the defendant here, Occidental Chemical Corp. (\"Occidental\"). The plaintiffs had all lived or worked on banana plantations. They alleged that they had suffered adverse health consequences as a result of exposure to a chemical pesticide called dibromochloropropane (\"DBCP\"). In 2010, some 17 years later, after a long train of procedural misadventures, the plaintiffs dismissed their claims voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case was filed in 2011, and, as filed, involved similar claims against substantially the same defendants. The plaintiffs here, however, were not parties to the original 1993 action. Nor are they subject to the 2010 dismissal. They were, however, absent members of the putative class: They are foreign nationals from Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Panama who, like the named plaintiffs in the 1993 lawsuit, allege tortious exposure to DBCP between the 1960s and early 1980s. Their claims against Occidental were transferred to this District in May 2017, following a circuitous procedural path that led from Louisiana (where the case was brought) to Delaware to (as against Occidental only) this Court. Occidental now moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that plaintiffs' claims are time-barred under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court finds plaintiffs' claims timely and therefore denies Occidental's motion. The Court's ruling, however, turns on an important and unresolved question of New York law that has divided courts in this District: whether New York law tolls the statute of limitations for purported class members during the pendency of a class action filed in another state. The Court holds that New York law does provide for such tolling. Therefore, the Court holds, based on the long-running Texas litigation initiated in 1993, plaintiffs' claims were long tolled and are timely today. Further, in the interest of economy, the Court certifies this order for interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Occidental manufactured and distributed DBCP, a pesticide known to cause sterility, sexual and reproductive abnormalities, and cancer. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, 65. Plaintiffs allege that they were exposed to Occidental's DBCP when they lived and worked on or around DBCP-treated banana plantations in Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-68. Because they were never informed of the dangers posed by DBCP, Plaintiffs allege, they did not wear any protective covering or respiratory equipment to prevent exposure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Asa result, they suffered a host of DBCP-related injuries, including sterility and increased risk of cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The procedural history of this case is baroque. The Court first reviews the two-decade-long history of the putative class actions (styled as\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   and, later,\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ) brought by plaintiffs bringing similar claims against defendants including Occidental. As explained, these cases have proceeded in Texas, Costa Rica, and Hawaii; none, however, resulted in the certification of a class. The Court then turns to the procedural history of this lawsuit (\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   ), which arrived in this Court after pit stops in Louisiana and Delaware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Earlier Putative Class Actions in Texas, Costa Rica, and Hawaii\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In August 1993, a putative class action was filed in Texas state court, captioned\n   <em>\n    Carcamo v. Shell Oil Co.,\n   </em>\n   93-C-2290.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSPH \u00b6\u00b6 1-4;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1-4. The\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   complaint sought relief against Occidental and other chemical concerns for the exposure to DBCP of the named plaintiffs and the putative class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4. The\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs proposed to represent a class defined, as relevant here, as \"[a]ll persons exposed to DBCP, or DBCP-containing products, designed, manufactured, marketed, distributed or used by [defendants including Occidental] between 1965 and 1990 in [countries including Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before a motion for class certification was filed or resolved, however, the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   defendants impleaded Dead Sea Bromine, a corporation indirectly owned in part by the State of Israel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7. Dead Sea Bromine then removed the case to federal court, asserting jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   case was assigned to Judge Sim Lake of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. In June 1994, it was consolidated with a related matter, which together were re-captioned\n   <em>\n    Delgado v. Shell Oil Co.,\n   </em>\n   No. H-94-1337. JSPH \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 1994, Judge Lake issued a scheduling order directing the parties to provide,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   their views on class certification, and stating the court's intention to resolve a series of dispositive motions, including any motions to dismiss for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9. Although the plaintiffs never filed a motion for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, their letter to Judge Lake asserted that class treatment would be appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 10. In their response, the defendants disputed that plaintiffs could satisfy Rule 23,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 11; the plaintiffs, in reply, reiterated their position,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 13. Several months later, but before class certification was briefed or decided, defendants moved to dismiss for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 11, 1995, the court resolved the motion to dismiss in a published memorandum and order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado v.

Finally, the Court noted that \"a number of other motions\" were pending.

In April 2001, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. JSPH \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   All the while, parallel litigation was underway in Hawaii. In 1997, a separate set of plaintiffs filed a DBCP class action in Hawaii state court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. The case followed roughly the same procedural trajectory as the\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   action: defendants impleaded Dead Sea Bromine; Dead Sea Bromine removed; the federal district court dismissed plaintiffs' claims on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds; and the plaintiffs appealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-46.

Judge Lake agreed that the permanent injunction was now void. However, Judge Lake denied the motion to vacate the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   dismissal. Judge Lake reasoned that a subsequent change in decisional law did not require vacatur, because the court had had at least an \"arguable\" basis for exercising jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 22 at 8-10. And denying vacatur, he held, would not deny the plaintiffs their day in court given the return jurisdiction clause (which would enable him, as necessary, to remand the case to state court).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 22 at 14. Accordingly, on March 15, 2004, Judge Lake issued another \"Final Judgment,\" this one vacating the permanent injunction and dismissing the action for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the Costa Rican plaintiffs moved before Judge Lake for remand to state court, so that a court of competent jurisdiction could decide whether to reinstate their action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 24. On June 18, 2004, Judge Lake granted the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25. In a memorandum and opinion addressing both the Costa Rican plaintiffs' original 1996 motion to reinstate and their 2004 motion to remand, Judge Lake explained, first, that under the return jurisdiction clause, the court had retained jurisdiction to \"enforce the agreements on which the dismissal was premised and to ensure that an American forum remain[ed] available to adjudicate plaintiffs' claims if and when the highest court of a foreign country dismisse[d] them for lack of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25 at 30. The motion to reinstate, therefore, was \"a direct continuation of the prior proceedings over which the court expressly stated its intent to retain jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nevertheless, Judge Lake held, the court lacked jurisdiction to decide the plaintiffs' motion to reinstate for two reasons. First, review of such a motion was not necessary to enforce the agreements on which dismissal was premised; and second, after\n   <em>\n    Patrickson,\n   </em>\n   no other basis for federal jurisdiction remained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the court lacked jurisdiction, Judge Lake stated, remand would be required so long as the court had not yet issued a \"final judgment\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

And the court had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   issued such a judgment, Judge Lake reasoned, because the 1995\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   dismissal had been \" 'final' only for purposes of appealing the [decision]\"-it had not been \"final\" in the sense of \"extinguish[ing] the court's duty either to continue examining its subject matter jurisdiction over this case, or to remand the underlying cases to state court when and if it determine[d] that it lack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25 at 35-36.

C.P.L.R \u00a7 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -c (personal injury actions arising from exposure to substances are subject to a discovery rule). And it is undisputed that plaintiffs' claims were discovered, and thus accrued, by August 31, 1993, with the filing of the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   putative class action complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 149.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent a toll, plaintiffs' lawsuit\n   would thus have become untimely on August 31, 1996, nearly 16 years before plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on June 1 and 2, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, argue that the limitations period as to their claims was tolled from August 31, 1993 (when the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   complaint was filed) through June 3, 2010 (when the Texas state court denied class certification). A toll of this length would make plaintiffs' June 2012 lawsuit timely. In pursuing such a toll, plaintiffs invoke a doctrine recognized in some states known as \"cross-jurisdictional class action tolling.\" Under this theory, a limitations period is tolled at all times while a complaint based on the same underlying facts is pending in another state on behalf of a putative class that includes plaintiffs as absent members. Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the Texas DBCP litigation and its sequelae, such was the case here at all times during the period for which they seek tolling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 146-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Occidental disputes that tolling is available here, for two reason. First, Occidental notes, the New York courts have not had occasion to hold whether they would recognize the doctrine of cross-jurisdictional class action tolling. Occidental argues that, if presented with the issue, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, would not adopt this doctrine. Second, Occidental argues, even if it is assumed that the New York courts would recognize this doctrine, the claims of plaintiffs here would still be time-barred. That is because, Occidental argues, any such toll based on the Texas DBCP litigation would have been terminated by either the July 11, 1995 dismissal on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds or the October 27, 1995 entry of \"Final Judgment\" that allegedly terminated the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo/Delgado\n   </em>\n   class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court holds with plaintiffs on both points. First, the Court holds, it is most likely that New York would apply cross-jurisdictional tolling. Second, the Court holds, applying that doctrine to the complex circumstances of the Texas litigation on which plaintiffs' claim of tolling rests, plaintiffs' claims were tolled continuously from August 31, 1993 through June 3, 2010, making this action timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(\"\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   did not itself announce any tolling rule applicable to state law claims.\"). States remain free to adopt alternative rules as to whether the pendency of a state-law class\n   action, whether filed within or without the state, tolls the state's statutes of limitation. As a result, a federal court sitting in diversity \"must look to the law of the relevant state to determine whether, and to what extent, the statute of limitations should be tolled by the filing of a putative class action in another jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Casey v.

The court here therefore faces an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   question: whether the relevant state (here, New York) has adopted, or, in the absence of clear authority, would adopt, cross-jurisdictional tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The New York courts have not squarely addressed whether New York law permits cross-jurisdictional tolling. Significantly, New York courts have embraced\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling as to state-law class actions originally filed within New York.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osarczuk v.

In declining to adopt cross-jurisdictional tolling, Judge Scheindlin, for instance, voiced concern that \"extend[ing] the doctrine into a state that has yet to consider it\" would run afoul of the \"general principle that, in trying to determine how the highest state court would interpret the law, we should not create or expand that State's public policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Soward,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198270\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/814/272/#p278\">\n    814 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   281-82 &amp; n.64 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wade v.

Rather, she observed, a federal court's duty is not outcome-driven: It is \"to predict accurately what the high court of a particular state would do in the same circumstance, and we fail equally in this duty when we erroneously dismiss a case that the state courts would sustain as we do when we erroneously sustain a case that a state court would dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Famular,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202470844\">\n    2017 WL 2470844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (\"[T]he Court would be ignoring its duty by adopting a presumption against imposing a legal rule the state courts have not addressed without a reasoned basis for doing so.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This Court agrees. The determinative question is not whether the rule in question would expand or contract a state's public policy as remedies. Rather, the Court is to predict, based on existing law, how the highest court of the forum state would resolve the uncertainty.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bensmiller v. E.I.

New York courts have indeed held that \"tolling provisions [in New York] should not readily be given an expansive interpretation tending to undermine the basic purposes behind the Statutes of Limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4385810\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/55/543/#p548\">\n    55 N.Y.2d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=450%20N.Y.S.2d%20457\">\n    450 N.Y.S.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20N.E.2d%201072\">\n    435 N.E.2d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). But Occidental's argument begs the question of whether recognizing tolling here would undermine those purposes. For the Court to predict whether the New York Court of Appeals would adopt cross-jurisdictional tolling requires assessing, concretely in light of precedent illuminating state policy, whether the tolling of a statute of limitations based on a parallel pending putative class action in a sister state would align with, or offend, New York state policy with respect to statutes of limitation. Contrary to Occidental's suggestion, in cases where state decisional law as to the availability of remedies is as yet unresolved, the Court is not simply to treat the default answer as \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Occidental's stronger argument is on the merits: that New York state policy disfavors adopting a cross-jurisdictional tolling rule. Occidental argues that recognizing tolling in such circumstances would foist upon the state \"a disproportionate share of suits which the federal courts have refused to certify as class actions after the statute of limitations has run.\" Occidental Br. at 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Vincent v. Money Store,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4300915\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/915/553/#p570\">\n    915 F.Supp.2d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bear Stearns,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068721\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/995/291/#p311\">\n    995 F.Supp.2d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). In effect, Occidental argues, adoption of a cross-jurisdictional tolling rule would encourage individual out-of-state plaintiffs who were absent members of a putative class elsewhere to flock to New York following the dismissal or denial of class certification of such cases brought in other states. Occidental further argues that recognizing cross-jurisdictional tolling would invite the possibility of \"unending tolling periods.\" These concerns, Occidental argues, would mark a sufficiently substantial\n   shift in New York public policy as to justify leaving adoption of such a rule, in the first instance, to the New York courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The broader concern Occidental raises about leaving potentially consequential decisions about the scope of state remedies to state courts is valid. \"[O]ur circuit takes a very strong position that state issues should be decided by state courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

For this reason, as explained below, the Court will certify this order for interlocutory appeal, mindful of the possibility that this case may prove an appropriate vehicle for certification to the New York Court of Appeals, and will stay further proceedings here, including the start of discovery, pending resolution of any interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nevertheless, as the case stands, the Court is left \"carefully to predict\" whether the New York Court of Appeals would permit cross-jurisdictional tolling.\n   <em>\n    Chauca v.

On balance, and largely for the reasons stated by Judge Buchwald in\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR-Based Financial Instruments,\n   </em>\n   the Court is persuaded that the New York Court of Appeals would adopt cross-jurisdictional tolling, notwithstanding Occidental's concern that such a rule would make New York a magnet for follow-on lawsuits after failed bids for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   First, and most important, the fact that New York courts have extended the principle of\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling to cover lawsuits originally filed in New York suggests that the Court of Appeals is likely to adopt cross-jurisdictional tolling as well.\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling derives primarily from three principles: \"a class complaint gives fair notice of claims to defendants; a putative class member acts reasonably when he relies on a class action to vindicate his rights; and run-of-the-mill individual suits are disfavored when a class action is viable because too many individual suits would subvert the modem class-action mechanism.\"\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR-Based Fin.

These principles apply with equal force in the context of cross-jurisdictional tolling: \"A class action gives defendants just as much notice of an individual's claims regardless of where each case happens to be filed,\" a putative class member acts no less reasonably in relying on a foreign class action to vindicate his rights than on an in-state class action, and \"denying cross-jurisdictional tolling would, at the margin, encourage parallel, individual litigation while a viable class action is pending.\"\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR-Based Fin.

For as long as the named plaintiffs pursued a live putative class action on behalf of a nationwide class against such manufacturers, the absent class members reasonably anticipated vindicating their rights in that lawsuit. It was reasonable for these class members to stay their hands and to hold off initiating individual actions against each particular manufacturer, whether in New York and/or the other states in which such entities were based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, some lower New York courts have already applied\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20205\">\n    N.Y.

Although such cases do not reveal with assurance how the New York Court of Appeals would respond to a bid by absent class members for a toll in deference to a pending out-of-state class action, they do indicate that New York is not categorically averse to tolling based on a class action pending elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Third, the Court is unpersuaded by Occidental's concern that recognizing cross-border tolling would open the floodgates to New York litigation. To begin with, to the extent that the rule plaintiffs urge carries some risk of inviting lawsuits from absent class members following the demise of an out-of-state class action, the contrary rule of not recognizing a toll in deference to a pending class action elsewhere carries its own risk of incentivizing problematic filings: Such a rule could inspire a profusion of duplicative \"placeholder\" suits intended to preserve as broadly as possible plaintiffs' rights while other class actions remain pending elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR-Based Fin. Instruments,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206243526\">\n    2015 WL 6243526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The DBCP litigation again supplies a good illustration. Courts across the country have had to contend with placeholder DBCP suits, paralleling the existing class actions, filed solely to maximize the likelihood that some forum would one day be available to resolve plaintiffs' claims on the merits. This inefficiency can be justified only if the contrary inefficiency-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a flood of stale, out-of-state claims following the demise of putative class actions in non-New York fora-would impose an equal or greater burden. But Occidental fails to offer even anecdotal evidence that any of the states that have adopted the\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   principle and applied it to cross-jurisdictional tolling\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   have buckled under the weight of such late-in-the-day filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In any event, even if out-of-state plaintiffs were drawn to New York by virtue of a cross-jurisdictional tolling rule, New York already has a mechanism in place to prevent opportunistic filings. As explained above, New York's borrowing rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20202\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides that claims accruing outside of New York cannot be commenced within New York after the expiration of the accrual state's statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that rule, and given the potential difficulties of establishing personal jurisdiction over a defendant, an out-of-state class plaintiff ought to have no special incentive to bring his claims in New York absent a sound factual basis for suing here (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   as alleged here, that New\n   York is a proper forum in which to sue a particular defendant in a multi-defendant case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court is also unpersuaded by Occidental's argument that cross-jurisdictional tolling would invite \"unending\" tolling of statutes of limitations. The same argument of course could have been made in opposition to\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling in general, yet such tolling as to federal claims has been the rule for more than 40 years, without evident ill effects. And this case again illustrates the risks of not recognizing such a toll. Occidental emphasizes the 17-year history of the DBCP litigation, arguing that a cross-jurisdictional tolling rule will embolden absent class members to sleep on their rights, thereby denying defendants reasonable repose. Conceivably such a circumstance could arise-the scenario defendants imagine is not implausible. However, as the Delaware Superior Court observed in a separate offshoot of this dispute, the procedural history of this litigation may support an alternative interpretation. \"[T]he fair reading of the procedural history here,\" it stated, \"is that defendants have attempted to tranquilize these claims through repeated forum shopping removals and technical dismissals, playing for time and delay and striving to prevent, or arguably frustrate, the claims from ever being heard on the merits in any court.\"\n   <em>\n    Blanco v. AMVAC Chem.

Super. Ct. Aug. 8, 2012). To be sure, this Court has had insufficient exposure to the protracted DBCP litigation to similarly comment on defendants' objectives in defending as they have. And it is important to recognize that much of the delay in the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   litigation in Texas, and in haling Occidental before an apt forum in this successor litigation, has been due to defendants'\n   <em>\n    success\n   </em>\n   on various motions in other forums. Nevertheless, the Delaware Superior Court's observation supplies an important reminder that a legal regime that does not recognize cross-border tolling may incent a defendant to pursue delay, so as to run out the clock as to the claims of absent class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that, in all likelihood the New York Court of Appeals would recognize cross-jurisdictional tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether this Action Was Tolled\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having held that New York law permits cross-jurisdictional class action tolling, the Court next considers under that doctrine whether, as plaintiffs contend, the claims here were tolled until June 1, 2009, or whether, as defendant argues, any toll ended sooner. This inquiry, too, is a matter of predicting New York law. But because the Court assumes that New York would adopt the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the Court likewise assumes, along with the parties here, that New York would apply tolling rules similar in substance to those applied in the federal system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    American Pipe,\n   </em>\n   class action tolling persists \"until class certification is denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Crown, Cork &amp; Seal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188175\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/345/#p354\">\n    462 U.S. at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188175\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/345/#p354\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On the contrary, both orders anticipated that the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo/Delgado\n   </em>\n   class action would continue to be pursued, albeit potentially in different judicial fora. The Court therefore holds that absent class members such as the plaintiffs here, following these orders, could reasonably have relied thereafter on the continued maintenance of the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo/Delgado\n   </em>\n   putative class action. The Court addresses these two orders in turn, noting at the outset that neither of these orders addressed the merits of class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The first such order was the July 11, 1995 dismissal on grounds of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   That order \"denied as moot\" all other pending motions, which this Court treats as encompassing a pending\n   motion for class certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Delgado,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7844047\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/890/1324/\">\n    890 F.Supp. at 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the motion for class certification was terminated for reasons other than the merits, and specifically to permit the named plaintiffs to pursue the same lawsuit in more convenient fora (which in fact they did), tends to support that it was reasonable for plaintiffs here to continue to rely on the\n   <em>\n    Carcamo/Delgado\n   </em>\n   putative class action as protecting their interests.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Betances,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262745\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/441/#p457\">\n    144 F.Supp.3d at 457-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling notwithstanding prior dismissals on qualified immunity grounds, including one denying class certification motion as moot; \"[b]ecause the appropriateness of a class action had not been addressed in any of the previously-filed putative class actions,\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling applies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   More important, the July 11, 1995 dismissal order effected only a\n   <em>\n    conditional\n   </em>\n   dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7844047\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/890/1324/\">\n    890 F.Supp. at 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As such, Judge Lake's dismissal order was a far cry from a paradigmatic order that could be taken as implying the impossibility of a future class action, such as an order granting with prejudice a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

In the interest of completeness, however, the Court notes that that action also would have justified a toll during its pendency.
