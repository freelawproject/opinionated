BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless attributed otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the morning June 6, 2014, Plaintiff Eric Brandt (\"Brandt\") was walking along sidewalks in Westminster, Colorado, displaying a sign which he describes as \"a gigantic Styrofoam middle finger emblazoned with the letters 'Fuck cops.' \" (ECF No. 37 at 7 \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; ECF No. 47 at 6-7, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; ECF No. 37-5 at 4-5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This behavior was in keeping with Brandt's conduct on numerous other occasions; as pled in Brandt's Complaint, \"wherever Mr. Brandt goes in Westminster, he carries a very large, handmade sign that reads 'Fuck Cops.' \" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 12.) According to Brandt, he does this to protest police misconduct, and particularly misconduct by the Westminster Police Department (\"WPD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the morning in question, for approximately 30 minutes after leaving his apartment, Brandt was, in his words, \"engaging the public\" with his sign. (ECF No. 37-5 at 4, 13.) Some members of the public, however, were less than thrilled. According to WPD records, at least three separate callers reported Mr. Brandt to the police. As reflected in WPD's report (ECF No. 37-3) and in the audio recording of calls to WPD and WPD dispatch communications (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 38, 40, 37-4), several civilians reported Brandt's sign and conduct as \"offensive,\" \"disgusting,\" and in similar terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The lead investigating officer responsible for taking statements from these complaining witnesses was non-party Officer William Carnes. (ECF No. 39 at 5, \u00b6 10.) Based on the calls and complaints received, WPD dispatched Sergeant Raymond\n   Esslinger and Officer Charles Rush, both Defendants here. Sergeant Esslinger, who knew Brandt from prior interactions, first contacted Brandt at the intersection of 76th Avenue and Sheridan Boulevard at approximately 8:38 a.m., and Officer Rush arrived a few minutes later. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37-3 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While Sergeant Esslinger and Officer Rush were speaking with Brandt, Officer Carnes took statements from the complaining witnesses. (ECF No. 39 at 5, \u00b6 10; ECF No. 43 at 5, \u00b6 10.) After he \"learned through Officer Carnes that probable cause for the charge of Disorderly Conduct existed\" (ECF No. 37-3), Officer Rush served Brandt with a citation for disorderly conduct in violation of Westminster Municipal Code \u00a7 6-2-1(A)(1). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1671396\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/817/83/#p85\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Brandt protested being arrested and taken into custody, and requested that he instead be issued a summons to later appear. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37-5 at 14.) Esslinger and Rush agreed to this, after which, Brandt, in his own words, \"boldly carried [his] sign down the street to [his] house.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) In total, Brandt's interaction with Esslinger and Rush lasted approximately thirty minutes. (ECF No. 37 at 3, \u00b6 1; ECF No. 47 at 3, \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The disorderly conduct charge against Brandt was eventually dismissed. (ECF No. 39 at 6, \u00b6 19; ECF No. ECF No. 37-5 at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiffs may have standing even if they have never been prosecuted or actively threatened with prosecution.

Thus, the Court finds it clear that under an authoritative limiting construction, the language of \u00a7 18-9-106(1)(a) applies only to \"fighting words.\" The question then becomes whether the same limiting construction applies equally to Section \u00a7 6-2-106(1)(a). Since the Westminster ordinance directly mirrors the state statute, using identical language, the Court sees no reason why the limiting construction explicitly applied to \u00a7 18-9-106(1)(a) does not also apply to Westminster's Section 6-2-106(A)(1), thus protecting against any municipal prosecutions that reach beyond the \"fighting words\" limitation, and saving the ordinance from overbreadth.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Although Brandt protests that Defendants cite \"no authority for the proposition that state court decisions interpreting other ordinances and statutes should give a separate and distinct ordinance a limiting construction\" (ECF No. 50 at 11), the Court rejects the view that Section 6-2-1(A)(1) is a prohibition that is materially \"separate and distinct\" from \u00a7 18-9-106(1)(a). Logic, judicial economy, and established principles of statutory interpretation and state-municipal relationships all dictate that the limiting construction which prevents \u00a7 18-9-106(1)(a) from being overbroad is equally applicable to Section 6-2-1(A)(1).\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kinder Morgan CO2 Co., L.P. v.

It certainly cannot be the case that if 100 Colorado municipalities each adopted ordinances which in all material respects mirror \u00a7 18-9-106(1)(a) that the Colorado Supreme Court would then need to resolve in 100 separate actions 100 identical claims of overbreadth before the statutory and limiting constructions would apply to the identical language of every one of those ordinances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Lastly, Brandt also points out that Section 6-2-1(A)(1) is not entirely identical to \u00a7 18-9-106(1)(A), because the Ordinance includes an additional phrase indicating that Section 6-2-1(A)(1) applies \"whether or not an actual breach of the peace takes place.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 50 at 12.) Brandt argues this clause \"expands\" the Ordinance's scope to regulate protected speech, and that the limitation to speech which \"tends to incite an immediate breach of the peace\" is in turn nullified by the caveat, \"whether or not an actual breach...takes place.\" (ECF No. 50 at 14-15.) The Court disagrees. The Court reads the final \"whether or not\" clause of Section 6-2-1(A)(1) as at most clarifying the application of the preceding clauses, but not expanding their substantive scope. The Court is unaware of any authority making the First Amendment \"fighting words\" doctrine dependent on an\n    <em>\n     actual\n    </em>\n    breach of the peace, or requiring authorities to wait until actual violence erupts before they may restrict speech that is otherwise permissibly regulated under\n    <em>\n     Chaplinsky\n    </em>\n    . The relevant test is not whether a breach of the peace has\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    occurred, but \"whether the speech was inherently\n    <em>\n     likely\n    </em>\n    to cause a violent reaction.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Klen v.

The uncontroverted evidence establishes that Esslinger and Rush responded to a dispatch call which had reported to them an unknown man allegedly yelling and/or cursing at passersby, without identifying the suspect as Brandt, and without mentioning his sign. Brandt does not claim, and could not prove, that Esslinger or Rush were retaliating against him for his speech, or otherwise violated his rights simply by responding to the dispatch call and making initial contact with him. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 43 at 14-22.) Moreover, as further analyzed below, the evidence cannot establish an unreasonable search or seizure in violation of Brandt's Fourth Amendment rights based on his temporary detention for an investigatory stop while Officer Carnes took statements to determine if Brandt had violated any law.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    , part III.C.2. Therefore the only act\n    taken by Esslinger and/or Rush which arguably could have violated Brandt's rights was issuing him the citation and serving him with a summons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The record establishes, however, that when Officer Rush completed and served the citation on Brandt, he did so exclusively in reliance on Officer Carnes's offsite determination that probable cause existed to cite Brandt for disorderly conduct under Section 6-2-1(A)(1). (ECF No. 37-1 at 3-4, 8.) Other than confirming which sub-part of the disorderly conduct Ordinance to indicate on the citation, Officer Rush did not inquire into the basis for Officer Carnes's determination of probable cause. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4, 8.)

He argues that Rush, and particularly Esslinger, as the supervising officer on scene, who held a higher rank than Officer Carnes, were independently \"responsible for ensuring that Mr. Brandt's arrest was both supported by probable cause and complied with the Constitution.\" (ECF No. 50 at 2.) This argument is unsupported by legal authority and contrary to the fellow officer rule, and Plaintiff's citation to distinguishable cases in which the involved officers knew or should have known their conduct was unconstitutional does not saddle Rush and Esslinger with a duty to second-guess a clear statement of probable cause relayed by another officer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Moreover, Brandt has not cited to evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that it was objectively unreasonable for Esslinger and Rush to rely on Officer Carnes's determination of probable cause. To the contrary, the record is clear that Officer Rush \"learned through Officer Carnes the probable cause for the charge of Disorderly Conduct existed\" (ECF No. 37-3), that Officer Rush \"didn't know the full basis of Officer Carnes' [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] investigation,\" but knew that \"it was alleged that Mr. Brandt was yelling at passing vehicles\" or at passersby, that Officer Carnes \"had several witnesses...willing to testify\" (ECF No. 37-1 at 3), and that Officer Rush \"issued [Brandt] a summons on [Officer Carnes's] behalf\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4). Sergeant Esslinger, who evidently did not speak with Officer Carnes himself, was \"engaged in a lengthy conversation with [Brandt] while Rush and Carnes spoke,\" but was informed, \"[f]rom Officer Rush, all he told me is, I have probable cause to issue him a ticket.\" (ECF No. 37-2 at 5.) Sergeant Esslinger also testified to the effect that it is standard procedure for WPD to \"go off of the investigating officer,\" and that he trusted Officer Carnes (ECF No. 37-2 at 5), while Officer Rush testified that \"[i]t's not uncommon...to act on the probable cause other officers generate\" (ECF No. 37-1 at 8), and that WPD \"often\" or \"typically\" operates by having one officer investigate and other officers rely on that officer's determination of probable cause (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ). All of these facts tend to establish that Rush and Esslinger acted reasonably when they relied on Carnes, and Brandt has no factual argument or evidence to show otherwise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Brandt objects that Esslinger and Rush are not entitled to immunity \"[f]irst and foremost\" because probable cause did not, in fact, exist to \"arrest and cite Mr. Brandt\" for disorderly conduct. (ECF No. 50 at 6.) But even assuming Brandt is correct that Carnes's probable cause determination\n    was flawed, that is exactly the situation in which the fellow officer rule shields Esslinger and Rush from liability.\n    <em>\n     Baptiste,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358911\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1252/#p1260\">\n     147 F.3d at 1260\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is simply not the case that because Esslinger and Rush did not observe Brandt breaking any law after they arrived, that they were obligated to second-guess whether he had done so before, as Carnes determined he likely had, based on speaking to witnesses not at the scene and unknown to Esslinger and Rush. Likewise, while Brandt cites to the WPD case report and dispatch records to argue that there was never probable cause, or indeed any report of unlawful conduct (as opposed to citizens complaining Brandt's conduct was \"offensive\" or \"disgusting\"), those records were not in Esslinger and Rush's possession at the time Brandt was cited, and their content was not known to them. The Court cannot hold that Rush and Esslinger were obligated to second-guess Carnes's police work based on facts unknown to them at the time, and on the statements of witnesses with whom they did not communicate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Since there is no genuine dispute that Esslinger and Rush did not know the facts that led to Officer Carnes's probable cause determination, and Brandt has no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that it was objectively unreasonable for them to rely on Officer Carnes in this circumstance, there was no reason why a \"reasonable official in [their] shoes would have understood that he was violating\" Brandt's rights.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Knopf\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516250\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/939/#p944\">\n     884 F.3d at 944\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

First, he argues that the very existence of Section 6-2-1(A)(1) demonstrates a municipal policy of criminalizing speech protected by the First Amendment. Having\n    rejected Brandt's facial challenges to the Ordinance, the Court must also reject this theory of municipal liability, since the Ordinance is not, in fact, unconstitutional on its face.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Second, Brandt argues that Westminster \"has a policy practice or custom of criminalizing Mr. Brandt's protected speech and violating his First Amendment rights,\" also phrasing this as \"a demonstrable custom, pattern, and practice of arresting [Brandt] for engaging in First Amendment activity.\" (ECF No. 37 at 10, 23.) In support, he points to numerous instances in which he has been cited or arrested by WPD in connection with what he claims was protected speech (specifically, twenty-four times, according to Brandt's own count). (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 37-5 at 24.) The evidence also reflects that Brandt was known (directly or indirectly) to Esslinger, Rush, and Carnes, based on his regular practice of displaying his \"fuck cops\" sign(s) around Westminster. The audio recording of the dispatch caller who fielded citizen complaints on June 6, 2014 also reflects that Brandt was well known to WPD. Indeed the dispatch employee stated WPD is \"always very aware of what [Brandt] is doing and when, and agreed with one caller that \"unfortunately\" although Brandt's sign and conduct were \"offensive both to us [\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    WPD] and...[to] everyone else in the area,\" that \"it's his freedom.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 38 at ~00:06-2:55.)

A jury might also credit the evidence, including the testimony of Sergeant Esslinger and Officer Rush, tending to show that while WPD officers are well aware of Brandt, his conduct, and his First Amendment advocacy, they have been directed to treat him \"just like every other citizen.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 37-2 at 6;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 37-1 at 6.) A jury crediting this evidence could thereby reject Plaintiff's municipal liability claim(s).

(ECF No. 39 at 6-11.) Specifically, Defendants argue that Esslinger and Rush\n    \"had reasonable suspicion to warrant an investigatory stop [of Brandt\"] (ECF No. 39 at 8), and that any detention of Brandt was \"justified at its inception...limited in length..and reasonable\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 11).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Brandt responds that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because he was \"seized, or arrested,\" and \"even subjected to a nonconsensual pat-down search,\" without probable cause to justify this seizure. (ECF No. 43 at 15.) Further, Brandt maintains that \"[t]he sole basis for arresting Mr. Brandt was his display of his 'Fuck Cops' sign...which offended a number of...citizens,\" and that \"First Amendment-protected activity cannot form the basis for probable cause.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The Fourth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, provides: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\" U.S. Const. amend.

The police can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity 'may be afoot,' even if the officer lacks probable cause. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the detaining officer must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.

While Defendants concede that Brandt was not free to leave during this interaction, they argue\n    that the resulting seizure was \"justified at its inception, extremely limited in length of time and reasonable.\" (ECF No. 39 at 11.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Court agrees with Defendants that on the undisputed facts, Brandt cannot establish a Fourth Amendment violation by showing an unreasonable seizure, and therefore summary judgment is warranted against this claim. Even viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to Brandt, the record establishes that Officers Esslinger and Rush had reasonable suspicion to investigate whether Brandt was engaged in criminal activity, including the possibility that he had been yelling at passersby in a manner criminalized by Westminster and\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    protected by the First Amendment (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that Brandt had been using \"fighting words\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Brandt's counter-argument is primarily that there was never probable cause to detain him. (ECF No. 43 at 14-22.) This argument misses the mark because the Court finds the controlling question is not whether there was probable cause, but whether there was reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop, and whether that stop remained reasonable. The Court finds that there was, and thus the nature of the seizure which occurred was not unreasonable, as a matter of law. Initially, there seems no basis to claim that Brandt's constitutional rights were violated as soon as WPD dispatched officers based on citizen complaints, an action which might have led only to a consensual encounter. \"An officer is free to approach people and ask questions without violating the Fourth Amendment.\"\n    <em>\n     Oliver\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455911\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/1179/#p1190\">\n     209 F.3d at 1186\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Given the citizen complaints of Brandt's behavior, the Court concludes that Esslinger and Rush's dispatch and initial contact with Brandt was justified at its inception.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Beyond that, the question is whether the interaction with Sergeant Esslinger and Officer Rush while Officer Carnes was investigating whether Brandt had violated any law was unreasonable. The Court concludes it was not. Although a pat-down search was conducted of Brandt, it is well-established that officers may do so as a safety precaution, even assuming Brandt did not consent.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Rice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5744627\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/1079/#p1084\">\n     483 F.3d 1079\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1084 (10th Cir. 2007).\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Further, Brandt himself characterizes his interaction with Esslinger as \"cordial,\" and \"nonconfrontational,\" and it is undisputed that Rush played a mostly-silent backup role, hardly speaking with Brandt until he served him the summons. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 37-5 at 11, 12-13, ; ECF No. 37-1 at 4.) Thus there is no indication of improper intimidation, coercion, or harsh treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Finally, while in other circumstances a stop of approximately 30 minutes would be near the outer temporal limits permissible for a\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    stop, here the record reflects that a substantial portion of that time occurred\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    Brandt had been informed that he would be arrested, and while he then \"pleaded\" (in his own words) to instead be issued a summons. (ECF No. 37-5 at 13.) Esslinger and Rush eventually agreed to this request, after which Brandt, again in his own words, \"boldly carried [his] sign down the street to [his] house.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16.) Brandt's own characterization is that the interaction before he was told he would be arrested lasted only about 15 minutes, during which time Officer Carnes was offsite speaking with multiple complaining witnesses, investigating whether any crime had been committed. (ECF No. 37-5 at 14; ECF No. 39 at 5, \u00b6 10.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Given this timeframe, the fact that Brandt was never physically restrained, and the fact that, although he was subject to arrest, Brandt was ultimately allowed to walk home on his own, the Court finds that the relevant Fourth Amendment seizure amounted to an investigatory stop, and remained reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes as a matter of law. Brandt, focusing his arguments on the lack of probable cause, does not argue that Defendants lacked reasonable suspicion to justify the investigatory stop, and his primary argument regarding its unreasonableness is addressed to its temporal length and the fact that he was not free to leave. As analyzed above, the Court finds these arguments unpersuasive and will grant Defendants' Motion for summary judgment against this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Malicious Prosecution\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    In the Tenth Circuit, \"a \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim includes the following elements: (1) the defendant caused the plaintiff's continued confinement or prosecution; (2) the original action terminated in favor of the plaintiff; (3) no probable cause supported the original arrest, continued confinement, or prosecution; (4) the defendant acted with malice; and (5) the plaintiff sustained damages.\"\n    <em>\n     Wilkins v.

In any event, Brandt has no evidence to carry his burden of showing the disorderly conduct prosecution was dismissed in a manner \"indicative of innocence.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 43 at 29-30.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Defendants are therefore also\n    entitled to summary judgment against Brandt's malicious prosecution claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    4.\n    <em>\n     First Amendment Retaliation Claim\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, Brandt must establish: (1) that he engaged in constitutionally protected activity, (2) that the defendant's actions caused plaintiff to suffer an injury that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity, and (3) that the defendant's adverse action was substantially motivated as a response to the plaintiff's exercise of constitutionally protected conduct.\n    <em>\n     Perez v.

Defendants argue, in cursory fashion, that Plaintiff cannot prove any of these elements and that they are entitled to qualified immunity against this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Brandt, while Esslinger and Rush are individually entitled to qualified immunity, a reasonable jury could find that Brandt has proven all the necessary elements of this claim, including the elements needed to establish municipal liability under\n    <em>\n     Monell.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Defendants first argue that \"there is no evidence that Rush or Esslinger contacted [Brandt] because of his participation in any constitutionally protected activity,\" and that Plaintiff therefore cannot meet the first element of his claim. (ECF No. 39 at 12.) This argument is misdirected, and confuses the first and third elements of the claim, at least as to a claim directed at Westminster, rather than at Rush and Esslinger individually. The question is whether Brandt was engaged in constitutionally protected activity, and there seems little dispute that at least part of Brandt's activity-both on June 6, 2014 and before-amounted to engaging in free speech, regarding topics of public concern, and within public for a. Moreover, Brandt has evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that Westminster, and in particular officers and employees of WPD, knew that Brandt's anti-police sign and speech were protected expression under the First Amendment. At a minimum, the evidence is sufficient to defeat summary judgment on the question of whether Brandt was engaged in constitutionally protected speech on and/or before June 6, 2014.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    As to the second element, whether Defendants caused Brandt to suffer an injury likely to chill the protected speech activities of \"a person of ordinary firmness,\" Defendants argue that Esslinger and Rush \"issued a citation because of [Brandt's] conduct toward public citizens and the reasonable belief that [Brand's] conduct was unlawful,\" and that Brandt therefore cannot sustain his claim on this element. Defendants' argument confuses the question of\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    Brandt was cited with the distinct question of whether the citation caused him an injury consistent with \"chilling\" protected speech or expression. The issue on this element is whether Defendants caused an injury to Brandt, and whether it was of a type that would \"chill\" or deter an ordinary person from future constitutionally-protected expression. It is undisputed that Brandt was charged with a crime, faced a fine or jail time, and spent some months defending against that citation before it was ultimately dismissed. A reasonable jury could find this sufficient to deter an ordinary person from expressing themselves in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Lastly, Defendants argue that \"the undisputed evidence establishes that the officers acted based on Plaintiff's behavior and probable cause established by [Officer Carnes],\" and were\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    motivated in response to Brandt's protected speech. (ECF No. 39 at 13.) Here, as with the evidence that could support Brandt's required showing of a municipal policy or custom, a reasonable jury could infer from Brandt's past history with the City of Westminster, and with WPD and even Sergeant Esslinger in particular, that WPD's conduct towards Brandt was, in fact, motivated as a response to Brandt's display of his \"Fuck cops\" sign, on this particular day and/or in the past. Further, because a jury might agree with Brandt that the citizen reports regarding his conduct amounted to no more than complaining of \"offensive\" or \"crude\" speech, well short of punishable \"fighting words,\" the jury could also agree with Brandt that Officer Carnes's determination of probable cause for a violation of Section 6-2-1(A)(1) was unfounded or pretextual, permitting a reasonable inference that Carnes, and perhaps other members of the WPD, did in fact seek to retaliate against Brandt and his \"Fuck cops\" message. More generally, the Court strongly disfavors granting summary judgment on issues of motive or intent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Randle v.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Brandt has explicitly pled two separate claims: first, for an as-applied direct violation of his First Amendment right to free speech, and second, for retaliation motivated by his protected speech. Unlike the single, and evidently somewhat muddled claim asserted in\n    <em>\n     Ramos\n    </em>\n    , and unlike the plaintiff's failure there to articulate the applicable test and elements, Brandt here clearly articulates two parallel claims. While they are certainly closely related, and even if Brandt's retaliation claim may be a better fit to the facts, the Court cannot summarily determine that Brandt's as-applied First Amendment claim is not cognizable or must fail as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Genuine Issues of Fact Remain\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    As with Brandt's retaliation claim, a reasonable jury could find in his favor on his as-applied First Amendment challenge. It is undisputed that Brandt was speaking in a public forum, specifically a sidewalk, and in relation to an issue of public concern. Moreover, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Brandt, a reasonable jury could agree that the witness reports regarding his speech fell short of showing any criminal conduct, reflecting only that a handful of citizens complained to the police because they were\" offended\" or \"disgusted.\" Because a jury could therefore agree with Brandt that the \"issuance of a citation and summons...[was] a content-based or view-point-based restriction on speech,\" and thereby a \"denial of his right to free speech\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 45-46), Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment against this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    However, even assuming that Officer Carnes or other Westminster employees violated Brandt's First Amendment rights, a reasonable jury could also agree with Westminster that this was not done pursuant to any municipal policy or custom. Therefore, given that Defendants Esslinger and Rush are entitled to qualified immunity, Brandt is also not entitled to summary judgment in favor of this claim. The Court therefore need not address whether a genuine factual dispute remains as to any other material issue or element of this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
