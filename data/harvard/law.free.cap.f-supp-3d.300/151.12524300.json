It is well established that a plaintiff's choice of forum is entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    Trout Unlimited\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650429\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/13/#p16\">\n    944 F.Supp. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That deference is entitled to less weight when (1) the forum has \"no meaningful ties to the controversy,\" or (2) the transferee forum has \"substantial ties\" to the plaintiff, such as when the plaintiff resides in the transferee forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650429\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/13/#p16\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Onyeneho v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3765014\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/466/1/#p5\">\n    466 F.Supp.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (D.D.C. 2006). In this case, Jalloh's choice of forum is entitled to slightly less deference because he resides in the District of Maryland, albeit in Bladensburg, quite near the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 2. But the deference is still substantial because, as described above, the District of Columbia has meaningful ties to this controversy. In contrast, the defendant's choice of forum ordinarily does not receive deference.\n   <em>\n    Mahoney v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803312\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/545/123/#p127\">\n    545 F.Supp.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (D.D.C. 2008). Moving Defendants have not shown that this is an extraordinary case where their choice of forum should receive deference, and so this factor weighs against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The third factor weighs slightly in favor of transfer. Claims \"arise\" under \u00a7 1404(a)\"where most of the significant events giving rise to the claims occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p28\">\n    918 F.Supp.2d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, there is no doubt that significant events occurred in the District of Columbia, as described above. On the other hand, the core event that gave rise to three of the four claims asserted by Jalloh-his alleged beating by the officers-took place in Maryland. As such, this factor tilts in favor of transfer, but only slightly given the significant events that occurred in the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, as Moving Defendants concede, Transfer Mot. at 7, the remaining factors-the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and the ease of access to sources of proof-do not weigh in either direction due to the proximity of the two jurisdictions at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Onyeneho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3765014\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/466/1/#p5\">\n    466 F.Supp.2d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]ecause Maryland and the District of Columbia are in close proximity, the convenience of the parties would not be greatly affected whether this action remains in the District of Columbia or is transferred.\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Liban v. Churchey Group II, L.L.C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9260219\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/305/136/#p142\">\n    305 F.Supp.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the \"close proximity\" of the District of Columbia and Maryland minimizes inconvenience).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Public-Interest Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The public-interest factors the Court can weigh include: (1) the transferee court's familiarity with the governing laws; (2) the relative congestion of the calendars of the transferor and transferee courts; and (3) the local interest in having local controversies decided at home.\n   <em>\n    Trout Unlimited\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650429\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/13/#p16\">\n    944 F.Supp. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each of these factors is neutral here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The first factor weighs neither for nor against transfer because Jalloh asserts constitutional claims. \"[A] transferee federal court is competent to decide federal issues correctly.\"\n   <em>\n    Liban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9260219\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/305/136/#p142\">\n    305 F.Supp.2d at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Moving Defendants concede this factor is neutral. Transfer Mot. at 8. Moving Defendants concede that the second factor is neutral as well, and they cite no data to suggest that one docket is significantly more or less congested than the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9260219\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/305/136/#p142\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v. Am. Institute of Physics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217163\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/322/28/#p35\">\n    322 F.Supp.2d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35 (D.D.C. 2004) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moving Defendants argue that the third factor-the local interest in having local controversies decided at home-cuts in favor of transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. The Court does not agree. Undoubtedly, when a case \"[touches] the affairs of many persons\" in a district, \"there is reason for holding the trial in their view and reach rather than in remote parts of the country where they can learn of it by report only.\"\n   <em>\n    Pres. Soc. of Charleston v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277935\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/49/#p57\">\n    893 F.Supp.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (D.D.C. 2012) (alteration in original). But when both districts have strong, roughly equal interests in deciding a controversy, this factor weighs neither for nor against transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p28\">\n    918 F.Supp.2d at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that local interest factor did not weigh heavily for or against transfer because both districts had strong interests in resolving case against company that conducted business within their borders). That is the case here. Both the District of Columbia and Maryland communities have equally strong interests in adjudicating claims of wrongdoing against their police officers. To the extent that Maryland's interest may be considered slightly greater because the alleged assault occurred there, its interest is counterbalanced by the District of Columbia's related interest in ensuring the integrity of its justice system, which is implicated because Jalloh claims to have been falsely prosecuted here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Undaunted, Moving Defendants argue that Maryland has a stronger interest, and cite three cases in which courts in this District transferred cases, in part because local interests heavily favored transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transfer Mot. at 8. But those cases are easily distinguishable. In each of them, the District of Columbia was relatively unaffected by the events at issue, and the transferee districts were heavily impacted. Thus, the other district's interests dramatically outweighed the District of Columbia's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Onyeneho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3765014\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/466/1/#p5\">\n    466 F.Supp.2d at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring case to the District of Maryland because of its interest in regulating treatment of employees who worked there almost exclusively);\n   <em>\n    Liban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9260219\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/305/136/#p142\">\n    305 F.Supp.2d at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring case to the District of Maryland because of its interest in resolving Fair Housing Act claims against real estate company incorporated there and related to property located there);\n   <em>\n    Trout Unlimited\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650429\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/13/#p16\">\n    944 F.Supp. at 19-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring case to the District of Colorado because of its interest related to a decision made by a federal official in Colorado impacting the forests, water systems, wildlife, and people there).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In sum, the private and public factors for and against transfer balance approximately\n   equally. Jalloh's choice of forum weighs against transfer, and the location of where the claims arose weighs slightly in favor. The other factors are neutral. Given this balance, Moving Defendants have not carried their \"heavy burden\" to show decisively that the interests of convenience and justice favor transfer.\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435375\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/196/21/#p31\">\n    196 F.Supp.2d at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
