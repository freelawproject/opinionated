The alleged basis for liability is (1) that the serving law firm used its name on the return address; and (2) that a glassine window on the envelope used for the recipient's postal address allowed a viewer to see the designation \"Defendant(s)/Respondent(s),\" which is part of the Michigan SCAO form of subpoena. The Court recognizes that the FDCPA potentially covers a wide range of \"unfair and unconscionable means\" of debt collection. This is not one of them. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. (ECF No. 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Weber &amp; Olcese, P.L.C., (\"W &amp; O\") is a law firm. It was engaged by a client to collect a debt from Plaintiff. (ECF No. 1, PageID.2.) W &amp; O mailed to Mr. DeCraene a copy of a subpoena and order to appear and/or produce served on U.S. Bank Home Mortgage in connection with a lawsuit pending in Michigan state court. (ECF No. 1-2, PageID.12.) W &amp; O's name and address appear in the upper left corner of the envelope. (ECF No. 1-1, PageID.10.) The envelope has a glassine window through which Plaintiff DeCraene's name and address, and the words \"Defendant(s)/Respondent(s), are visible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also visible through the glassine window are a small \"v\" beside the Plaintiff's name, the word \"Ionia\" above the small \"v,\" and a phone number. Plaintiff contends that the markings violate the FDCPA's prohibition on using language or symbols on an envelope indicating that the contents concern debt collection. (ECF No. 1, PageID.4-6.) Plaintiff asserts no independent claim against Defendant Portfolio Recovery Associates, L.L.C. (\"PRA\"), arguing instead that PRA bears vicarious liability because it hired W &amp; O.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FED.

Ill. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff contends that including W &amp; O's name on the envelope violates section 1692(f)(8) because, in Plaintiff's view, the name of the law firm-Weber &amp; Olcese, P.L.C.-indicates that it is in the debt collection business. Plaintiff argues that even if the firm's name on its face does not necessarily connote a debt collection business, it still violates the statute because a simple internet search would reveal that W &amp; O collects debts. This argument lacks merit. The words \"Weber &amp; Olcese, P.L.C.\" do not on their face bespeak debt collection. The firm's name is innocuous. W &amp; O's name differs qualitatively from names other courts have found do violate the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keasey v. Judgment Enforcement Law Firm\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:13-CV-420,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201744268\">\n    2014 WL 1744268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Mich. April 30, 2014) (finding that the name \"Judgment Enforcement Law Firm\" above the return address on the envelope violated section 1692f(8) because \"[a] person viewing the mailing, including the least sophisticated consumer, could reasonably conclude that a law firm dedicated to enforcing judgments is in the debt collection business.\");\n   <em>\n    Rutyna v.

Ill. 1979) (finding that the name \"COLLECTION ACCOUNTS TERMINAL, INC.\" above the return address on the envelope violated section 1693f(8) because the name indicates that the corporation is in the debt collection business.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even if Plaintiff is correct that an internet search would yield information about W &amp; O's debt collection work, this is not enough to show a violation of the statute. The statute does not mention internet searches or other research, and Plaintiff has not identified any legal authority that supports his claim that the Court should look beyond the name on the envelope to research results linked to the name. To the contrary, courts have rejected similar \"attempt[s] to add a research element into the unsophisticated consumer calculus....\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v. MRS BPO, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15C2303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204326900\">\n    2015 WL 4326900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. July 15, 2015). The Court finds no basis to read a research element into the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that the visibility of the small \"v\" beside the Plaintiff's name, the word \"Ionia\" above the small \"v,\" and the words \"Defendant(s)/Respondent(s)\" above the Plaintiff's name violates the statute. The Court disagrees. Courts repeatedly have found that section 1692f(8) excepts \"benign language\" and permits innocuous markings that do not reveal they pertain to debt collection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goswami v. American Collections Enterprise, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214152\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/488/#p493\">\n    377 F.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 493-94 (5th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    Strand v.

Cal. 1991) (finding that the phrase \"Personal and Confidential\" on the envelope of a collection letter did not violate section 1692f(8) ). The markings Plaintiff challenges in this case are benign, because they do not signal debt collection. The \"Defendant(s)/Respondent(s)\" language and other markings indicate nothing more than an interest in litigation, not the existence of a collection action against the recipient. Moreover, the literal reading of section 1692f(8) Plaintiff urges would yield \"bizarre and idiosyncratic results.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed. Home Loan Mortg.

Under such a reading, \"a debtor's address and an envelope's pre-printed postage would arguably be prohibited, as would any innocuous mark related to the post, such as 'overnight mail' and 'forwarding and address correction requested.' \"\n   <em>\n    Strand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9210207\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/316/#p319\">\n    380 F.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
