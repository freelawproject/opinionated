Mann, Vicki Mann, and William K. Mann III filed a second amended complaint bringing claims for medical malpractice and wrongful death arising out of a failure to diagnose lung cancer in the decedent, William K. Mann Jr. (\"Mr. Mann\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 58.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held a bench trial on August 7, 2017, through August 9, 2017. At the trial, Plaintiffs called two expert witnesses: Dr. Jordan L. Haber, an expert in radiology; and Dr. Ronald H. Blum, an expert in oncology and internal medicine. Plaintiffs also called Vicki Mann, Mr. Mann's surviving spouse, and Donnell Raysor, a family friend, as well as Mr. Mann's four children: Christina M. Mann, William K. Mann III, Marcus D. Mann, and Alice A. Mann. The Government called Dr. Richard Sullivan, who was Mr. Mann's primary care physician at the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Rome, New York. Additionally, excerpts of two depositions were played for the Court: one of the decedent, Mr. Mann, and the other of Dr. John C. Sandborn, a radiologist who was employed by the Syracuse VA Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Having reviewed the parties' pre-trial submissions, the trial transcript and exhibits, and the parties' post-trial briefs, the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Ex. 2 at 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   10. Plaintiffs' radiology expert, Dr. Haber, testified that given Mr. Mann's history of smoking the radiologist reviewing his chest x-ray should have been looking for lung cancer, which can present as either a \"coin lesion\" or a \"spiculated lesion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   11. Mr. Mann's May 25, 2011 chest x-ray showed a 1.5 centimeter nodular density in the upper left lobe of his lung.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   12.

Dr. Haber and Dr. Ronald Blum, Plaintiffs' oncology expert, testified that the lesion present in Mr. Mann's May 25, 2011 x-ray indicated that Mr. Mann had cancer and that a CAT scan was required in order to prove otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    at 37, 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   14.

According to Dr. Blum, Mr. Mann had Stage 1A lung cancer at the time of his May 25, 2011 chest x-ray, and he would have had a seventy percent chance of survival at five years through surgical treatment alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 237.

Once again, the Government did not provide an expert witness to contradict Dr. Blum's testimony. However, in its post-trial brief, the Government argues that Rome Hospital's failure to diagnose Mr. Mann's lung cancer in January 2014-just six months before he was eventually diagnosed-was an \"intervening causal event.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 75 at 3-4. The Court disagrees. Dr. Blum testified that Mr. Mann already had Stage IV metastatic cancer when the x-ray was taken in January 2014, and the Government provided no expert medical testimony contradicting Dr. Blum's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Government contested liability at trial and in its post-trial brief, but it would have been prudent for the Government to admit liability. The Government did not call a single witness to refute liability. In the Court's view, the medical malpractice of the defendant is flagrant, totally below any acceptable level of care, and in this case it was fatal. The attempt by the Government to argue that Rome Hospital's similarly unacceptable failure to diagnose the lung tumor was an intervening cause is disingenuous, as the actual diagnosis of lethal lung cancer was made only six months later and Plaintiffs' expert stated that at the time Rome Hospital performed the chest x-ray, Mr. Mann's diagnosis was already Stage IV metastatic cancer. At that time, the Court concludes that Mr. Mann was already a dead man walking. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs proved their claim of medical malpractice and wrongful death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

Conscious Pain and Suffering\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   After his diagnosis in July 2014, Mr. Mann lived for approximately twenty months until his death in March 2016. Over the course of those twenty months, Mr. Mann endured enormous pain and suffering. He underwent radiation to the spine and brain, as well as several rounds of chemotherapy; he was admitted to the hospital numerous times for back pain, stomach pain, and general weakness; he suffered extreme pain due to bone metastases ; and Mr. Mann was forced to use a wheelchair. In addition to his many physical symptoms, Mr. Mann also showed signs of emotional suffering and the mental\n   anguish of impending death; he became isolated, sad, exhausted, and angry. Mr. Mann lived day after day with no hope. Despite all of that-and despite Mr. Mann's pre-existing depression and mental health problems-he expressed that he wanted to take every step to preserve his life for as long as possible. Mr. Mann requested additional chemotherapy even when it was very unlikely to help, and he asked to be intubated and resuscitated even though such measures would ultimately be futile. Although Mr. Mann had a substance abuse problem, he was honest about those issues, he was confronting them, and he continued living his life and caring for his children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In comparable cases, plaintiffs have been awarded a range of damages awards for conscious pain and suffering.

The Government states that the federal government has already paid for Mr. Mann's medical expenses-either through Medicare, the VA, or CHAMPVA, a comprehensive health care benefits program administered by the VA-and the Government therefore will not reimburse Mr. Mann's medical expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.
