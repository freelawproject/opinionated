The motion is fully briefed. Based on the moving papers, and for the reasons below, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this putative class action, Plaintiffs allege the following relevant facts. Plaintiffs are East African refugees who currently are, or formerly were, employees of Defendants Bristol Bay Corporation (\"BBNC\"), Glacier Technical Solutions, LLC (\"GTS\"), and Workforce Resources, LLC (\"Workforce\"). (FAC, ECF No. 5 at \u00b6 2.) BBNC is an Alaskan Native Corporation based in Anchorage, Alaska. (FAC \u00b6 30.) BBNC wholly owns GTS and Workforce. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) BBNC \"operates as a joint employer with GTS and Workforce ... by sharing or codetermining policies, human resource functions, management functions, and more.\" (FAC \u00b6 30.) GTS and Workforce maintain offices in Oceanside, California. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants contract with the Department of Defense to train Marines in foreign cultures. (FAC \u00b6 3.) In doing so, Defendants employ East African refugees, on a \"temporary, part-time, and sporadic\" basis, to \"role play\" as residents of a foreign nation as a way to accustom American soldiers to African cultures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs \"performed most of their work on various U.S. military bases, particularly but not exclusively on Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, California,\" but \"also worked off military bases, particularly but not exclusively in and near\" GTS and Workforce's shared offices outside of Camp Pendleton. (FAC \u00b6 7.) Plaintiffs are from extremely poor communities and are mostly \"Somali Bantu immigrants who were driven from their homeland of Somalia by civil war and terrorism that began 25 years ago and continue to today.\" (FAC \u00b6 4.) Few understand English, most are illiterate in their native language, and \"[m]ost or perhaps all\" live below the federal poverty line. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the complaint, \"[t]he Defendants have a consistent and pervasive history ... of treating East African role-players less favorably than role-players who are not East African,\" such as employees of Iraqi, Afghani, or Filipino descent. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9.) This differential treatment \"was and is advanced and effected\" by Site Manager Habit Tarzi, and \"adopted and endorsed by other management employees including\" General Manager Carol Giannini, Scheduling Manager Weston Giannini, Assistant Site Manager\n   Atiq Hamid, and Deputy Project Manager David Tarzi. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These decisions were \"made and effected\" from \"locations outside military bases\" including GTS and Workforce offices in Oceanside and Anchorage, Alaska. (FAC \u00b6 8.) When employees complained of the disparate treatment and harassment, Defendants worsened their actions and threatened the employees with termination. (FAC \u00b6 9.) Between December 2015 and February 2016, East African role players filed claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (FAC \u00b6 10.) The East African role players also filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") on July 12, 2016, alleging violations of protected concerted activity. (FAC \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this action, Plaintiffs categorize themselves into three putative classes: (1) East African refugees from Somalia, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Burundi (the \"East African Class\"); (2) female East African refugees (the \"Female Class\"); and (3) Muslim East African refugees (the \"Muslim Class\"). (FAC \u00b6 13.) With respect to the East African Class, Plaintiffs allege that \"Defendants engaged in a continuing policy and practice of discrimination and harassment based on race, color, and national origin ... by denying them terms and conditions of employment that were as favorable as those provided to non-East African Class members,\" including \"subjecting members of the East African Class to daily or near-daily insults, ridicule, scorn, mockery, and other disparagements direct towards their race, color, national origin, language culture, and traditions\"; requiring East African Class members to \"perform janitorial duties that were outside their job description ... for the benefit of Defendants without compensation\"; denying East African Class members \"promotional opportunities, rest and meal breaks, drinking water, food and snacks, and transportation\"; and retaliating against the East African Class members for complaining about this adverse treatment. (FAC \u00b6 14.) With respect to the Female Class, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \"engaged in a continuing policy and practice of discrimination and harassment based on gender/sex ... by denying them terms and conditions of employment that are as favorable as those provided to Female Class members,\" including \"subjecting members of the Female Class to daily or near-daily insults, ridicule, scorn, mockery, and other disparagements directed toward their gender/sex\"; \"refusing to allow members of the Female Class to wear traditional clothing but allowing non-Female Class members to wear traditional clothing\"; requiring Female Class members to \"perform stereotypically female cleaning and housekeeping duties not within their job description ... without compensation\"; denying Female Class members \"promotional opportunities to the same extent and in as favorable a manner\" as non-Female Class members; and retaliating against Female Class members for complaining about their adverse treatment. (FAC \u00b6 15.) With respect to the Muslim Class, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \"failed to provide [them] religious accommodation ... as required by law, and engaged in a continuing policy and practice of discrimination and harassment based on religion .. by denying them terms and conditions of employment that are as favorable as those provided to non-Muslim Class members,\" including \"subjecting members of the Muslim Class to daily or near-daily insults, ridicule, scorn, mockery, and other disparagements directed toward their religion and religious practices\"; \"failing to provide religious accommodation to members of the Muslim Class but allowing such accommodation to non-Muslim Class members\"; and retaliating against Muslim Class members for complaining\n   about their adverse treatment. (FAC \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the following claims: (1) race discrimination and harassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"); (2) color discrimination and harassment in violation of Title VII; (3) national original discrimination and harassment in violation of Title VII; (4) race discrimination with respect to the making, performance, and termination of contracts in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (5) gender/sex discrimination in violation of Title VII; (6) religious discrimination and harassment (including denying a religious accommodation) in violation of Title VII; (7) race discrimination and harassment in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\"); (8) color discrimination and harassment in violation of FEHA; (9) national original discrimination and harassment in violation of FEHA; (10) gender/sex discrimination in violation of FEHA; (11) religious discrimination and harassment (including denying a religious accommodation) in violation of FEHA; (12) failure to prevent discrimination and harassment in violation of FEHA; and (13) retaliation in violation of FEHA.

Title VII's Applicability to Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants contend first that Plaintiffs' Title VII actions must be dismissed because BBNC is an Alaska Native Corporations (\"ANC\") and, as such, it and its wholly owned subsidiaries are not governed by Title VII. The Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act (\"ANCSA\") establishes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [f]or the purposes of implementation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ], a Native Corporation and corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, or affiliates in which the Native Corporation owns not less than 25 per centum of the equity shall be within the class of entities excluded from the definition of \"employer\" by section 701(b)(1) of Public Law 88-352 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Stat.%20253\">\n    78 Stat. 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), as amended [ 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b)(1) ], or successor statutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201626\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). In other words, Title VII does not apply to ANCs and their wholly owned subsidiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to the FAC, BBNC is \"an Alaskan Native Corporation.\" (FAC \u00b6 30.) BBNC is therefore not governed by Title VII's requirements and prohibitions. Moreover, according to the FAC, GTS and Workforce are both \"wholly owned subsidiar[ies\n   ]\" of BBNC. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Because GTS and Workforce are \"affiliates in which the Native Corporation owns not less than 25 per centum of the equity,\" GTS and Workforce are also excluded from the definition of \"employer\" under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pratt v. Chenega Integrated Sys.\n   </em>\n   , No. C 07-01573 JSW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202177335\">\n    2007 WL 2177335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. July 27, 2007) (dismissing Title VII claims because the defendant \"is at least 25% owned by a Native Corporation,\" and plaintiff did not contest that status).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs respond by asserting that Defendants have \"waived\" their exclusion from the definition of employer under Title VII by signing an agreement with the Department of Defense. (ECF No. 10 at 5-11.) This argument lacks merit. Parties cannot amend a statutory provision via contract. They can, of course, agree on terms in a contract paralleling the requirements and prohibitions of a statute. But even if Defendants' contract with the federal government commits Defendants to a nondiscrimination policy mirroring Title VII, Plaintiffs would not be able to seek legal redress\n   <em>\n    through\n   </em>\n   Title VII; instead, Plaintiffs would have to rely on a different source of law for their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202177335\">\n    2007 WL 2177335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3-4 (rejecting plaintiff's claim that the defendant waived its exemption from Title VII by including an \"Equal Employment Opportunity Statement\" in its employee handbook because \"a party thus designated cannot waive a statutory exemption or create subject matter jurisdiction\"). Because the FAC clearly and exclusively invokes Title VII as the source of law under which Plaintiffs sue for Counts One, Two, Three, Five, and Six, those claims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The FEHA Claims' Timeliness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' FEHA claims are untimely. Under FEHA, an individual must bring a civil action against the employer within one year of the date the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (\"DFEH\") issues a right-to-sue notice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012965\">\n    Cal.

Rptr. 3d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757 (2013) (\"This code establishes a strict 'one-year statute of limitations, commencing from the date of the right-to-sue notice by the [DFEH],' except for certain statutory exceptions.\"). This limitations period is tolled, however, when the following three \"requirements have been met\": (1) \"[a] charge of discrimination or harassment is timely filed concurrently with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [ (\"EEOC\") ] and the [DFEH]\"; (2) \"[t]he investigation of the charge is deferred by the [DFEH] to the [EEOC]\"; and (3) \"[a] right-to-sue notice is issued to the person claiming to be aggrieved upon deferral of the charge by the [DFEH] to the [EEOC].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20749\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12965(d)(1). These three conditions were met here. The right-to-sue notices sent by the DFEH to Plaintiffs indicate that their complaints were \"being dual filed with\" the DFEH and EEOC; the EEOC would be \"responsible for the processing\" of the complaint; and \"[p]ursuant to [ \u00a7 12965(d)(1), Plaintiffs'] one-year period [to file FEHA claims] will be tolled during the pendency of the EEOC's investigation.\" (ECF No. 7-4, Exs. 34-49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The time for commencing an action for which the statute of limitations is tolled under [ \u00a7 12965(d)(1) ] expires when the federal right-to-sue period to commence a civil action expires, or one year\n   from the date of the right-to-sue notice by the [DFEH], whichever is later.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20749\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12965(d)(2). Here, the \"later\" of the two deadlines discussed in \u00a7 12965(d)(2) was Plaintiffs' federal deadline. The DFEH issued right-to-sue notices to Plaintiff Deh on January 4, 2016; Plaintiff Abikar on January 5, 2016; Plaintiff Muganga on January 7, 2016; Plaintiffs Awmagagan and Mohamed on February 2, 2016; Plaintiff Madende on February 24, 2016; and Plaintiffs Musa and Somon on February 26, 2016. (ECF No. 7-4, Exs. 34-49.) Based on the dates of Plaintiffs' DFEH right-to-sue notices recited above, the state statute of limitations for Plaintiffs to file their FEHA claims expired no later than February 26, 2017, one year after the last right-to-sue notice was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' federal deadline came later. The EEOC issued all Plaintiffs individual right-to-sue notices on February 14, 2017. (ECF No. 7-4, Exs. 17-32.) Federal law requires an individual to file suit under Title VII \"within ninety days after the giving of [an EEOC right-to-sue] notice.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). That time period begins \"from the date on which a right-to-sue notice letter arrived at the claimant's address of record.\"\n   <em>\n    Payan v. Aramark Mgmt. Servs. Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563840\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1119/#p1121\">\n    495 F.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1121 (9th Cir. 2007). The Ninth Circuit applies a rebuttable presumption that an individual received an EEOC right-to-sue notice three days after it was mailed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563840\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1119/#p1121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563840\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1119/#p1121\">\n    at 1125-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There being no suggestion that Plaintiffs received their notices earlier or later than three days after the EEOC issued its notices, the Court applies this presumption and assumes that Plaintiffs received the EEOC's February 14, 2017 right-to-sue notices on February 17, 2017. To meet the federal deadline, Plaintiffs had to file suit no more than 90 days after the date of their receipt, which was May 18, 2017. Because the federal deadline (May 18, 2017) was later than the state deadline (February 26, 2017), the federal deadline governs under \u00a7 12965(d)(2). Plaintiffs filed this suit on May 18, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) Plaintiffs therefore filed their original complaint prior to the expiration of the deadline set forth in \u00a7 12965(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There is, however, an additional complication. While Plaintiffs filed the original complaint before the expiration of the period to file their FEHA claims, that original complaint asserted\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   federal claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1.) It was not until October 6, 2017, that Plaintiffs amended their complaint to include FEHA claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 5.) Defendants argue that this fact renders Plaintiffs' FEHA claims untimely because \"[c]ourts have repeatedly determined that bringing Title VII claims under federal law does not toll FEHA claims under state law, and vice versa.\" (ECF No. 7-1 at 15.) The two cases Defendants cite, however, do not support that proposition. Defendants first cite\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Defendants offer no compelling reason why FEHA would not apply to Plaintiffs' work performed outside of a federal enclave. As the FAC states, Plaintiffs engaged in work outside of Camp Pendleton:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The East African employees performed most of their work on various U.S. military bases, particularly but not exclusively on Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, California. The East African employees\n   <em>\n    also worked off military bases, particularly but not exclusively in and near the shared offices of defendants GTS and Workforce, and outside the gates of Camp Pendleton.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (FAC \u00b6 7 (emphasis added).) Defendants respond first by arguing that it is \"implausible\" that Plaintiffs would \"be summoned to an administrative location to perform hours of office work\" in light of the fact that Plaintiffs mostly cannot speak or read English. (ECF No. 17 at 9.) The FAC, however, does not allege that Plaintiffs were summoned to non-enclave offices for \"office work.\" For example, the FAC states that Defendants forced Plaintiffs, on a discriminatory basis, to perform unpaid janitorial work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15.) It is\n   also plausible that Plaintiffs performed their normal role-playing work at GTS and/or Workforce offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants also suggest that the federal enclave doctrine bars FEHA claims even if \"portions of [Plaintiffs'] work occurred off-base.\" (ECF No. 17 at 9.) In essence, Defendants suggest that there is an established \"de minimis\" rule within the federal enclave doctrine, which instructs that so long as\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   of a plaintiff's work is performed within the boundaries a federal enclave, state law also is inapplicable to work performed outside the enclave. But the cases Defendants cite do not support this theory. Defendants first cite\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   , in which the plaintiff argued that the federal enclave doctrine was inapplicable to her claims because her \"termination was decided and implemented at respondent's headquarters\" outside of a federal enclave.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20206\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rejecting that argument, the court explained that the plaintiff \"was, at all relevant times, employed by a federal contractor\n   <em>\n    working on a federal enclave.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20206\">\n    at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, by contrast, there is more than the assertion that employment decisions were made outside of the enclave-Plaintiffs allege that they also\n   <em>\n    worked\n   </em>\n   outside of the enclave. For the same reason, this case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Powell v.

They do not, however, address the issue of the federal enclave doctrine's applicability to an employee's work performed outside of the enclave. Because \"the plaintiff's place of employment\" determines the applicability of the federal enclave doctrine, it appears that where Plaintiffs performed their work is crucial in determining the doctrine's applicability. In the absence of any authority supporting a de minimis rule suggested by Defendants, the Court is persuaded that the federal enclave doctrine does not bar Plaintiffs' FEHA claims to the extent they are premised on work Plaintiffs performed outside of Camp Pendleton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The plaintiff was later terminated for failing to follow protocol, a reason that was-according to the plaintiff-pretext for discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court found these allegations insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1981 because, other than the \"RuPaul\" comment's \"potential\" racial connotation, \"none of the other acts identified by Plaintiff ... appear to have any relation to Plaintiff's race.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Here, again, Plaintiffs have identified a reasonable basis for inferring disparate treatment by identifying harassment pointed solely to their racial group and their being the only racial group forced to engage in unpaid work outside of their job description and denied benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is worth noting, however, that Defendants correctly argue Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1981 claim may be brought only under a theory of disparate treatment on the basis of race. Plaintiffs cannot pursue their \u00a7 1981 claim under theories of religious or sex discrimination, nor can they prove their \u00a7 1981 claim under a disparate impact theory.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gen.

Tenorio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9183443\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/731/#p738\">\n    384 F.3d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (9th Cir. 2004) ( Section 1981\"does not protect against discrimination on the basis of gender or religion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III. General Challenges to the FAC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants include in their motion a section with the heading \"All Defendants Move to Dismiss All of Plaintiffs' Claims Due to Plaintiffs' Imprecise Pleading,\" in which Defendants complain that the allegations in the FAC are too vague. (ECF No. 7-1 at 21-22.) Defendants assert that the FAC does not provide Defendants a reasonable opportunity \"to ascertain (1) which entity each claim is brought against, (2) who was the actor carrying out various alleged actions, (3) against whom Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, and (4) the geographic scope of Plaintiffs' putative claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Defendants alternatively move for a more definite statement with respect to these issues under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e). That rule provides: \"[a] party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The\n   motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the defects complained of and the details desired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court disagrees with Defendants' contention that the FAC is too vague or that Defendants, based on the FAC, do not have a reasonable ability to prepare a response. The FAC makes clear that Plaintiffs are accusing all Defendants of discriminating against them by subjecting them to harassment, forcing them to engage in unpaid work outside of their job descriptions, denying them benefits, and imposing on them stricter clothing standards. Plaintiffs explicitly name supervisors that were primarily responsible for the discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 6 (\"Most of this treatment was and is advanced and effected by management employee Habit Tarzi, Site Manager ... and adopted and endorsed by other management employees including Carol Giannini, General Manager; Weston Giannini, Scheduling Manager; Atiq Hamit, Assistant Site Manager; and David Tarzi, Deputy Project Manager.\").) Requiring Plaintiffs to allege more-such as what was said to Plaintiffs or when it was said-would be tantamount to imposing Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standards.\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198183\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1047/#p1055\">\n    637 F.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055 (9th Cir. 2011) (\"To satisfy Rule 9(b), a pleading must identify the who, what, when, where, and how of the misconduct charged ...\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). As discussed above, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient factual information to raise a plausible inference of discrimination. While general in nature, the allegations are not conclusory-they offer factual allegations indicating that they were treated differently on the basis of their national origin, sex, and religion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheppard v. David Evans &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523608\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1045/#p1049\">\n    694 F.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1049-50 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that plaintiff's \"brief\" complaint alleging disparate treatment, consisting of a few basic facts identifying the grounds of age discrimination, was sufficient to create a \"straightforward\" plausible prima facie case). As Plaintiffs' employers, Defendants are in a reasonable position to investigate Plaintiffs' claims and respond to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court finds it unnecessary to require Plaintiffs to specify in any more definite manner \"against whom Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief.\" The FAC states that Plaintiffs seek \"[a] declaratory judgment that the practices complained of in this complaint are unlawful and violate Title VII and 2[8] U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.\" (FAC, Prayer for Relief \u00b6 6.) This is a routine request that the Court declare the actions alleged in the FAC unlawful. Defendants may ultimately prove that certain individual defendants did not engage in the actions that are alleged in the FAC. That possibility, however, does not render the allegations themselves improperly vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court also disagrees with Defendants' assertion that, to have a reasonable opportunity to respond to Plaintiffs' allegations, Defendants need more specificity about the geographic scope of Plaintiffs' putative classes. This putative class action has not yet proceeded to the certification phase. Defendants offer no authority supporting the assertion that specificity in this respect is necessary at the pleading stage. Rather, \"[t]he permissible scope of the class, if any, is a question best addressed through a motion for class certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Henderson v. J.M. Smucker Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 10-4524-GHK (VBKx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201050637\">\n    2011 WL 1050637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (C.D. Cal. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the same reason, the Court denies Defendants' motion to strike \"Plaintiffs' statements regarding the statute of limitations and all allegations prior to the statute of limitations.\" (ECF No. 7-1 at 22-24.) Defendants assert that it is \"harassing\" for Plaintiffs to craft their putative\n   classes to include employees who have worked for Defendants since 2010. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (\"a class period of more than seven years prior to the filing of this action appears to be an undisguised attempt to gather years of discovery that have no reasonable relation to the claims alleged\").) This again amounts to an attack on Plaintiffs' initial description of their putative classes. At the motion to dismiss stage, what matters is the allegations relevant to the named Plaintiffs, not the scope of an uncertified putative class. Defendants may offer objections to the scope of the putative class when Plaintiffs seek certification, if and when this case reaches that phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court dismisses Plaintiffs' Title VII claims because, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201626\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), Defendants are excluded from the definition of \"employer\" for purposes of Title VII. The court also dismisses Plaintiffs' FEHA claims to the extent they are premised on work performed within the boundaries of Camp Pendleton only. It is clear that federal law does not permit Plaintiffs' claims under Title VII or under FEHA (to the extent the FEHA claims are premised on work performed within the boundaries of Camp Pendleton), and that \"allegations of other facts consistent with the challenged pleadings could not possibly cure the deficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

But, as the court explained, the FEHA claims the plaintiff added were based only on the allegations in her original DFEH charge.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261377\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/19/900/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261377\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/19/900/\">\n     at 908\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Defendants argue that Plaintiffs are \"modify[ing] their allegations to suit their changing needs\" because the FAC asserts that Plaintiffs were hired to work as role players in simulated villages, not for janitorial work.

The fact that Plaintiffs were hired for one purpose does not make it implausible that Defendants later forced Plaintiffs, on a discriminatory basis, to engage in work outside of their job description.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Defendants separately cite\n    <em>\n     Naigan\n    </em>\n    's statement that \"[t]he application of state law to claims that did not arise within California's jurisdiction creates a due process problem.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205278641\">\n     2013 WL 5278641\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2.
