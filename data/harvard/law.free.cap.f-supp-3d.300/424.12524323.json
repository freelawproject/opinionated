He must have some other injury to establish standing, which he does not. Accordingly, Mayor's claims are DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Plaintiff David Mongielo's Claims Are Moot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff Mongielo also lacks standing because he currently holds an unrestricted NYS firearms license. ECF No. 26, at 25. Defendant Judge Murphy suspended Mongielo's firearms license on July 3, 2013, but reinstated it on February 18, 2016. ECF No. 26, at 26. Defendants thus challenge Mongielo's standing under the mootness doctrine. Mongielo contends that (1) NYS's firearms licensing laws are constitutionally invalid pursuant to the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n    561 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ; and (2) Mongielo is under constant threat of having his license suspended again. ECF No. 29, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mongielo's arguments are meritless. First, his conclusion that NYS's firearms licensing laws are unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   is unfounded.\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   , like\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   , makes clear that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is limited and does not grant American citizens \"the right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    554 U.S. at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n    561 U.S. at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   struck down complete bans of handgun possession at home.\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    554 U.S. at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n    561 U.S. at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those cases did not hold that a state's firearms licensing laws were unconstitutional, which is what Mongielo and his co-Plaintiffs argue here. Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   court declined to address a possible licensing requirement for handguns in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    554 U.S. at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, holding that NYS's\n   firearms licensing law is unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   would stretch the conclusions of both decisions well beyond their scope. The Court declines to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, Mongielo's argument that he is under constant threat of having his license suspended again is also meritless. As discussed above, Mongielo does not have standing to challenge NYS's firearms licensing laws when he has an unrestricted NYS firearms license. The very licensing laws that Mongielo seeks to challenge allow him to own firearms. Furthermore, while Mongielo has had his license suspended, the possibility that it will be suspended again is speculative. Mongielo asks this Court to hold NYS's licensing laws invalid because a licensing officer\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   , at an unknown time in the future, decide to suspend Mongielo's firearms license. This alleged threat takes the Court into \"the area of speculation and conjecture,\" which is beyond its jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    O'Shea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716177\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/488/#p497\">\n    414 U.S. at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716177\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/488/#p497\">\n    94 S.Ct. 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Mongielo's claims are DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Plaintiff Cuthbert Has Established an Injury as to the Second and Third Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff Cuthbert lacks standing to challenge NYS's firearms licensing laws regarding at-home possession because he has a limited NYS firearms license that allows him to possess a firearm at home and carry a firearm outside his home for target shooting and hunting. ECF No. 26, at 27-28. Defendants, however, concede that Cuthbert \"may\" have standing to challenge the \"proper cause\" requirement for a concealed carry license.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716177\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/488/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Cuthbert contends that he has standing to challenge at-home possession for the same reasons Plaintiffs Kuzma, Cooper, Rober, Rebmann, Garrett, and Mayor have standing. ECF No. 29, at 5. Cuthbert also asserts that he has standing to challenge the \"proper cause\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716177\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/488/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants, and partially with Cuthbert. Just as Plaintiffs Kuzma, Cooper, Rober, Rebmann, Garrett, and Mayor lack standing to challenge the standards for at-home possession, so too does Cuthbert. Cuthbert cannot challenge a statute that allows him to exercise his right to possess a firearm in his home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Decastro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892473\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/160/#p164\">\n    682 F.3d at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Decastro\n   </em>\n   also dictates that Cuthbert does not have standing to challenge NYS's firearms licensing laws regarding at-home possession merely because he disagrees with them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892473\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/160/#p164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Cuthbert, however, does have standing\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to challenge the \"proper cause\" requirement for a concealed carry license because he established an injury: he applied for the license and was denied.\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky v.

Based on well-established law, Judges Kehoe and Boller were acting in their judicial capacities when they ruled on Cuthbert and Murtari's firearms license applications. First, Judges Kehoe and Boller are authorized to evaluate firearms license applications because they are judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3980208\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/48/347/#p363\">\n    48 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   365 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20265.00\">\n    N.Y.

Here, however, Judges Kehoe and Boller may evaluate firearms license applications because they are judges\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the relevant law grants that authority to judges specifically. Consequently, it would be illogical to find that Judges Kehoe and Boller were acting outside of their judicial capacity.\n   <em>\n    Aron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3980208\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/48/347/#p363\">\n    48 F.Supp.3d at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, Judges Kehoe and Boller's acts carry all the hallmarks of judicial acts: their determinations arose out of an individual case before them, which is the \"principal hallmark\" of a judicial act; a judge normally\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   performs those acts; and Cuthbert and Murtari were dealing with Judges Kehoe and Boller in their capacity as judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Murtari and Cuthbert argue that Judges Kehoe and Boller received\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications in their role as licensing officers in violation of the Judicial Code of Conduct, and they therefore could not be acting in their judicial capacity when deciding firearms license applications. ECF No. 29, at 14. As noted above, however, an informal or\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   proceeding does not strip an act of its judicial character.\n   <em>\n    Bliven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053157\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/204/#p209\">\n    579 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Forrester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600739\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/219/#p225\">\n    484 U.S. at 225-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600739\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/219/#p225\">\n    108 S.Ct. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

However, the court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Aron\n   </em>\n   is thorough and based on well-established Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, provide little or no legal authority to support their arguments. Plaintiffs are correct that the\n   <em>\n    Aron\n   </em>\n   court, based on Northern District of New York precedent, reasoned that a judge authorized to act because she is a judge is therefore acting in her judicial capacity. What Plaintiffs fail to grasp, however, is that this analysis is based on both NYS's firearms licensing laws and the functional analysis framework for judicial acts handed down by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit. Without their own legal authority to counter the substantial case law that Defendants and the\n   <em>\n    Aron\n   </em>\n   court provide, Plaintiffs' arguments must fail. Accordingly, the Court finds that Judges Kehoe and Boller are immune from suit for money damages and injunctive relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   in their individual capacities, and all claims against them in their individual capacities are DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

ECF No. 26, at 51. Notably, they do not challenge Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief. Plaintiffs did not respond to Defendants' arguments. Judges Kehoe and Boller are state officials who enjoy immunity from suits for damages in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    Aron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3980208\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/48/347/#p363\">\n    48 F.Supp.3d at 366-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Included in that category are handguns, which the\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   court noted are \"the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    554 U.S. at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the same reasons, NYS's firearms licensing laws restrict the possession of weapons that are typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. Indeed, under\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   , handguns are the most commonly possessed firearm for the ultimate lawful purpose-defending the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In a footnote, Defendants urge the Court to find that NYS's firearms licensing laws do not burden conduct protected by the Second Amendment. In support, they note that the\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   court\n   <em>\n    assumed\n   </em>\n   , but did not decide, that NYS's concealed carry requirements burdened conduct protected by the Second Amendment. ECF No. 26, at 39 n.22. Moreover, they argue that NYS's licensing laws qualify as a \"longstanding\" regulation that the\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   court determined is \"presumptively lawful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p575\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court is not persuaded. First, Defendants' characterization of the\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   decision is incorrect. The Second Circuit assumed that Second Amendment protections, and the\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   decision, had \"\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   application in the very different context of the public possession of firearms.\"\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710881\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/81/#p85\">\n    701 F.3d at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis\n   in original). The Second Circuit did not reach the question of whether NYS's concealed carry requirements burdened Second Amendment protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Even if Defendants' characterization were correct, requirements for possession of firearms at home carry the highest level of protection under the Second Amendment, a fact noted repeatedly in\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the context in this case is completely different from the concealed carry requirements analyzed in\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, given the framework outlined in\n   <em>\n    NYSRPA\n   </em>\n   , whether NYS's firearms licensing laws are \"longstanding\" or \"presumptively lawful\" is irrelevant at this stage of this analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is required to determine whether the licensing laws burden possession of weapons that are in common use and typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.
