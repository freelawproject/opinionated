(\"SunEdison,\" or the \"Company\") was briefly one of the world's largest renewable-energy companies. As described in the Second Amended Consolidated Securities Class Action Complaint (the \"Complaint\"), from 2014 to 2016, SunEdison's management made a series of disastrous and short-sighted business decisions, many of which grew out of urgent liquidity needs caused by the Company's expansion. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2016,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   According to plaintiffs, while SunEdison scrambled to raise financing, defendants made a series of material misstatements and omissions about the true state of affairs. In August 2015, SunEdison raised $650 million through an offering of preferred shares (the \"Preferred Offering\"). Plaintiffs allege that in connection with the Preferred Offering, material misstatements and omissions were made or approved by management, board members and underwriters, thereby violating sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k, 77\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (the \"Securities Act\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that from August 7, 2014 through April 4, 2016 (the \"relevant period\"), Ahmad Chatila, who was SunEdison's Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Wuebbels, who was its Chief Financial Officer, knowingly made material misstatements and omissions about SunEdison's liquidity and financial strength, resulting in the artificial inflation of the Company's share price. They allege that Chatila and Wuebbels violated sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   All defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs' Securities Act claims, on the basis that the Complaint fails to allege any material misstatement or omission in the offering documents connected to the Preferred Offering. Separately, Chatila and Wuebbels move to dismiss all claims brought under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and urge both that the Complaint fails to allege that they made any material misstatements and omissions and that it fails to raise a cogent and compelling inference of scienter. Finally, defendant KPMG, LLP (\"KPMG\") moves to dismiss the Securities Act claim brought against it in its capacity as SunEdison's external auditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs have identified dozens of statements that they believe are actionable. As will be explained, in nearly every instance, the Complaint has failed to allege that these statements omitted or misstated material information. Corporate mismanagement is not a violation of the federal securities laws. Both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act require factual allegations that show a material misstatement or omission. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\") also requires claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 to be supported by facts that raise a cogent and compelling inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On plaintiffs' Securities Act claims, the Court concludes that the Complaint has alleged that defendants omitted material information about the existence of an August 2015 margin call on a margin loan by the Company, and omitted the existence of a high-interest loan that the Company allegedly took to from Goldman Sachs in order to pay down that margin call. The Court also concludes that, for the purposes of the Securities Act claims, the Company's descriptions of lender recourse available on certain debts owed by SunEdison were so contradictory and confusing that they amounted to a material misstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As to plaintiffs' fraud claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, the Complaint has adequately alleged that defendant Chatila recklessly misrepresented the projected point in time at which SunEdison expected to generate cash. The Complaint otherwise fails to identify a material misstatement or omission that was made with scienter. The Complaint repeatedly fails to connect allegations of corporate mismanagement, including the purported looting of a SunEdison subsidiary, with a reckless misstatement or omission made to investors. With the exception of Chatila's projection about cash generation, the motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lastly, KPMG's motion to dismiss is granted in full. The Complaint has failed to plausibly allege that KPMG misrepresented its compliance with relevant accounting standards when it audited the Company's financial reporting and opined on its financial controls, as set forth in its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Overview of the Parties.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Municipal Employees' Retirement System of Michigan (\"MERS\") is lead plaintiff in this action. (Compl't \u00b6 1.) MERS manages the retirement and employee-benefit plans of approximately 800 municipalities in Michigan. (Compl't \u00b6 18.) It holds $9.3 billion in assets. (Compl't \u00b6 18.) MERS purchased SunEdison's common stock during the relevant period. (Compl't \u00b6 18.) The second named plaintiff, the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (\"ATRS\"), manages retirement benefits for Arkansas's public-school employees, and has $15.5 billion in total assets. (Compl't \u00b6 19.) ATRS purchased shares in SunEdison's Preferred Offering. (Compl't \u00b6 19.) MERS and ATRS purport to bring claims\n   on behalf of those who purchased common stock in SunEdison, sellers of publicly traded put options of SunEdison common stock, and purchasers of preferred SunEdison shares in the August 2015 Preferred Offering. (Compl't \u00b6 1, 535.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the relevant period, defendant Ahmad Chatila was the president and CEO of SunEdison, as well as a director of the Company. (Compl't \u00b6 21.) He was also chairman of the board of SunEdison's two \"YieldCo\" subsidiaries, Terraform Power (\"TERP\") and Terraform Global (\"Global\"). (Compl't \u00b6 21.) Defendant Brian Wuebbels was Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and CFO of SunEdison. (Compl't \u00b6 22.) Wuebbels also was president and CEO of both TERP and Global from November 2015 through March 30, 2016. (Compl't \u00b6 22.) Plaintiffs' claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are brought only against Chatila and Wuebbels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additional defendants are alleged to have violated the Securities Act. Plaintiffs bring Securities Act claims against members of SunEdison's board of directors at the time of the Preferred Offering (the \"Director Defendants\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the underwriters of the preferred offering (the \"Underwriter Defendants\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and KPMG, the Company's outside auditor. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 431-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SunEdison itself is not a defendant in this case, and, as of the date of this Memorandum and Order, is covered by the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Compl't \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Overview of SunEdison's Business.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the relevant period, SunEdison was one of the world's largest renewable energy companies. (Compl't \u00b6 25.) It maintained two separate business segments. (Compl't \u00b6 25.) The first segment, known as a \"DevCo,\" developed new renewable energy projects. (Compl't \u00b6 26.) The second segment is known as a \"YieldCo.\" (Compl't \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The YieldCos included two subsidiaries under SunEdison's control: Terraform Power (\"TERP\") and Terraform Global (\"Global\"). (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 2, 25, 27.) SunEdison formed TERP in July 2014. (Compl't \u00b6 28.) TERP's business focused on economically developed energy markets, including the United States. (Compl't \u00b6 28.) SunEdison formed Global in July 2015, with the intent that its business would focus on developing markets including Brazil, India and China. (Compl't \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The two YieldCos were publicly traded companies that owned completed energy facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl't \u00b6 27.) As the DevCo, SunEdison developed new energy projects, which, once completed, it sold to the YieldCos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Compl't \u00b6 27.) SunEdison exercised control over TERP and Global through ownership of more than 90 percent of their voting shares and by carrying out day-to-day management, accounting and regulatory duties. (Compl't \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   SunEdison's separation of its DevCo business and its two YieldCo spinoffs was explained as a measure that would bring favorable returns to investors. (Compl't \u00b6 30.) The Company's DevCo business expected to generate a steady cash flow from the sale of its completed projects to the YieldCos. (Compl't \u00b6 30.) As public companies, the YieldCos would purchase the DevCo's developments using money raised in stock offerings. (Compl't \u00b6 30.) SunEdison also believed that because the YieldCos functioned as captive buyers for its projects, it could reduce financing costs and \"get superior value for those projects.\" (Compl't \u00b6 30.) In addition, as a major shareholder of the YieldCos, SunEdison would profit from any dividends that they issued. (Compl't \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Overview of SunEdison's Expansion and Collapse.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that after SunEdison adopted its two-tiered, DevCo and YieldCo business model, management undertook a series of disastrous measures that ultimately drove the Company to bankruptcy. The Court will discuss in detail the defendants' allegedly material misstatements and omissions below, but an overview of SunEdison's decline is useful context for plaintiffs' theories of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   From 2013 to 2015, SunEdison pursued an aggressive growth strategy, during which its debt ballooned from $2.6 billion to $10.7 billion. (Compl't \u00b6 32.) The Company went on an acquisition spree. In the summer of 2015, SunEdison announced eleven major transactions, a partial list of which includes the purchase of companies such as Latin America Power Holding, B.V. (\"Latin American Power\") and Continuum Wind Energy Limited; acquisition of wind-power plants in Idaho and Oklahoma; acquisition of a solar-panel installer in the United Kingdom; and construction of a wind-power project in Maine. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) Not all of these acquisitions were consummated, including the planned acquisition of Latin American Power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   SunEdison required significant financing to complete these transactions. As will be discussed, plaintiffs allege that SunEdison's expansion strategy left it with a constant need to obtain additional financing on favorable terms. When the Company did not have ready access to cash, payment to key vendors was delayed or never made. The Complaint alleges that the Company made material omissions or misstatements about the terms of outside funding that it obtained in 2015, including the existence of a margin call on a previously disclosed margin loan, the terms of a high-interest loan from Goldman Sachs, and certain creditors' ability to take recourse against SunEdison itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Complaint highlights two loans obtained by SunEdison. On January 29, 2015, SunEdison took out a $410 million margin loan (the \"Margin Loan\") in order to finance the purchase of First Wind LLC, a company it was jointly acquiring with TERP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl't \u00b6 33.) Under the Margin Loan agreement, SunEdison agreed to the prepayment or the posting of additional collateral in the event that the common stock of TERP fell below a set price. (Compl't \u00b6 34.) On or about August 7, 2015, TERP's share price fell below that threshold, thus triggering a margin call that allegedly\n   sent the Company scrambling for cash. (Compl't \u00b6 332.) Although the Margin Loan had been disclosed to investors, the Company did not publicly acknowledge the margin call until August 25, 2015, one week after the Preferred Offering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Complaint also describes a high-interest, second-lien loan (the \"Second-Lien Loan\") that SunEdison took from Goldman Sachs in August 2015. (Compl't \u00b6 102.) Under this \"secretly negotiated\" loan, SunEdison borrowed $169 million at 9.25% interest, plus an origination fee of $9 million. (Compl't \u00b6 102.) Plaintiffs state that \"this enormously high rate\" and the fact that the loan carried a second lien reflected that SunEdison was a \"cash-strapped\" company whose assets had already been pledged to other, first-lien loans. (Compl't \u00b6 102.) According to the Complaint, the Second-Lien Loan was taken in order to make payments on the margin call. (Compl't \u00b6 118.) Like the margin call, the existence and terms of the Second-Lien Loan were not disclosed in the offering documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 17, 2015, SunEdison announced the Preferred Offering of 650,000 convertible preferred securities priced at $1,000 per share. (Compl't \u00b6 120.) On that same date, SunEdison filed an offering prospectus and a shelf registration statement. (Compl't \u00b6 120.) The Preferred Offering was underwritten by the Underwriter Defendants, and was \"for general corporate purposes.\" (Compl't \u00b6 120.) Plaintiffs' Securities Act claims are based entirely on the offering documents and the documents that they incorporated by reference. According to the Complaint, when SunEdison's financial conditions were fully revealed, the value of these preferred shares dropped from $1,000 per share to $23 per share. (Compl't \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As depicted in the Complaint, some of SunEdison's liquidity problems arose because the Company was plagued by ineffective internal financial controls, which defendants Chatila and Wuebbels certified as effective under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Plaintiffs allege that the Company never integrated the accounting systems of its corporate acquisitions, and that, with no unified accounting system, its employees used a \"piecemeal\" approach that \"made it impossible\" to know what SunEdison owed its creditors. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 70-73.) The Company attempted to consolidate all financial data into a single Excel spreadsheet, which one manager called \"literally the most complicated spreadsheet\" he had ever seen. (Compl't \u00b6 76.) Plaintiffs assert that Excel spreadsheets are not acceptable accounting platforms because they lack input controls, so that one error can generate a domino effect of inaccuracies. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 76-78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Complaint identifies subsequent disclosures that the Company made from August 2015 through April 2016 and the correlated drops in share price, which, plaintiffs allege, reflected the market's reaction to learning the truth about SunEdison's dwindling liquidity. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 123-253.) Among other things, the Complaint also alleges that SunEdison's cash-strapped DevCo business coerced Global into purchasing a project for $231 million, and did so after firing dissenters in Global's management and installing new board members. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 181-214.) In March 2016, the Company announced that it was delaying the filing of its annual 10-K, and acknowledged weaknesses in the Company's internal controls. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 237-44.) On March 28, 2016, the press reported that the SEC had commenced an investigation of SunEdison. (Compl't \u00b6 245-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 21, 2016, SunEdison and 25 affiliated entities filed petitions for bankruptcy protection in the Bankruptcy Court of this District. (Compl't \u00b6 254.) SunEdison\n   claimed more than $16 billion in debt, inclusive of debts held by TERP and Global.

This statement of belief about liquidity over the course of a year, qualified by an acknowledgment of the risk of adverse events, is identified as a forward-looking statement with a\n   cautionary statement identifying risk factors that could alter expected results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77z-2(c)(1)(A)(i).

This language expressly alerts investors that SunEdison will \"need to raise additional funds in the future\" in order to meet operating needs. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 10 at 61.) It makes \"no assurances\" that financing will be available on \"acceptable\" terms, and warns that new financing might not be available at all. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a bolded and italicized passage quoted above, the Company warned that it may not be able to generate cash sufficient to service its debt, and may not succeed in other alternative debt-servicing measures. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 2 at 33.) It warned of \"substantial liquidity problems\" if it could not service its debt. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 2 at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   These warnings to the investing public were \"meaningful cautionary statements\" that \"identif[ied] important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i).

They allege that SunEdison's liquidity problems were known to defendants. According to the Complaint, Wuebbels participated in weekly \"cash calls,\" where SunEdison management reviewed the status of projects and the cash needed for vendor payments. (Compl't \u00b6 65.) Wuebbels allegedly approved all cash distributions to vendors. (Compl't \u00b6 65.) The Complaint also describes a January 2015 call led by Chatila, in which a SunEdison employee said that the Company was about to lose telephone service because SunEdison had not paid its bills, and that suppliers were \"breathing down their necks\" about payments. (Compl't \u00b6 65.) Chatila allegedly replied with a \"rant\" about making sacrifices to rapidly grow the Company. (Compl't \u00b6 65.)

A reasonable investor reviewing filings incorporated into the Offering Documents would have understood that, going forward, SunEdison required a steady infusion of financing from external sources, but that the availability of funding was uncertain. A reasonable investor would have understood that the Company would face dire consequences if outside funding became unavailable.

They include two principal weaknesses: first, the Company failed to integrate the different accounting systems of acquired companies, resulting in a piecemeal, chaotic approach to tracking the Company's finances; second, the Company attempted to consolidate its financial data into an unsecured Excel spreadsheet that contained no input controls and was vulnerable to inaccuracies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Complaint describes complications caused by the Company's use of different accounting platforms across different business divisions. The former Head of Global Field Operations at SunEdison has stated that, going back to 2013, the Company failed to integrate acquired entities and\n   internal divisions into a single system for monitoring financial data, resulting in a \"poorly built system,\" a \"clunky and broken process\" and a \"massive disconnect.\" (Compl't \u00b6 70.) The Complaint quotes a senior auditor of SunEdison as stating that the Company used \"a cluster of different accounting systems that made it a nightmare for any sort of internal controls to be functional.\" (Compl't \u00b6 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Complaint also includes detailed descriptions posed by the consolidation of financial data into a single, unsecured Excel spreadsheet. The Complaint alleges that the Company manually consolidated financial data into a single Excel spreadsheet, a practice that began in or around 2009. (Compl't \u00b6 76.) The former Head of Global Field Operations called the document \"literally the most complicated spreadsheet\" he had ever seen, and said that it was internally referred to as the \"Brain Damage\" spreadsheet.\" (Compl't \u00b6 76.) A senior auditor has stated that use of the Excel document was \"a huge problem because Excel has very little security around it\" and the document lacked \"any sort of IT controls.\" (Compl't \u00b6 78.) There were no input controls to ensure that data was correctly entered by code and category, or to flag likely errors. (Compl't \u00b6 78.) According to the Complaint, this meant that incorrect entries could go unnoticed, leading to cascading errors and miscalculations. (Compl't \u00b6 78.) Moreover, there were no access controls to the Excel spreadsheet, meaning that any employee \"with even minimal security clearance\" could alter it. (Compl't \u00b6 79.) The Complaint cites to the senior auditor's view that standard accounting software typically tracks who entered data, and that typically material inputs cannot be made without the authorization of a controller. (Compl't \u00b6 79.) The Global Head of Field Operations, who left the Company in 2015, is quoted in the Complaint as stating that the document's security was so weak that even after his departure, he could still access the spreadsheet to change entries and review information. (Compl't \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Viewed together, these allegations describe a confused, inefficient and unsecured process for tracking the Company's financial data. However, the Complaint fails to identify any erroneous financial reporting that resulted. The absence of any actual deficiencies in the Company's financial reporting, or any other tangible harm resulting from the Company's controls, renders implausible plaintiffs' claim that the certifications were false. Similarly, plaintiffs have described vulnerabilities in the Company's use of an unsecured spreadsheet, but they have not identified any instances in which the spreadsheet was improperly accessed or manipulated by an employee, or where use of the spreadsheet resulted in false reporting. In short, the Complaint has included extensive details about the alleged problems with the Company's internal controls, but it has not identified a resulting error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   With no corresponding error in the Company's financial reporting, the Complaint fails to plausibly allege that the certification of effective internal controls was false or misleading. Claims that successfully allege insufficient internal controls typically involve instances where the failure of internal controls led to restated financial results or were accompanied by misconduct.

In that filing, SunEdison disclosed that it had entered into the Margin Loan for the purpose of acquiring First Wind Holdings, LLC. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 9 at 22.) Under the heading \"Margin Loan,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   the Form 10-Q stated that on January 29, 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a Margin Loan Agreement \"pursuant to which SunEdison guaranteed all of the subsidiary's obligations under the Margin Loan Agreement. Under the Margin Loan Agreement, the subsidiary borrowed $410 million in term loans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The 10-Q stated that the Margin Loan Agreement required that the loan-to-value ratio could not exceed 50% of the value of TERP common stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, SunEdison pledged at least $820 million in TERP common stock as collateral against the $410 million loan amount. (Sec. Def. Mem. at 13.) If that ratio was not maintained, the Company would be required to post additional cash collateral and/or repay a portion of the loan. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 9 at 22.) \"In addition, the Margin Loan Agreement requires the repayment of all or a portion of the term loans made thereunder upon the occurrence of certain events customary for financings of this nature, including other events relating to the price, liquidity or value of the [TERP] Common Stock ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   That same 10-Q further disclosed that the Company had amended a February 2014 credit agreement in order to facilitate the Margin Loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) That original credit agreement was annexed to SunEdison's Form 10-K for 2014, as Exhibit 10.130. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 2 at 70.) The amendment defined the term \"Margin Loan Pledged Equity\" to mean \"up to 32,200,000 class B units of common stock ... of [TERP],\" \"up to \"32,200,000 class B Units of TerraForm Power, LLC\" and \"up to 50% of non-voting membership interests in TerraForm Power, LLC conferring certain incentive distribution rights to SunEdison Holding Corporation by Terraform Power, LLC pursuant to its Organization documents.\" (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 2 at 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   According to defendants, investors could estimate the TERP stock price that would trigger a margin call by reading the 10-Q alongside the February 2014 credit agreement. Defendants explain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Multiplying that figure [of 32.2 million shares] by the publicly known trading price of [TERP] stock provides an approximation of the value of the margin loan collateral on any given day. Combined with the publicly disclosed requirement of a 2:1 value to loan ratio, investors could readily ascertain when a margin call might be triggered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   (Sec. Def. Mem. at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants' proposed arithmetic exercise would still leave a reasonable investor uncertain as to whether, in fact, a margin call had been made. In defendants' own words, such an investor would be left with only \"an approximation\" of the collateral required by the Margin Loan agreement, and an estimate of when a margin call \"might be triggered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the time the Offering Documents were disseminated, however, the margin call allegedly had been made, and a reasonable investor should not have been expected to engage in estimation and guesswork when the fact of the margin call was known to management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Moreover, the definition of \"Margin Loan Pledged Equity\" contained in the 2014 amendment does not limit collateral solely to the value of TERP common stock. It includes 50 percent of non-membership voting interests and incentive distribution rights in an LLC. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 2 at 73.) The value of these distribution rights as collateral on the Margin Loan may have been minimal and immaterial, or they may have been substantial. A reasonable investor would have no way of knowing, and would have remained in the dark about the existence of the margin call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   This is not, as defendants urge, an instance where a reasonable investor could have calculated the timing of a margin call based on a straightforward calculation.

(Sec. Def. Mem. at 15-16.) But the Complaint describes the terms of this loan, including the distinction between the interest rate and the origination fee, and merely recalculates an aggregate, effective percentage rate.

The Complaint adequately alleges that the Second-Lien Loan was different in nature from the Company's already-disclosed loans. First, the Complaint asserts, and defendants do not dispute, that the 9.25% interest rate significantly exceeds the average 2.68% rate for the Company's other debt arrangements. (Compl't \u00b6 102.) Second, the Complaint alleges, and defendants do not dispute, that the second-lien character of the loan differed from other loans taken by the Company, and indicated that no first-lien assets were available as collateral. (Compl't \u00b6 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Third, the Complaint alleges that, based on the timing of the Second-Lien Loan, the Company needed this \"emergency\" loan in order to pay the margin call.

At the pleading stage and\n   in the context of surrounding allegations, the Complaint plausibly alleges that the Company urgently needed the Second-Lien Loan in order to pay the undisclosed margin call. In context, the Second-Lien Loan was not routine financing of the type identified and anticipated by the Company's past disclosures, but a uniquely expensive loan taken out to resolve the exigencies of the undisclosed margin call. Quantitatively, the loan may have totaled only 1.5% of the Company's total debt obligations, but qualitatively, the timing and terms of the Second-Lien Loan may have been indicative of a company struggling with liquidity shortfalls and limited financing options.

The two 10-Qs described contradictory and irreconcilable facts. In the narrative descriptions of the Margin Loans and the Exchangeable Notes, investors were expressly informed that these were recourse debts. However, elsewhere in the filings, these debts were expressly listed as non-recourse, and included in the total calculations for the Company's non-recourse debt. A reasonable investor would be left with no way of discerning which description was accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   According to the Complaint, a UBS analyst observed on August 25, 2015 that investors lacked information on \"simple items\" such as \"how much debt is actually recourse to SunEdison,\" and added, \"More broadly, we see characterization of debt between recourse and non-recourse in recent disclosures as potentially reducing mgmt. credibility.\" (Compl't \u00b6 124.) The confusion as to whether the debt was recourse or non-recourse is further underscored by statements allegedly made by Chatila and Wuebbels in a November 2015 call with Deutsche Bank, in which they allegedly explained that the margin call required the company \"to reclassify the loan from non-recourse to recourse,\" and explained that the classification of the exchangeable notes in the prior 10-Q as non-recourse \"was due to clerical error.\" (Compl't \u00b6 369.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Because the Form 10-Qs set forth conflicting descriptions of the recourse against SunEdison's debt, including the misstatement that the debt was non-recourse, the Complaint plausibly alleges a material misstatement about the classification of Company debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Any Claim Alleging a Misstatement about the Use of Proceeds from the Preferred Offering Is Dismissed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Complaint alleges that defendants misleadingly omitted that funds raised in the Preferred Offering would be used toward the margin call and to address other pressing liquidity needs.

Thus, for the reasons explained, the Court concludes that for the purposes of the Exchange Act claims, the Complaint has alleged that Chatila and Wuebbels failed to disclose the existence of the August 2015 margin call and the Second-Lien Loan, and made a material misstatement as to the Company's classification of certain debts as being both recourse and non-recourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The Court separately concludes that the Complaint fails to allege facts that raise a strong inference of scienter for these misstatements and omissions.

The alleged falsehood is a forward-looking, opinion-based statement about what the speaker \"believe[d]\" as to the Company's future liquidity.

The statements were expressly forward-looking, qualified and accompanied by cautionary language. Moreover, the Complaint does not include facts that would tend to show that these statements concerning the Company's liquidity over the coming year were actually false. The Complaint's own allegations describe a course of conduct whereby SunEdison was rapidly acquiring liquidity and spending it on acquisitions and new projects. While the Company accrued significant debt, in the year that followed the filing of these two 10-Qs, and ultimately was driven to bankruptcy, it continued to have access to creditors, and made two notes offerings and the Preferred Offering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that the Complaint does not adequately allege that these statements were false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Oral Statements Made by Chatila and Wuebbels on Earnings Calls.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Plaintiffs cite to various oral statements made on SunEdison's earnings calls during 2014 and 2015, and assert that Chatila and Wuebbels made materially false and misleading statements about the Company's liquidity positions.

(Compl't \u00b6 105-06.) Under the warehouse credit facility, the Company pre-negotiated with its lenders certain parameters for the funds' use. (Compl't \u00b6 106.) If a project satisfied the criteria, SunEdison simply could draw down the warehouse financing. (Compl't \u00b6 106.) Based on these allegations and the documents incorporated by reference, a credit facility that is available but not drawn upon may be more properly characterized as a \"capital resource\" instead of a component of \"liquidity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that because access to the credit facility was restricted to certain types of pre-approved projects, they should not have been included in the Company's public statements about its available liquidity.

The warehouse facility contributed to capital resources because it was a source of funding for capital expenditures, specifically as to the construction and acquisition of renewable energy projects.

(Compl't \u00b6 380.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The Complaint does not include any details about who authored the internal projection or who reviewed it. A\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article of April 2016 referenced the November projection, with no additional discussion of its substance or distribution. (Compl't \u00b6 380.) In contrast to the September 2015 projection of Chatila, which the Court has concluded is actionable, the Complaint does not allege that Chatila and Wuebbels had knowledge about the internal projection. The allegations concerning its contents and distribution are vague. Because the Complaint does not allege facts that would show that defendants knew this projection to be false, it fails to adequately allege a violation of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The motion to dismiss the Exchange Act claim directed to this projection is therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint Does Not Allege that Chatila Made a Material Omission Concerning the Latin American Power Acquisition.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Chatila omitted material information about SunEdison's failure to consummate its acquisition of Latin American Power, a company that owned projects in Chile and Peru. SunEdison agreed to buy Latin American Power for approximately $733 million, to be paid in installments. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 221-22.) According to plaintiffs, SunEdison never paid any installment, including the initial closing payment. (Compl't \u00b6 359.) On October 6, 2015, the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   reported that the transaction would not be completed, and included conflicting explanations as to why from both SunEdison and Latin American Power.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl't \u00b6 346; Bartlett Dec. Ex. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   In a conference call of October 7, 2015, an analyst questioned Chatila about whether\n   SunEdison had failed to make a payment that was required to close the deal. (Compl't \u00b6 346.) Chatila stated in part that \"we're really disappointed with the result. We're still committed to Latin America.... The seller there did not satisfy the conditions precedent, the closing of the share purchase agreement. So instead of trying to fix it, remedying it, we're saying that the agreement is terminated.\" (Compl't \u00b6 346.) The Complaint asserts that this description of the Latin American Power transaction was materially misleading because it omitted SunEdison's failure to make payments to the seller that were required to complete the transaction. (Compl't \u00b6 347.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Although Chatila did not cite to SunEdison's payment obligations to Latin American Power, the Complaint does not plausibly allege that his statement omitted material information. It does not allege that Chatila's description of Latin American Power's failure to satisfy conditions precedent was false. (Compl't \u00b6 346.) Moreover, the Complaint does not plausibly allege that discussion of SunEdison's alleged non-payment would have significantly altered the total mix of information available to a reasonable investor.\n   <em>\n    ProShares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697607\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/96/#p102\">\n    728 F.3d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   had already reported that SunEdison would not complete the acquisition of Latin American Power. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 29.) That article reported that, according to Latin American Power, SunEdison had failed to make an upfront cash payment of approximately $400 million, whereas SunEdison asserted that the deal fell through because Latin American Power breached unspecified conditions. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 29.) Thus, the two parties' conflicting explanations were already in the mix of public information by the time of the October 7 conference call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that the Complaint has failed to plausibly allege that Chatila materially omitted information concerning the acquisition of Latin American Power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint Does Not Allege a Misstatement Directed to the Adequacy of the Company's Internal Controls.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   In addition to the three SEC filings discussed in the context of plaintiffs' Securities Act claims, the Complaint asserts that Chatila and Wuebbels falsely certified the effectiveness of the Company's financial controls for financial reporting in Form 10-Qs filed for the second and third quarters of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015. Plaintiffs' section 10(b) claim directed to the certification of internal controls is dismissed for the same reason that the Securities Act claim is dismissed. As discussed, despite allegations that describe inefficiencies and weaknesses in the Company's internal controls, the Complaint fails to identify any example of erroneous financial reporting on the part of SunEdison. Because there was no example of financial reporting that was alleged to be false or inaccurate because of the Company's internal controls, or other tangible harm that resulted from the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, the Complaint fails to plausibly allege that the certifications misstated the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that the Complaint has failed to allege a claim under the Exchange Act based on the certifications of the effectiveness of internal controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint Does Not Allege an Actionable Omission as to the Defendants' Actions toward the YieldCos.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The Complaint describes steps that SunEdison allegedly took to coerce\n   the YieldCos into providing immediate financing to the Company. (Compl't \u00b6 188-214.) The Complaint alleges that when SunEdison was unable to obtain financing for its repayment obligations under the Margin Loan, the Company's management sought a cash infusion from the YieldCos. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 188-90.) Management at the two YieldCos refused, and cited an inability to agree to the consideration that would be provided by SunEdison. (Compl't \u00b6 191.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Chatila then scheduled a special meeting of the YieldCos' boards for November 20, 2015. (Compl't \u00b6 192.) At the meeting, members of the YieldCos' senior management were terminated and replaced, and the YieldCos' boards and conflicts committees were reorganized with \"loyalists.\" (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 192-95.) Board meetings of the YieldCos were then called, Wuebbels was appointed CEO of both YieldCos, and Global agreed to an immediate payment of $150 million to SunEdison for the purchase of projects in India. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 196, 199, 203, 206-08.) This payment was allegedly critical to SunEdison, and made the same afternoon as the default deadline on the margin call. (Compl't \u00b6 208.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Chatila and Wuebbels materially misrepresented and omitted the Company's motivations for selling the India properties and shuffling personnel at the YieldCos. First, in two announcements on November 23 and 24, 2015, SunEdison announced that it had pre-paid all but $5 million of the Margin Loan. (Compl't \u00b6 210.) Second, on November 23, 2015, SunEdison described the YieldCos' management changes as a step to \"drive organizational alignment,\" and did not mention the need to divert cash to SunEdison. (Compl't \u00b6 211.) Third, in a November 24, 2015 press release, Chatila and Wuebbels touted Global's acquisition of the India projects, describing it as beneficial to both Global and SunEdison. (Compl't \u00b6 212.) The Complaint asserts that these statements omitted material information as to the motives behind SunEdison's actions, specifically as to SunEdison's need \"to loot Global\" for immediate cash in order to cover obligations on the Margin Loan. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 210-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The Complaint has not identified statements that were rendered false or misleading by the reorganization of the YieldCo boards and the authorizing of the $231 million payment. The public statements accurately stated that SunEdison had substantially pre-paid the amounts owed on the Margin Loan, described changes in personnel and announced the sale of SunEdison's projects in India. (Bartlett Dec. Exs. 14, 15.) The statements contained broad, vague descriptions about the effects of these changes, stating, for example, they would help SunEdison \"implement its plans to improve the alignment and effectiveness of its operating structure, drive operational efficiency and focus on its organic development opportunities.\" (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 14.) This generalized explanation did not offer concrete information, and amounts to puffery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    San Leandro Emergency Med.

(Compl't \u00b6 251.) Global brought claims alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 251-52.) Among other things, Global asserted that the defendants misrepresented SunEdison's liquidity to Global's board of directors and conflicts committee. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 251-52.)

For the purposes of plaintiffs' claims against Chatila and Wuebbels under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, however, the Court concludes that the Complaint has not raised a cogent and compelling inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   As previously discussed, the Company's statements about the recourse available to SunEdison's lenders were, taken together, contradictory and unclear, so that a reasonable investor reviewing the Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2015 could have been left with the misimpression that certain debts were non-recourse. The narrative descriptions in SunEdison's Form 10-Q explained that direct recourse was available as to the Margin Loan and the Exchangeable Notes, while elsewhere in the same filing, these debts were listed as non-recourse. (Compl't \u00b6 467; Bartlett Dec. Ex. 9 at 22-23, Ex. 10 at 25.) In the 10-Q for the third quarter of 2015, the debt classifications were revised to accurately state that they were recourse debt. (Compl't \u00b6 167.) The classification was further muddied when, in November 2015, Chatila stated that the margin call required SunEdison to reclassify the loan from non-recourse to recourse, and stated that any prior classification of the Exchangeable Notes as non-recourse \"was due to clerical error.\" (Compl't \u00b6 369.) A UBS analyst observed in August 2015 that, \"More broadly, we see characterization of debt between recourse and non-recourse in recent disclosures as potentially reducing mgmt. credibility.\" (Compl't \u00b6 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Although the Company's descriptions of creditor recourse were sloppy, contradictory and poorly drafted, they are not consistent with the \"reckless disregard for the truth\" required to allege scienter.\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v.

The Company prominently and accurately described SunEdison's obligations to its creditors, which is inconsistent with a reckless disregard for the truth. Weighing the statements in their full context, including subsequent corrections, the more plausible inference is that the Company negligently erred in listing these debts as non-recourse against SunEdison, and subsequently attempted to resolve any confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p336\">\n    551 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p336\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover,\n   assuming that the internal controls were as dysfunctional as plaintiffs allege, the Complaint does not include facts that raise a cogent and compelling inference that Chatila and Wuebbels were reckless, as opposed to negligent, in stating that the Company had effective internal controls. The Complaint has described inefficient and cumbersome controls based on the Company's failure to integrate different accounting platforms and the frustrations that this caused for internal auditors (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 70-77), but absent knowledge on the part of Chatila and Wuebbels that these systems resulted in misreported financial data, allowed for fraudulent conduct or facilitated other similar harms, plaintiffs fail to raise a cogent and compelling inference of scienter. Similarly, the Complaint explains the risks of using an unsecured Excel spreadsheet to consolidate financial data (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 78-80), but it does not allege that any of these potential harms came to fruition, much less that they were known to Chatila and Wuebbels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   By contrast, Judge Kaplan concluded in\n   <em>\n    Dobina\n   </em>\n   that the Complaint adequately alleged that a certification of internal controls was made with a reckless disregard for its truth when the defendant was personally told about specific deficiencies in controls, including audit delays, and the company's inadequate controls eventually required the restatement of financial results.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835609\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/228/#p244\">\n    909 F.Supp.2d at 246-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both SunEdison and Latin American Power offered their conflicting explanations in a\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article, which is cited in the Complaint. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 29.) In the Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2015, the Company stated that Latin American Power's sellers terminated the transaction, that SunEdison thereafter invoked a right to terminate based on the sellers' purported failure to satisfy a condition precedent, and that the sellers had submitted a demand for arbitration.

As discussed, while not labeled under an Item 303 heading, the Company's SEC filings explained to investors its present and ongoing need for liquidity. For example, the Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2015 included discussion under the heading, \"Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources. (Bartlett Dec. Ex. 12 at 85.) It noted that \"recent market conditions,\" including lower share prices for TERP and Global common stock, had decreased capital available to the two YieldCos, and that SunEdison accordingly \"plan[ned] to reduce the volume\" of projects sold to TERP and Global. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This development marked a shift in the DevCo/YieldCo model adopted by the Company. The Company proceeded to warn that because \"equity interests\" in SunEdison, TERP and Global were trading \"significantly below\" past levels, project financing was \"less attractive,\" and, absent additional financing, the Company was at risk of breaching its debt covenants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Thus, the Company publicly warned investors that declining stock prices were restraining the DevCo from selling projects to the YieldCo, that it was struggling to obtain financing, and that it was at risk of breaching debt covenants.

(Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 77, 450.) In its work as auditor, KPMG signed a \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" (the \"Audit Report\") that was attached to SunEdison's Form 10-K for 2014. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 427, 450.) As has been discussed, the Offering Documents incorporated this Form 10-K by reference, including the Audit Report. (Compl't \u00b6 427.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   KPMG's alleged misstatements are limited to a portion of the Audit Report in which KPMG stated that it had complied with GAAS, as promulgated by the PCAOB. (Compl't \u00b6 488.) The Complaint quotes the Audit Report at length. (Compl't \u00b6 488.) In the Audit Report, KPMG stated, \"We have conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the [PCAOB],\" and \"perform[ed] the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\" (Compl't \u00b6 488.) KPMG explained that it had audited consolidated financial statements for evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures contained therein. (Compl't \u00b6 488.) It stated that its review of SunEdison's internal controls was \"designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with [GAAP].\" (Compl't \u00b6 488.) KPMG concluded that for the purposes of the Form 10-K for 2014, the Company maintained effective internal controls for the purposes of its financial reporting. (Compl't \u00b6 488.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   The Complaint asserts KPMG materially misrepresented the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls. (Compl't \u00b6 489.) Plaintiffs allege that KPMG violated the GAAS by ignoring severe deficiencies in the Company's internal controls at the time of the audit, specifically including GAAS Standard No. 3, which requires an auditor to exercise due professional care in performing an audit, and GAAS Standards of Fieldwork Nos. 2 and 3, which require an independent auditor to obtain information sufficient to afford a reasonable opinion. (Compl't \u00b6 489-92, 499.) The Complaint alleges that a GAAS-compliant audit would have revealed deficiencies in the Company's internal controls, specifically including the non-integrated systems used across SunEdison's divisions and use of\n   the unsecured Excel spreadsheet. (Compl't \u00b6 497.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   The Court concludes that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege a section 11 claim against KPMG. First, as has been discussed, the Complaint's failure to identify any misrepresentation of financial data contained in the Form 10-K for 2014 is fatal to plaintiffs' claim. Second, the Complaint fails to include facts to support a conclusion that KPMG did not honestly hold its belief that it complied with GAAS. Courts have noted the breadth and subjectivity of GAAS obligations. Because the Complaint includes no supporting facts to show that KPMG did not honestly satisfy its duty of care under GAAS, the section 11 claim against it is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint Fails to Identify Any Misstated Financial Reporting Information in the Form 10-K for 2014.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   The section 11 claim against KPMG is directed to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. But, as has been discussed at length, the Complaint identifies no misrepresentation or inaccuracy in the financial reporting data recited in the Form 10-K for 2014. GAAS General Standard No. 3 requires \"an audit of internal control over financial reporting,\" and no misstatements in the Company's financial reporting have been identified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   In support of the claim against KPMG, the Complaint cites to the Company's public statements in April 2016 that acknowledged deficiencies in internal controls. But the weaknesses identified in 2016 did not touch on financial reporting. Instead, the Company cited to its cash forecasting processes, management's need to more fully discuss risks and adjustments with the Company's board, management's inadequate response to missed cash forecasts, and management's disclosures to the Company board concerning cash flow, including extensions of accounts payable and use of cash committed for projects. (Compl't \u00b6 498.) These statements about deficient internal controls related to internal management of cash, and not to public financial reporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Even if they did relate to the narrower issue of financial reporting, the Company's statements of April 2016 pertained to the contents of the Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015. This acknowledgement of deficiencies would not apply to the internal controls over financial reporting for the 10-K covering fiscal year 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Because the Complaint has failed to identify an error in the Company's financial reporting in the relevant 10-K, the section 11 claim against KPMG is dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Braskem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274753\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/731/#p758\">\n    246 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   758 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Lehman Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257245\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/799/258/#p289\">\n    799 F.Supp.2d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section 11's purposes include holding auditors and others strictly liable, subject to the due diligence defense, for materially false or misleading statements in the portions of registration statements 'expertised' by them.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint Does Not Plausibly Allege that KPMG Did Not Honestly Believe that It Complied with Its Duties Under GAAS.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   The section 11 claim against KPMG is also dismissed for the separate reason that the Complaint fails to allege that KPMG did not honestly hold its stated opinions about the sufficiency of its audit of internal controls over financial reporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   The Complaint broadly alleges that KPMG failed to comply with GAAS, as set forth at AU \u00a7 150.02, which states: \"The auditor must exercise due professional\n   care in the performance of the audit and the preparation of the report.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Judge Kaplan has noted, GAAS implements standards that \"are couched in rather general and in some cases inherently subjective terms.

It also does not include facts to support the assertion that KPMG failed to assess the risk of financial misstatements as required by GAAS AU \u00a7 150.02, or that KPMG had an insufficient basis to state its opinion about the financial statements as a whole based on its audit as required by Standard of Reporting 4 in the same GAAS provision.
