Jimenez filed an application for Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") benefits nearly eight years ago and now appeals, for the second time, the decision of the Acting Commissioner of Social Security (\"Commissioner\") denying his application. Following Jimenez's first appeal, Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty reversed and remanded the case on the basis that the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") failed to sufficiently specify and explain his reasons for assigning various weight to the medical opinions regarding Jimenez's physical impairments. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Record (\"AR\") 545-46.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Jimenez now argues that, in his second decision, the ALJ did not properly weigh the opinions on his mental impairments and erred in not sufficiently including limitations for Jimenez's mental impairments in his residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"). Because the ALJ repeatedly failed to properly weigh medical opinions, and because his RFC findings are not supported by substantial evidence, I REVERSE and REMAND for an immediate award of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

Additionally, a claimant's physical or mental impairments must be \"medically determinable\" and \"expected to result in death or [have] lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.905\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jimenez filed his application for SSI benefits on January 15, 2010. [AR 169-175.] He reported that he was limited in his ability to work by neck and lower back problems, numbness, shoulder pain, and depression. [AR 195.] After his application was denied, Jimenez requested a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ found that Jimenez was not disabled and therefore not entitled to SSI benefits. [AR 14-25.] Because the Appeals Council denied review, the ALJ's decision, filed on March 19, 2012, became the Commissioner's final decision. [AR 1-5.] Jimenez sought judicial review of the decision, and Magistrate Judge Hegarty reversed and remanded the case on the basis that the ALJ failed to sufficiently specify and explain his reasons for weighing the medical opinions on physical impairments. [AR 545-46.] Remand proceedings before the same ALJ resulted in another unfavorable decision, filed on May 4, 2015, and the Appeals Council refused to take corrective action, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner for purposes of judicial review. [AR 468.] Jimenez now appeals the second denial of benefits, arguing that the ALJ did not properly weigh the opinions of Jimenez's mental impairments and erred in not sufficiently accounting for the mental limitations in his residual functional capacity findings. Jimenez raised similar issues in his first appeal before Magistrate Judge Hegarty, but the court had no need to address them after finding grounds for reversal in the ALJ's weighing of the opinions on physical impairments. [AR 545.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because Magistrate Judge Hegarty's order provides a detailed and chronological recitation of Jimenez's medical record leading up to May 2014, and because Jimenez's second appeal focuses on the ALJ's assessment of his mental impairments, I need only repeat the pertinent facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jimenez was diagnosed with and began receiving treatment for depression in June 2009. [AR 254.] For his SSI application, Jimenez was referred to Dr. Brett Valette for a psychological evaluation on July 14, 2010. [AR 351.] Jimenez accused Dr. Valette of laughing at him during a previous appointment and said Valette \"denied\" him. [AR 351-52.] Dr. Valette objected and told Jimenez he would not agree to see him if Jimenez believed Valette was just going to laugh at him. Jimenez \"got mad\" and \"left,\" and Dr. Valette was not able to complete the examination or provide a diagnosis. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Jimenez was then referred to Dr. Richard Madsen for a psychological evaluation on August 19, 2010. Dr. Madsen wrote that Jimenez's \"ability to do work related activities is impaired,\" and as a result he would have difficulty \"relating to peers, coworkers, supervisors, and the general public.\" [AR 354-58.] Dr. Madsen noted Jimenez's \"lifelong problems with ... mood swings with depression and agitation,\" and concluded that he gets \"explosive and assaultive\" when agitated. [AR 358.] He further explained that Jimenez \"has lost several jobs because of his anger management problems,\" and his \"longest period of employment is only two to three month.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   State agency psychologist Gayle Frommelt evaluated the case record, including Dr. Madsen's examination report, and issued an RFC assessment on August 27, 2010. She indicated moderate limitations in both Jimenez's \"ability to get along with coworkers\" and his \"ability to accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors.\" [AR 70.] At the end of the RFC assessment form, Dr. Frommelt concluded that Jimenez \"retains the ability to follow simple instructions, sustain ordinary routines and make simple decisions. He can manage social interactions that are not frequent or prolonged. He should have limited contact [with the general] public.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In December 2010, Jimenez underwent a \"SyCare Initial Emergency Assessment\" with mental health counselor Wayne Monk. Mr. Monk diagnosed Jimenez with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. [AR 421, 426.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Jimenez received mental health treatment at Spanish Peaks Mental Health Center (\"Spanish Peaks\") beginning in February 2011. A psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, Mark Jankelow, diagnosed Jimenez with Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder ; Psychosis ; Possible Personality Disorder; and Hypertension. [AR 419.] Mr. Jankelow reported the same diagnosis on Jimenez's subsequent visits in June and August, 2011. [AR 412-13.] Mr. Jankelow completed an RFC evaluation for Jimenez on August 1, 2011, and ranked him with moderate to marked limitations in \"understanding and memory\"; mostly moderate to extreme limitations in \"sustained concentration and persistence\"; marked limitations in \"social interaction\"; and moderate to marked limitations in \"adaptation.\" [AR 398-99.] He indicated that Jimenez is not mentally capable of attending work at any job 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, and estimated that Jimenez would be mentally off task for 75% of the work week. [AR 400.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 2, 2011, Mr. Monk completed an RFC evaluation for Jimenez and ranked him with marked to extreme limitations in \"understanding and memory\"; marked to extreme limitations in \"sustained concentration and persistence\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   marked to extreme limitations in \"social interaction\"; and moderate to marked limitations in \"adaptation.\" [AR 401-02.] Mr. Monk, like Mr. Jankelow, indicated that Jimenez is not mentally capable of attending work at any job 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, but he estimated that Jimenez would be mentally off task for 90% of the work week. [AR 403.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Jimenez's records show that he continued to receive mental health treatment from Mr. Jankelow and others at Spanish Peaks through at least September 16, 2014. [AR 678-751.] In an evaluation on September 9, 2014, Mr. Jankelow noted that Jimenez's attention and concentration were poor. [AR 680.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Second Hearing and Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his second decision, the ALJ again found Jimenez was not disabled. As to the first step, it was uncontested that Jimenez was not engaged in substantial gainful activity. At step two, the ALJ determined Jimenez had a number of severe impairments: (1) degenerative changes of the cervical lumbar spine; (2) bi-polar disorder; (3) personality disorder; and (4) obesity. [AR 483.] At step three, the ALJ found that Jimenez's impairments did not meet or equal those listed in the applicable federal regulations. He evaluated the mental impairments using the \"paragraph B\" criteria and determined that they did not bring about episodes of decompensation, and only caused moderate limitations in activities of daily living, social functioning, and concentration, persistence or pace. [AR 485; 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app.1, \u00a7 12.07.].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The ALJ then defined Jimenez's RFC and concluded that Jimenez's physical and mental impairments were not disabling. He found Jimenez had the RFC to perform light work with the following restrictions: can only lift twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently; can only sit for two hours per day; can stand and/or walk for up to six hours per day; can occasionally bend, squat, and kneel; cannot climb ladders or scaffolds; cannot work over chest level; cannot deal with the general public but can occasionally deal with coworkers; and cannot perform complex tasks, such that he is limited to unskilled work. [AR 486.] In determining Jimenez's RFC, the ALJ discounted the opinions of Jimenez's mental health providers (Mr. Jankelow and Mr. Monk) and the opinion of the consultative examiner (Dr. Madsen). He gave preference to the opinion, or at least portions of the opinion, of the State agency consultant (Dr. Frommelt). [AR 494-96.] At step four, the ALJ found Jimenez has no past relevant work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on the RFC provided by the ALJ, the vocational expert (VE) testified at the hearing that Jimenez could perform three jobs in the region: dry cleaning/laundry worker, housekeeper/cleaner, and pamphlet distributor. [AR 512-13.] However, the VE stated that there would be no competitive work for someone with the following additional restrictions: on an unpredictable basis, an inability to appropriately interact with the general public and to complete a normal workday and work week without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms; no ability to make simple, work-related decisions; and no ability to work in combination with or proximity to others. [AR 513.] On cross-examination by Jimenez's attorney, the VE stated that, of all the social interactions required in a work situation, the ability to\n   interact with supervisors is the most critical because all jobs require some interaction with supervisors. [AR 514-15.] There is no mention of this favorable testimony in the ALJ's decision. Ultimately, the ALJ concluded that Jimenez was not disabled because he was capable of performing jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy. [AR 497.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With his second bite of the apple, the ALJ feigned compliance with Magistrate Judge Hegarty's order but, once again, did not properly assess the medical source opinions. Nor did he sufficiently include Jimenez's limitations from his mental impairments in his RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Medical Opinions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ALJ's findings regarding the weight to accord the medical source opinions are replete with errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Opinion of Dr. Madsen and Weight Compared to Opinion of Dr. Frommelt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the ALJ improperly weighed the opinion of Dr. Madsen, an examining source, as compared to the opinion of Dr. Frommelt, a non-examining consultative source. When there is no opinion by a treating physician or a treating opinion does not merit controlling weight, an ALJ must consider the following six factors in determining how to evaluate and weigh other medical opinions on the record: length of the treating relationship, frequency of examination, nature and extent of the treating relationship, evidentiary support, consistency with the record, medical specialization, and other relevant considerations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). \"[A]n examining medical-source opinion is ... presumptively entitled to more weight than a doctor's opinion derived from a review of the medical record.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapo v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890926\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1285/#p1291\">\n    682 F.3d 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1291 (10th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). An ALJ may dismiss or discount an examining opinion, \"but that must be based on an evaluation of all of the factors set out in the cited regulations and the ALJ must 'provide specific, legitimate reasons for rejecting it.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890926\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1285/#p1291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Doyal v.

Accordingly, the ALJ's justification for effectively rejecting (or, as the ALJ put it, giving \"little weight\" to) Dr. Madsen's findings is critical to the validity of the ALJ's decision. The ALJ gave Dr. Madsen's opinion little weight, in part, because it was rendered after a single exam and because Dr. Madsen did not review medical records prior to rendering his opinion. That Dr. Madsen's opinion was rendered after only one examination is not a proper reason to accord his opinion less weight than Dr. Frommelt's. This may be a valid reason not to give Dr. Madsen's findings the conclusive weight of a treating opinion, but \"it is not by itself a basis for rejecting them.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890926\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1285/#p1291\">\n    682 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1291 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kellams v.

And, while the ALJ may consider other factors such as \"the extent to which a medical source is familiar with the other information in [a claimant's] case record,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(6), it is quite a stretch to find that Dr. Frommelt's opinion is entitled to more weight than Dr. Madsen's simply because her conclusions were based upon a review of the medical record and his were based on an in-person evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   That Dr. Madsen did precisely what examining physicians do, and Dr. Frommelt did precisely what non-examining physicians do, is not sufficient justification for discounting Dr. Madsen's opinion. Holding\n   otherwise would contradict the regulatory presumption to \"... give more weight to the medical opinion of a source who has examined [a claimant] than to the medical opinion of a medical source who has not examined [a claimant].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ALJ's other reasons for rejecting Dr. Madsen's opinion-that it was vague, not well explained, and inconsistent with the record as a whole-are equally flawed. The ALJ noted that Dr. Madsen's opinion \"is of little utility in determining [Jimenez's] RFC\" because it does not provide any indication as to the severity or frequency of the impairments. [AR 495.] Yet he failed to seek clarification or additional information regarding Dr. Madsen's report.

Although the ALJ did not expressly reject any particular part of Dr. Frommelt's opinion, he criticized and discounted the limitations on interaction with coworkers and supervisors as being unsupported by the evidence.

Nor did he state that any evidence, other than his own speculative opinion, conflicted with Dr. Frommelt's findings regarding Jimenez's social functioning limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In crafting his opinion, the ALJ selectively ignored the more inimical interactions in Jimenez's medical record, such as the turbulent exchange with Dr. Brett Valette. [AR 351-52.] The SyCare Initial Emergency Assessment conducted on September 1, 2013, reported that Jimenez \"can [ ] be very combative and uncooperative.\" [AR 708.] Indeed, a nurse at the hospital reported that during his triage, Jimenez threatened to \"shoot his wife,\" though he could not remember making the threat when questioned. [AR 707.] Nevertheless, the ALJ plucked the most miniscule evidence of Jimenez's ability to engage appropriately with medical providers as supposed proof that Jimenez is able to respond appropriately to coworkers and supervisors. His failure to acknowledge the episodic pattern of Jimenez's psychological symptoms suggests \"cherry picking\" of the record, which is improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890926\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1285/#p1291\">\n    682 F.3d at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I note that the ALJ's conclusions as to Jimenez's abilities differed dramatically from the conclusions of Mr. Monk and Mr. Jankelow; a difference which the ALJ did not sufficiently explain. As previously noted, the\n   medical sources' opinions on Jimenez's mental limitations are largely consistent. Dr. Frommelt indicated moderate limitations in Jimenez's \"ability to accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors,\" and Dr. Madsen wrote that Jimenez would have difficulty \"relating to peers, coworkers, supervisors, and the general public.\" [AR 70, 354-58.] Mr. Jankelow indicated a marked impairment in ability to accept instructions and criticism from supervisors, and Mr. Monk indicated an extreme impairment in the same category. [AR 398-403.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The ALJ discredited the opinions of Mr. Monk and Mr. Jankelow based, in part, on Jimenez's admission of \"significant daily activities that are inconsistent with the information he gave in these mental health sessions.\" [AR 496.] That Jimenez's mental health providers often relied on his subjective reports of his symptoms is no basis for discrediting the medical source opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Jimenez's statement, as documented in summary form in a mental health treatment plan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is open to more than one interpretation and does not substantiate the ALJ's conclusion. In fact, treatment notes from the same day indicate that one of Jimenez's treatment goals was to \"be able to manage his depressive symptoms so he can engage with helpers to complete his SSI appeals process and complete the process for his in-home caregiver.\" [AR 496.] Becoming stable enough to participate in and complete the SSI appeals process is quite different than seeking mental health treatment for the sole purpose of obtaining benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The ALJ next dismissed the opinions of Mr. Monk and Mr. Jankelow\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   because\n   they were \"not supported by the longitudinal treatment history\" and \"not accompanied by meaningful explanation concerning the ratings given.\" [AR 496.] Yet the other evidence complements, rather than undermines, the opinions of Mr. Monk and Mr. Jankelow with respect to social interaction limitations and limitations in the ability to adapt to changes in the work setting. [AR 70, 358.] And although Mr. Monk and Mr. Jankelow assessed greater functional limitations than Dr. Frommelt, they also had the most frequent interactions and longest treatment relationship with Jimenez of the medical sources. The ALJ's complaint that the statements of Mr. Monk and Mr. Jankelow lacked meaningful explanation does not withstand scrutiny given that the record is thick with treatment notes and findings lending context and support to their opinions. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 404-20.] A more thorough analysis of the treatment records would have provided a better longitudinal picture of Jimenez's mental impairments than the ALJ's own lay opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B. Mental Impairments in RFC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Jimenez argues that the ALJ's improper treatment of the opinions discussed above resulted in a flawed RFC that did not account for three crucial limitations: ability to interact with supervisors, ability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms, and ability to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13, p. 9. When a claimant suffers from mental impairments, as the ALJ found in this case, the ALJ's inquiry must include consideration of \"limited ability to carry out certain mental activities, such as limitations in understanding, remembering, and carrying out instructions, and in responding appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and work pressures in a work setting.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.945\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Commissioner's argument that \"any related limitations in concentration and attention were addressed when the ALJ limited Plaintiff to performing SVP one or two, unskilled work\" (ECF No. 14, p 10) is not without merit.

However, the limitations related to Jimenez's ability to respond appropriately to supervisors and to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions are distinguishable. Because the evidence in the record supported, at the very least, moderate to marked limitations in these areas, the ALJ erred in not clearly relating these impairments to the VE or accounting for them in his RFC findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The parties' briefs include a lengthy debate, which I do not detail here, about the significance of Sections I and III of Dr. Frommelt's RFC form. I reject the Commissioner's argument that, because the ALJ's RFC finding aligns with Dr. Frommelt's Section III RFC, Jimenez's challenge has no merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14, p. 7. Dr. Frommelt's Section III conclusion accounts for some, but not all, of the impairments described in Section I of the form. Because the Section III conclusion did not describe all of the Section I limitations, it was improper for the ALJ to look only to the Section III narrative as the psychologist's opinion regarding mental RFC. I also reject the Commissioner's alternative argument that the ALJ's RFC \"reasonably accommodated for the Section I 'moderate' limitations in social interactions by limiting Plaintiff to not dealing with the general public and occasionally dealing with coworkers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ECF No. 14, p. 10.

Furthermore, he did not explain why he apparently credited Dr. Frommelt's opinion that Jimenez could \"sustain ordinary routines\" but ignored her finding that Jimenez's ability to complete a normal work schedule was moderately limited. [AR 69-70.] The ALJ also failed to explain his rejection of the consistent opinions of Dr. Madsen, Mr. Monk, and Mr. Jankelow, all of whom indicated that Jimenez would have difficulty completing a regular work schedule.

It is likely that the proceedings would have resulted in a different outcome had the ALJ properly weighed the medical source opinions and properly accounted for Jimenez's mental impairments and functional limitations. In particular, the medical source opinions regarding the supervisory limitation, if credited, would have resulted in a different RFC determination, thus producing different testimony from the VE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Contrary to the Commissioner's assertion, this is not a case where the VE identified jobs a person with those additional limitations could still perform.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 16.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The ALJ has had two opportunities to rule in accordance with the substantial evidence in the record and has failed to do so. Further, this case has a prolonged history. Jimenez has been seeking benefits for almost eight years and should not be subject to additional delay. Jimenez is now 54 years old and will be\n   considered a person of advanced age in August 2018. \"Outright reversal and remand for immediate award of benefits is appropriate when additional fact finding would serve no useful purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Sorenson v.

Here, the evidence establishes Jimenez has additional limitations not reflected in the ALJ's RFC. When posed some of those additional limitations, the VE testified that there would be no jobs in the national economy for someone with such limitations. The record in this case fully supports a determination that Jimenez cannot hold full-time employment due to the combination of his physical and mental impairments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   I, therefore, REVERSE the determination of the Commissioner through the ALJ that Jimenez is not disabled.
