Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Christine Adams and Susanna Hempstead are female graduate students in Defendant Ohio University (\"the University\")'s English Department. (ECF No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 45). The University is a public educational institution located in Athens, Ohio that receives federal funding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Defendant Andrew Escobedo was a professor at the University who taught Introduction to English Studies (ENG 5950), a class in which both Plaintiffs were enrolled in the fall of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 15-16, 46). Defendant Joseph McLaughlin is also an English professor at the University, and previously was the chair of the English Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Sexual Harassment Against Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Professor Escobedo invited all of the students in his Introduction to English Studies class, including Ms. Adams and Ms. Hempstead, to an end-of-the-semester celebration at Jackie O's Pub to begin at 7:00 p.m. on December 3, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 47, 17). Both Ms. Adams and Ms. Hempstead attended the gathering. Ms. Adams arrived early, approximately five to ten minutes before the party began, while Ms. Hempstead was one of the last students to arrive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 48). Upon Ms. Adams' arrival, Professor Escobedo immediately began buying rounds of alcoholic beverages for the students, and he continued to do so throughout the evening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 22, 60). He bought five to six\n   drinks for Ms. Adams over the course of the night. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Ms. Hempstead arrived, she at first sat next to Professor Escobedo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48). Later, when she went to the bar to buy a drink, Professor Escobedo followed her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49). He placed his hand on her back and told the bartender to put her drink on his tab. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After they returned to their seats, Professor Escobedo touched Ms. Hempstead on her hand, upper thighs, back, waist, and buttocks, as well as other areas of her body that were not visible to the rest of the group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50). Earlier that evening, Professor Escobedo told a student who wanted beer instead of liquor that he had to \"teach [him/her] something about taste\", and Ms. Hempstead then called him an \"asshole\" in response. Professor Escobedo then said, \"Careful. I still haven't submitted your grade.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B, p. 9, 38). Thus, Ms. Hempstead believed her response to his physical advances could impact her grade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54). Ms. Hempstead attempted to increase the distance between herself and Professor Escobedo to signal that the advances were unwanted and to prevent further physical contact, but Professor Escobedo was apparently undeterred-he continued the unwanted touching. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). Ms. Adams witnessed Professor Escobedo touching Ms. Hempstead's knees, thigh, and back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around 9:45 p.m., Professor Escobedo and a group of students, including Ms. Adams and Ms. Hempstead, left Jackie O's Pub and went to Tony's Tavern. They arrived at the second bar around 10:10 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21). At Tony's Tavern, Ms. Hempstead piled jackets and bags next to her seat in attempt to prevent Professor Escobedo from sitting next to her, but he moved the items and positioned himself directly in between Ms. Hempstead and Ms. Adams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 62). Professor Escobedo continued to make unwanted physical contact with Ms. Hempstead throughout the evening, including touching her over her clothes on her hands, arms, thighs, legs, knees, waist, lower back, buttocks, breast, and vagina multiple times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-64). Around 10:45 p.m., Ms. Hempstead left Tony's Tavern because of Professor Escobedo's unwanted sexual advances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65). As she was leaving, he approached her and hugged her, touching her breast during the encounter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66). Throughout the night and early the next morning, Ms. Hempstead texted her then-boyfriend a series of text messages about being touched by her professor, including on her crotch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B, pp. 43-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Professor Escobedo also non-consensually touched Ms. Adams while the group was at Tony's Tavern, placing his hands on her on her face, neck, hands, legs, thighs, knees, back, arms, buttocks, and vagina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26). Among other incidents of unwanted touching, Professor Escobedo put his hands inside of Ms. Adams' pants to cup her buttocks, touched her butt over her pants twice, touched her back under her shirt, and touched her vagina over her clothing with a rubbing motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Adams overheard Professor's comment to Ms. Hempstead telling her to be \"careful\" since he still had not submitted her grades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). Thus, she believed that her response to his advances could impact her grade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). Even still, Ms. Adams made faces signaling discomfort, but Professor Escobedo ignored them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). She also attempted to move away from him by moving to a new seat and placing objects and people between them, but he continued to make physical contact with her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Around 12:45 a.m. on December 4, the group disbanded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). Ms. Adams left Tony's Tavern with another student, Jessica Cogar, and they began walking\n   toward Ellis Hall at the University. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Professor Escobedo caught up with them and walked with them until they reached Ellis Hall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Ms. Cogar then went inside the building to use the restroom, leaving Ms. Adams alone with Professor Escobedo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). It was then that Professor Escobedo told Ms. Adams that he was sexually attracted to her, and pressed his body against hers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). He then kissed her, and inserted his tongue into her mouth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39). Ms. Adams did not reciprocate the kiss, and told him that she was not interested in a sexual relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). Despite this unambiguous rejection, Professor Escobedo continued to clutch her body against his. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). All the while, he rubbed his lower body and erect penis against her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Ms. Cogar came back out of Ellis Hall, Professor Escobedo released Ms. Adams, but not before telling her that \"she better not tell anyone\" about anything that occurred that evening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44). According to a report authored by the University's Office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance (\"ECRC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , after Professor Escobedo and Ms. Cogar went their separate ways to walk to their cars, Ms. Adams met a friend around 1:00 a.m. and told her friend that Professor Escobedo made unsolicited verbal and physical advances on her, including sexually propositioning her, trying to kiss her, and putting his hand down her pants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B). ECRC corroborated the story with Ms. Adams' friend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    ECRC Investigation and Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 10, 2016, ECRC received a report from the Chair of the English Department about concerns raised by a graduate student representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B). According to the graduate student representative, \"an alarming number of students\" requested that the faculty address issues of sexual misconduct in the Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On the same day, the Chair told ECRC that there had been graffiti in the restroom on the first floor of Ellis Hall stating that Professor Escobedo \"is a predator. You are not alone\" and that he \"preys on young women. The Department knows.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further graffiti urged students to \"Email makeousafe@gmail.com for help / with stories. He must be stopped\"; and stated, \"Together they can't ignore us.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On March 24, 2016, ECRC received a report of additional graffiti in the restroom in Ellis Hall, stating that \"If you have been sexually harassed, touched, etc. by a certain male [Department] prof.\n   <em>\n    GO TO OUPD\n   </em>\n   and file an anonymous report. The Dept. can't catch him without\n   <em>\n    your\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    help\n   </em>\n   !\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Also on March 24, Ms. Adams and Ms. Hempstead requested to meet with ECRC Investigator Jessica Cook. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). They ultimately each met with her individually to discuss the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On March 31, 2016, Professor Escobedo was given notice of the allegations and placed on administration leave pending the outcome of the ECRC investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The investigation culminated in a memorandum of findings, which was issued on December 15, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The memorandum concluded that Ms. Adams' and Ms. Hempstead's allegations of non-consensual sexual contact, quid pro quo sexual harassment, and hostile environment were all substantiated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The report recommended submitting the matter to the Department Chair and the Dean for consideration of possible disciplinary action and further recommended\n   that Professor Escobedo remain on administrative leave and be banned from campus until final determination of disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 5, 2017, Professor Escobedo sent a letter to his colleagues in the English Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 301, Ex. E). He stated that he was unable to give a clear account of what happened on December 3 because of his degree of intoxication, but acknowledged that he bore \"serious responsibility for what happened\" and \"certainly deserve[d] disciplinary action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 303, 305, Ex. E). Nevertheless, he asked that he not be terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Previous Incidents Involving Professor Escobedo\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition to the sexual harassment that Plaintiffs allege occurred in December of 2015, the Amended Complaint details a host of previous improprieties allegedly involving Professor Escobedo. According to the Complaint, it has been widely known for over a decade among faculty and students within the University's English Department that Professor Escobedo seeks sexual relationships with students and young faculty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67). It is alleged that both professors and students warn incoming graduate students that Professor Escobedo poses a threat to female students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83-84). According to the ECRC's report, Professor Escobedo admitted that three members of the faculty \"collectively decided that [he] is a 'sexual predator' \" and that one of those faculty members used to \"warn incoming graduate students that [he] was a 'sexual predator.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs set forth allegations regarding seven sets of factual circumstances. First, in 2003, Professor Escobedo made unwanted advances toward a graduate student in one of his classes, referred to as Complainant #3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102). He invited his class out for drinks at a local bar, where he placed his hands up her shirt and/or skirt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 104-05). A temporary adjunct professor witnessed Professor Escobedo place his hands inside Complainant #3's shirt and rub her back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106). This incident was not reported to the University at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B). Complainant #3 reported the conduct to ECRC on July 12, 2016, and ECRC found the allegations of sexual harassment to be substantiated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, in July of 2005, Professor Escobedo sexually harassed the temporary adjunct professor who witnessed the 2003 incident. The adjunct, referred to as Complainant #5, had gathered with her friends at a restaurant for dinner to celebrate her birthday, before walking to Tony's Tavern for drinks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 112-13). Professor Escobedo, who was not invited to the birthday celebration, showed up at Tony's Tavern and sat next to Complainant #5 at the bar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 114-15). Complainant #5 was wearing a skirt, and Professor Escobedo touched her legs and upper thighs while he sat next to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115). Some of Complainant #5's friends witnessed the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116). Around 2006, after Complainant #5 moved out of Ohio-and felt that Professor Escobedo could no longer negatively impact her career-she reported the incident to the ECRC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118). No record exists of this complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). ECRC found Complainant #5's allegations of sexual harassment against Professor Escobedo to be substantiated during their 2016 investigations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex B.). ECRC further noted that while ECRC no longer has a record of the report in 2006, \"multiple witnesses told the Investigator that there was an inquiry by [ECRC] into allegations against [Professor Escobedo] in 2006\" so the Investigator did not draw any conclusions from the absence of documentation of Complainant #5's 2006 communication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B., p. 66, n. 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Third, Professor Escobedo was involved in a sexual relationship with a female graduate student in 2006 while he was her doctoral thesis advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69, 132). Marsha Dutton, a now-retired English Professor, reported the relationship to Defendant Joseph McLaughlin, who was Chair of the English Department at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 137). Professor McLaughlin told her that he would ask Professor Escobedo-a close personal friend of his-about the relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 138). When Professor McLaughlin confronted Professor Escobedo, Professor Escobedo \"adamantly denied\" having the relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 139). Professor Dutton reported the relationship to the ECRC\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which then conducted a \"climate survey\" of the English Department, intended to determine if students in the English Department \"felt safe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Twenty individuals responded to the climate survey, twelve of whom reported that they were female and seven of whom reported that they were male. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74, Ex. A). The results of the climate survey indicate that six out of nineteen students disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement \"Overall, the climate for women in the English Department is good.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Comparatively, no students disagreed and only one out of twenty students strongly disagreed with the statement that \"Overall, the climate for men in the English Department is good.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nine students reported observing \"inappropriate sexist language, humor/jokes or comments\" once (3) or more than once (6), and six students said that they experienced such inappropriate sexist language, humor/jokes or comments once (2) or more than once (4). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Five students reported observing \"seductive remarks, including attempting to establish a sexual relationship\" and four students reported experiencing seductive remarks, including attempting to establish a sexual relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Six out of fourteen students responded \"no\" to the question \"I am familiar with the Ohio University Harassment Policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Three respondents indicated that they disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement \"I feel safe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition to the survey results, multiple course evaluations made reference to sexual harassment and sexual misconduct by a faculty member. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124). Mara Holt, a Professor in the University's English Department, was a member of the Administrative Committee of the English Department about a decade ago. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 122). The Committee was responsible for gathering and reviewing course evaluations submitted by students regarding their professors and courses from the preceding semester. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 123). Professor Holt stated that there was conflict among the Committee about how seriously to take the evaluations that referenced sexual misconduct by a faculty member. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125). She does not know if the faculty member was named. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124). Professor Dutton believes the references were to Professor Escobedo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Professor Escobedo was the Graduate Chair at the time the course evaluations were submitted, which is a position of power in relation to other faculty in the English Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite the potentially damning course evaluations and the survey results, no thorough investigation was conducted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 91, 128). Instead, general training for the faculty about sexual misconduct was recommended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 129). One English\n   Professor \"felt that the 2006 report was not treated with the seriousness that it deserved, and there were no restraints or consequences for [Defendant Escobedo].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80). Plaintiffs allege that Professor McLaughlin failed to investigate and deliberately downplayed the results of the survey because Professor Escobedo was a personal friend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87, 91, 130).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sometime between 2006 and the December 2015 incident involving the Plaintiffs, at least two additional sexual encounters occurred. First, Professor Escobedo made inappropriate sexual contact with Ayesha Hardison, who was a junior faculty member in the English Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 129). Ms. Hardison told a graduate student about the incident, but did not report the incident to the ECRC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Second, in 2011, Professor Escobedo tried to kiss Professor Jill Ingram, his faculty mentee, without her consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 131). She reported the incident to Professor McLaughlin, who responded that Professor Escobedo's personality was just \"like that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Professor Ingram asked Professor McLaughlin to intervene, but Professor McLaughlin stated that an intervention \"would not happen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Professor McLaughlin did not report the incident to the ECRC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Professor Ingram did not initially report the incident to the ECRC either, because she felt as though she could not make an official complaint because she depended on Professor Escobedo's recommendation for tenure.

Both of these arguments fail. The underlying harm in Plaintiffs' complaint is the sexual harassment that occurred against each of them-they are attempting to vindicate their own rights, not the rights of any of Professor Escobedo's previous victims. Plaintiffs have each clearly alleged their own injury, which occurred in December of 2015, within two years of the time they filed their complaint in March of 2017. Thus, Plaintiffs have standing and their claims are not time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants argue that the five previous acts Plaintiffs rely on for notice are insufficient as a matter of law to establish notice. (ECF No. 28 at 9). First, Defendants argue that the neither the climate survey nor the course evaluations mention Professor Escobedo specifically, nor do they involve the same degree of harassment. (ECF No. 36 at 4-5). Defendants correctly point out that the climate survey responses could be about graduate students experiencing \"seductive remarks\" from other graduate students, as the text is not, on its face, limited to faculty. This does not mean, however, that Plaintiffs \"can prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim which could entitle [them] to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/\">\n    526 U.S. 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 654,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (internal citations omitted). Discovery could show, for instance, that students were told that the survey was in relation to misconduct by faculty members and were instructed to respond accordingly. As to the course evaluations, it could be true, as Defendants allege, that Professor Dutton did not inform an appropriate person at the University that the faculty member referenced in the course evaluations was\n   Professor Escobedo. Or, discovery could reveal that Professor Dutton informed an appropriate person at the University and nothing was done. Similarly, it could be shown through discovery that the course surveys were in regards to a particular course taught by Professor Escobedo-making the lack of his name on the evaluation less of an evidentiary hurdle for Plaintiffs. In short, at this stage, the Court cannot say that Plaintiffs can prove no set of facts that would entitle them to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that Professor Dutton's 2006 report that Professor Escobedo was having a sexual relationship with a student is unsubstantiated and too distant in time to constitute notice. (ECF No. 36 at 6). Defendants rely on a footnote in ECFC's report stating, \"it appears that there was insufficient information for [ECFC] to proceed in 2006\" and that a witness (who appears to be Professor McLaughlin, as he was the \"Department Chair in 2006\"), said that the report was based upon rumors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, they argue, the 2006 incident was a rumor at best, which is not sufficient for notice. It does not escape this Court's notice, however, that this footnote stating \"it appears\" there was not enough information to proceed was based on Professor McLaughlin's own statement that it was a rumor. Such a statement could be read as self-serving, or discovery may later reveal that Professor McLaughlin's representation is accurate. Under these circumstances, Defendants have not proven as a matter of law that the 2006 report could not constitute notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the two reports of sexual misconduct against faculty members are not sufficient to provide notice because they involve co-workers, not students, and are too distant in time. The mere fact that Professor Escobedo's previous victims were not students is not enough to save the University from liability as a matter of law. In fact, considering these facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs reveals a pattern of preying on young women in the English Department. The Complaint alleges that both faculty victims were young, female members of the Department who were subordinate to Professor Escobedo. One victim (Complainant # 5) was a recent graduate and temporary adjunct professor who believed that Professor Escobedo could impact her career. (ECF No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 111, 117-18). The other victim (Jill Ingram) was a junior faculty member who was Professor Escobedo's mentee, and the Complaint alleges that the incident of sexual harassment occurred \"soon after [Defendant Escobedo] gained a position of authority over her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 131). In both instances, Professor Escobedo is alleged to have sexually assaulted females over whom he had some amount of authority and power. Whether that is sufficient to constitute reasonable notice \"does not lend itself well to a determination by the Court\" at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hart v.

Ohio Nov. 15, 2002) is instructive, as it resolves similar arguments made by Defendants regarding the notice prong. There, Defendant Harry Arnold was a teacher in the Paint Valley Local School District from 1973 until November of 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Plaintiff Williams was one of Arnold's fourth grade students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Williams alleged that Arnold inappropriately touched him over a two-week period, including rubbing the inside of his thigh and \"bumping against [his] genitalia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In 1976, four male students in Arnold's reading class alleged that he inappropriately touched them in essentially the same manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The 1976 conduct was reported to the school administration and school board, and the Principal conducted several interviews. The Principal determined that ongoing observations were in order and drew no final conclusions. Thereafter, the Principal made an effort to be more visible in Arnold's classroom, instructed him to keep his door open, and use aides more frequently.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Years later, in 1990, one of Arnold's sixth grade students alleged that Arnold inappropriately touched him in a substantially similar manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The student's parents met with the Principal and Arnold to report the allegations, and the Principal then notified the Superintendent, and Children Services. The Sheriff's Department and Children's Services conducted an investigation, which concluded that there was no substantiating evidence of the child's claims against Arnold's denial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board took no official action against Arnold and decided he could remain in the classroom, and the Principal once again instructed him to leave his door open and also told him to avoid being alone with students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No formal action resulted against Arnold from either the 1990 or the 1976 complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The defendants in\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   filed a motion for summary judgment arguing in part that the 1976 and 1990 allegations were not sufficient to constitute actual notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Namely, they argued that none of the previous allegations were substantiated and that the 1976 and 1990 acts were too remote in time to constitute notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   court held that\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   does not require that the appropriate official have actual knowledge of current abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Rather, the actual notice standard is met when an appropriate official has actual knowledge of a substantial risk of abuse to children in the school based on prior complaint of other students. While the complaints may be unsubstantiated by corroborating evidence and denied by the allegedly offending teacher, whether such complaints put the school district on notice of a substantial risk to students posed by a teacher is usually a question for the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court thus declined to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendants, since the Plaintiff presented at least enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the School Board knew of a substantial risk of abuse in light of the prior complaints against Arnold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   principles to the facts here, the Court finds that the previous incidents of harassment Plaintiffs point to for notice are not insufficient as a matter of law. The\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   court made clear that previous acts of abuse against victims other than the plaintiff can be considered in determining whether the actual notice standard is met to impose Title IX liability. Thus, Defendants' argument that there is no standing is without merit. Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   court relied on incidents that occurred nearly 20 years prior to the harassment against the plaintiff, so the argument that the claims are time barred or too remote in time must fail. So too must the argument that Plaintiffs cannot rely on unsubstantiated events as a matter of law-the\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   court held that whether such unsubstantiated events could be considered sufficient notice is a question usually for the jury. Thus, the Court will not give credence to Defendants' arguments that the alleged notice in this case is insufficient as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Deliberate Indifference\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Turning to the final prong, the University is only liable if its response to the harassment amounts to deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/\">\n    524 U.S. at 291-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(ECF No. 36 at 7-8). Specifically, they argue that in response to the rumor that Professor Escobedo was having a consensual sexual relationship with a student in 2006, Professor McLaughlin told Professor Dutton he would confront Professor Escobedo about it-which he did-and Professor Escobedo denied the allegations. Professor McLaughlin then allegedly contacted ECRC, which could not substantiate the rumor. After that, the climate survey was conducted, along with training in the English Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But, Defendants' arguments do not account for all of the previous allegations discussed above-allegations which could, through discovery, lead to a finding of deliberate indifference. For example, plaintiffs also allege that the survey results\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   should have led to further investigation. It is not clear, what, if anything, was done in response to the course evaluations or the report from the adjunct professor that she was harassed in a way substantially similar to Plaintiffs' allegations. Plaintiffs are entitled to further discovery on these issues. As the\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   court stated, the deliberate indifference standard-whether a school's reaction was clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances-\"does not lend itself well to a determination\" by the court at the summary judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. This statement is even more potent at the motion to dismiss stage, a stage at which Plaintiffs have not been given an opportunity to conduct full discovery into how the University responded to each instance of previous misconduct. Of course, \"in appropriate cases, a court may determine as a matter of law that conduct is not 'clearly unreasonable' \" but given the facts alleged here, it cannot be said that Plaintiffs failed to allege enough facts in their complaint to state a claim that would entitle them to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts at this stage, which, if taken as true, could state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis NextFriend LaShonda D. v.

Plaintiffs argue that Professor McLaughlin's response to Defendant Escobedo's sexual relationship with a student in 2006 and his response to Jill Ingram's report of sexual harassment in 2011 exhibited the requisite deliberate indifference to establish that Professor McLaughlin violated a constitutional right. (ECF No. 34 at 28). Defendants argue that the 2006 relationship was unsubstantiated-and to the extent it was substantiated it was consensual-such that even if Professor McLaughlin was on notice of the allegations, his response was not deliberately indifferent as a matter of law. (ECF No. 28 at 12). As to the 2011 incident, Defendants argue that Professor McLaughlin was not in a position to take appropriate action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As discussed above, however, \"these are factual issues not appropriate for determination at the pleading stage, much less on the basis of qualified immunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Ohio 2014). Plaintiffs do allege sufficient facts to survive the motion to dismiss stage. For example, they allege that Professor McLaughlin responded to the 2011 incident of harassment by stating Professor Escobedo is just \"like that\" and he did not report the conduct to the ECRC. (ECF No. 23 at \u00b6 131). They allege that Professor McLaughlin knew about the sexual harassment and the risk posed by Professor Escobedo, but that he acted with deliberate indifference because of his close personal relationship with Professor Escobedo.

They further allege that Professor Escobedo's sexual misconduct was \"widely known\" throughout the Department, that both faculty and students warned incoming students about him, and that a reasonable department chair would have investigated his behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83, 84, 235, 331). Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Professor McLaughlin \"interfered and attempted to stop any attempts to report the misconduct to the ECRC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135). There are questions of fact regarding what, exactly, Professor McLaughlin knew and when, what his reactions were and whether they were reasonable, and whether he was in a position to remediate the threats.

The facts alleged in the Complaint in reference to Professor McLaughlin all relate to his allegedly deliberate indifferent response to past allegations of sexual misconduct.

While Plaintiffs state that \"Defendant McLaughlin continues to act with deliberate different [sic] toward formal reports,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 320) such a conclusory allegation is not sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Allard v.
