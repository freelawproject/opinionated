The \"specifically identifiable fund\" changed from one which the plaintiff could seek reimbursement as an equitable remedy to one immune from process, petition, levy, execution, or sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"924739\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/423/134/\">\n    620 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1147 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rajaratnam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7256183\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/83/170/#p174\">\n    83 A.3d at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the settlement funds were converted into the property of both Mr. and Mrs. Weida as tenants by the entireties, they became the general assets of the couple, and outside the reach of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montanile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (An ERISA fiduciary cannot enforce an equitable lien against a\n   defendant's general assets). Any constructive trust or equitable lien attached to the settlement funds was extinguished.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n    at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (If, instead of preserving the specific fund subject to the lien, the defendant dissipated the entire fund on nontraceable items, that complete dissipation eliminated the lien.... At equity, a plaintiff ordinarily could not enforce any type of equitable lien if the defendant once possessed a separate, identifiable fund to which the lien attached, but then dissipated it all. The plaintiff could not attach the defendant's general assets instead because those assets were not part of the specific thing to which the lien attached). Accordingly, the equitable lien having been extinguished, any claim the plaintiff would have over the defendant is a legal one, and not available under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, even if the settlement funds were not converted to property owned as tenants by the entireties, the plaintiff's claim would still fail. By the time the plaintiff filed a complaint in this court, the settlement funds had been dissipated. There was no way to trace and identify whose money was used to pay what because the settlement fund could no longer be separately identified. Money from the joint account was spent on items that were the joint property of the husband and wife. For example, the money in the joint checking account was used to pay a couple of mortgage payments on the jointly owned residence. This residence has been owned by Mr. and Mrs. Weida as tenants by the entireties for more than twenty years. As such, it is a general asset of the Weidas, and cannot be considered a separate, identifiable asset of the defendant alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   There was also testimony that loans from various family members of the defendant and his wife were repaid with the settlement funds. Some of the loans were made to assist the Weidas in paying their joint mortgage during Mr. Weida's recuperation from the accident. These loans were made before the settlement funds existed and payments on the mortgage were made from the private loans, not from the settlement funds. Those funds, however, cannot be classified as an identifiable asset solely for the benefit of the defendant. The marital home was purchased twenty years before the settlement funds came into existence and is owned by the defendant and his spouse, jointly, as tenants by the entireties. The home is subject to a mortgage with a payoff balance of approximately $120,000.00. No lien can attach to the jointly owned home because the husband and wife are not jointly liable to the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, some of the money in the joint checking account was also used to repay a loan taken from Mr. Weida's 401(k) pension plan in 2010. The defendant repaid that loan in August 2014. The money taken out as a loan was part of that pension plan years before the settlement. Repayment of the loan did not create a separate asset of the defendant, because it had already been in existence for years before the settlement funds were ever created. The 401(k) plan is a general asset of the defendant, and was not created from the settlement funds.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    At the Rule 16 Conference, defense counsel indicated that when the defendant received the settlement funds, he and his wife waited six months for the plaintiff \"to file something\" but when it did not, they placed the money in a joint fund and paid off their mortgage. Post-hearing discovery has revealed, as shown below, that this statement is not quite accurate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The complaint was filed nine months after the Plan was notified of the impending distribution of the settlement funds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Money from the joint checking account, i.e., $3,000.00, was also spent on the purchase of a motor vehicle. This payment occurred on September 29, 2014, seven and a half weeks after the deposit of the settlement funds, and after those funds were spent. The joint checking account is a general asset of the defendant and his wife, and consists of monies deposited by them, not traceable to a portion of the settlement funds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Finally, Carpenter Technology cannot trace from where the money came to pay two mortgage payments, to repay the family\n    loans, or to repay the 401(k) loan. The joint checking account is owned by both the defendant and his wife and consists of several sources of money, not traceable to any specific deposit. The joint account consists of paychecks, pension payments, monies already in the account prior to the deposit of the settlement funds, and monies over and above the medical lien.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The plaintiff seeks equitable relief where such relief is no longer possible. Equitable remedies \"are, as a general rule, directed against some specific thing; they give or enforce a right to or over some particular thing ... rather than a right to recover a sum of money generally out of the defendant's assets.\"\n    <em>\n     Montanile\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 658-659\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In its supplemental letter brief, Carpenter Technology argues,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    \"Just putting the settlement funds into a bank account, whether it is with his wife or another, doesn't destroy the lien. To hold otherwise would allow wrongdoers to get away with avoiding liens by the simple expedient of immediately depositing the money into a joint account.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Document # 23 at 1. The Supreme Court addressed a similar argument in\n    <em>\n     Montanile\n    </em>\n    , and held, \"Even though the defendant's conduct was wrongful, the plaintiff could not attach the defendant's general assets instead. If, instead of preserving the specific fund subject to the lien, the defendant dissipated the entire fund, that complete dissipation eliminated the lien.\"\n    <em>\n     Montanile\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 659\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court continued, \"where a person wrongfully dispose[d] of the property of another but the property cannot be traced into any product, the other ... cannot enforce a constructive trust or lien\n    <em>\n     upon any part of the wrongdoer's property.\n    </em>\n    \" The plaintiff had \"merely a personal claim against the wrongdoer\"-a quintessential action at law.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting Restatement (First) of Restitution \u00a7 215(1) ). Here, by the time Carpenter Technology sought relief, it was too late. The \"particular thing\" no longer existed. Any claim it might now have against Mr. Weida is, therefore, a personal one against the defendant's general assets. Recovering out of those assets is a legal remedy, not an equitable one. I will grant the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    In conclusion, Carpenter Technology had an equitable lien by agreement that attached to Mr. Weida's settlement funds when he obtained title to those funds. And, the nature of its underlying remedy would have been equitable had it objected immediately upon notice or sued to enforce the lien against the settlement funds before Mr. Weida deposited the funds into the joint checking account.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Montanile\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The settlement funds subject to the medical lien were never kept as a separate, identifiable asset. They were converted to a general asset of the defendant and his wife as tenants by the entireties, and thus out of the reach of the plaintiff. Further, the factual evidence indicates that the settlement funds were entirely dissipated before the complaint was filed, and that the defendant commingled the settlement funds with his and his wife's general assets. Carpenter Technology cannot collect against the defendant's general assets or his assets jointly owned with his wife. The settlement funds no longer exist as a separate identifiable fund, and thus the relief requested cannot be granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    An appropriate Order follows.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
