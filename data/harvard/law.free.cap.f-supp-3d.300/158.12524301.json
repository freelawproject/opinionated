Compl. [Dkt. # 1] \u00b6\u00b6 5-16. Plaintiffs allege that defendants have engaged in \"ongoing illegal, unconstitutional surveillance of millions of Americans,\" including high-profile Americans, such as the Chief Justice of the United States, President Donald J.

According to plaintiffs, \"each and every\" defendant has engaged in \"ongoing illegal, unconstitutional surveillance of millions of Americans, including prominent Americans such as the [C]hief [J]ustice of the U.S. Supreme Court, other justices, 156 judges, prominent businessmen and others such as Donald J.

He claims that, on August 19, 2015, he was induced by the FBI, under the direction of Comey, to turn over 47 hard drives, valued in excess of $50,000, which allegedly contained evidence of defendants' unconstitutional mass surveillance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. Specifically, this evidence consisted of 600,000,000 pages of data on over 20 million Americans, much of which was collected on behalf of the U.S. Government on computers supplied by the FBI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Aff. of Dennis Montgomery in Supp. of Pls.' Mot. TRO &amp; Prelim. Inj. (\"Montgomery Aff.\") [Dkt. # 9] \u00b6 4. Montgomery alleges that he only gave the hard drives to the FBI because the FBI expressly promised that it would conduct an investigation of the mass surveillance. Compl. \u00b6 38. Former General Counsel of the FBI, James Baker (\"Baker\"), allegedly assured plaintiffs that Comey was taking \"hands on\" supervision of the Montgomery investigation, given its importance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. Comey and the FBI, however, never conducted the investigation, and Montgomery alleges that they are concealing the hard drives in order \"to ensure that the evidence contained therein is not investigated or revealed to the public and prosecuted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Montgomery also claims that, on or around December 21, 2015, he was interviewed under oath at the FBI field office in Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. During that three-hour interview, which was recorded on videotape, Montgomery set forth the NSA, CIA, and DNI's pattern and practice of unconstitutional mass surveillance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although plaintiffs have contacted Baker numerous times regarding the status of the Montgomery investigation, they have been ignored.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.

But in order to establish that defendants' conduct caused a chilling effect sufficient to constitute a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must first sufficiently allege that they have reason to believe that they were actually surveilled. As I have already concluded, however, plaintiffs have not made this showing.

Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In Count III of their Complaint, plaintiffs request preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop the government from wiretapping and surveilling them in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81-88. In their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, plaintiffs request additional equitable relief that encompasses Counts V, VI, and VII of their Complaint. Specifically, plaintiffs request that I issue an order enjoining defendants from: (1) destroying evidence of their constitutional violations contained on Montgomery's hard drives; (2) destroying documents related to Montgomery's interview with the FBI; and (3) continuing their conversion of Montgomery's hard drives. Pls.' Mot. 15-16. Unfortunately for plaintiffs, I find that they have not met their burden for a preliminary injunction for any of the relief that they seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To begin with, plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   on any of the claims that form the basis of their motion for a preliminary injunction. As discussed, plaintiffs cannot prevail on their Fourth Amendment claim regarding unlawful surveillance because they lack standing to do so, they cannot prevail on their common-law tort claims for conversion and fraudulent misrepresentation because they have sued the wrong parties, and they cannot prevail on their claim under the Privacy Act because the requested documents are exempt from disclosure. Plaintiffs thus have failed to satisfy the first-and most important-factor for a preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Because I have already concluded that plaintiffs' allegations of government surveillance and hacking arc speculative, at best, those allegations necessarily cannot support a finding of irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

And plaintiffs' allegations of conversion, non-disclosure, and fraudulent misrepresentation fare no better. Plaintiffs allege that they would suffer irreparable harm if Montgomery's hard drives and video interview are not preserved because they constitute \"direct proof\" of defendants' unconstitutional spying on which this lawsuit is premised. Pls.' Mot. 16. The harm that plaintiffs fear, however, is unwarranted. At the status conference in this case, counsel for the Government defendants represented to this Court that the \"hard drives are in a secure facility with the [I]ntelligence [C]ommunity's Office of Inspector General\" and that there was \"no risk\" that they were \"going to be destroyed anytime soon.\" Status Hr'g Tr. 15:13-18, 19:13-15, June 23, 2017. I also instructed the Government to put a litigation hold on the video of the interview, as well as any related FD-302 reports,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319650\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/888/28/#p31\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319650\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/888/28/#p31\">\n    at 33:16-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Government has confirmed that it has done so. Gov't Defs.' Mem. 42. Plaintiffs therefore cannot show that the impending\n   harm they fear is anything more than theoretical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs have not shown that the balance of equities weighs in favor of granting a preliminary injunction here. Plaintiffs' primary argument on this point is that, without preservation of the hard drives and the interview tapes, they \"will lose the material evidence in this case.\" Pls.' Mot. 18. But as I have already explained, the Government has represented to this Court that there is a litigation hold preventing the destruction of either the hard drives or the interview tapes. There is accordingly no need for a preliminary injunction to ensure that plaintiffs' material evidence is preserved. Plaintiffs also claim that public interest considerations counsel in favor of issuing an injunction here because \" '[i]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am.

But, as I have already concluded, plaintiffs have not made the requisite showing that a constitutional violation actually occurred here. Plaintiffs accordingly cannot show that it would be in the public interest to grant an injunction to prevent the alleged unconstitutional surveillance they allege has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This case marks what I expect will be the end of this Court's role in adjudicating plaintiff Klayman's challenges to the Government's various surveillance programs. While the diligence with which Klayman has sought to protect Americans' constitutional rights against Government overreach over the last four and a half years is admirable, the allegations in this case, though sincerely advanced, are largely frivolous and duplicative of ones I have already found to be insufficient in\n   <em>\n    Klayman I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Klayman II\n   </em>\n   .
