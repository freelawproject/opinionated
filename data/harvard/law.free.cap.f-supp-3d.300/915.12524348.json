After reviewing the briefs, the record, and the relevant law, the Court issues the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit, brought by Thomas Munroe III and Karen Munroe (\"the Munroes\"), concerns the death of their son, Richard \"Brick\" Alexander Munroe, in the early hours of July 5, 2015. Munroe called 911 shortly before 4:00 a.m. that morning. He told the 911 call taker that he wanted someone to talk to. The 911 call taker informed him, when asked, that she would\n   not send police officers, but that as a routine response officers would drive around the three-mile radius of his location, which they could determine based on the information his cell phone transmitted to cell phone towers. However, the officers who self-assigned to the call-Matthew Murphy, Stephen Johnson, and John Nelson-were able to pinpoint Munroe's address with the help of the dispatcher by searching for Munroe's cell phone number in a database and finding a record associated with it. When they arrived, as they were beginning to secure the perimeter of the house, Johnson saw through a window of the house that Munroe appeared to be holding a handgun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Munroe came out of the house briefly, went back inside, and then came out once more. The second time, as he was standing on the front step of the house, Murphy attempted to calm Munroe down and told him to put the gun down. Munroe sat down on the step, put the gun in his lap, and removed his right hand from the gun. His left hand was holding his cell phone to his ear-he was still speaking to the 911 call taker. While Munroe's gun was in his lap, Murphy came out from behind the tree where he had been taking cover, approached Munroe, and fired his taser. Little more than one second after Munroe deployed his taser, gunshots rang out. The parties dispute what happened leading up to the gunshots.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The officers contend that the taser was ineffective, and that Murphy, Johnson, and Nelson only began firing at Munroe after Munroe had pointed his gun at Murphy. The Munroes assert that it is possible that the taser was in fact effective, causing Richard Munroe to fall over, and that there is physical evidence from the autopsy suggesting that he was tased in the back (not in the front, as Murphy testified). They say-based on interviews conducted after the incident with Nelson and with Kelli Barge, a civilian rider who witnessed the incident from Johnson's car-that Murphy shot Munroe as he was falling over to his left, away from Murphy, and that he was therefore not reaching his gun up in Murphy's direction. Less than two seconds after Murphy used his taser, gunshots were fired. The three officers fired a total of 23 rounds, six of which hit Munroe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Munroes bring this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 1983\") and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), against the officers who killed Richard Munroe, the City of Austin (the \"City\"), and Art Acevedo, the police chief at the time.

At the time that Murphy deployed his taser, Murphy had instructed Munroe to \"put the gun down.\" (Murphy Dash Cam Video, Dkt. 23-5, at 4:13:20). Munroe put the gun in his lap, but the parties dispute whether that action complied with the order to put his gun down. Murphy believed that Munroe had not complied with his order because the gun was still in Munroe's lap and therefore \"in his possession.\" (Murphy Dep., Dkt. 23-9, at 69:16-22). The Munroes contend that he was complying with the order because he had put the gun down. (Pls.' Resp., Dkt. 29, at 17). Whether or not Munroe's action technically complied with Murphy's order, the parties agree that the gun was in Munroe's lap at the time Murphy tased him. Murphy did so in an attempt to \"achieve ... neuromuscular incapacitation,\" after he \"saw a very-what I presumed to be a very small window to take action, so I went forward and took that action.\" (Murphy Dep., Dkt. 23-9, at 71:25, 72:25-73:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The lack of clearly established law on this point at the time is illustrated most clearly by\n   <em>\n    Carroll v. Ellington\n   </em>\n   , where a deputy sheriff, \"[u]nsatisfied with [the suspect's] decision to sit in a chair rather than comply with [the deputy's] order to get down on the floor,\" used his taser on a person suspected of trespass and vandalism who was sitting in a chair.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055128\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/154/#p163\">\n    800 F.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 (5th Cir. 2015). The court declined to reach \"the close constitutional question\" of whether a reasonable jury could find that use of force to be excessive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055128\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/154/#p163\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055128\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/154/#p163\">\n    174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That case, decided the month after this incident took place, demonstrates that Murphy was not on notice that his taser use was unconstitutional in the manner required to overcome the \"clearly established\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   prong of qualified immunity. The person who was tased in\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   was suspected of a crime, but not a particularly serious one. He also did not have a gun. The court found it to be a close question whether that use of force was unconstitutional. Here, Munroe was not suspected of a crime, but he did have a gun within reach at the time Murphy tased him. He had blood on his arm, (Johnson Dep., Dkt. 23-8, at 19:8-19), the source of which was unknown to the officers. The officers also did not know whether or not anyone else was in the house at the time. Murphy's attempt to use less than lethal force to defuse the situation did not violate clearly established law; he is therefore entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the use of his taser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    2. Gun\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Less than two seconds after he deployed his taser, Murphy began firing his gun at Munroe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Murphy's version of events were credited, Murphy's decision to begin shooting Munroe was objectively reasonable. Murphy contends he shot his gun in response to Munroe grabbing the gun from his lap and bringing it up towards Murphy. (Murphy Dep., Dkt. 23-9, at 75:23-25). If that was the case, Murphy \"reasonably believed that the suspect posed a threat of serious harm to the officer or others.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237980\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/767/#p772\">\n    745 F.3d at 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and brackets omitted). However, the Munroes have pointed to evidence that, if credited, would shed doubt on this account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   a. Constitutional Violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Munroes first note that punctures consistent with a taser wound were found on Richard Munroe's back, which Murphy cannot account for because he maintains that Munroe was facing him when Murphy tased Munroe. Murphy testified that he did not tase Munroe in the back. (Murphy Dep., Dkt. 23-9, at 81:5). He also testified that Munroe was not tased more than once, and he could not provide an explanation for why the only evidence of a taser mark on Munroe's body was on his back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:6-11). Dr. Kendall Crowns, the Travis County deputy assistant medical examiner who prepared Munroe's autopsy, testified that two puncture wounds on Munroe's lower back were consistent with a taser probe. (Crowns Dep., Dkt. 29-17, at 89:15-90:6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Medical Examiner Report, Dkt. 29-14, at 21 (\"There are two superficial puncture wounds of the lower left side of the back measuring 0.4 x 0.3 cm and 0.2 x 0.1 cm.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41 (\"Additionally, two apparent puncture marks were observed to the decedent's left lower back. It was speculated by APD that the apparent puncture marks might be consistent with the taser prongs.\")). Kelli Barge, a civilian who was seated in Johnson's car at the time, witnessed the incident. Her police statement reveals that after she heard the taser go off, she saw that Munroe \"rolled over to his left and his body twisted a bit and [he] yelled out. Then I hear[d] shots being fired.\" (Barge Statement, Dkt. 29-19, at 4; Audio Recording of Barge Statement, Dkt. 29-15, at 22:34-23:57). Additionally, Nelson described Munroe's movement after Murphy deployed his taser as a \"defensive jerk\" and stated it looked like Munroe was \"getting away from Murphy ... it just kind of was like a ... turn or a jerk, uh,\n   like away from Officer Murphy.\" (Nelson SIU Interview, Dkt. 29-25, at 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is therefore sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Munroe was, as Murphy contends, moving his gun in Murphy's direction at the time that Murphy began shooting. This dispute is material because it would not have been reasonable for Murphy to shoot Munroe if he was falling over and not raising his gun at Murphy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lytle v.

If that is what happened, then Johnson could not have seen Munroe raise his gun at Murphy. More to the point, if that is what happened, Johnson saw Munroe falling away from Murphy and not raising his gun.

Even when drawing every inference in favor of the Munroes, Nelson's reaction was objectively reasonable. Nelson knew that Munroe had a gun and was very close to Murphy. When he heard gunshots it meant that one of two things was happening: (1) Munroe was shooting at Murphy, or (2) Murphy was shooting at Munroe. Either way, his response was reasonable. It would of course be reasonable to employ deadly force if Munroe was firing at Nelson's fellow officer. And if Murphy was firing at Munroe, it was reasonable for Nelson to believe that Murphy had a legitimate reason for doing so, especially since Nelson was aware that Munroe had a gun within reach and had been behaving erratically. Given the information available to Nelson at the time, his action was objectively reasonable. Therefore, he is entitled to qualified immunity; the motion for summary judgment with respect to Nelson granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The City points to evidence that it provided 40 hours of crisis intervention training to each officer when they were cadets at APD Training Academy. (Turner Aff., Dkt. 25-4, \u00b6 6). The City has attached the entirety of its lengthy crisis intervention training materials to its motion for summary judgment. (Training Materials, Dkts. 25-4-25-14). When the officers completed the training, it exceeded the state-mandated minimum of 16 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Each of the Officers completed this training. (Spangler Aff., Dkt. 2, \u00b6 9; Nelson Training Record; Dkt. 25-17, at 5; Murphy Training Record, Dkt. 25-17, at 11; Johnson Training Record, Dkt. 25-17, at 16). The Munroes do not mention anything about Acevedo personally in their response to the motion for summary judgment, nor do they identify any specific failures in the supervision of the Officers. They assert the generalized allegation that \"there was a failure in coordination and communication\" and that \"[w]hen there is no shift sergeant on duty and a corporal is in charge and handling supervisory duties, he or she should not have more than one shift to supervise.\" (Pls.' Resp. City's Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 31, at 10). The City has produced evidence that Corporal Hector Campos was only in charge of one shift, (Campos Dep., Dkt. 34-2, at 25:19-26:20). But even assuming that the Munroe's statements are true, they have not put forth sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to whether any failure in supervision reached the level of deliberate indifference. The motion for summary judgment as to the claims against Acevedo is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    V. ADA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, the Munroes bring a claim pursuant to the ADA, contending that the City denied Richard Munroe a reasonable accommodation of his mental disability. (Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43). The ADA claim is directly controlled by\n   <em>\n    Hainze v. Richards\n   </em>\n   and therefore must be dismissed. In\n   <em>\n    Hainze\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that \"Title II does not apply to an officer's on-the-street responses to reported disturbances or other similar incidents, whether or not those calls involve subjects with mental disabilities, prior to the officer's securing the scene and ensuring that there is no threat to human life.\"\n   <em>\n    Hainze v.

Although in hindsight it appears that Munroe's BB gun probably was not a threat to the officers at the scene, because the gun was in appearance an exact replica of a real handgun, they could not have known that at the time. They cannot be said to have finished securing the scene before shooting Richard Munroe; rather, they did so in the process of attempting to secure the scene.\n   <em>\n    Hainze\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454313\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/207/795/#p801\">\n    207 F.3d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To require the officers to factor in whether their actions are going to comply with the ADA, in the presence of exigent circumstances and prior to securing the safety of themselves, other officers, and nearby civilians, would pose an unnecessary risk to innocents.\"). Indeed, the Munroes do not respond to the City's argument\n   that\n   <em>\n    Hainze\n   </em>\n   forecloses their ADA claim in this case. The City has put forth sufficient evidence to shift the summary judgment burden to the Munroes by pointing to deposition testimony that the Officers \"were in the process of securing the scene and assessing the situation when Munroe suddenly appeared with blood on his body and waving a gun in their direction.\" (City's Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 25, at 19 (citing Murphy Dep., Dkt. 15, at 47; Johnson Dep., Dkt. 16, at 20-21)). The Munroes have not put forth any evidence to suggest that there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the Officers had completed securing the scene at the time of the shooting. Therefore, summary judgment must be granted in favor of the City with respect to the Munroes' ADA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18 (\"There is a fact dispute as to whether Officer Murphy fired his taser and firearm at the same time.\")). They provide no cases to support undertaking such an analysis. The reasonableness inquiry is fact-dependent, and the alleged facts leading up to the use of the taser differ significantly from those immediately preceding the gunshots, as do the levels of harm the two separate methods of force can produce. Because the video from Johnson's dash cam shows clearly that the taser deployment and the first shot were separated by at least one second, and because the two methods of force are so different with respect to the consequences that may result from their use,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Batiste v.

Additionally, the officers proffer different justifications for the reasonableness of each use of force: Murphy's justification for the use of his taser was to \"allow the officers to gain control of Munroe's gun,\" (the officers do not contend that Munroe was holding his gun at the time Murphy used his taser), (Officers' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 23, at 12); the justification for the shooting is that Munroe allegedly brought his gun up towards Murphy. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Although Johnson's dash cam video is grainy, it does provide audio that makes clear the timing of both the taser deployment and the initial gunshots. Between 4:14:03 and 4:14:06, Murphy moves from his cover up towards the house, near Munroe. The sound of the taser can be heard at 4:14:06; the first gunshot is fired at 4:14:07. The plaintiffs' expert estimates that the time between the taser deployment and the first gunshot is 1.16 seconds. (Report, Dkt. 29-16, at 14).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    In the abstract, the result (the two officers who claim they fired because they saw a gun being pointed at one of them are denied qualified immunity; the officer who did not see the gun pointed is granted qualified immunity) may seem perverse. However, this conclusion is compelled by the evidence available at the summary judgment stage. The evidence produced by the Munroes would give a jury reasonable grounds for finding that Murphy and Johnson acted in a way that violated Munroe's clearly established constitutional rights. However, even if a jury were to find that Murphy and Johnson acted unreasonably because they could not have seen Munroe pointing his gun because he was actually falling away from Murphy at the time, Nelson's shooting in response to the sound of gunshots would still be objectively reasonable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    As the City notes in its brief, the allegation that the City employed excessive force disproportionately against minorities is irrelevant here, because Richard Munroe was a white male.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
