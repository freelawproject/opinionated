Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BEFORE THE COURT is: (1) Third-Party Defendant Metropolitan Group Property and Casualty Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 44); (2) Plaintiff Scottsdale's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 48); (3) Defendants Season Hamilton, Glenn Thornton, and Estate of E.T.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 49); and (4) Defendant Lee and Julie Thornton's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 53). Plaintiff and all Defendants filed Response briefs to Plaintiff and Defendants' Motions. (ECF No. 59); (ECF No. 63); (ECF No. 67). Plaintiff and all Defendants filed Reply briefs. (ECF No. 68); (ECF No. 69); (ECF No. 70). Plaintiff took no position on Met Life's Motion (ECF No. 58), and Defendants stated they had no objection to that Motion (ECF No. 73), (ECF No. 74). All Motions were submitted for decision without oral argument. This Order memorializes the court's ruling on the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The MetLife Policy provided coverage only for the Toyota Highlander. Metlife asserts its Policy provides no coverage for the U-Haul truck or the U-Haul operation. (ECF No. 44 at 5). The parties do not oppose MetLife's Motion. The court finds there is no genuine issue of fact that the\n   MetLife Policy does not provide coverage for the U-Haul accident and summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At all material times, Defendant Lee Thornton owned and operated the Malo Store, located at 17510 N. Highway 21, Malo, Washington 99150. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6 2). He had run the Malo Store since September 2003. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6 3). As part of the Malo Store operation, Lee Thornton was, since January, 2003, a registered agent of U-Haul to rent, receive, and display U-Haul trucks. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Scottsdale Insurance Company (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Scottsdale\") issued Commercial General Liability policy No. CPS2343072 (\"Scottsdale Policy\") to the Malo Store which had a policy period of October 14, 2015, to October 14, 2016. (ECF No. 51-1 at 4). The Malo Store application listed \"grocery\" and \"gas pump\" in the schedule of hazards (ECF No. 51-2 at 2). The application did not disclose or seek insurance coverage for a truck rental business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 51-2). The application answered \"N[o]\" when asked \"DO YOU RENT OR LOAN EQUIPMENT TO OTHERS\" and \"ANY PARKING FACILITIES OWNED/RENTED.\" (ECF No. 51-2 at 4). The application was signed by Lee Thornton. (ECF No. 51-2 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Scottsdale Policy excludes claims for \" 'Bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, 'auto' or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\" (ECF No. 51-1 at 15, \u00a7 I(A)(2)(g) ). This exclusion does not apply to \"[p]arking an 'auto' on, or on the ways next to, premises you own or rent, provided the 'auto' is not owned by or rented or loaned to you or the insured.\" (ECF No. 51-1 at 15, \u00a7 I(A)(2)(g)(3) ). The Scottsdale Policy defines \"auto\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   a. A land motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer designed for travel on public roads, including any attached machinery or equipment; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   b. Any other land vehicle that is subject to a compulsory or financial responsibility law or other motor vehicle insurance law where it is licensed or principally garaged. However, \"auto\" does not include \"mobile equipment\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (ECF No. 51-1 at 24, \u00a7 V(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 7, 2015, the Malo Store entered into its then current Agreement with U-Haul Company of Inland Northwest. (ECF No. 66 at 1). Pursuant to the Agreement, the U-Haul equipment is \"consigned to [Malo Store] and title to the Equipment shall remain in U-Haul and/or one of its affiliates at all times.\" (ECF No. 66 at 1). The Store's obligations to U-Haul included \"prominently displaying the Equipment, distributing the Equipment ... [and] dispatching and receiving the equipment.\" (ECF No. 66 at 5). The Store was also obligated to complete \"all relevant inspections, inquiries and paperwork, checking and correcting the tire pressure, fluid levels, non-functioning lights, cleanliness and visible damage ... [and] perform repair work designated as minor maintenance on the Equipment.\" (ECF No. 66 at 5). U-Haul required the Malo Store to \"account for all odometer mileage accumulated on the Equipment\" and the Malo Store paid \"for any mileage not properly accounted for on a valid rental contract.\" (ECF No. 66 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third Party Defendant Metropolitan Group Property and Casualty Insurance Company (\"MetLife\") issued Auto Policy No. 161072257-0 (\"MetLife Policy\") to Defendant Julie Thornton with effective dates June 1, 2016 to December 1, 2016. (ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   No. 46-1 at 3). Julie Thornton is the wife of Lee Thornton (collectively \"Thornton Defendants\"). (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 3); (ECF No. 18 at \u00b6 3). The MetLife Policy lists Julie and Lee Thornton as household drivers. (ECF No. 46-1 at 4). The only insured vehicle on the MetLife Policy is a 2009 Toyota Highlander. (ECF No. 46-1 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 5, 2016, Glenn Thornton and Season Hamilton, individually and as co-administrators of the estate of E.T. (collectively \"Hamilton Defendants\" in this matter) filed a First Amended Complaint for Wrongful Death, Pre-Death Pain and Suffering, Loss of Parent/Child Consortium in case number 16-2-00083-9 in the Ferry County Superior Court against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Lee and Julie Thornton and the Malo Store. (ECF No. 51-4). On May 23, 2017, the Hamilton Defendants filed a Second Amended Complaint in the Ferry County court. (ECF No. 51-5);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton, et al. v. Thornton, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-2-00083-9, Dkt. # 30 (Ferry County Superior Court) (\"Ferry County lawsuit\"). The underlying facts as alleged in the Ferry County lawsuit, are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 9, 2016, customer Mike Seifried returned a rented U-Haul truck to the Malo Store. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12); (ECF No. 51-5 at \u00b6 2.9). Seifried parked the truck in front of the Malo Store, entered the Store, returned the keys, and asked for his deposit. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11). Lee Thornton returned the deposit, took Seifried's paperwork, and set it on the counter because Lee Thornton was assisting other customers. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). Seifried left the Store. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6 13). Thereafter, Lee Thornton left the store to park the returned U-Haul truck in the designated display area. (ECF No. 64 at \u00b6 15). When Lee Thornton went outside, his two year old grandson, E.T., followed him. (ECF No. 51-5 at \u00b6 2.17). E.T. was accidently knocked to the ground and run over by the U-Haul truck driven by Lee Thornton, causing E.T.'s death. (ECF No. 51-5 at \u00b6\u00b6 2.21, 2.22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Ferry County lawsuit alleges Lee Thornton was negligent in operating the U-Haul truck and failed to take precautions to prevent two-year old E.T. from following him outside. (ECF No. 51-5 at \u00a7 III). The Thornton Defendants tendered the Ferry County lawsuit to Scottsdale. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 26); (ECF No. 18 at \u00b6 26). Scottsdale agreed to defend the Thornton Defendants against the Ferry County lawsuit, subject to a reservation of rights. (ECF No. 51-6); (ECF No. 51-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 21, 2017, Scottsdale filed the Complaint in this court seeking declaratory relief regarding its duty to defend the Thorntons in the Ferry County lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1). On July 24, August 1, and August 2, 2017, the parties filed their competing Motions for Summary Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 44); (ECF No. 48); (ECF No. 49); (ECF No. 53). Response and Reply briefs were filed in September, 2017. No party requested oral argument on the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The purpose of summary judgment is to avoid unnecessary trials when there is no dispute as to the material facts before the court.\n   <em>\n    Northwest Motorcycle Ass'n v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515259\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/1468/#p1471\">\n    18 F.3d 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1471 (9th Cir. 1994). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment when, viewing the evidence and the inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 ;\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p252\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p252\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p252\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). While the moving party does not have to disprove matters on which the opponent will bear the burden of proof at trial, they nonetheless bear the burden of producing evidence that negates an essential element\n   of the opposing party's claim and the ultimate burden of persuading the court no genuine issue of material fact exists.\n   <em>\n    Nissan Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Companies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11533921\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/1099/#p1102\">\n    210 F.3d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1102 (9th Cir. 2000). When the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\n   <em>\n    Devereaux v. Abbey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486755\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/263/1070/#p1076\">\n    263 F.3d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (9th Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Once the moving party has carried its burden, the opponent must do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

The Hamiltons assert Lee Thornton was negligent in his supervision of E.T. which allowed E.T. to leave the store and walk to the parking lot. (ECF No. 49 at 5-6). Lee Thornton's alleged negligent supervision exposed E.T. to injury that \"could have occurred anywhere at any time throughout the business day, and in many ways and places.\" (ECF No. 49 at 6). The Hamiltons also argue the Scottsdale Policy covered the parking of vehicles at the Malo Store's gas station and, by extension, applied to the parking of the U-Haul truck. (ECF No. 70 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Scottsdale argues the efficient proximate cause rule does not apply because there was no covered occurrence. (ECF No. 67 at 7). Scottsdale asserts the only occurrence is the U-Haul accident, which is not covered under the Scottsdale Policy because it falls under the \"auto exclusion.\" (ECF No. 67 at 7). Additionally, Scottsdale argues the Scottsdale Policy does not cover any alleged negligence in babysitting E.T. (ECF No. 67 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The named insured in the Scottsdale Policy is the Malo Store. (ECF No. 51-1 at 4). To the extent Lee Thornton is considered an insured because the Store is a sole proprietorship, Lee Thornton and his wife are insureds \"only with respect to the conduct of a business of which you are the sole owner.\" (ECF No. 51-1 at 20, \u00a7 II(1)(a) ). There are no facts that reasonably infer Lee Thornton was babysitting E.T. in furtherance of the Malo Store. The only alleged act undertaken for the Store was moving the U-Haul truck. Whether it could have involved any other person being\n   injured is immaterial to the efficient proximate cause rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even if Lee Thornton was negligent in babysitting E.T., the Scottsdale Policy does not cover that alleged negligence because it was unrelated to the operation of the Malo Store. Accordingly, the only occurrence that could provide coverage is Lee Thornton's use of the returned U-Haul, addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Scottsdale argues the U-Haul accident falls within this exclusion because the truck was an \"auto\" as defined by the Scottsdale Policy. (ECF No. 48 at 5). Additionally, Scottsdale asserts \"there can be no reasonable debate that Lee Thornton was alleged to have been using the U-HAUL truck at the time of the accident.\" (ECF No. 48 at 5). Scottsdale also argues \"the accident alleged clearly arises out of the use of an auto.\" (ECF No. 48 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Thornton Defendants do not contest the auto exclusion issue, instead focusing on whether the \"parking exception\" applies.

The accident caused bodily injury arising out of Lee Thornton's operation of the U-Haul truck, an \"auto\" under the Scottsdale Policy.

The Hamilton Defendants argue the U-Haul truck was not \"loaned\" to the Malo Store or Lee Thornton because he did not have permission to use it for personal purposes. (ECF No. 59 at 6-9). Additionally, the Hamilton Defendants assert interpreting \"loan\" to apply to consignments would make the \"parking exception\" illusory. (ECF No. 59 at 9-10).

The Store did not have any ownership interest in the truck. The trucks were in the Store's possession pursuant to a longstanding formal arrangement. For all intents and purposes, the truck was \"loaned\" to the Store, whether from U-Haul or the customer. The fact insurance exclusions are to be narrowly interpreted does not change this result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penn-America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012489671\">\n    2014 WL 12489671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (holding any doubts about the duty to defend \"must be resolved in favor of the insured\" and adopting a broad definition of \"loaned\" in an auto exclusion).

The court need not engage in hypothetical speculation when the facts before the court clearly fall within the reasonable scope of \"loaned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The fact the Scottsdale Policy lists the gas station and convenience store as hazards but omits the rental operation further\n   supports the conclusion the Store did not intend to obtain liability coverage for the U-Haul trucks through the Scottsdale Policy. Had Lee Thornton intended for the Scottsdale Policy to cover the U-Haul business, it should have been listed therein or included in response to the questions on the application form which Lee Thornton signed. The only reasonable inference from its omission is that the U-Haul operation was not intended to be covered by the Scottsdale Policy. The fact parking customers' vehicles was reasonably foreseeable as part of the gas station operation does not change this conclusion because parking the U-Haul was not part of the gas station or car repair operation. Additionally, even if, as the Hamilton Defendants argue, Scottsdale had notice of the U-Haul operation, this does not change the clear and unambiguous language of the Policy which did not cover the U-Haul operation. For all of the above reasons, the \"parking exception\" does not apply because the U-Haul truck was \"loaned\" to the Malo Store and/or Lee Thornton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The court further finds the \"parking exception\" does not apply because the U-Haul was \"loaned\" to the Malo Store and/or Lee Thornton within the ordinary meaning of the word. The court also finds the efficient proximate cause rule is inapplicable because negligent supervision of E.T. is not covered under the Scottsdale Policy.
