In this case, permitting Lannett to proceed with this litigation in its current posture would disregard the\n     procedures provided by the FDA in\n      <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.110\">\n       21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (b) and undermine the FDA's ability to correct, if appropriate, the mistakes alleged by Lannett.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Garlic v.

For example, Lannett could persuade the FDA that its ANDA should be approved through its anticipated supplement to its ANDA, wherein it intimates that another manufacturer may be substituted to supply the Temozolomide capsules, and this could possibly eliminate the need for judicial review.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Defs.'

Consequently, judicial review would benefit from Lannett exhausting the administrative remedies available to it under\n      <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.110\">\n       21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (b).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-44\">\n      For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the FDA's rescission action is not a final agency action subject to judicial review under the APA.
