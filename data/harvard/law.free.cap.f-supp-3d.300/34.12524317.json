Mem. at 8 (citing A.R. at FDA658). In conjunction with its ANDA, Lannett identified Chongqing Lummy Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (\"Lummy\"), a company located in Chayuan, China, \"as the proposed manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for the finished drug product.\" Compl. \u00b6 18; <em>see also</em> A.R. FDA659. As part of its review of Lannett's ANDA, the FDA, in July 2013, \"conducted a pre-approval inspection of Lummy's factory ... to determine whether Lummy's manufacturing was in accordance with cGMP requirements.\" Pls.' Mem. at 9; <em>see also</em> A.R. FDA659 n.5. The FDA determined that \"Lummy['s] facility had 'an acceptable compliance status,' \" and this finding was documented in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's electronic platform used in the review and processing of ANDAs. Pls.' Mem. at 9 (quoting A.R. FDA659 n.5).</p><p id=\"p-21\">From March 14 to 16, 2016, an FDA investigator from the agency's China office conducted a routine inspection at Lummy's facility to confirm that its cGMP compliance remained acceptable. A.R. FDA59, FDA64. The inspection revealed that Lummy was \"in the process of moving manufacturing operations from the Chayuan site to the newly established Changshou site located [near] ... Chongqing city,\" A.R. FDA68, and thus, the FDA investigator inspected both manufacturing sites, A.R. FDA66. Although the Changshou \"facility ha[d] not been registered with the FDA,\" Lummy \"ha[d] already transferred all analytical instrumentation and stability samples [for the Temozolomide batches] to the Changshou site.\" A.R. FDA70. Based on his inspection, the FDA \"investigator ... conclude[d] that there were significant cGMP compliance problems relating to data integrity, including numerous records relating to manufacturing that [he] determined to have been falsified.\" Pls.' Mem. at 10 (citing to A.R. FDA4-7); <em>see also</em> Defs.' Mem. at 9-10 (citing various portions of the A.R.). The investigator provided Lummy with the list of objectionable practices and conditions he observed, and requested that Lummy provide a response indicating its corrective actions. <em>See</em> A.R. FDA79.</p><p id=\"p-22\">On March 15, 2016, the FDA investigator sent an e-mail \"to the Office of Compliance ... and to [the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's Office of Pharmaceutical Quality's] Office of Surveillance,\" informing them of his \"recommendation that the Lummy facility be classified as [Official Action Indicated (\"OAI\") ],\" which is an inspection conclusion \"reflect[ing] the fact that 'objectionable conditions were found and a <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"40\" href=\"#p40\" id=\"p40\">*40</a>regulatory action is recommended.\" A.R. FDA659; <em>see also</em> Defs.' Mem. at 11. However, \"[b]ecause the investigator's e[-]mail recommendation did not also include the 'field alert' form typically used to trigger entry of an OAI alert into the [electronic p]latform, ... staff responsible for entering facility status into the [electronic p]latform were not immediately aware that such an alert had not yet been entered.\" A.R. FDA659. Consequently, the electronic platform still indicated that Lummy maintained an acceptable compliance status with cGMP requirements, <em>see</em> A.R. FDA659 n.5., and on March 23, 2016, the FDA issued a letter indicating that Lannett's ANDA had been approved, <em>see</em> A.R.

FDA19-20.</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-24\">employees within [the Office of Surveillance had] became aware of the discrepancy and entered an OAI alert into the [electronic p]latform to flag that the Lummy facility was classified as potential OAI, a designation that should result in [the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality] not recommending for approval or tentative approval any application referencing [that] facility.</p><p id=\"p-25\">A.R. FDA659. On March 31, 2016, Lummy provided the FDA with a corrective action plan addressing the investigator's list of observed objectionable practices and conditions. A.R. FDA32-58.</p><p id=\"p-26\">On April 1, 2016, the FDA sent a letter to Lannett requesting a teleconference to discuss \"a commitment by [Lannett] to not distribute any Temozolomide product\" and \"[a] necessary withdrawal of [Lannett's] ANDA.\" A.R. FDA649. The FDA and Lannett conducted the teleconference on April 5, 2016, during which Lannett confirmed that Lummy had notified it of the FDA's March 2016 inspection findings and that it had not distributed any Temozolomide product in the United States. A.R. FDA651-52. Also, Lannett stated that it \"would not commit to withdraw[ing]\" its ANDA, but its representatives agreed to discuss with Lannett's senior management the FDA's proposed rescission of its approval of Lannett's ANDA, returning it \"back to pending status.\" A.R. FDA652. Two weeks later, the FDA sent a letter to Lannett indicating that the FDA had \"erred in approving [Lannett's] ANDA ... despite the fact that the information available to the agency at the time indicated that the compliance status of a facility identified in [Lannett's] ANDA was not acceptable to support approval.\" A.R. FDA662. The FDA also informed Lannett of the following three options that Lannett could exercise regarding its ANDA: \"request that [the] FDA withdraw approval of the application, ... agree to immediate rescission of approval, which would put [its] ANDA back into pending status, or ... [within thirty] days ... provide information ... on whether the compliance status of the Lummy facility ... was acceptable <em>as of the date of approval</em>, March 23, 2016.\" A.R. FDA662-63. In response, on April 21, 2016, Lannett sent a letter to the FDA proposing a fourth option that would permit Lannett to submit for FDA review \"a supplement pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.70\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.70</extracted-citation>, and the <em>Guidelines for Industry-Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA</em>,\" addressing a \"move to a different manufacturing site for the manufacture of the [Temozolomide capsules].\" A.R.

FDA822; <em>see also</em> A.R. FDA818-22 (refuting the legal arguments asserted by Lannett in its April 21, 2016 letter to the FDA).

As explained in the FDA's cGMP Complete Response Letter, Lannett was obligated to comply with the procedures provided in the FDA's regulations by either resubmitting or supplementing its ANDA, withdrawing its ANDA, or requesting an opportunity for a hearing. <em>See</em> A.R.

Mem. at 44-45. As the Supreme Court observed, \"[e]xhaustion gives an agency 'an opportunity to correct its own mistakes with respect to the programs it administers before it is haled into federal court,' and it discourages 'disregard of [the agency's] procedures.' \" <em>Woodford</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p88\">548 U.S. at 89</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p88\">126 S.Ct. 2378</extracted-citation> (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>McCarthy v.

In this case, permitting Lannett to proceed with this litigation in its current posture would disregard the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"46\" href=\"#p46\" id=\"p46\">*46</a>procedures provided by the FDA in <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.110\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110</extracted-citation>(b) and undermine the FDA's ability to correct, if appropriate, the mistakes alleged by Lannett. <em>See</em> <em>Garlic v.

For example, Lannett could persuade the FDA that its ANDA should be approved through its anticipated supplement to its ANDA, wherein it intimates that another manufacturer may be substituted to supply the Temozolomide capsules, and this could possibly eliminate the need for judicial review. <em>See</em> Defs.' Mem. at 45. Alternatively, Lannett could request a hearing on \"whether there are grounds for denying approval of ... [its ANDA].\" <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.110\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110</extracted-citation>(b)(3). The FDA would then be required to either approve or deny Lannett's ANDA and provide Lannett with a hearing. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.110\">id.</extracted-citation></em> And, this would amount to a final agency action that would be subject to review by the Circuit. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355</extracted-citation>(h) (granting the Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of an order refusing or withdrawing approval of an ANDA application). Consequently, judicial review would benefit from Lannett exhausting the administrative remedies available to it under <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.110\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110</extracted-citation>(b).</p><p id=\"p-44\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the FDA's rescission action is not a final agency action subject to judicial review under the APA. Furthermore, Lannett failed to exhaust all of its available administrative remedies pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.110\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110</extracted-citation>(b) prior to bringing this case to federal court.
