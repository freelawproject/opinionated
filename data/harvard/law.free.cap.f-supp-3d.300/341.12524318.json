Eginton, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this putative class action, plaintiffs Kimberly Negron, Daniel Perry, Courtney Gallagher, Nina Curol and Roger Curol allege that defendants Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company (\"CIGNA\") and OptumRx, Inc., have violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"). Plaintiffs allege that defendants have artificially inflated prescription drug costs in violation of the terms of their health insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In count one, plaintiffs assert their action against defendants pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), which provides that a participant or beneficiary may bring an action to enforce rights under the terms of the plan. In counts two and three, plaintiffs assert violations of ERISA's prohibited transactions enumerated in ERISA \u00a7 406(a) and (b). In count four, plaintiffs allege that defendants have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence in violation of ERISA \u00a7 404(a)(1). In count five, plaintiffs allege that defendants violated ERISA's antidiscrimination provision of ERISA \u00a7 702(b). In counts six and seven, plaintiffs allege that defendants are liable as co-fiduciaries or non-fiduciaries based on knowing participation in the asserted breaches of fiduciary duty. In counts eight through ten, plaintiffs assert RICO claims against defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss this complaint for failure to state plausible claims for relief. For the following reasons, the motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts all allegations of the complaint as true. The Court assumes familiarity with the allegations of the complaint. However, the Court will include this brief factual background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs receive prescription drug benefits through individual or group health plans issued or administered by defendants. Cigna offers both administrative services only (\"ASO\") plans and insured plans. Both types of plan offer the same range of administrative services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cigna has an in-house pharmacy benefit manager known as Cigna Pharmacy Management that provides and administers health and pharmacy benefits to patients. Cigna Pharmacy Management outsources certain functions to other providers, including defendant OptumRx and another entity known as Argus Health Systems Inc. Cigna utilizes OptumRx's technology and service platforms, retail network contracting and claims processing services. Argus was the primary pharmacy benefit manager prior to 2013, and it remains part of Cigna's pharmacy benefits delivery system. Plaintiffs allege that Argus and OptumRx have been directed by Cigna and are involved in administering pharmacy benefits for the relevant plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that defendants and other co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud patients by overcharging for the cost of medically necessary prescription drugs. Patients allegedly pay excess charges to participating pharmacies in exchange for receiving their prescription drugs. Defendants allegedly misrepresent the costs of the prescription drugs in the form of increased charges to patients and then \"clawback\" from the pharmacies a large portion of the patients' payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In their complaint, plaintiffs have included an example of the asserted Clawback scheme applied to a prescription Vitamin D that a pharmacy purchased from the manufacturer or wholesaler for $0.60. Pursuant to the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Pharmacy Agreement (PBM Pharmacy Agreement), defendants' pharmacy benefit manager paid the pharmacy 0.96 for the Vitamin D, a fulfillment fee of $1.40, and $0.21 in tax. Thus, in accordance with the PBM Pharmacy Agreement, the contracted charge made by the pharmacy was\n   $2.57. The PBM Pharmacy Agreement required the pharmacy to charge the patient a $7.68 \"copayment\" for the prescription Vitamin D, which represents almost 300% of an overcharge. The PBM-Pharmacy Agreement then required the pharmacy to pay the PBM or insurer the \"Spread\" between the contracted fee and the \"copayment\" amount collected from the patient. Thus, plaintiffs allege that defendants received a $5.11 Clawback. The PBM Pharmacy Agreement prohibited the pharmacy from disclosing to the patient the amount paid to the pharmacy or the Clawback.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the relevant plans provide that \"[i]n no event will\" a copayment or coinsurance amount paid by an insured exceed the amount paid by the plan to the pharmacy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, plaintiffs assert that contrary to the plan provisions, defendants have forced network pharmacies to charge patients unauthorized and excessive amounts for prescription drugs that far exceed the charges made by the pharmacy under their agreements; and that defendants have \"clawed back\" some or all of the excessive charges by forcing the pharmacies to pay the unauthorized charges to defendants after collecting them from the patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs' plans provide for (1) a claim determination and appeal process relative to coverage claims; and (2) a customer or member service for complaints if the insured has,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , \"a concern regarding a person, a service, the quality of care, [or] contractual benefits.\" The customer or member service provision instructs that an insured who is not satisfied with the results of a coverage decision \"may start the appeals procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plan provisions relevant to filing a reimbursement or filing a claim for prescription drugs provide that upon purchase of a drug at a retail participating pharmacy, an insured or beneficiary pays an applicable Copayment, Coinsurance or Deductible and does not need to file a claim form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The function of a motion to dismiss is \"merely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Ryder Energy Distrib. v.

Relevant to prescription drugs, the instant plans provide that, upon purchase of a drug at a retail participating pharmacy, an insured or beneficiary pays an applicable Copayment, Coinsurance or Deductible and does not need to file a claim form. In\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth Group\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that two of the relevant plans provided procedures specific to challenging coinsurance or copayment calculations; and that the administrative procedures of the other plans provided adequate administrative procedures applicable to copayment and coinsurance disputes.\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth Group\n   </em>\n   noted that the relevant member handbook explained that the \"Grievance procedure\" applied to both adverse determinations and \"for other issues.\" In the instant matter, the plans provide (1) a claim determination and appeal process relative to claims for coverage; and (2) a customer or member service for complaints if the insured has,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , \"a concern regarding a person, a service, the quality of care, [or] contractual benefits.\" Consistent with the following discussion, this Court finds that plaintiffs have plausibly stated that the plan terms do not set forth administrative procedures that unambiguously address plaintiff's claims of being overcharged for prescription drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they were not aware that they had been overcharged, and therefore, they could not have filed a claim based on the amount of their copayments or coinsurance. \"Because the exhaustion requirement rests on the assumption that notice of denial has been provided, a fiduciary who has not provided notice of a claim for benefits is foreclosed from insisting upon exhaustion of administrative remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    Corsini v.

Cigna contends that its RICO liability depends upon a showing that it conducted or participated in the conduct of OptumRx's or Argus's affairs. However, plaintiffs have alleged that Cigna designed the Clawback scheme, that it required OptumRx and Argus to misrepresent the cost-sharing amounts, and that it directed OptumRx and Argus to forward the Clawbacks. Taking the allegations to be true, the Court cannot hold as a matter of law that plaintiffs have failed to allege that Cigna directly or indirectly participated in the alleged enterprises' affairs through racketeering activity.

Plaintiffs allege that Cigna created a mechanism through which Cigna could obtain additional monies beyond what plaintiffs should have paid under their plan for prescription drugs. Cigna allegedly designed and entered into the Clawback scheme with the intent to defraud insureds who paid for excessive prescription drug costs. The complaint plausibly alleges that defendant Cigna acted with scienter by alleging that it intentionally sought to charge excess amounts for\n   prescription drugs and that it required the pharmacies to conceal from the insureds the amounts of the prescription drug costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Count Nine Against OptumRx\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In count nine, plaintiffs allege that OptumRx, as a RICO \"person,\" was associated with the OptumRx Pharmacy Enterprise, which consists of OptumRx and pharmacies in OptumRx's pharmacy networks or solely of such pharmacies; that OptumRx participated in the conduct of the OptumRx Pharmacy Enterprise's affairs through contracts and agreements to defraud plaintiffs by overcharging for prescription drug costs; and that OptumRx committed RICO predicate acts of \"racketeering activity\" in furtherance of its Clawback scheme through mail and wire fraud. The complaint enumerates several dates on which OptumRx allegedly directed the OptumRx Pharmacy Enterprise to conduct the asserted Clawback scheme. Plaintiffs allege that the rackeeterring activities caused injury to business and property due to overpayments for medically necessary prescription drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   OptumRx argues that the RICO claim fails as a matter of law because plaintiffs have failed to allege any predicate acts of fraud in the conduct of the OptumRx Pharmacy Enterprise; that plaintiffs have failed to plead the predicate acts with particularity; and that plaintiffs have pleaded neither the existence of the OptumRx Pharmacy Enterprise nor OptumRx's control of that enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    RICO Enterprise\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   OptumRx argues that the plaintiffs have failed to allege that OptumRx and the pharmacies had a common purpose to engage in a particular fraudulent course of conduct and that they worked together to achieve such purposes as required to establish a plausible enterprise. OptumRx asserts that the allegations indicate that the pharmacies were forced into participating in the Clawback scheme rather than acting with shared a common purpose with OptumRx, and that the allegations fail to establish that the individual pharmacies worked in concert to defraud plan participants. OptumRx characterizes the allegations as describing a \"hub and spoke\" enterprise, with OptumRx as the hub and the pharmacies as the spokes, which is generally insufficient to constitute a RICO enterprise absent concerted effort or cooperation among the spokes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Addario v.

Nevertheless, each pharmacy's alleged acts of overcharging and failure to disclose the excessive charge occurred independently from each similar act by the other pharmacies.
