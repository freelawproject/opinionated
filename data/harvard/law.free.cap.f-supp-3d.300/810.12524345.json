The ACA imposed a tax on medical providers but exempted the states from paying it. Notwithstanding Congress's direction in the ACA, the HHS regulation effectively requires the states to pay this tax. Plaintiffs now challenge both the tax and the regulation. Because Plaintiffs have standing to challenge both, the Court must decide the legality of each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court concludes that the challenged ACA tax is lawful, offending neither the structure nor substance of the Constitution. But the HHS regulation violates the non-delegation doctrine, delegating to a private entity the authority to decide who must pay this tax. Pursuant to that unlawful delegation, the private entity decreed that the states must pay this tax, contrary to Congress's express directive. HHS's unlawful delegation enabled a private entity to effectively rewrite the ACA, wrongfully forcing Plaintiffs to pay this tax. It is therefore the regulation-not the tax-that harms Plaintiffs. For the reasons that follow, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT in part\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' claims challenging the regulation and declare the offending regulation \"contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,\" and \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(B)-(C).

If the tax, assessment, or fee is not deductible as an expense for corporate tax purposes, the actuary should apply an adjustment to reflect the costs of the tax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   ASOP 49 \u00a7 3.2.12(d). Since the HIPF is a non-deductible tax,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   ASOP 49 effectively declared that states must reimburse MCOs the full amount of the HIPF in their capitation rates in order for AAA actuaries to certify their rates under the Certification Rule. HHS then embraced these new ASB standards for compliance with the Certification Rule and affirmed in a guidance document that the states must comply with them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2015 MCO Guide. The undisputed evidence accordingly shows that ASB has dictated prospective, generally applicable rules of conduct for meeting a legal condition to Medicaid subsidies. Indeed, because the Certification Rule delegates to the ASB power to prevent CMS from approving any MCO contract that deviates from its standards, HHS is obliged to follow the ASB's enactments-even when the ASB effectively rewrites the ACA, forcing the states to pay a tax when Congress has expressly forbidden the federal government to collect it from them. HHS's delegation of legislative power to the ASB therefore requires HHS to obey the ASB even over the express commands of Congress-which, in the final analysis, is the only proper legislative body in this entire scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Defendants argue that the Supreme Court rejected a similar non-delegation claim in\n   <em>\n    Currin v.

The laws empowered the Secretary of Agriculture to take certain regulatory actions and only empowered private entities to veto those actions once the Secretary took the initiative to do them.

Importantly, the ASB's legislative powers operate on the states and the MCOs before HHS takes any action-indeed, independent of any HHS action-because the ASB enacts its rules, and their actuaries decide whether to certify an MCO contract pursuant to those rules, before the states even submit their MCO contracts to CMS for approval. Therefore, this case does not involve, as in\n   <em>\n    Currin\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Rock Royal\n   </em>\n   , Congress empowering HHS to initially declare an MCO contract \"actuarially sound,\" and then empowering the ASB to subsequently veto the agency's determination.

CMS may disapprove an MCO contract that contains a private certification, but Truffer's testimony and the text of the regulation establish that CMS may not consider or approve an MCO contract without one. The ASB's rulemaking and veto powers are therefore binding on CMS and not merely advisory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Defendants further argue that ASOP 49 is advisory because a different ASOP-ASOP 41-provides that an actuary may permissibly deviate from an ASOP if the actuary \"provid[es] an appropriate statement\" of his rationale. Defs.' Br. 37 n.26, ECF No. 63. This argument also fails. ASOP 41 allows individual actuaries to establish their own prospective, generally applicable rules for setting capitation rates and-by the grace of the ASB-to use these rules to certify a capitation rate. Far from negating or diminishing the Certification Rule's initial delegation, this appears to constitute yet another delegation, now from a private organization (the ASB) to a private individual (an actuary).\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that HHS did not delegate legislative authority through the Certification Rule because the ASB and its actuaries are not \"interested private parties\" tasked with regulating business competitors.

But this distinction is not dispositive. Because of the Certification Rule's legislative delegation to the ASB,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B-and the ASB's promulgation of ASOP 49-the HIPF is now functionally operating as a condition on Medicaid funds. Just as in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , the Government here threatens to withhold all of Plaintiffs' Medicaid subsidies if Plaintiffs do not comply with a new and onerous federal condition.\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   involves different facts, but its holding controls this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The fundamental question posed by\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   in this case is whether Plaintiff States \"voluntarily\" accepted the spending condition. 567 U.S. at 577,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p544\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182103\" index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/1/#p17\">\n    451 U.S. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182103\" index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/1/#p17\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court finds that if Congress conditions existing Medicaid funds on whether states pay a new and onerous federal tax that was not a part of the original Medicaid bargain-this condition would be coercive and violate the Spending Clause. This conclusion is consistent with the holding and underlying logic of\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , and a contrary finding would open the door to further constitutional violations. For if the Spending Clause allows the Government to impose new and onerous taxes as retroactive conditions on spending, Congress could evade the Tenth Amendment's intergovernmental tax immunity by enacting a \"voluntary\" tax on the states and attaching it as a spending condition.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part III.E (discussing the Tenth Amendment's intergovernmental tax immunity). So long as Congress framed the tax as a \"voluntary\" alteration to a pre-existing spending deal, the states would have to accept it, and pray the Government did not alter it any further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The Court finds, however, that Congress enacted the HIPF as a tax-an ordinary, unadorned tax-not as a condition on Medicaid funds. Indeed, the ACA expressly excludes the states from paying the HIPF. ACA \u00a7 9010(c)(2)(B). It would be improper for the Court to declare that a statute violates the Spending Clause as a coercive condition on spending when Congress plainly fashioned the statute so that it would not be a condition on spending-indeed, so that the states would not pay it at all. Plaintiffs' grievance is with HHS's legislative delegation to the ASB-empowering the ASB to issue legislative decrees that transformed the HIPF into a spending condition-not with Congress's routine exercise of the taxing power. Accordingly, the Court finds that the HIPF is not a coercive condition on spending in violation of the Spending Clause.
