Hall, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case comes before the court pursuant to a Complaint (Doc. No. 1) filed by the plaintiff, Aetna Life Insurance Company (\"Aetna\"), against the defendants, Nellina Guerrera (\"Guerrera\"); Carter Mario Injury Lawyers (\"Carter Mario\"); Attorney Sean Hammil (\"Hammil\"); Attorney Danielle Wisniowski (\"Wisniowski\"); and Big Y Foods, Inc. (\"Big Y\"). The case arises out of a dispute regarding payment for medical services received by Guerrera following an injury that Guerrera sustained at a Big Y retail location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 5, 2017, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 26) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), arguing that the case does not belong in federal court, either because this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction or because Aetna has not stated a plausible claim with respect to their federal cause of action. On July 26, 2017, Aetna filed a Cross-Motion to Amend its Complaint (Doc. No. 38). In a Memorandum filed in support of the Cross-Motion and in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Aetna clarified that it is opposing the Motion to Dismiss, but is cross moving to amend its Complaint \"should this Court determine that Aetna's Complaint, as it is currently drafted, fails to create subject matter jurisdiction\n   over Aetna's claims, or fails to state viable claims against Defendants.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and In Support of Cross-Motion for Leave to Amend its Complaint (\"Pl.'s Response\") (Doc. No. 39) at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 36) is granted in part and denied in part, and Aetna's Motion to Amend (Doc. No. 38) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendant Big Y is a\n   Massachusetts corporation with a location in Monroe, Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.

At all relevant times, Guerrera was Medicare-eligible and was enrolled in and maintained health insurance coverage through Aetna's MAO Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.

The Medicare Act consists of five parts, the first two of which \"create, describe, and regulate traditional fee-for-service, government-administered Medicare.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Avandia Mktg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902508\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/353/#p357\">\n    685 F.3d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (3d Cir. 2012). The third part, Part C, outlines the Medicare Advantage Program, described further below. The fourth and fifth parts are not at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 1980, Congress amended the Medicare Act to add the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (\"MSP\"), in an effort to reduce the escalating costs of Medicare to the federal government. Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 90-499,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Stat.%202599\">\n    94 Stat. 2599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"As its title suggests, the statute designates Medicare as a 'secondary payer' of medical benefits, and thus precludes the program from providing such benefits when a 'primary plan' could be expected to pay.' \"\n   <em>\n    Taransky v. Sec'y of HHS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148753\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/307/#p310\">\n    760 F.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310 (3d Cir. 2014). The MSP is codified at section 1395y of title 42 of the United States Code. The MSP provides that Medicare cannot pay medical expenses when \"payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made under a workman's compensation law or plan of the United States or State or under an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan (including a self-insured plan) or no fault insurance.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In subsection 1395y(b)(2)(B) of the MSP, Congress gave \"[t]he Secretary\" authority\n   to make conditional payments \"if a primary plan ... has not made or cannot reasonably be expected to make payment with respect to such item or service promptly,\" but such payment \"shall be conditioned on reimbursement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148753\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/307/#p310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (b)(1)(B)(i). Congress further provided an enforcement mechanism for the \"United States\" in cases where conditional payment has been made. Subsection 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii) provides that \"a primary plan, and an entity that receives payment from a primary plan, shall reimburse the appropriate Trust Fund for any payment made by the Secretary under this subchapter with respect to an item or service if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii). Subsection (2)(B)(ii) also contains a responsibility-triggering provision, which explains that responsibility for repayment \"may be demonstrated by a judgment, a payment conditioned upon the recipient's compromise, waiver, or release (whether or not there is a determination or admission of liability) of payment for items or services included in a claim against the primary plan or the primary plan's insured, or by other means.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148753\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/307/#p310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, subsection (2)(B)(iii) creates a cause of action for \"the United States,\" which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In order to recover payment made under this subchapter for an item or service, the United States may bring an action against any or all entities that are or were required or responsible (directly, as an insurer or self-insurer, as a third-party administrator, as an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan, or large group health plan, or otherwise) to make payment with respect to the same item or service (or any portion thereof) under a primary plan. The United States may, in accordance with paragraph (3)(A) collect double damages against any such entity. In addition, the United States may recover under this clause from any entity that has received payment from a primary plan or from the proceeds of a primary plan's payment to any entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Congress also created a private right of action, codified at section 1395y(b)(3)(A) of title 42 of the United States Code, and described herein as the \"Private Cause of Action\" provision. In comparison to the cause of action created for the United States, the Private Cause of Action provision is relatively sparse. It provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   There is established a private cause of action for damages (which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided) in the case of a primary plan which fails to provide for primary payment (or appropriate reimbursement) in accordance with paragraphs [ (b) ](1) and [ (b) ](2)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A). That is the entirety of the Private Cause of Action provision; it does not make explicit who may bring suit or against whom, or even under what conditions precisely suit may be brought. Paragraph (b)(1) governs situations in which group health plans must provide payment, while paragraph (b)(2)(A) governs situations including liability insurance settlements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395y(b)(1), (b)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1997, Congress once again amended the Medicare Act to add Part C, which \"afford[s] beneficiaries the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private organizations\" known as Medicare Advantage Organizations (\"MAOs\").\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

The court views this case as distinguishable from Konig, however, as the Private Cause of Action provision, unlike the government's cause of action, is (at a minimum) ambiguous with respect to whether MAOs may bring suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, the court also acknowledges that Konig, while clearly focused on the government's cause of action as opposed to the Private Cause of Action provision, contains broader language suggesting that the Private Cause of Action provision is not a cause of action for MAOs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201078633\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Nothing\n   </em>\n   in the Medicare statute itself creates a cause of action, and the parties cannot fashion one by invoking the regulations.\" (emphasis added)). To the extent that this language makes Konig inconsistent with this Ruling, the court finds Konig unpersuasive and declines to follow it.

At first blush, this language implies that section 422.108(f) interprets the government's cause of action, subsection (2)(B)(iii), not the Private Cause of Action provision, paragraph (3)(A). With respect to subsection (2)(B)(iii), section 422.108(f) is entitled to no\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference on the issue of who may bring suit, as subsection (2)(B)(iii) unambiguously creates a right of action for the government alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii) (creating a cause of action for \"the United States\").

In short, the Second Circuit has concluded that, at a minimum, primary payers may be sued pursuant to the Private Cause of Action provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Aetna urges the court to find that beneficiaries and their attorneys may also be sued pursuant to the Private Cause of Action. Pl.'s Response at 20-21. The court concludes, however, that the MSP and interpreting regulations do not give MAOs the right to sue beneficiaries or their attorneys. The court reaches this conclusion for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, the plain language of the Private Cause of Action provision, while admittedly vague, suggests that Congress intended suit against only primary plans. The provision is triggered when \"a primary plan ... fails to provide for primary payment (or appropriate reimbursement).\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A). Had Congress intended to create a cause of action for double damages against beneficiaries who received\n   payment from a primary plan, Congress could simply have created a cause of action when \"any entity or person\" failed to reimburse an MAO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In support of its interpretation, Aetna cites the court to a CMS regulation section 411.24(g) of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\" section 411.24(g)\"), which states that \"CMS has a right of action to recover its payments from any entity, including a beneficiary, ... that has received a primary payment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Aetna further cites the court to the government's cause of action in the MSP, subsection (2)(B)(iii), which states that \"the United States may recover under this clause from any entity that has received payment from a primary plan or from the proceeds of a primary plan's payment to any entity.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii). Far from conflicting with the court's interpretation, however, this authority supports a reading of the Private Cause of Action provision that permits suit only against primary plans. This is because the government's cause of action permits only recovery from beneficiaries, while providing that the government may \"collect double damages against\" entities including \"any or all entities that are or were required or responsible (directly, as an insurer or self-insurer, as a third-party administrator, as an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan, or large group health plan, or otherwise) to make payment with respect to the same item or service (or any portion thereof) under a primary plan.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii). In other words, the government's cause of action provides only for recovery of payment against beneficiaries or their attorneys, while allowing the government to sue primary plans for double damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090878\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/36/#p42\">\n    346 F.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The [MSP] provides for the government to receive double damages in successful actions against primary payers.\"). Notably, the government's cause of action, subsection (2)(B)(iii), references the Private Cause of Action provision, paragraph (3)(A), in the course of allowing for double damages \"against any such entity,\" where \"such entity\" describes primary plans. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii). This cross-reference suggests that the Private Cause of Action, like the government's cause of action, allows for double damages only against primary plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Aetna also directs the court to a Ruling by a court in the Eastern District of Louisiana, which held that beneficiaries who had received a settlement from a tortfeasor were, in effect, converted into primary plans.\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224202\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/653/#p659\">\n    73 F.Supp.3d at 667-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the settlement itself-as opposed to the entity that funded the settlement-was the \"primary plan\" because \"there is no real distinction between a claim against a tortfeasor or his insurer to obtain reimbursement and a claim against a beneficiary to obtain reimbursement from a settlement\n   <em>\n    funded\n   </em>\n   by a tortfeasor or his insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224202\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/653/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224202\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/653/#p659\">\n    at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The court declines to follow the lead of the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court, however, as its interpretation of the Private Cause of Action provision cannot be reconciled with the text of the MSP. Unlike much of the language at issue in the MSP, \"primary plan\" has a clear definition that does not include beneficiaries who have received benefits or settlement funds. The MSP defines \"primary plan\" as \"a group health plan or large group health plan ... and a workmen's compensation law or plan, an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan (including a self-insured plan) or no fault insurance....\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(1)(A)(ii).

As analyzed above, the government's cause of action allows for double damages only against primary plans, who do not include beneficiaries or their attorneys. In fact, this distinction is spelled out even more explicitly in another CMS regulation, section 411.24.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 411.24(c) states, \"If it is necessary for CMS to take legal action to recover\n   <em>\n    from a primary payer\n   </em>\n   , CMS may recover twice the amount [of the Medicare primary payment].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (emphasis added). In contrast, section 411.24(g), which governs recovery of payments \"from parties that receive primary payments,\" including \"a\n   <em>\n    beneficiary\n   </em>\n   , provider, supplier, physician,\n   <em>\n    attorney\n   </em>\n   , State agency or private insurer that has received a primary payment,\" includes no double-damages provision, permitting CMS only to \"recover its payments.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (emphasis added). Thus, the CMS regulations do not suggest that the Private Cause of Action provision allows collection of double damages from beneficiaries or their attorneys, but only from primary plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the Medicare beneficiary had already received medical expenses from a tortfeasor, and the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court observed that precluding suit against beneficiaries would \"produce[ ] an odd result, as that interpretation would encourage beneficiaries to hide their settlements from the MAOs and provide no recourse to the MAOs against the beneficiaries for such action.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224202\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/653/#p659\">\n    73 F.Supp.3d at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, both the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court and the parties in this case have overlooked another provision in section 411.24, which provides \"[s]pecial rules\" in circumstances including \"liability insurance settlements.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). Section 411.24(i) states, \"If Medicare is not reimbursed as required by paragraph (h)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   of this section,\n   <em>\n    the primary payer must reimburse Medicare even though it has already reimbursed the beneficiary or other party\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20411.24\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1) (emphasis added). In short, section 411.24(i) explicitly addresses the situation with which the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court was concerned, and addresses the issue not by treating beneficiaries and primary plans alike, as Aetna urges the court to do here, but by clarifying that primary plans could not evade their obligations to Medicare simply through settlement with beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glover v.

As in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Paris Blank\n   </em>\n   holding relied on section 422.108(f), which equates the rights of recovery for MAOs to the rights of recovery for the government, in combination with section 411.24, which permits recovery against beneficiaries and their attorneys, as the court has just described.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134767\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/676/#p680\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134767\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/676/#p680\">\n    at 681-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, section 411.24 does not provide for double damages recovery against beneficiaries and their attorneys, consistent with the text of the government's cause of action, subsection (2)(B)(iii). Thus, to conclude that beneficiaries and their attorneys may be sued under the Private Cause of Action provision would mean that MAOs would not have rights\n   <em>\n    equal\n   </em>\n   to those of the government, but rather rights\n   <em>\n    greater\n   </em>\n   than those of the government, because the Private Cause of Action provision only provides for double damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Relevant to this issue, the court notes that the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court interpreted the Private Cause of Action provision to allow for either single or double recovery, depending on whether a primary plan (which, for the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court, includes beneficiaries who have received settlement payments) \"intentionally withh[e]ld payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224202\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/653/#p659\">\n    73 F.Supp.3d at 669-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The text of the Private Cause of Action provision does not, however, provide for single recovery. As described above, the Private Cause of Action provision creates \"a private cause of action for\n   <em>\n    damages (which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided)\n   </em>\n   in the case of a primary plan which fails to provide payment (or appropriate reimbursement).\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added). The\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   court reached its conclusion that the provision allowed for either single or double damages, depending on the circumstances, by effectively shifting the second parenthesis to include another clause, converting the clause \"which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided\" to say, instead, \"which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided in the case of a primary plan which fails to provide payment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224202\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/653/#p659\">\n    73 F.Supp.3d at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Furthermore, the court notes that, although the\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   opinion describes the Private Cause of Action provision as a cause of action for a \"private party\" to \"recover from a private insurer,\" this language does not preclude Aetna's cause of action against Big Y, as Aetna is a \"private party\" and, according to the MSP definition, Big Y is a \"private insurer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In their Reply, the defendants assert that the \"2003 amendment to the definition of 'primary plan' does not change the analysis when one looks to Second Circuit precedent.\" Def.'s Reply at 8.

The court finds this argument by the defendants puzzling, as this holding in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   is completely irrelevant to the case at bar, where no one, including the defendants, has argued that Aetna has failed to allege injury.

However, Aetna's Complaint alleges that Big Y paid Guerrera a $30,000 settlement. Compl. at \u00b6 25. Although Aetna does not expressly allege that Big Y is a \"self-insured plan,\" the allegation that Big Y paid Guerrera a settlement is sufficient, on its own, to plausibly allege that Big Y is a \"primary plan\" within the meaning of the MSP. In the government's cause of action provision, the MSP provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A primary plan's responsibility for such payment may be demonstrated by a judgment, a payment conditioned upon the recipient's compromise, waiver, or release (whether or not there is a determination or admission of liability) of payment for items or services included in a claim against the primary plan or the primary plan's insured, or by other means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii).

In its Response to the Motion to Dismiss, Aetna maintains that\n   amendment is not necessary, but requests leave to amend its Complaint \"should this Court determine that Aetna's Complaint, as it is currently drafted, fails to create subject matter jurisdiction over Aetna's claims, or fails to state viable claims against Defendants.\" Pl.'s Response at 33. Aetna attached a proposed amended complaint to its Response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 2, Pl.'s Response (Doc. No. 39-4) (proposed amended complaint with edits highlighted). Aetna asserts that the proposed amendments \"are neither conclusory nor baseless, simply amplify and expand the allegations already contained in the Complaint, and do not add any new parties or claims.\" Pl.'s Response at 27-28. In pertinent part, Aetna has proposed an amendment that specifically alleges that Big Y is a \"primary plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 2, Pl.'s Response at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In their Reply, the defendants argue that this amendment is both conclusory and baseless because, according to the defendants, Aetna \"acknowledges that it has no idea whether Big Y or some 'completely separate,' 'undisclosed entity' is in fact the 'primary plan' that it should attempt to sue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Reply at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In light of the court's conclusion that Aetna adequately alleged that Big Y is a primary plan in its initial Complaint, the court finds that amendment is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section V(B)(2). In addition, the court agrees with the defendants that the proposed amendments are conclusory, in that they largely insert legal terms as opposed to facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 10 (\"Simply inserting the term 'primary plan' ... is a textbook example of 'conclusory.' \"). However, the court disagrees with the defendants' argument that Aetna has failed to allege the necessary facts to show that Big Y fits within the statutory definition of a \"primary plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The problem with the proposed amendments is not that they are unsupported by facts, but that they are unnecessary in light of the facts that were previously alleged in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Therefore, Aetna's Cross-Motion to Amend the Complaint (Doc. No. 38) is denied with respect to the amendments as proposed in Exhibit 2 to Aetna's Response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   That being said, it is the court's view that Aetna's Complaint is unclear as to which claims are specifically brought pursuant to the Medicare Act, as opposed to state law, and against whom each state claim is brought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 11. In light of the court's Ruling with respect to the Medicare Act claims, the court concludes that it would be expedient, and consistent with the standard established in Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to permit Aetna to amend its Complaint-consistent with this Ruling-in order to clarify its claims and specify, with respect to the state claims in particular, against whom the claims are alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   F.R.C.P. 15(a)(2) (\"The court should freely give leave [to replead] when justice so requires.\"). Aetna is therefore given leave to replead within twenty-one days of the date of this Ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 36) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Aetna's claims pursuant to the Medicare Act are dismissed with respect to Guerrera, Carter Mario, Hammil, and Wisniowski. Aetna's Medicare Act claim will proceed against Big Y. Furthermore, the court will exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Aetna's state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In light of the court's Ruling with respect to the Motion to Dismiss, Aetna's Cross-Motion to Amend the Complaint (Doc.
