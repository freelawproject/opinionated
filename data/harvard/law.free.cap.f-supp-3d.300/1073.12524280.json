Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This lawsuit concerns two literary works, one of which is alleged to have infringed the other. Plaintiff Dr. Seuss Enterprises (\"DSE\") is the assignee and owner of various copyright registrations for and alleged trademark rights in the works of the late Theodor S. Geisel, better known under his pseudonym \"Dr. Seuss.\" One of Dr. Seuss's best-known books-and the one primarily at issue in this suit-is\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Places You'll Go!\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   \"). Defendants ComicMix LLC, Glenn Hauman, David Jerrold Friedman (a/k/a David Gerrold), and Ty Templeton created a Kickstarter campaign in order to fund printing and distribution of an allegedly infringing\n   work,\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Places You'll Boldly Go!\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   \"). Defendants all took part in the creation of\n   <em>\n    Boldly. Boldly\n   </em>\n   combines aspects of various Dr. Seuss works with \"certain characters, imagery, and other elements from\n   <em>\n    Star Trek\n   </em>\n   , the well-known science fiction entertainment franchise created by Gene Roddenberry.\" Plaintiff alleges that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   \"misappropriates key elements\" of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   and four other Dr. Seuss books. Defendants contest this point, and prior to the threat of litigation noted on their Kickstarter page that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   While we firmly believe that our parody, created with love and affection, fully falls within the boundary of fair use, there may be some people who believe that this might be in violation of their intellectual property rights. And we may have to spend time and money proving it to people in black robes. And we may even lose that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Further,\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   's copyright page both states that \"[t]his is a work of parody, and is not associated with or endorsed by CBS Studios or Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P.[,]\" and includes the following text: \"Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for 'fair use' for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, research, and parody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon learning of\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   and the corresponding Kickstarter campaign, Plaintiff sent Defendants two letters over the span of approximately ten days asserting their exclusive rights in the relevant Dr. Seuss works. When Defendants did not respond to the first letter, Plaintiff on the same day sent a takedown notice to Kickstarter and a second letter to Plaintiff. Kickstarter disabled access to Defendants' campaign later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Several weeks later Plaintiff's Counsel and Defendants' Counsel exchanged letters; Defendants argued their use of Dr. Seuss's intellectual property was fair, threatened suit, and advised Plaintiff that Defendants would send a counter-notice to Kickstarter to reinstate the\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   campaign. Plaintiff commenced this suit shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Bus. and Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 ). (\"Compl,\" ECF No. 1.) Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. (ECF No. 8.) The Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' Motion. (\"Prior Order,\" ECF No. 38.) Specifically, the Court denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's claim of copyright infringement (Count I) and granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's claims of trademark infringement and unfair competition (Counts II and III). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also granted Plaintiff leave to amend its Complaint \"regarding the second and third causes of action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, (\"FAC,\" ECF No. 39), and Defendants filed the present Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) permits a party to raise by motion the defense that the complaint \"fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\" generally referred to as a motion to dismiss. The Court evaluates whether a complaint states a cognizable legal theory and\n   sufficient facts in light of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which requires a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Although Rule 8\"does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' ... it [does] demand more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

(FAC \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff states \"[n]otably, 'Dr. Seuss' does not appear on any of the [book] covers, and all of the covers include names of other authors, despite the fact that these works are authorized by DSE and are recognized by the public as Dr. Seuss works.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants argue\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   cannot cause any relevant market harm because Plaintiff's licensed collaborations listed in the FAC are not works of\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   's type. (MTN 17.) Defendants argue Plaintiff has not licensed and would not license \"any derivate work that creates a hybrid of Dr.\n   Seuss's books with existing characters and imagery from a third party's entertainment franchise. The first amended complaint does not give rise to a plausible claim that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   would cause any harm in any transformative market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Defendants distinguish their mash-up from Plaintiff's licensed derivatives and argue none of the books published as part of Plaintiff's co-branding licensing program \"are crossover works that integrate pre-existing characters or imagery from another entertainment franchise, such as\n   <em>\n    Star Trek\n   </em>\n   , with those of Dr. Seuss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff argues it has in fact collaborated with others and created crossover works, such as through the creation of\n   <em>\n    The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss\n   </em>\n   , \"a live action/puppet show produced by the Jim Henson Company featuring Dr. Seuss's well-known and beloved characters alongside new, Muppet-like characters created by The Jim Henson Company.\" (Opp'n 32; FAC \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff argues\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   \"is the kind of derivative work that DSE has the right to develop and could develop or license others to develop.\" (Opp'n 33.) The Court now analyzes the fourth fair use factor taking into account the Parties' arguments and the amendments in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The first issue is whether the Court may presume market harm as it did in its Prior Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order 11 (finding a potential harm to Plaintiff's licensing opportunities is presumed).) Defendants argue the Court cannot presume market harm here. (MTN 16.) Defendants are correct. A court may presume market harm when the second work supersedes the original and \"serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    510 U.S. at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But \"when ... the second use is transformative, market substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so readily inferred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10, Inc. v.

The Court has previously found\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   to be transformative. (Prior Order 8). The Court therefore does not presume market harm but analyzes the potential for market harm based on the allegations in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even without presuming market harm and analyzing this factor in the first instance, the Court finds the amendments in the FAC do not change its finding that factor four weighs in favor of Plaintiff. \"The market for potential derivative uses includes only those that creators of original works would in general develop or license others to develop.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    510 U.S. at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's current literary licensing program involves allowing other authors to publish books based off of Plaintiff's books and even use Plaintiff's characters. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 6). Although these books may not be mash-ups like\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   , there is a potential market for a literary mash-up involving Plaintiff's books; such a market would not be unlikely based on Plaintiff's past licensing programs. Defendant's production of\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   may result in an adverse impact on Plaintiff's derivative market and the Court therefore finds there is potential harm to the market for Plaintiff's derivative works. Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Thus, after again weighing the fair use factors, the Court finds Defendants' fair use defense fails as a matter of law. The relevant information in the FAC regarding factor four, if anything, shifts the balance more in Plaintiff's favor due to the allegations regarding potential market harm. The Court denies Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's claim of copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff claims trademark rights to (1) the title\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   ; (2) \"the stylized font used consistently on the front and back covers, spine, and title page of the Dr. Seuss books such that this use of the styled font has come to be recognized by consumers as a source identifier for Dr. Seuss,\" and (3) \"the unique illustration style of the characters and backgrounds found throughout Dr. Seuss books\" (collectively, the \"Unregistered Dr. Seuss Marks\").

Plaintiff provides general information regarding all Dr. Seuss books-the books have sold over 650 million copies worldwide and have been translated into more than a dozen languages. (FAC \u00b6 14.) Accepting Plaintiff's factual allegations as true, and at this stage of the proceedings, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the public would associate\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   with Dr. Seuss. Thus, the Court finds that the title\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   may be protected under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    2. Whether Plaintiff's Font Is a Trademark\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff alleges trademark rights in \"the stylized font used consistently on the front and back covers, spine, and title page of the Dr. Seuss books.\" (FAC \u00b6 17.) Stated more broadly in its Causes of Action, Plaintiff claims \"Defendants' willful misappropriation of the stylized font that DSE uses consistently throughout the Dr. Seuss books\" misleads and confuses customers. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 76, 85.) As clarified by Plaintiff at oral argument, Plaintiff is claiming trademark rights in all fonts on the\n   <em>\n    covers\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Dr. Seuss books, or also in the font used\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the books. Defendants argue the font on Plaintiff's books varies widely from cover to cover and the \"mutable lettering is too divergent to entitle DSE to trademark protection.\" (Reply 8-9.) At this stage, the Court finds it unnecessary to determine whether Plaintiff may claim trademark rights in the fonts used on covers of books other than\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   or the font used within\n   <em>\n    Go!.\n   </em>\n   The use of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   's title (the words of the title and the title's design on the book covers) will be addressed in the Court's analysis of the nominative fair use factors.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section II.B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Toho Co. v.

But the illustration of the Cat's hat is different than the general \"illustration style\" and non-specific \"characters and backgrounds found throughout\" Plaintiff's books, in which Plaintiff asserts trademark rights now.

In contrast to the title of a single book, the title of a series may be registered as a mark.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Scholastic Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.P.Q.%202d%20%28BNA%29%201774\">\n     23 U.S.P.Q.2d 1774\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (T.T.A.B. 1992) (holding \"The Magic School Bus\" was registrable for a series of children's books, all of which had the mark as part of their title).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Plaintiff does include side-by-side comparisons of pages of\n    <em>\n     Go!\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Boldly\n    </em>\n    as examples of Defendant's attempt \"to recreate entire pages from the Dr. Seuss Books with meticulous precision, and thereby infringe ... the Dr. Seuss Marks.\" (FAC \u00b6 37 (showing eight pages of the two books in side-by-side comparisons).) This provides no insight into whether Plaintiff claims trademark rights in any specific image or background.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Indeed, in\n    <em>\n     Welles\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiff used the trademarked term \"playboy\" and \"playmate\" but added words to the trademark-listing herself as \"Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981.\"\n    <em>\n     Welles\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9397651\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/796/#p802\">\n     279 F.3d at 800\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Still, the Ninth Circuit evaluated the nominative fair use defense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Court also disagrees with Plaintiff that the nominative fair use defense is ill-suited for a Rule 12 motion. (Opp'n 13.) This Court has previously held nominative fair use is appropriate for resolution under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. (Prior Order 17-18.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Defendants also point to the Court's Prior Order, where, in discussing the use of the\n    <em>\n     illustrations\n    </em>\n    within the books, the Court stated\n    <em>\n     Boldly\n    </em>\n    does not \"copy more than necessary to accomplish its transformative purpose.\" (Prior Order 9.) This finding does not apply to the use of the title trademark at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    (FAC \u00b6 37.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Defendants cite\n    <em>\n     Aviva USA Corp. v.

Ariz. 2012) in arguing that the Court must consider the purpose of the work in analyzing this factor. (Reply 11.) That case is distinguishable. There, the court found defendant satisfied the second nominative fair use factor even though defendant had used the \"distinctive colors and font\" of plaintiff's mark.\n    <em>\n     Aviva\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810170\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/902/1246/\">\n     902 F.Supp.2d at 1265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, the court noted defendant used the mark as part of the \"very obvious negative commentary directed toward [plaintiff]\" and this could not lead to confusion.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810170\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/902/1246/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Defendant's use of plaintiff's logo (Aviva) was: \"Aviva Uncovered: The Sad Truth about Aviva's Business Practices.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810170\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/902/1246/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810170\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/902/1246/\">\n     at 1252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court contrasted this from the use of \"the stylized logo and distinctive coloring\" in a \"commercial or competitive manner.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810170\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/902/1246/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810170\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/902/1246/\">\n     at 1256\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, there is no obvious negative commentary of Plaintiff, or any negativity at all, on the cover of or within\n    <em>\n     Boldly\n    </em>\n    , and the Court already found \"there is no question Defendants created their work for profit.\" (Prior Order 8.) Even when considering the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Boldly\n    </em>\n    , the Court finds Defendants have not satisfied this nominative fair use factor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
