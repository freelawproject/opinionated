However, where, as here, it is not apparent from the face of the complaint that a case is removable, a defendant may remove within thirty\n   days of receipt of an amended complaint, motion, order, or \"other paper\" from which it may first be ascertained that the case is removable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, Defendants' counsel first learned in pre-suit written communications with Plaintiff's counsel that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, and that therefore the case was removable. However, the amount in controversy was not apparent from the face of the barebones Complaint, subsequently filed and served. Sometime thereafter, Plaintiff submitted a case management conference memorandum (required by local procedure in state court) demanding $350,000. Thirty days after the case management memorandum was filed (but forty-nine days after the filing and service of the Complaint), Defendants removed the case to federal court. In response, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to remand the case back to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff's position is that the aforementioned pre-suit written communications made it apparent that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, and thereby constitute \"other paper\" under the removal statute. Given that, in Plaintiff's view, the Defendants already knew that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, the thirty-day removal period began when the Complaint was filed and served, thereby rendering removal untimely because removal was more than thirty days after the filing and service of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants contend that it was not apparent that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000 until Plaintiff filed the case management conference memorandum, making removal-thirty days thereafter-timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue in this case is whether the written pre-suit communications between counsel qualify as \"other paper\" under the removal statute. If so, then Defendants' thirty-day window to remove would have started on the date that the Complaint was filed and served. If not, then the time for removal would run from the filing of the case management conference memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that, under \u00a7 1446(b), the written pre-suit communications do not qualify as \"other paper,\" and therefore Defendants' removal within thirty days of the filing of the case management conference memorandum was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   court did not specifically address whether a pre-suit communication could be \"other paper\" (if it were in writing or actually made the amount in controversy apparent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The second case,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , involved a negligence claim arising from a motor vehicle accident.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

There, the defendants removed more than thirty days after the plaintiff filed her complaint, but only two days after plaintiff refused to cap her damages at\n   $75,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20765988\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff argued that defendants were aware that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000 since before the complaint was filed, because of settlement negotiations between plaintiff and defendants' insurance company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   court first looked to the four corners of the complaint, and concluded that it was not apparent from the face of the complaint that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. After discussing the boilerplate complaint, the court went on to note that \"[t]he only concrete numbers produced by [p]laintiff pertaining to damages were contained in a letter from [p]laintiff's counsel to [d]efendants' insurer dated [prior to the suit being filed].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The court then noted that that letter only listed damages totaling less than half of $75,000, so \"[e]ven when viewed in conjunction with the alleged damages asserted in the [c]omplaint, we find that this sum would not place [d]efendants on notice that the amount in controversy requirement has been met.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   court, like the\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   court, did not address whether it mattered that the letter was sent prior to the suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Considering that neither\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   discussed the distinction between pre-suit and post-suit written communications in the context of \"other paper,\" nor the significance of that distinction, they do not support Plaintiff's position that a pre-suit letter can qualify as \"other paper.\" Further, as discussed above, Plaintiff's position is at odds with the statutory language, which makes clear that only post-suit writings qualify as \"other paper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the relevant communications between counsel in this case were exchanged prior to the filing and service of the Complaint, they do not qualify as \"other paper.\" Therefore, the first time that the grounds for removal were apparent under \u00a7 1446(b) was when the case management conference memorandum was filed on April 4, 2017. Thus, the case management conference memorandum is the \"other paper\" in this case. Because Defendants removed this action on May 3, 2017, removal was within thirty days of the filing of the case management conference memorandum, and therefore removal was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
