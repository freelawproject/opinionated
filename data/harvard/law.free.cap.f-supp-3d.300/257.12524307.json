Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court accepts as true the facts as pled in Muhammad's complaint. On the afternoon of June 5, 2014, Muhammad slipped and fell on the \"public sidewalks and ... curbs that were directly adjacent to ... 5636 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. The USPS operates a Post Office at that address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Muhammad suffered \"major injuries to his head, shoulder, ribcage and etcetera.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. The fall \"caused a hole\" in his forehead, which resulted in \"a massive amount\" of bleeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. A passerby helped Muhammad enter the Post Office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Once inside, Muhammad asked \"Defendant [Jane] Doe and/or ... anyone else ... to immediately call '911.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. However, Doe refused both this request and Muhammad's request to use the Post Office's bathroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Doe instead instructed Muhammad to use the bathroom of a grocery store \"located down the street.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, he was \"compelled to seek out 'public transportation' for his severe head injuries in order to seek immediate medical treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Muhammad attributes his injuries to Defendants' negligence in failing to maintain the sidewalk, as well as to \"racism and apathy.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the complaint, Muhammad asserts the following claims, each against all Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Count One: Negligence for failure to maintain the \"postal facility's adjoining sidewalks; walkways and curbs, free of defects and ... hazardous conditions,\" and for failure to warn \"Postal Patrons and/or Postal Visitors of potentially dangerous public sidewalks and/or public sidewalks' curbs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Count Two: Violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for failure \"to provide adequate and meaningful safeguards for people with physical disabilities within ...
