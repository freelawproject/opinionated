DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having considered the substantial evidence in the record, the parties' post-trial\n   submissions, and the applicable law, the court will deny all of Defendant's motions. The court will deny Plaintiffs' motions for enhanced damages, attorney's fees, and a new trial and grant Plaintiffs' motion for prejudgment interest. The court's reasoning follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, a new trial on infringement. (D.I. 249.) Defendant's sole challenge to the jury's infringement verdict is that Plaintiffs \"failed to prove that it 'selectively decolorized' one of the colors of the unsorted mixed color cullet, which is a required element of every asserted claim.\" (D.I. 249 at 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both of the asserted independent claims, 1 and 18, require \"selectively\" decolorizing and enhancing \"at least one of the colors of said unsorted mixed color glass cullet.\" '737 Patent at Claims 1, 18. Thus, to infringe, Defendant must use colorizers or decolorizers in a selective way to remove and enhance only a particular color cullet. (D.I. 249 at 3.) Defendant argues that there is no evidence in the record that its glassmaking process selectively uses decolorizers or colorizers to act on the cullet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Specifically, Defendant argues that the evidence only shows that it used the same colorizers and decolorizers that are well-known in the prior art, that these colorizers and decolorizers acted on all colors in all materials in the batch as a whole, and were not selective. Tr. 263:4-264; 265:10-266.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they presented substantial evidence \"through exhibits, fact, and expert testimony,\" which provided the jury reasonable grounds to find that Defendant infringed all asserted claims of the '737 Patent. (D.I. 260 at 3-4.) The court agrees. Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Steve Martin, testified extensively as to Defendant's infringement finding that \"all of the steps [of the independent claims asserted] have been practiced by [Defendant]'s accused methods.\" (D.I. 260 at 4); Tr. 400:24-433; 424:2-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Dr. Martin's testimony alone provided a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find Defendant infringed the '737 Patent, Plaintiffs submitted considerable additional evidence. (D.I. 260 at 4.) For example, Plaintiffs' technical director, Dr. Lehman, testified that Defendant's Manager of Glass Technology told him they used mixed color cullet with colorizers\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   decolorizers. Tr. 201:1-9. At trial, Plaintiffs presented testimony from Defendant's corporate head, James Keener, who testified that \"[Defendant] practiced every limitation of the '737 Patent's independent claims.\" Tr. 711:22-712:20. The jury also heard evidence about an internal email stating that \"[Defendant] would not seek a license on any color control technology because [they] are already\" using the technology. DX-134; (D.I. 260 at 4.) Lastly, the court recognized at trial that \"asserting a defense of anticipation based on Ardagh's prior public use could seriously undermine the infringement position in the eyes of the jury.\" Tr. 762:10-15. Despite this warning, Defendant proceeded with their defense. Accordingly, a reasonable jury could have found\n   infringement based on all the aforementioned evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant argues, alternatively, that the court should grant a new trial on infringement because \"Plaintiffs' counsel questioned [Defendant]'s lay witness Mr. Keener on the claim elements and concluded with [the question] 'you have just proven infringement [....] correct?' \" (D.I. 249 at 4); Tr. 711:22-712:22. Despite the court's admonishment of Plaintiffs' counsel and its curative instruction, Plaintiffs' counsel repeated this statement in his closing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Tr. 713:5-714:9, 1289:18-20. While counsel behaved inappropriately and unprofessionally at this and other times during the trial, after much thought the court believes its curative instructions sufficed to adequately ameliorate the harm caused by counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inter Digital Commc'ns, Inc. v. ZTE Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201073229\">\n    2016 WL 1073229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (D. Del. Mar. 18, 2016). At the time the question was asked, the court told the jury that they were \"to disregard [counsel's] question and his comment. It was inappropriate. He has been told about it. And he will not repeat the offense again. But I am directing you to disregard the comment, please.\" Tr. 714:2-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the final jury instructions the court reiterated its point and instructed the jury that they \"must completely ignore\" all the things during trial they were ordered to disregard and that they must \"not speculate about\" what a witness or exhibit may have shown because they are not evidence. Tr. 1230:15-23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For these reasons, the court will deny Defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, for a new trial on the issue of infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Willful Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, Defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, a new trial on willful infringement. (D.I. 249.) Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs failed to prove willful infringement of the '737 Patent because (1) its glassmaking process predates the '737 Patent's. priority date; (2) it did not use unsorted cullet; and (3) Plaintiffs' actions demonstrate that it did not willfully infringe the '737 Patent. (D.I. 249 at 5.) Generally, a finding of willful infringement should be reserved for \"egregious cases of misconduct beyond typical infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1935\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1935,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1935\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Willfulness \"is a classical jury question of intent. When trial is had to a jury, the issue should be decided by the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    WBIP, LLC v.

Cir. 2016). A willful infringer is one \"who intentionally infringes another's patents-with no doubts about its validity or any notion of a defense-for no other purpose other than to steal the patentee's business.\"\n   <em>\n    Halo Elecs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1935\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Priority Date &amp; Mixed Cullet\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant asserts that because their glassmaking process predated the '737 Patent's priority date, it reasonably believed it could not be liable for infringement. (D.I. 249 at 5.) Defendant further contends that testimony by their former Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Mr. Rhea, establishes that Defendant's glassmaking process had not materially changed since at least 1986, and the process used\n   <em>\n    mixed\n   </em>\n   color cullet prior to Plaintiffs' patent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1935\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Tr. 768:1-11, 771:20-773:13. At his deposition, however, Mr. Rhea also stated that he \"can't recall [to] any degree ever reading [the '737 patent ],\" and was not \"aware of any analysis that Ardagh did internally to determine whether or not it was using technology from CulChrome.\" (D.I. 260 at 10); (D.I. 252 at 10.) Defendant's Senior Vice President of Technical Services, Roger Erb, further said he would be \"impress[ed]\" if Plaintiffs \"could take 50% Green Glass and 50% Amber Glass and successfully make Amber Glass\" at the time. (D.I. 260 at 8); (JTX-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Unsorted Cullet\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that it believed it was not liable for patent infringement because it does not and has not used\n   <em>\n    unsorted\n   </em>\n   cullet. (D.I. 249 at 7.) At trial, the evidence from both Defendant's witnesses and third parties established that Defendant used\n   <em>\n    sorted\n   </em>\n   mixed color cullet before Plaintiffs' patent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1935\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant, however, introduced no evidence that anyone \"act[ed] on the basis of the defense [of using only sorted cullet] or was even aware of it.\" (D.I. 260 at 11);\n   <em>\n    Halo Elecs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1935\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, Defendant's assertion that it could not be liable because it only used \"sorted\" cullet contradicts its prior assertion that it could not be liable because it had been using \"mixed color cullet\" prior to issuance of the '737 Patent. (D.I. 249 at 5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiffs' Actions &amp; Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Among other things, the jury heard evidence on (1) Defendant's deliberate copying, including that, a mere eight days after learning about the patent, Defendant drafted a secret dossier in which it sought information regarding nineteen different aspects about Plaintiffs' technology; (2) Defendant's failure to investigate the scope of the patent or form a good faith belief that it was invalid or not infringed; (3) Defendant's failure to take remedial action, including continued post-suit infringement; and (4) Defendant's attempts to conceal its infringement, including a letter sent to Plaintiffs denying infringement pre-suit and a letter post-suit denying it used \"mixed color cullet.\" Tr. 593:11-15. After considering the evidence, the jury, under a heightened willfulness instruction, found that \"Ardagh was especially worthy of punishment.\" Tr. at 1250:23-24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Other than presenting conflicting testimony from their own experts, Defendant has not demonstrated that a reasonable jury could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have found that it willfully infringed the patent. It is not the court's role to second guess the credibility determinations of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SIBIA Neuroscis. Inc., v.

Anticipation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At trial, Defendant asserted that three separate references (hereinafter \"the 1995 Process,\" \"Duckett,\" and \"Ross\") anticipate the asserted claims of the '737 patent -in-suit. Proving that a patent is invalid based on anticipation \"requires that the four corners of a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   , prior art document describe every element of the claimed invention, either expressly or inherently, such that a person of ordinary skill in the art could practice the invention without undue experimentation.\"\n   <em>\n    EMC Corp., et al. v. Zerto, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201291757\">\n    2016 WL 1291757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 (D. Del.

Cir. 2000). The central point of dispute between the parties is whether each of these prior art references anticipates the \"unsorted mixed color cullet\" requirement that appears in the '737 Patent. (D.I. 249 at 10.) Plaintiffs aver that not one of the three references anticipate the patents-in-suit. (D.I. 260 at 12.) The court agrees, and, for the reasons that follow, finds that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury's verdict of no invalidity by anticipation with respect to each of the references.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    i. The 1995 Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant asserts that their pre-1995 glassmaking process used mixed color cullet colorizers, and decolorizers. (D.I. 249 at 9.) Specifically, Defendant asserts the result of the broad construction of unsorted mixed color cullet is that their pre-1995 process anticipates the '737 Patent. (D.I. 249 at 11.) Plaintiffs argue that the 1995 Process cannot anticipate the '737 Patent because \"trial proved that Ardagh's alleged invalidating reference, DX-16, did not anticipate the '737 [P]atent.\" (D.I. 260 at 13.) Defendant did not, and cannot, prove anticipation for six distinct reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, Defendant's expert, Dr. Carty, admitted on direct examination that he predicated his anticipation opinions on ignoring the \"selectivity limitation.\" Tr. 1073:4-114. Second, Dr. Carty admitted that DX-16 does not explicitly disclose mixed color cullet. Tr. 1127:18-1129:22. Third, more than sufficient evidence existed for a reasonable jury to reject Dr. Carty's assertion that the \"cullet\" listed in DX-16 was mixed color cullet. For example, Dr. Carty admitted that as of 1994 Defendant's trade association confirmed that mixed color cullet in container manufacturing could not be used. Tr. 1125:6-21. Fourth, Dr. Carty showed batch records containing greater than 50 percent internal cullet added to the batch. Tr. 1130:3-13. Fifth, the jury instructions properly instructed that an anticipating reference must be \"reasonably accessible to the public,\" or \"not subsequently abandoned, suppressed, or concealed.\" Tr. 1254:11-1255:19; (D.I. 260 at 16.) Sixth, Defendant introduced no evidence that the pre-1995 process anticipated dependent claim 20, which adds the limitation that the \"mixed color cullet\" comprise flint, green, and amber glass.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747593\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1272/#p1282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Duckett\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant's post-trial brief asserts that Duckett discloses the use of colorizers with mixed color cullet to make amber and green bottles. (D.I. 249 at 16.) Specifically, Defendant argues that Duckett disclosed selective colorizing in 1979, including \"selenium and cobalt oxide and manganese as the decolorizing agents [to] compensate for iron and flint glass.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747593\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1272/#p1282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Tr. 1092:3-20; Tr. 1095:12-16. Thus, Defendant asserts Duckett anticipates claims 1 and 18 as a matter of law in addition to each of the dependent claims, claim 20, 21, 22, and 24. (D.I. 249 at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendant's invalidity defenses regarding the Duckett and Ross references, were so meritless that Defendant did not even mention them in their opening statement or closing argument. (D.I. 260 at 18.) Additionally, Plaintiffs point out that Defendant's expert, Dr. Carty, only testified about Duckett on direct for three minutes. (D.I. 260 at 18); Tr. 1090:12-1094:2. Dr. Carty gave an analysis of claim 18 and was asked \"[i]f we march through the rest of the limitations for claim 18, do you find any of limitation that has not been disclosed in Duckett for claim 18?\" to which he responded, \"No, I do not.\" Tr. 1093:14-17.

On cross examination, Dr. Carty explained how Duckett did not invalidate the '737 patent because it merely disclosed how to solve the so-called \"flint tinge problem.\" Tr. at 1149:25-1150:23. The '737 Patent itself, however, disclosed and distinguished the \"flint tinge problem\" as being unrelated to the problem and methods disclosed in the '737 Patent.

(D.I. 249 at 17.) At trial, Mr. Ross, an independent consultant in glass manufacturing, testified that his 1994 batch calculation for Coors proved that he helped Coors make glass including mixed cullet, decolorizers, and colorizers, including salt cake, graphite, and melite. Tr. 917:14-25-918:1-25. Defendant asserts that while Plaintiffs contend that the Ross Batch Calculations were secret, Mr. Ross testified that they were not confidential when he shared them with Coors. (D.I. 249 at 17); Tr. 920:16-18. In response, Plaintiffs argue that there was no evidence regarding a motivation to combine Duckett and the Ross Batch Calculation. (D.I. 260 at 18-19.) Additionally, Plaintiffs assert that Dr. Carry's testimony regarding the alleged obviousness in light of the combination of Duckett, Ross, and the knowledge of a POSA was equally deficient as a matter of law because he did not analyze any of the four\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   Factors.

(D.I. 257 at 27.) The parties dispute when Plaintiffs learned of the infringement.

Defendant argues that if the court awards prejudgment interest, it should apply the T-Bill rate \"because plaintiffs never produced evidence (1) that they borrowed at a higher rate; (2) what that rate was; or (3) that there was any causal connection between borrowing and losing the use of the money due to [Defendant]'s infringement.\" (D.I. 257 at 27-28.);\n   <em>\n    Schering Corp. v.

Plaintiffs submitted the declaration of Anthony Lame confirming that it was forced to borrow at a rate of 9% during the damages period, which would add more to the verdict than the compounded quarterly rate. (D.I. 262 at 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Plaintiffs' motion for prejudgment interest will be granted in accordance with the compounding quarterly calculations set forth by Michael Lasinski, Plaintiffs' damages expert, in his declarations.

(D.I. 252 at 14.) Defendant counters that it did not copy the patent at issue because it has been making glass using mixed color cullet long before the '737 Patent. (D.I. 257 at 2.) While substantial evidence was presented at trial on both sides of the dispute, the jury presumably found the facts to be more consistent with Plaintiffs' characterization than Defendant's. The court, therefore, concludes that the \"deliberate copying\" factor must, based on the jury verdict, be deemed to favor enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Turning to the second\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   Factor-\"whether the infringer, when he knew of the other's patent protection, investigated the scope of the patent and formed a good-faith belief that it was invalid or that it was not infringed\"-the record shows that Defendant did not have a \"good faith belief\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   that the '737 Patent was invalid or not infringed. On November 25, 1998, Mr. Rhea told Plaintiffs that it \"had been working with mixed cullet for 'five or six years' ...\" Tr. 265:10-266:10. Defendant, however, maintains that it continuously told Plaintiffs that their patent could not cover Defendant's \"long-standing processes.\" (D.I. 257 at 6.) The jury, however, returned a verdict finding willful infringement \"especially worthy of punishment.\" Tr. 1250:21-24, 1375: 8-11. This factor, therefore, weighs in favor of enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant's \"behavior as a party to the litigation,\" the next\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   Factor, disfavors enhancement. Plaintiffs assert that Defendant's counsel \"conceded that Ms. Flight's testimony was 'terrible,' but then falsely told the jury, '[t]hat testimony does not have anything to do with any issue you have to decide in this case.' \" (D.I. 252 at 12); Tr. 1325:16-23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant, however, asserts that Plaintiffs inappropriately suggest that its counsel lied during closing arguments, and that Ms. Flight's deposition testimony was and remains irrelevant to infringement, invalidity, and willful infringement since she was not an officer who had any authority to decide how Defendant made glass. (D.I. 257 at 9.) Ms. Flight, however, admitted that if she were \"to sign a declaration today, it would say something completely different than what th[e] declaration [regarding mixed color cullet] said\" when she signed it. Tr. 294:17-295:2. In sum, the litigation conduct factor does not favor enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant is a large and healthy business entity. This fact might, as a general matter, support enhancement. Under the circumstances here, however, these considerations do not merit any weight. Plaintiffs agreed with Defendant to exclude reference to Defendant's size and financial condition in the parties' proposed pre-trial order. (D.I. 212 at 4, Schedule N1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4); (D.I. 257 at 10.) As such, there was no evidence presented that Ardagh \"exploited its size and wealth\" over Plaintiffs in refusing to license or use the '737 Patent. (D.I. 252 at 13.) Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The next\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   Factor, \"closeness of the case,\" is neutral. Defendant prevailed at trial on non-infringement on one of the two patents at issue. (D.I. 257 at 10.) The court denied Plaintiffs' request for summary judgment on all claims and defenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; (D.I. 211.) Plaintiffs, however, prevailed at trial on willful infringement of the '737 Patent as to all claims. (D.I. 252 at 14.) The jury's deliberation was relatively brief-approximately three hours. Nevertheless, the case presented a number of close calls for the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 763:22-764:19 (discussing claim construction), 1243:6-11, 1359:7-1360:3, 1373:21; (D.I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   183.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, however, finds this factor to be neutral as there is evidence that could weigh in favor of each side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The next two factors-the \"duration\" of the infringer's \"misconduct\" and \"[r]emedial action\" it has taken-do not favor enhancement. Even accepting Plaintiffs' position that Defendant's misconduct began in March 2008,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the '737 Patent expired (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 353:14-16), the record cannot be reasonably understood to show an uninterrupted 7-year period of un-remediated wrongs. In 1998, Plaintiffs approached Defendant with their patents and explained their glassmaking process. Tr. 775:8-24. Subsequently, according to Defendant, Plaintiffs threatened them with a patent infringement action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant explained that it did not infringe and did not need a license because it was using the same process well before Plaintiffs. (D.I. 257 at 11.) For 15-years, Plaintiffs did not make another infringement assertion and never disputed Defendant's contentions of non-liability prior to filing suit in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Similarly, there is no evidence of a \"motivation for harm\" that would support enhancement. Plaintiffs rely on the rebuttal expert report of Defendant's damages expert, Mr. Schoettelkotte, to support their position. (D.I. 152 at 15.) The statement upon which Plaintiffs rely says that \"no Ardagh customers or end users have indicated they would pay more for glass containers simply due to the presence of recycled glass within the containers, much less one with the accused unsorted mixed color cullet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The statement further explains that there was no evidence that \"any such success or popularity is based on the allegedly infringing manufacturing process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This is not enough. \"[T]he fact that the infringer acted pursuant to a financial motive does not distinguish this case from the garden-variety infringement case.\"\n   <em>\n    Idenix Pharms.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272996\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/271/694/#p705\">\n    271 F.Supp.3d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sprint Communications Co., L.P. v.

The jury also learned from Green Mountain's president that this is why Plaintiffs did not seek redress earlier. Tr. 325:21-326:22.

Defendant, however, maintains that it did not conceal their process, thus, concealment cannot be a basis to enhance Plaintiffs' damages. (D.I. 257 at 12.) Given the history between these parties, the court believes that if this factor weighs in favor of an enhanced award, it is only ever so slightly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Having assessed and weighing each of the\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   Factors, the court concludes that an award of enhanced damages is not warranted. Only three factors favorite enhancement: deliberate copying, investigation and good faith belief, and attempts to conceal misconduct. Most of the other factors-a good faith belief in non-infringement, behavior in the litigation, the duration\n   of misconduct and remedial actions taken by Defendant, and the lack of a motivation to harm Plaintiffs-disfavor enhancement. The remaining factors, Defendant's size and financial condition, and the closeness of the case are essentially neutral. In sum, the\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   Factors demonstrate that the court should exercise its discretion to deny Plaintiffs' request for enhanced damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The award of attorneys' fees therefore turns on whether this case is exceptional. In light of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that it is not exceptional.\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons described in connection with the court's decision on enhancement of damages, this case does not \"stand out from others\" with respect to the \"substantive strength\" of Plaintiffs' position, nor the substantive weakness of Defendant's. Instead, both sides' positions had substantial merit, and this was a case that, quite understandably, went to trial-a trial at which either side could have prevailed. Nor does this case \"stand out from others\" with respect to \"the unreasonable manner\" in which it was litigated. While the case has been hotly contested, and has been marked by a tremendous number of disputes, these are typical realities of high-stakes patent litigation between competitors in a market presenting an opportunity for enormous profits. For the most part, both sides defended their respective positions throughout this litigation in apparent good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court, therefore, finds that no party is entitled to an award for attorneys' fees and costs in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
