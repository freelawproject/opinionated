As recently instructed by our court of appeals, when the proxy discloses the specific information given to the directors' financial advisor and then discloses the financial advisor's projections as a matter of fact with several disclaimers, a shareholder cannot transform the securities law mandate of disclosure into challenging whether the directors should have given more information to the financial advisor. The directors' proxy disclosure of the specific information given to the advisor is fact-based. It either happened as represented or it did not. Today we review a shareholder's challenge to the directors' disclosure of information given to the financial advisor to prepare projections and then copied into a proxy statement. The shareholder does not challenge other misleading statements in the proxy. With several disclaimers, the proxy's representation of giving financial information to the advisor and then disclosing the advisor's projections is a true statement. We decline to transform the disclosure of the information given to the advisor and the advisor's resultant projections reported in the proxy into a fiduciary obligation of disclosing all aspects of the assumptions which possibly should or could have been given to the advisor particularly with lengthy and specific disclaimers under the securities law. The disclosures challenged today do not state a federal securities claim and we grant the motion to dismiss in the accompanying Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pension Fund now sues HIG, LBT Acquisition, LBT Merger Sub, Lionbridge, and Lionbridge's board of directors and executives alleging the January 31, 2017 proxy violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its implementing regulations. Pension Fund claims the proxy statement contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pension Fund also claims HIG, its affiliates, and Lionbridge's board and executives are \"controlling persons\" as defined under Section 20(a) of the '34 Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   and should be held liable for the misleading statements and omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HIG, its affiliates, Lionbridge, and Lionbridge's board and executives move to dismiss the amended complaint. They argue the proxy statement did not contain material false or misleading statements or omissions. They also argue the statements and omissions relate to forward-looking statements accompanied by cautionary language and are not actionable under the safe harbor found in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the \"bespeaks caution\" doctrine. Finally, they argue Pension Fund failed to plead a claim against HIG, LBT Acquisition, LBT Merger Sub and Lionbridge Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer Marc Litz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pension Fund fails to plead a misleading or false statement or omission under Section 14(a).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pension Fund alleges specific nondisclosures violate the securities laws. First, Pension Fund claims the projections table included in the \"Projected Financial Information\" section of the proxy statement is\n   materially misleading because the projections did not incorporate anticipated growth through Lionbridge's acquisition strategy. Second, Pension Fund claims the financial projections did not incorporate the financial impact of the Exequo acquisition completed days after Lionbridge's merger with LBT Merger Sub. Third, Pension Fund claims four statements relating to the assumptions underlying the projections are misleading and false, including the statement the projections \"were developed under the assumption of continued standalone operation as a publicly traded company and did not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger.\" Pension Fund claims the assumptions are misleading because Lionbridge omitted the fact the financial projections did not incorporate Lionbridge's acquisition strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue the projections cited by Pension Fund cannot be interpreted as a statement of fact regarding management's expectations for the future. Rather, Lionbridge included the projections to provide the voting shareholders with the same projections Lionbridge management and Union Square used in evaluating the potential merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pension Fund invokes our subject matter jurisdiction and limits its claim based on specific disclosures which allegedly violate federal securities law. It does not allege breach of fiduciary duty under Delaware Law. \"[T]he fundamental purpose of the Securities Exchange Act is to implement 'a philosophy of full disclosure;' once full and fair disclosure has occurred, the fairness of the terms of the transaction is beyond the scope of the Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   A breach of fiduciary duty unaccompanied by misrepresentation, nondisclosure, or deception, does not violate the '34 Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 14(a) of the '34 Act prohibits any person \"in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [Securities and Exchange Commission] may prescribe ... to solicit or to permit the use of his name to solicit any proxy or consent or authorization in respect of any security ... registered pursuant to section 12.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Section 14(a) seeks to prevent management or others from obtaining authorization for corporate actions by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosures in proxy solicitations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 14a-9 provides \"[n]o solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made by means of any proxy statement ... containing any statement which, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"To be actionable under Rule 14a-9, 'a statement or omission must have been misleading at the time it was made; liability cannot be imposed on the basis of subsequent events.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The filer of a proxy statement is not obligated to predict the future, unless\n   the filer has reason to believe a future event will occur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    ECF Doc.

Based on the disclaimer accompanying the projections, the only relevant statement of fact a shareholder may draw from the inclusion of the projections is Lionbridge provided the same projections to its special committee of independent directors and to Union Square in assessing the proposed merger with LBT Merger Sub.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Pension Fund claims the projections are materially misleading because they fail to incorporate potential growth through Lionbridge's acquisition strategy. Pension Fund alleges Lionbridge experienced compound annual revenue growth of 7% from\n    2011 to 2015.\n    <footnotemark>\n     64\n    </footnotemark>\n    In 2016, Lionbridge disclosed a preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2017 estimating its year-on-year revenue growth to be 4%-6%.\n    <footnotemark>\n     65\n    </footnotemark>\n    Pension Fund also alleges Lionbridge's Chairman and CEO stated his intention to make Lionbridge a $1 billion company in the near future, largely through acquisitions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     66\n    </footnotemark>\n    But the projections included in the proxy statement provided for a compound annual growth rate of around 3.9%.\n    <footnotemark>\n     67\n    </footnotemark>\n    Pension Fund accounts for the reduced growth rate estimate of 3.9% by alleging Lionbridge failed to incorporate potential growth through acquisitions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Even assuming Pension Fund alleged sufficient facts to attribute the reduction in Lionbridge's growth estimates to its failure to include estimated growth through its acquisition strategy, Pension Fund does not allege a false or misleading statement based on the projections. Pension Fund does not allege how the omission of potential growth through an acquisition strategy is materially misleading or false based on the information reported to Union Square. Pension Fund does not allege Lionbridge's board did not provide the projections to its special committee, or financial advisor. Whether the projection incorporated the acquisition strategy does not negate Lionbridge's representation it provided the same projection to others involved in assessing the merger. The representation in the proxy statement is true. Pension Fund's claim the Defendants should have told Union Square more information may have been or could have been part of the pre-merger Chancery Court litigations, but this \"should have disclosed\" is not part of the plead Section 14 claim here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    For the same reason, Pension Fund's claim fails to the extent it relies on the alleged exclusion of the Exequo acquisition from the projections. Pension Fund does not allege how this renders the statement the projections were available to Lionbridge and Union Square in assessing the merger false or misleading under Section 14(a).\n    <footnotemark>\n     68\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because Pension Fund does not allege the projections included in the proxy statement are not the same projections provided to Lionbridge's board and Union Square in assessing the proposed merger, Pension Fund does not state a claim under 14(a) based on the projections.\n    <footnotemark>\n     69\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Pension Fund claims the assumptions underlying the projections are false and misleading because the projections did not incorporate Lionbridge's acquisition growth strategy. Directed by our court of appeals in\n    <em>\n     OFI Asset Mgmt.\n    </em>\n    , we analyze only the statements alleged to be false and misleading in Pension Fund's amended complaint. Pension Fund alleges four statements relating to the underlying assumptions of the financial projections as false or misleading. Specifically, Pension Fund cites the Defendants' statement the projections \"were developed under the assumption of continued standalone operation and did not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger.\"; \"The forecasts ... were based on numerous variables and assumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market conditions ...\"; \"The forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change ...\"; and finally, \"The forecasts also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for our business, changes in business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when the forecasts were prepared.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Pension Fund's claim fails for the same reason its claim based on the projection numbers failed. Pension Fund does not identify how these assumptions render the statement of fact the same projections were provided to Lionbridge's board and Union Square is materially false or misleading. Allowing Pension Fund to backdoor a claim based on the projections by alleging false and misleading assumptions would allow Pension Fund to wholly bypass our court of appeals' decision in\n    <em>\n     OFI Asset Mgmt\n    </em>\n    . Pension Fund's claim based on the projections' assumptions is equivalent to its claim based on the numbers. Even assuming it is true the assumptions do not reflect Lionbridge's acquisition strategy, it would not negate the representation by Lionbridge it provided the same projections based on the same purported assumptions to its board, special committee and financial advisor. Pension Fund does not allege Lionbridge provided different projections to its board, special committee, or financial advisor. Based on our liberal reading of Pension Fund's amended complaint, Lionbridge provided the same allegedly flawed projections to its board, special committee, and financial advisors as it did to its shareholders.\n    <footnotemark>\n     70\n    </footnotemark>\n    Pension Fund now seeks to hold Lionbridge's board and others liable for failing to provide accurate projections. This theory is not viable under our court of appeals' guidance in\n    <em>\n     OFI Asset Mgmt\n    </em>\n    . If it did, we would be recognizing a claim challenging the board's adherence to the fiduciary duties of loyalty, candor and care in the context of a 14(a) claim. We decline to transform Section 14(a) focusing on disclosure into a second shot at a fiduciary duty claim for failing to disclose information to the financial advisor. This may be a claim in Chancery Court but we do not see a viable claim under Section 14(a) after\n    <em>\n     OFI Asset Mgmt.\n    </em>\n    Pension Fund fails to allege a\n    false or misleading statement in the proxy statement under Section 14(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Pension Fund's Section 20(a) claim fails because it does not allege an underlying violation of the '34 Act.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Pension Fund claims Lionbridge's board members and executives and HIG, LBT Acquisition, and LBT Merger Sub are liable for the alleged false and misleading statements and omissions as \"controlling persons\" under Section 20(a). Section 20(a) of the '34 Act imposes liability on every person who controls any person liable under any provision of the '34 Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     71\n    </footnotemark>\n    A Section 20(a) claim is predicated on an underlying '34 Act violation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     72\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because we find Pension Fund does not allege a Section 14(a) violation, Pension Fund Section 20(a) claim fails.\n    <footnotemark>\n     73\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    We dismiss Pension Fund's Section 14(a) claim for failure to allege a misleading or false statement or omission in the proxy statement. The challenged statements are true as stated. We dismiss Pension Fund's Section 20(a) as Pension Fund fails to plead Defendants violated the '34 Act.
