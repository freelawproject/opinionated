Moreover, the Personal Keepsakes court determined that the poems at issue were not entitled to copyright protection, rendering that court's comments about the meaning of \"conveyed in connection with\" dicta.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233880\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/975/920/#p929\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

The second case it cites in support,\n   <em>\n    Tomelleri v.

This is because a link to the Terms of Use appeared at the bottom of each relevant webpage, and because the Terms of Use clearly state that they are intended to cover all content on the website. This includes Plaintiff's photographs. Physical proximity is not the only appropriate measure of whether a copyright notice constitutes CMI. Rather, the notice must be \"accessible in conjunction with, or appear with, the work being accessed.\"\n   <em>\n    Janik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20345111\">\n    2018 WL 345111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.

Plaintiff argues that it is immaterial that Defendants did not know that Plaintiff held the copyright, because Defendant must have known that Defendant did not itself own the photographs' copyrights. She further argues that Defendant intentionally chose the wording of the copyright messages at the bottom of each webpage and the Terms of Use.
