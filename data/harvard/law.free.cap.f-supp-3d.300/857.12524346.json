Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This civil rights action stems from the September 14, 2015 suspension and arrest of A.M., a fourteen-year-old African-American Muslim freshman attending McArthur High School (\"McArthur\") in\n   Irving, Texas. He was suspended from school and arrested on charges of bringing a \"hoax bomb\" to school. Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed (\"Mr. Mohamed\" or \"Plaintiff\"), as next friend for his minor son, A.M., filed this action on August 8, 2016, seeking monetary and injunctive relief against the City of Irving (the \"City\"), the Irving Independent School District (the \"IISD\"), and school principal Daniel Cummings (\"Principal Cummings\"). Mr. Mohamed alleged that Principal Cummings subjected A.M. to discriminatory discipline based on race and religion when he suspended A.M. for three days and, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , sued him for alleged violations of A.M.'s constitutionally protected right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Alleging that Principal Cummings was acting pursuant to an unconstitutional practice of discriminatory discipline against African-American students sanctioned by the IISD's Board of Trustees, Mr. Mohamed also sued the IISD for Fourteenth Amendment violations as well for allegedly violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d (\"Title VI\"), by discriminating against A.M. on the basis of his race and religion. Although Mr. Mohamed did not sue any of the individual police officers involved in A.M.'s arrest, he sued the City under section 1983 alleging that it had failed to properly train and supervise its officers with respect to determining probable cause for arrest, and that these inadequacies caused the police officers' alleged violations of A.M.'s constitutionally protected rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 18, 2017, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the City's, Principal Cummings's, and the IISD's respective motions to dismiss, and dismissed all claims without prejudice, with the exception of Mr. Mohamed's section 1983 claim against the City premised on alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment and his Title VI claim against the IISD premised on religious discrimination, which were dismissed with prejudice, \"as there [was] no legal basis for those claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v.

Tex. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   \"). The court granted Mr. Mohamed leave to file an amended pleading by June 1, 2017, as to all claims dismissed without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274018\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/602/#p629\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 1, 2017, Mr. Mohamed filed Plaintiff's First Amended Original Complaint (Doc. 27), and on June 15, 2017, the court granted Mr. Mohamed's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint and to add as Defendants four City of Irving police officers: Robin Howman (\"Officer Howman\") and Charles Taylor (\"Officer Taylor\"), who were working as school resource officers at McArthur on the date of the incident; and Sergeant Richie Miller (\"Sgt. Miller\") and Sergeant Jeff Mitchell (\"Sgt. Mitchell\"), both of whom ultimately made the decision to arrest A.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 15, 2017, Mr. Mohamed, as next friend of A.M., filed Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (\"Second Amended Complaint\"), the live pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sec. Am. Compl. (Doc. 34). In addition to amending his pleadings in an attempt to overcome the pleading deficiencies identified by the court in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   with respect to his claims against the City, the IISD, and Principal Cummings, Mr. Mohamed brings claims against Officer Howman, Officer Taylor, Sgt. Miller, and Sgt. Mitchell (sometimes collectively, the \"Officer Defendants\") pursuant to section 1983, alleging that they violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by arresting A.M. without probable cause on charges of bringing a \"hoax bomb\" to school in violation of section 46.08 of the Texas Penal Code and by\n   using excessive force against him during the arrest. Mr. Mohamed asserts that Defendants are jointly and severally liable and, in addition to actual and compensatory damages, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All Defendants have filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The City and the IISD contend that, although permitted an opportunity to amend his pleadings twice, Mr. Mohamed has failed to cure the pleading deficiencies noted by the court in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   and that his additional allegations are conclusory and insufficient to state a claim. Principal Cummings similarly argues that the amended pleadings are insufficient to overcome his entitlement to qualified immunity. The City, the IISD, and Principal Cummings request that all claims be dismissed with prejudice, as Mr. Mohamed has already had two previous opportunities to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sgt. Miller and Sgt. Mitchell, who were not parties in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   , assert their entitlement to qualified immunity and contend that Mr. Mohamed's section 1983 claim against them for unlawful arrest and excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be dismissed because he fails to allege any underlying Fourth Amendment violation and because they did not violate clearly established law of which a reasonable law enforcement officer would have known. Officers Taylor and Howman also assert their entitlement to qualified immunity and make similar arguments to those made by Sgt. Miller and Sgt. Mitchell. In addition, Officers Taylor and Howman contend that dismissal is required on the face of the pleadings, as Mr. Mohamed alleges that it was Sgt. Miller and Sgt. Mitchell who made the decision to arrest A.M. and who used force against A.M., rather than either of them, thereby defeating any Fourth Amendment claim against them for arrest without probable cause or excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Mohamed counters that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are factually and legally sufficient to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. He urges the court to deny the motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court now sets forth the allegations drawn from the Second Amended Complaint. In its recitation of the facts, the court applies the legal standard set forth in Section II of this Memorandum Opinion and Order and accepts all well-pleaded facts as true and views them in the light most favorable to Mr. Mohamed.\n   <em>\n    Sonnier v.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 57. A.M. showed the device to his Geometry teacher, Mr. Lemons, who told him that it was \"really nice\" and advised him to keep it in his backpack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Later that same day, notwithstanding Mr. Lemon's instruction, A.M. removed the device from his backpack and showed it to another student during his fourth period English class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The device made a beeping sound and caught the attention of his English teacher, Erin West (\"Ms. West\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. West heard the beeping noise but did not know whence it came.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After class, A.M. approached Ms. West with the device and reminded her that the prior Friday he had told her he was going to build her something\n   that weekend and bring it to school to show her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When A.M. showed her the device, she asked: \"[I]s that a bomb?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A.M. was surprised and confused by her question, since he had built many contraptions over the years and taken them to school to show teachers, and he replied, \"no, it's an alarm clock, see?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. West took the device from A.M., told him she would give it back to him at the end of the day, and placed it in her desk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"For the next several hours, the homemade clock was out of A.M.'s hands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notwithstanding that McArthur had a bomb threat protocol, Ms. West did nothing to engage the protocol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. \"There was no alarm raised, no evacuation, [and] no bomb squad called.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.

At 12:45 p.m., Ms. West sent an e-mail to Officer Howman stating: \"I confiscated something from a student in my classroom that I would like for you or Officer Taylor to take a look at. I can't come down until 8th period. Is there a way for one of you to stop by Room (804) before this.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint App. in Supp. of Daniel Cummings's and IISD's Mot. to Dismiss Pl.'s Sec. Am. Compl.

Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 60. When Officer Howman arrived, Ms. West took the device into the hallway and plugged it into an electric socket on the wall to demonstrate the clock to Officer Howman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following this initial inspection, Officer Howman brought the device to the school resource office and showed it to Officer Taylor, who took a picture of the device and sent it to Sgt.

The\n   Irving police, the Mayor of Irving and the IISD have all represented to the public that A.M. was \"less than forthcoming\" during his interrogation. However, A.M. repeatedly told them that it was an alarm clock, not a bomb, which was true. He repeatedly told them that he had made it to show his English teacher, which was true. The clock functioned as a crude alarm clock. A.M. never represented that it was anything else, he never made any threat of harm, he never said he had a bomb, and he never attempted to scare anyone or cause alarm. A.M. never misrepresented a single thing. Tellingly, the Irving police eventually dropped the charges for which they arrested him and it was stated that there was no proof that A.M. had \"intent to cause alarm.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When A.M. asked for his parents, he was told that he could not talk to them because he was in the middle of an interrogation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. During the interrogation, Principal Cummings told A.M. to write a statement and \"threatened to expel him if he did not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. A.M. was \"terrified\" and did not want to write anything.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At 3:01 p.m., A.M. wrote on a piece of paper under the heading \"Write in your own words what happened\": \"I Built a clock, Cops think It's a Bomb.\" Joint App. 4, Declaration of Daniel Cummings at Ex. A (September 14, 2015 Statement) (Doc. 40-4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Mohamed alleges that A.M. wrote the statement because he was threatened and did not have anything to hide, and that the reason he wrote \"that he made an alarm clock and the authorities thought was a bomb\" is because \"that was what they were telling him.\" Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 65. In the same Statement, at 3:02 p.m., Principal Cummings wrote: \"I asked A.M. again, \"What was your intent for building the clock?

Officer Howman placed A.M. in handcuffs and marched him out of the front of the school, all four officers involved in the arrest, two on each side of A.M.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. Mr. Mohamed further alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Because Officer Howman was the arresting officer, A.M. was placed in the back of Officer Howman's police vehicle; however, when Officer Howman noticed\n   that the mobile video was not working in his car, A.M. was transferred to Officer Taylor's police vehicle. They put him into the back of a police car. They took him to the police station and booked him as a criminal, with mugshots and fingerprinting-all still without his parents. On the way to the station, Officer Taylor told Officer Howman that [Sergeants] Mitchell and Miller wanted the device to show the captain, so Officer Howman gave the clock to [Sgt.] Miller when he arrived at the police station.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   When at the station, A.M. was seated in handcuffs in a room with Officers Taylor and Howman, who further questioned A.M. while [Sergeants] Mitchell and Miller inquired, presumably with their superiors, regarding how to proceed with the matter. Eventually, [Sgt.] Miller returned to tell Officers Taylor and Howman that A.M. was going to be processed and released to his parents at the station. Only at this point did Officer Howman called A.M.'s father, who indicated that he would be at the police station in 5 minutes.

After A.M.'s mother and sister arrived, Mr. Mohamed asked whether they could see A.M. to find out what happened.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Sgt. Mitchell said they could not see A.M. until the arrest was processed and completed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, Officer Taylor brought A.M. to his family in handcuffs, shoving A.M. as he walked and telling him to \"hurry up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After speaking with A.M., Mr. Mohamed urged the officers to drop all charges, stating that A.M. had done nothing wrong, but the officers refused to discuss this possibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As they were leaving, A.M.'s family asked for his electronic tablet back, which was refused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.

Mayor Van Duyne and the City Council's actions in this regard created immense tension between the white community and the Muslim community, tensions that were further flamed when, on January 26, 2017, Mayor Van Duyne formally urged lawmakers at the Texas Homeland Security Forum in Austin to investigate the legality of Islamic tribunals in North Texas. In May 2017, Mayor Van Duyne joined the current presidential administration-the same administration headed by a man who in March 2016 said, \"I think Islam hates us.

Regarding the need for such legislation, Mayor Van Duyne wrote, in pertinent part, \"Sharia Law Court was NOT approved or enacted by the City of Irving .... Our nation cannot be so overly sensitive in defending other cultures that we stop protecting our own.\" Despite similar institutions having existed for decades in the American Jewish and Christian faith communities, the law backed by the Mayor and City Council was created in response to a local Islamic tribunal that mediated in civil cases on a voluntary basis for members of the Muslim community. Mayor Van Duyne and the City Council's actions in this regard created immense tension between the white community and the Muslim community, tensions that were further flamed when, on January 26, 2017, Mayor Van Duyne formally urged lawmakers at the Texas Homeland Security Forum in Austin to investigate the legality of Islamic tribunals in North Texas. In May 2017, Mayor Van Duyne joined the current presidential administration-the same administration headed by a man who in March 2016 said, \"I think Islam hates us. There's something there that-there's a tremendous hatred there.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. With respect to these new allegations, Mr. Mohamed has failed to plead facts sufficient to establish, or from which the court can reasonably infer, that any policy of the City supporting a state law prohibiting application of foreign laws in United States courts was the moving force behind A.M.'s arrest or of any arrest allegedly made without probable cause by the City's police officers; or that any alleged statements by Mayor Van Duyne or President Trump establish a policy of the City that is connected in any way to A.M.'s arrest for bringing a hoax bomb to school. Further, what President Trump, former-Mayor Van Duyne, or any government official\n   of the President's administration says, is quite beside the point and does not factor into the court's analysis insofar as its resolution of the issues in this case. Moreover, nothing in the pleadings even remotely intimates that the City Council of Irving has abdicated its policymaking authority or oversight function for the City and delegated such authority or oversight to President Trump or any official in his administration. Such alleged statements regarding President Trump or ex-Mayor Van Duyne simply have no nexus to the issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As to Mr. Mohamed's claim that the City's police department failed to train its officers with respect to determining probable cause for arrest, the Second Amended Complaint contains no new allegations, and continues to rely on conclusory allegations that are insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, for the reasons already set forth in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   , the court concludes that the failure to train allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274018\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/602/#p629\">\n    252 F.Supp.3d at 618-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, although the Second Amended Complaint, like the original Complaint, alleges a claim against the City for failure to supervise its officers, Mr. Mohamed once again fails to address the City's motion to dismiss this claim in his response brief. As such, the court concludes, as it did in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   , that he has conceded that he has failed to state a claim for failure to supervise against the City or, alternatively, by not addressing this claim, he has abandoned it.

Specifically, even considering the amended pleadings, Mr. Mohamed has failed to adequately allege a policy or custom of the City that was the moving force behind the alleged Fourth Amendment constitutional violations, or adequately pleaded a failure to train claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Threadbare recitals of elements of causes of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\").

Assuming the facts as true in the\n   <em>\n    Bhombal\n   </em>\n   case, references to peer harassment are irrelevant to Mr. Mohamed's section 1983 claims against the IISD, as peers are not state actors.

In addition, Officers Taylor and Howman contend that dismissal is required because Mr. Mohamed alleges that it was Sgt. Miller and Sgt.

According to Mr. Mohamed, the true function of the alarm clock could be discerned within seconds of inspection, and \"[i]t is clear that no one-not the teachers, the school administrators not the police officers, including Mitchell and Miller, believed the alarm clock to be an explosive device as they showed no alarm and did not handle it as an explosive device.\" Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.

The court agrees. The Second Amended Complaint alleges: \"Officers Mitchell and Miller made the decision to arrest A.M. for bringing a hoax bomb to school.\" Sec. Am. Comp. \u00b6 100. By Mr. Mohamed's own admission, the decision to arrest A.M. was made by the sergeants, not the school resource officers. In light of this allegation, the court concludes that Mr. Mohamed has failed to allege that Officers Taylor and Howman violated A.M.'s Fourth Amendment right to be free from arrest without probable cause.

First, they argue that Mr. Mohamed has failed to state an underlying constitutional violation.

Was the Law Clearly Established?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In the present case, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that Sergeants Miller and Mitchell made the decision to arrest A.M. for violating the \"hoax bomb\" statute contained in section 46.08 of the Texas Penal Code. Sergeants Miller and Mitchell have moved to dismiss Mr. Mohamed's claim that they violated A.M.'s rights by arresting him without probable cause for violating the \"hoax bomb\" statute. In support, they assert their entitlement to qualified immunity. Whether Sergeants Miller and Mitchell committed an underlying constitutional violation is not the focus of the court's inquiry at this juncture. To meet his burden of demonstrating the inapplicablity of Sergeants Miller's and Mitchell's assertion of their qualified immunity defense, Mr. Mohamed must establish\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that: (1) they violated a statutory or constitutional right,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) that the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of the conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As recently stated by the Fifth Circuit in summarizing the governing law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   For a right to be clearly established, the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. Thus, the right must already be clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct. When considering whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, the court must ask whether the law so clearly and unambiguously prohibited his conduct that every reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates the law. To answer that question in the affirmative, we must be able to point to controlling authority-or a robust consensus of persuasive authority-that defines the contours of the right in question with a high degree of particularity. Where no controlling authority specifically\n   prohibits a defendant's conduct, and when the federal circuit courts are split on the issue, the law cannot be said to be clearly established. This is true even when the circuit split developed after the events in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Sergeants Miller and Mitchell argue that Mr. Mohamed's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   is \"unavailing.\" Defs.' Reply 7 (Doc. 48). The court agrees. In\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit rejected an arresting officer's assertion of qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage, concluding that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the officer violated clearly established law when: (1) he stopped Mr. Alexander without arguable reasonable suspicion; (2) he arrested him without arguable probable cause; and (3) he used force against him which was objectively unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276896\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/298/\">\n    854 F.3d at 305-309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit held that the de minimis injury requirement, while still the law, would not be sufficient to defeat the plaintiff's claim of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276896\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276896\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/298/\">\n    at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Alexander's alleged injuries-though perhaps not sufficient on their own to satisfy the de minimis requirement-are enough to support a claim for excessive force at the motion to dismiss stage.\"). In\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   , there was no arguable probable cause to arrest so that any use of force to effect the arrest was deemed unreasonable even if the use of force did not produce injuries beyond the de minimis threshold. Here, the court concludes, based on the face of the pleadings, that arguable probable cause existed for the arrest, thereby justifying the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest. Specifically, Mr. Mohamed alleges that A.M. brought to school a device in a small box containing a circuit board, wires, and a timing display, repeatedly disobeyed a teacher who had told him to keep the device in his backpack, displayed and activated the device during class after being told to keep it in his backpack, and was less than forthcoming when he was questioned about the device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 63. A.M. also did not answer Principal Cummings's questions about why he brought the device to school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Joint App. 2 (Doc. 40-4). Considering these factual allegations, and viewing them in the light most favorable to Mr. Mohamed, and given that these events transpired in a school setting, the court determines that the Officer Defendants had a basis to believe to a fair probability that a hoax bomb violation had occurred, providing them with at least arguable probable cause to arrest A.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Further, Mr. Mohamed reads\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   too narrowly, and if the Fifth Circuit's holding means what he contends, the holding contravenes earlier Fifth Circuit precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   , the court stated the following regarding an arrest-without-probable-cause claim and one for excessive force: \"That the deputies' arrest of Freeman was unlawful on the facts alleged does not, however, mean that any force used by the deputies to effectuate the arrest was necessarily excessive.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5743674\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/404/#p416\">\n    483 F.3d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is so because the excessive force claim must be analyzed \"without regard to whether the arrest itself was justified[,]\" as the \"excessive force claim is separate and distinct from [Freeman's] unlawful arrest claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5743674\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/404/#p416\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In sum, Mr. Mohamed has failed to allege more than a de minimis injury stemming from Sgt. Mitchell's and Sgt. Miller's alleged conduct during his arrest. The alleged injuries of A.M. are certainly no greater than those alleged in\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   , and the Fifth Circuit did not consider them substantial enough to constitute excessive force. In light of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   , this court cannot hold that Mr. Mohamed has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted with respect to his excessive force claim.

By not requesting to replead, he is effectively saying, \"I have pleaded or stated my best case against the Officer Defendants.\" While the court recognizes that the Officer Defendants were not included until the Second Amended Complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Mohamed was duly put on notice in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   of the heightened pleading requirement necessary to defeat or overcome a government official's entitlement to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Mohamed I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274018\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/602/#p629\">\n    252 F.Supp.3d at 620-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If the court allows Mr. Mohamed an opportunity to amend his pleadings as to the City, the IISD, and Principal Cummings, it will be his fourth \"bite at the apple.\" As to these Defendants, Mr. Mohamed has had three opportunities to state a claim against them and has failed to do so. The court does not believe a fourth attempt is warranted under these circumstances. As Mr. Mohamed has failed to cure the pleading deficiencies to state a claim against the City, the IISD, and Principal Cummings, and has effectively acknowledged that he has stated his best case against the Officer Defendants, the court concludes that further amendment is not warranted, as it is futile and will unduly and unnecessarily delay the resolution of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
