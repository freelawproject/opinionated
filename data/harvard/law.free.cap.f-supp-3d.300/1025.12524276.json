Pl.'s Second Mot. Dismiss &amp; Strike Insufficient Defense, ECF No. 45. Summers seeks to dismiss four counterclaims and an affirmative defense filed by Defendants (and Counterclaim Plaintiffs) Tri-County AG, LLC and Tri-County Iron, LLC (collectively Tri-County). The matter came before the Court for hearing on October 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Mins. Pl.'s Mot. Dismiss &amp; Strike, ECF No. 55.

For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Summers's Motion to Dismiss Tri-County's Counterclaims I, II, III, and IV for failure to state a claim and denies Summers's Motion to Strike Tri-County's second affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from Tri-County's alleged infringement of two patents Summers currently holds on a farm equipment attachment, United States Patent No. 9, 326, 439 (the '439 patent) and United States Patent No. 9, 462, 737 (the '737 patent) (the patents). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59, 73, ECF No. 1. Summers is a manufacturing company that produces and sells farm equipment, including harrows and other tillage implements and attachments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. In 2013, Summers began manufacturing a mounted rolling basket attachment for tillage farm equipment (the Summers Basket).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25-26. Summers asserts unlike other rolling baskets on the market, the \"Summers Basket[ is] equipped with internally mounted mud scrapers to keep the basket[ ] clean for continuous\" use, particularly in wet conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. The Summers Basket is compatible with a large variety of tillage equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Summers Baskets are the subject of, and covered by, the '439 and '737 patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. The '439 patent is dated May 3, 2016, and the '737 patent is dated October 11, 2016. Pl.'s Ex. A &amp; Ex. B, ECF No. 1. Both are entitled \"Agricultural Implement with a Scraper Internal to a Rolling Basket.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Summers alleges after it introduced the Summers Basket, Tri-County began selling the Tri-County Scraper Kit, which is specifically designed for retrofitting John Deere Baskets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 28-34. When combined, the Tri-County Scraper Kit and the John Deere Baskets create the Tri-County Retrofit Basket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Summers alleges the Tri-County Scraper Kit has no other purpose than to be assembled into the Tri-County Retrofit Basket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Summers also asserts Tri-County has provided instructions and drawings directing purchasers on how to assemble the Tri-County Retrofit Basket and have advertised the allegedly infringing use of the Tri-County Retrofit Basket to the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Finally, Summers claims the Tri-County Retrofit Basket \"meets each limitation of at least claim 1\" of both the '439 and '737 patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 44. In Summers's Complaint, Summers provides detailed illustrations and analysis of the alleged similarities\n   between the Summers Basket and the Tri-County Retrofit Basket, including the particular limitations in claim 1 of the patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-43, 45-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 7, 2016, counsel for Summers wrote a letter to Tri-County to place it on notice that the Tri-County Scraper Kit and the Tri-County Retrofit Basket allegedly infringed at least claim 1 of the '439 and '737 patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51; Pl.'s Ex. D Supp. Compl., ECF No. 1-4. On November 11, 2016, Tri-County responded with its own letter, asserting it had not infringed upon the patents and listing differences between its product and the Summers Basket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52; Pl.'s Ex. E Supp. Compl., ECF No. 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Summers filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, asserting Tri-County is infringing on the '439 patent and the '737 patent. ECF No. 1. Pursuant to a joint stipulation and request to transfer, the District of North Dakota transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, Central Division. Order, ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its original answer, Tri-County asserted five affirmative defenses, including one claiming the '439 and '737 patents were invalid. Defs.' Answer 7-8, ECF No. 38. Tri-County also alleged two counterclaims: 1) a counterclaim for declaration of non-infringement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, and 2) a counterclaim for declaration of invalidity,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. In response, Summers filed its first Motion to Dismiss both counterclaims under Rule 12(b)(6), and to strike as insufficient Tri-County's invalidity affirmative defense under Rule 12(f). ECF No. 39. Summers also asserted Tri-County's counterclaims should be dismissed as violating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(b), as the counterclaims were not separately pled based on the two patents but instead combined into claims of non-infringement and invalidity naming both patents. Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss &amp; Strike Insufficient Defense 9, ECF No. 39-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rather than file a resistance to Summers's motion, Tri-County filed an Amended Answer. ECF No. 41. The answer again included an affirmative defense of invalidity, as well as two counterclaims for a declaration of non-infringement and two counterclaims for a declaration of invalidity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 10-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As in its original answer, Tri-County rests its second affirmative defense and invalidity counterclaims-Counterclaims III and IV-in part on prior art, including European Patent 1639876 (the European Patent).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 12. After withdrawing its first Motion to Dismiss, Summers filed the present Second Motion to Dismiss Tri-County's counterclaims under Rule 12(b)(6) and strike as insufficient the affirmative defense of invalidity under Rule 12(f). ECF No. 45; ECF No. 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response, Tri-County conceded it was not resisting Summers's Motion to Dismiss Tri-County's invalidity counterclaims as they related to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 52. The Court first considers Summers's Motion to Dismiss Tri-County's counterclaims. The Court then turns to Summers's Motion to Strike Tri-County's second affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Summers moves to dismiss Tri-County's non-infringement counterclaims (Counterclaims I and II) as well as its invalidity counterclaims (Counterclaims III and IV) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. ECF No. 45. Tri-County responds, based on Summers's initial, detailed Complaint and Tri-County's denial of each factual allegation and claim, Summers is on notice of the bases for Tri-County's counterclaims for declaration of non-infringement. ECF No. 51 at 3-5. Tri-County also argues its invalidity counterclaims are sufficiently pled because they explain the statutory bases for Tri-County's request and identify a specific, invalidating prior art.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before ruling on Summers's Motion to Dismiss Tri-County's non-infringement counterclaims, the Court must determine whether it will rely upon Summers's Complaint or Exhibit E, a letter Tri-County sent to Summers that Summers attached to its Complaint. The Court concludes it will not rely upon either. A counterclaim must stand on its own and may not be supplemented by the facts alleged in an opposing Complaint. Additionally, the letter is not incorporated into the Amended Answer. The Court first addresses in greater detail its decision not to rely upon these materials. The Court then considers the merits of Summers's Motion to Dismiss and grants dismissal of both of Tri-County's non-infringement counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Court Will Not Rely Upon Summers's Complaint or Exhibit E When Ruling on Summers's 12(b)(6) Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As part of its Resistance to Summers's Second Motion to Dismiss, Tri-County asserts the Court should rely upon the factual information included in Summers's Complaint, and Tri-County's denial of such information, as the factual basis for Tri-County's non-infringement pleading. For the reasons stated below, the Court will not consider the factual allegations contained in Summers's Complaint or Exhibit E, attached to Summers's Complaint, in its Rule 12(b)(6) analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Counts I and II of its Complaint, Summers alleges Tri-County's manufacturing of the Tri-County Scraper Kit, as well as Tri-County's demonstration and sale of the Tri-County Retrofit Basket, infringes on both the '439 patent and '737 patent. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 59-60, 73-74. In the factual background of the Complaint, which is incorporated into Counts I and II, Summers asserts the Tri-County Retrofit Basket meets each limitation of claim 1 of both patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 44, 58, 72. Furthermore, Summers sets forth in detail the various components of the Tri-County Retrofit Basket it believes infringes on claim 1 of each patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-43, 45-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its Amended Answer, Tri-County denies the majority of the facts asserted in the factual background of Summers's Complaint. ECF No. 41 at 3-4 (stating \"Denied\" or explaining it lacks information or\n   knowledge to respond to the allegations).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tri-County also denies without further explanation all of the enumerated claims comprising Count I and Count II of Summers's Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7 (stating \"Denied\"). In its non-infringement counterclaims, Tri-County asserts, \"[t]he [Tri-County Retrofit Basket] does not contain one or more limitations of each independent claim of the '439 [and '737 ] Patent[s], including claim 1, which is the only claim alleged in the Complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Tri-County also claims, \"[t]he [Tri-County Retrofit Basket] does not contain any part or component that has a particular use as part of some other machine or composition that infringes the '429 [and '737 ] Patent[s], including those uses alleged in the Complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Finally,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Tri-County requests the declaration of the Court that Tri-County does not make, use, sell, offer to sell or otherwise infringe, and has not made, used, sold, offered to sell or otherwise infringed, directly or indirectly, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, any claim of the '439 [and '737 ] Patent[s], including claim 1 which is the only claim alleged in the Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Second Motion to Dismiss, Summers asserts Tri-County has failed to sufficiently plead a counterclaim for declaration of non-infringement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45-1 at 3. Summers argues Tri-County has not identified a single limitation listed in claim 1 of either patent it has not infringed upon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, Summers asserts Tri-County has not explained how or why a specific limitation is not met, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Finally, Summers claims Tri-County does not describe the Tri-County Retrofit Basket or how it functions in relation to the Summers Basket, and therefore Summers cannot sufficiently respond to Tri-County's claim it did not infringe on Summers's product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response, Tri-County argues it has provided sufficient factual details to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss and that Summers is attempting to enforce a stricter pleading standard than is required under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51 at 5-6. Additionally, Tri-County asserts its pleadings must be read as a whole.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. When the pleading is read comprehensively, Tri-County argues both its firm denial of the allegations in Count I and Count II of Summers's Complaint, as well as its denial of the detailed factual assertions described in Summers's Complaint, put Summers on notice of what limitations in claim 1 Tri-County asserts are missing from the Tri-County Retrofit Basket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, Tri-County argues, it is not required to re-list, in detail, the limitations in claim 1 it believes the Tri-County Retrofit Basket has not met.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court determines Tri-County's pleadings may not be supplemented with the factual allegations contained in Summers's Complaint when Tri-County's pleadings merely deny those factual allegations. There is a material difference between denying factual allegations and asserting them, a fact other district courts have noted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gradient Enters., Inc. v.

Denying Summers's allegations merely places the facts in dispute; it does not provide Summers or the Court with any facts illustrating how such denials support Tri-County's non-infringement counterclaim. Summers is entitled to fair notice of the facts Tri-County disputes, as well as the facts Tri-County specifically intends to rely upon for its non-infringement counterclaim. Put simply, a counterclaim must stand on its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the Court agrees it must read the pleading as a whole, rather than \"parsed piece by piece to determine whether each allegation, in isolation, is plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Braden v.

However, Tri-County has not pointed to any authority showing either 1) a party may rely upon an opposing party's allegations to bolster its own pleadings, or 2) there is a different pleading standard for non-infringement claims brought independently, as opposed to in reaction to a direct infringement claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the Court will not rely upon Summers's detailed factual allegations when considering Summers's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Similarly, the Court will not incorporate into Tri-County's Amended Answer the November 11, 2016 letter Tri-County sent to Summers that Summers attached as Exhibit E to its Complaint. Pl.'s Ex. E, ECF No. 1-5. In the letter, which Tri-County sent in response to Summers's November 7, 2016 letter asserting infringement, Tri-County made several arguments. First, Tri-County responded to Summers stating, \"[u]nlike your Mounted Rolling Basket equipped with mounted mud scraper ..., our product is retrofitted exclusively for the purpose of aftermarket. We do not make or sell rolling baskets but rather retrofit our product to a rolling basket that is the property of a third party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Tri-County further alleged its \"product is not designed to be mounted on a rolling basket of any particular party or any particular type. Such baskets may be equipped with a plurality of blades, round bars or square bars.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Tri-County asserted \"[b]ecause the purpose of our product is to be retrofitted, our design is structurally different from your patented design. What your letter contends is a 'sleeve' is in-fact not a 'sleeve' but rather a compression fitting. Your patents show and claim a stationary blade or elongated scrapping edge connected to the sleeves (see Exhibit A, Figure 1 and Figure 2). Our design does not have such a structure. Our design uses a plurality of different paddles ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As part of its Amended\n   Answer, Tri-County admits it sent the November 11, 2016 letter and contends the \"contents of [the] letter speak for themselves.\" ECF No. 41 at 5. At the hearing, Tri-County argued the letter should be incorporated as referenced in its Amended Answer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court finds the letter is not the type of document usually incorporated and analyzed by a court considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

Finally, this letter substantiates, rather than merely reiterates, Tri-County's non-infringement claims and is thus a document traditionally considered outside the pleadings. The letter includes independent bases for non-infringement and additional facts apart from the statements made in Tri-County's Amended Answer. For instance, while the letter argues Tri-County's product is only sold for \"aftermarket\" and does not include a stationary blade, Tri-County's counterclaims do not contain any mention of the particular differences between its product and the Summers Basket.

For the same reason Tri-County may not look to Summers's Complaint to supplement its counterclaims, Tri-County may not rely upon factual statements contained in a separate document but wholly absent from its pleadings to survive a 12(b)(6) motion. Consequently, Exhibit E is not incorporated into Tri-County's Amended Answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Tri-County does not point to any specific facts illustrating how its product does not meet one or more of the limitations described in claim 1 of either patent and thus does not infringe on Summers's patents. Instead, Tri-County merely provides legal conclusions. For example, Tri-County asserts its product \"does not contain one or more limitations\" and \"does not contain any part or component that has a particular use as part of some other machine or composition that infringes\" Summers's patents. ECF No. 41 at 10-11. Tri-County also asserts its product does not infringe, either \"directly or indirectly, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

Furthermore, the only authority Summers cites for this proposition,\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Cleasby Manufacturing.

Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   did note there were at least five ways for a patent to be invalidated, it did not dismiss the counterclaim based on the defendant's failure to separately format and allege each section of Title 35.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-7.

In cases where courts have held claims under \u00a7 112 sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, the claims specified which aspect of \u00a7 112 the patent failed to meet. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    CryoLife, Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff specifically pointed to the patent's alleged \"lack of [a] written description.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201069397\">\n    2015 WL 1069397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 4 (D.Del. March 10, 2015). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Tannerite Sports\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's counterclaim withstood dismissal where it alleged the plaintiff's patent application contained an \"insufficient description of the method of transporting plaintiffs' \" rifle targets.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201737740\">\n    2016 WL 1737740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. Based on Tri-County's counterclaims under \u00a7 112, however, Summers would be required to respond to all three possible allegations contained in \u00a7 112 without any indication from Tri-County as to what facts may support or undermine those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additionally, in its Resistance, Tri-County did not expand upon or explain the bases of its claims under \u00a7 112.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51. In fact, Tri-County failed to resist Summers's Motion to Dismiss as to \u00a7 112 in any way. At the hearing, Tri-County conceded it had not responded to or resisted Summers's motion as to \u00a7 112. Consequently, Tri-County's broad and unsupported \u00a7 112 counterclaims are insufficient to give Summers fair notice, and thereby fail to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court will now turn to Tri-County's invalidity counterclaims under \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103. A patent is invalid under \u00a7 102 due to anticipation, meaning \"each and every element as set forth in the claim is found, either expressly or inherently described, in a single prior art reference.\"\n   <em>\n    Verdegaal Bros. v.

In contrast, a patent is invalid under \u00a7 103 for obviousness, which is established \"if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Tri-County specifically points to the European Patent as invalidating prior art and contends, \"in view of at least [the] European Patent [ ], as well as the references cited\" in the patents themselves, both the '439 and '737 patents are invalid. ECF No. 41 at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tri-County contends this\n   language is sufficient to place Summers on notice of both the basis for its invalidity counterclaims ( \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103 ) and facts supporting such assertions (the existence of the European Patent and combinations of prior art listed in Summers's patents).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Tri-County has failed to assert sufficient facts demonstrating any elements of the European Patent can be found in any other element of Summers's patents, as required under \u00a7 102. Although Tri-County identifies the European Patent as invalidating prior art, Tri-County does not analyze or even describe the European Patent. Consequently, Summers has not been put on notice of a single limitation Tri-County contends the European Patent and Summers's patents share. Merely stating the patents are invalid \"in view of at least [the] European Patent\" is conclusory and devoid of any facts upon which the Court may infer the European Patent does, in fact, invalidate Summers's patents under \u00a7 102. ECF No. 41 at 12. Similarly, Tri-County has not stated any facts suggesting how the European Patent, either alone or in combination with other references, makes Summers's patents obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art, as required under \u00a7 103. Without more, Summers cannot respond to the allegations that any of the referenced prior art renders its patents obvious. Because Tri-County's counterclaims are devoid of any specific fact comparing or analyzing either the European Patent or the prior art references they assert invalidate Summers's patents under \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103, Tri-County has failed to sufficiently state a claim under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court recognizes other district courts considering this issue have found similarly broad invalidity claims to be sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CryoLife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201069397\">\n    2015 WL 1069397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (upholding an invalidity claim when the plaintiff \"identifie[d] the specific statutory sections regarding invalidity ( \u00a7\u00a7 102, 103, and/or 112 ) and provide[d] examples of invalidating prior art\");\n   <em>\n    Beer Barrel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205936874\">\n    2016 WL 5936874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (upholding an invalidity\n   counterclaim when defendant listed prior art which invalidated the patents, since \"[a] patent is invalid if its claims were previously covered by prior art\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, at least one district court has looked for more detail in invalidity claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PetEdge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202983086\">\n    2017 WL 2983086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (upholding an invalidity counterclaim when the defendant alleged the plaintiff's patent was invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 103, named an allegedly invalidating prior art, and also \"further provide[d] a specification from the [invalidating patent] that appears substantially similar to a specification from the [plaintiff's] patent\").

Specifically, Summers argues 1) the pleading standard established in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   applies to both affirmative defenses as well as counterclaims; 2) the cases Tri-County cites holding otherwise are not patent cases and are therefore inapplicable; and 3) under the plausibility pleading standard, Tri-County's affirmative defense is insufficient because Tri-County relies on the same broad references to Title 35 and the European Patent as the invalidity counterclaims. ECF No. 45-1 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Although Tri-County concedes district courts are currently split on the applicable pleading standard for affirmative defenses, Tri-County argues the district courts in the Eighth Circuit have not applied the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   standard to affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51 at 7.

First, patent cases consistently cite to non-patent cases when determining or describing the applicable pleading standard for affirmative defenses, thereby diminishing any argument that patent cases should be held to a different standard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PetEdge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202983086\">\n    2017 WL 2983086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Info.

Second, there is nothing unique about patent cases that would make non-patent decisions inapplicable on this issue.

For the reasons stated below, the Court agrees with the analysis of fellow district courts in the Eighth Circuit and finds the plausibility standard inapplicable to affirmative defenses.

First, although the permissive language of Rule 12(f) provides courts with broad discretion regarding affirmative defenses, the Eighth Circuit views striking an affirmative defense as \"an extreme measure.\"\n   <em>\n    Stanbury Law Firms v Internal Revenue Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11246307\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1059/#p1063\">\n    221 F.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1063 (8th Cir. 2000).

Rule 8(a) requires a claimant provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim\n   <em>\n    showing\n   </em>\n   that the pleader is entitled to relief\"; Rule 8(c) simply states \"a party must affirmatively\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   any avoidance or affirmative defense.\" Fed.

In order to meet the more demanding pleading standard under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , a responding party would initially plead fewer affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2011514682\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, following discovery, the responding party would then be required to amend its answer to re-assert newly revealed affirmative defenses, thereby extending pretrial litigation and delaying possible settlement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2011514682\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, the reasoning underlying the plausibility standard is inapplicable to affirmative defenses. The purpose of the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   pleading standard is to provide the responding party with enough factual information so it may adequately deny or admit particular allegations.\n   <em>\n    Topchian\n   </em>\n   , 760 F.3d at 848. However, unlike claims or counterclaims, parties are not required to respond to affirmative defenses. Rather, affirmative defenses are pled in an effort to put the opposing party on notice of possible defenses likely to be developed during discovery, at which point the opposing party will have had enough time and information to analyze and, potentially, rebut them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

ECF No. 51 at 2 n.2, 5 (citing Defs.' Ex. 1, ECF No. 51-1). The letter details various alleged similarities between the European Patent and Summers's product. ECF No. 51-1. During the hearing, Tri-County argued the Court should consider Exhibit 1 in its 12(b)(6) analysis. The Court declines Tri-County's request. Exhibit 1 was not attached to Tri-County's Amended Answer, but rather a Resistance to Summers's Motion to Dismiss. Although the letter was sent before Tri-County filed its Amended Answer, the Amended Answer makes no reference to the letter or its contents but rather merely states the European Patent renders Summers's patents invalid.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 41. Additionally, Tri-County asserts in its Resistance the letter indicates Summers is aware of the specific facts supporting Tri-County's invalidity counterclaim. However, Tri-County's Amended Answer does not allege this. Tri-County does not assert Summers received the letter or was made aware of Tri-County's specific contentions; only the Resistance raises this issue and argument. Furthermore, the letter provides specific facts not alleged in Tri-County's Amended Answer, such as Tri-County's assertion the European Patent \"features multiple rolling baskets, each having a stationary internal scraper plate that extends between the opposite sides of the basket.\" ECF No. 51-1 at 2. Although Tri-County claims the European Patent invalidates Summers's patents, the Amended Answer does not reference any specific aspects of the European Patent also present in the Summers Basket.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McAuley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699622\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/784/#p787\">\n     500 F.3d at 787\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding a motion to dismiss was converted to a motion for summary judgment when the district court made findings not discussed in the plaintiff's complaint). Finally, similar to Exhibit E, unlike a contract or previous agreement between the parties, Summers did not sign Exhibit 1 and the letter merely states Tri-County's position at the time the letter was sent, which Summers disagrees with. Consequently, the Court will not consider Exhibit 1 in its determination of Summers's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims III and IV.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The other cases Tri-County cites to in its Resistance are inapplicable as they all originate from districts with local patents rules requiring parties provide each other with detailed invalidity contentions.
