Having considered the parties' briefs and counsels' arguments during the motions hearing held on March 1, 2018, the Court will grant STRS Ohio's motion, appoint STRS Ohio as lead plaintiff, approve Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine as lead counsel, and deny Amalgamated Bank's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4 (2016), a court must \"appoint as lead plaintiff the member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members ....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i).

Mar. 13, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, STRS Ohio also appears to meet the adequacy requirement of Rule 23. In assessing this requirement, courts generally consider whether a movant has the ability and incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously, whether the movant has obtained adequate counsel, and whether there is a conflict of interest between the movant's claims and those asserted on behalf of the class.\n   <em>\n    In re Cendant Corp. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483272\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/201/#p262\">\n    264 F.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on its financial interest in excess of $45 million, STRS Ohio has ample incentive to represent the putative class vigorously. Moreover, both STRS Ohio and its proposed lead counsel, Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine, have extensive experience in securities litigation. STRS Ohio has served as a lead or co-lead plaintiff in numerous class-action securities lawsuits, including a prior case litigated in this district, while Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine has served as lead counsel and has secured multimillion- to billion-dollar recoveries in numerous such suits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   STRS Ohio's Opp'n. Br. 1-2, Dkt. 27; STRS Ohio's Reply Br. 10-12, Dkt. 28 (citing lawsuits); STRS Ohio's Br., Rosen Decl. Ex. D at 5-7, Dkt. 16-5. As a preliminary matter, it also appears that STRS Ohio's interests are aligned with the putative class, and STRS Ohio can adequately represent the class's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The conclusion that STRS Ohio is presumptively the most adequate plaintiff does not end the inquiry because the presumption can be rebutted if a putative plaintiff can prove that STRS Ohio \"will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\" or \"is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II). In addition, a putative plaintiff can obtain discovery to rebut the presumption but \"only if the plaintiff first demonstrates a reasonable basis for a finding that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff is incapable of adequately representing the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iv). Amalgamated Bank has neither rebutted the presumption nor demonstrated a reasonable basis to make the finding necessary to warrant discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, Amalgamated Bank contends that STRS Ohio is incapable of adequately representing\n   the class principally because it is subject to a unique defense, namely, a pay-to-play challenge. In particular, Amalgamated Bank alleges that Ohio Attorney General Michael DeWine's office, and not STRS Ohio, selected Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine to serve as STRS Ohio's lead counsel, and Murray Murphy Moul &amp; Basil LLP to serve as special counsel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   because of campaign contributions that these firms, their members, a lobbyist, and family members made to various campaigns involving Attorney General DeWine and his son. Amalgamated Bank's Reply Br. 2-3, 5-13, 17-18, Dkt. 29. For this reason, Amalgamated Bank argues that STRS Ohio is subject to unique defenses that render it incapable of adequately representing the class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23. Amalgamated Bank predicts that, in the future stages of this litigation, the defendants will raise the pay-to-play issue and challenge STRS Ohio's appointment as lead plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Such challenges, Amalgamated Bank contends, will subject the class to unnecessary expense and thereby affect its ultimate recovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Amalgamated Bank further argues that the close associations between selected counsel and the Ohio Attorney General's Office call into question whether STRS Ohio and its counsel are capable of adequately representing the interests of the class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To support its claims, Amalgamated Bank has offered various evidence, including (1) Ohio Secretary of State records reflecting contributions that the law firms, Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine and Murray Murphy Moul &amp; Basil LLP, their attorneys, and their attorneys' family members made to various political campaigns and committees, including Mike DeWine for Ohio, DeWine for Judge, DeWine for Justice, the Ohio Republican State Central and Executive Committee State Account, and the Ohio Republican State Central &amp; Executive Committee State Candidate Fund;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Ohio Secretary of State records reflecting contributions that Stephanie McCloud, a lobbyist hired by Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine in 2011 when Attorney General DeWine assumed office, made to Mike DeWine for Ohio, DeWine for Judge, DeWine for Justice, and the Ohio Republican State Central &amp; Executive Committee State Candidate Fund;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) newspaper articles from 2014 suggesting a link between law firm contributions and Attorney General DeWine's appointments of legal counsel for various state contracts; and (4) fundraising event invitations that reveal\n   that JB Hadden participated directly in the organization of fundraisers for the Mike DeWine for Ohio campaign. Amalgamated Bank's Reply Br., 2d Meeks Decl. Exs. A-Q, Dkt. 29-2 to 29-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court is unaware of any case concluding that either a putative lead plaintiff or a putative class representative failed to satisfy Rule 23's adequacy requirement based on a pay-to-play challenge. Nor is the Court aware of any case in which a pay-to-play challenger has been granted discovery on the basis of such a claim. This is not surprising. \"Courts have long been less enamored of securities litigation pay-to-play arguments than litigants and the press ....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Sec.

Cal. 2009). To the Court's knowledge, this is the first time in this jurisdiction that a putative plaintiff has advanced a pay-to-play challenge in an attempt to disqualify a presumptive lead plaintiff under the PSLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Amalgamated Bank cites a Third Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    In re Cendant Corporation Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483272\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/201/#p262\">\n    264 F.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2001), to support its pay-to-pay challenge. While the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Cendant\n   </em>\n   expressed concerns about pay-to-play allegations, it affirmed the district court's decision rejecting such a challenge where the challenger put forth no evidence that lawful campaign contributions had influenced the lead plaintiff's selection process in that case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483272\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/201/#p262\">\n    264 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   269-70 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cendant Corp.

As counsel explained, Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine and Murray Murphy Moul &amp; Basil LLP competed in a request-for-qualifications (\"RFQ\") process to be selected to serve on the securities litigation panel of the Ohio Attorney General's Office.

At this juncture, Amalgamated Bank's assertion that the defendants are likely to litigate the pay-to-play issue and use it to challenge STRS Ohio in future stages of this litigation is speculative. Nor can the Court conclude-based on either the pay-to-play allegations or the alleged associations between counsel and the Ohio Attorney General's Office-that there is a \"reasonable basis\" to find that STRS Ohio is \"incapable of adequately representing the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iv). Because Amalgamated Bank has failed to meet its burden to rebut the presumption that STRS Ohio is the most adequate plaintiff to represent the class, the Court appoints STRS Ohio as lead plaintiff and approves Barrack, Rodos &amp; Bacine as lead counsel in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1.
