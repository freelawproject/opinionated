Plaintiff David LeClair, who is disabled, was exiting the subway car in his wheelchair when the front wheel wedged in the gap between the car and the platform, throwing him to the ground. The complaint alleges that defendant Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (\"MBTA\") failed to take measures to help disabled persons use the subway in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   It further alleges that the MBTA was negligent in failing to provide plaintiff with safe and reasonable access to the subway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant has moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon\n   which relief can be granted. The principal question is whether plaintiff is bound, in whole or in part, by the 2006 settlement of a class action brought against the MBTA for failure to provide disabled persons equal access to the transit system. For the reasons stated below, the motion will be granted in part, and the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts are set forth as described in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   David LeClair is a disabled person who requires a wheelchair to move because of a double leg amputation in 2013. (Compl. \u00b6 11). On June 25, 2014, he was traveling to visit his mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). He boarded the Orange Line at the Back Bay station and took an inbound train to Downtown Crossing, where he transferred to a southbound Red Line train. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). When the train reached South Station, LeClair attempted to wheel himself onto the subway platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). However, the front wheel \"went into the gap\" between the car and the platform, causing him to be thrown forward onto the platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). The Red Line train conductor did not leave the subway car to offer assistance, although several passengers helped LeClair get back into his wheelchair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After getting back into the wheelchair, LeClair pushed an emergency button at the station platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). However, according to the complaint, no MBTA employee assisted or spoke with him until he located a MBTA inspector to report the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At Back Bay, Downtown Crossing, and South Station, LeClair was unable to locate MBTA employees who could provide assistance to disabled passengers and help them enter and exit subway cars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). Nor were there any signs or warnings posted about the risk gaps between subway cars and platforms posed to wheelchair-bound individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaint alleges that the injuries sustained from LeClair's fall required surgery that removed a remaining portion of both legs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). The surgery also prevented him from ever being able to use prosthetic devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The complaint asserts two claims against defendant: a claim for violation of the ADA (Count 1) and a state-law negligence claim (Count 2). Count 1 sets forth six alleged violations of the ADA. Defendant has moved to dismiss Count 1 on the grounds that the injunctive relief sought is barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion (also known as\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   ) and release and that money damages may not be awarded in the absence of intentional discrimination. Defendant has also moved to dismiss Count 2 on the basis of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, the court \"must assume the truth of all well-plead[ed] facts and give ... plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences therefrom.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v.

Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 10, Ex. 1 at 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs in that case had sued the MBTA on behalf of a class of disabled persons for failure to provide equal access to the public transportation system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the consent decree, the MBTA pledged to make several hundred million dollars in new capital investment that would be used, among other things, to train employees, install elevators and escalators, acquire new buses, close platform gaps between subway cars and platforms, and install announcement and electronic message boards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties in this litigation do not dispute that the settlement in\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   constituted a \"final judgment on the merits\" for the purpose of claim preclusion. Rather, the parties dispute whether there is sufficient \"identity of the claims\" and \"identity of the parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first question is whether plaintiff's claims here are sufficiently identical to those of the plaintiff class in\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold.\n   </em>\n   It is clear that the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   encompassed all types of ADA claims that disabled persons, particularly those with mobility impairments, could have against the MBTA. The\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   complaint alleged that the MBTA system was not \"readily accessible\" to persons with disabilities. (Docket No. 10, Ex. 2 \u00b6 17(a) ). That complaint further identified a variety of ADA violations, including ones that are at the heart of plaintiff's claims in the present suit, such as \"failure to respond to calls from riders with disabilities seeking assistance in accessing a train,\" \"failure to provide accessible telecommunications access, \"failure to employ a [subway car-to-platform] gap filler,\" and \"failure to adequately train and supervise employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17(b), (d) ). The claims are therefore sufficiently identical to those in\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   to satisfy the standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff contends that\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   never contemplated the specific injury he suffered here and thus the claims are not identical.

As relevant here, there was a certified class in\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   covering \"[a]ll individuals with ... disabilities, as defined by Title II of the [ADA] ... who use, will use, or would use the bus, light rail, and heavy rail rapid transit services....\" (Docket No. 10, Ex. 1 at 3).

Specifically, he states that he only became disabled in 2013 and therefore was not then a member of the class and never had an opportunity to \"opt-out\" of the\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   settlement. (Pl.'s Opp. at 8-10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That argument, however, is unpersuasive for multiple reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, and as an initial matter,\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold\n   </em>\n   was a Rule 23(b)(2) class\n   action for injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if plaintiff had been disabled as of 2006 and therefore a then-present member of the class (as opposed to a future member), he would not have been permitted to opt out. \"[Rule] 23(b)(2) does not require that class members be given notice and opt-out rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Those persons were found to be adequately represented by counsel at the time. And after a fairness hearing, Judge Lasker found that the settlement agreement was \"fair, reasonable, and adequate\" for the entire class. (Docket No. 10, Ex. 1 at 2). There is nothing to suggest that future class members were not bound by the settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The forms of equitable relief sought here overlap almost entirely with the equitable relief provided in\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Finegold.\n   </em>\n   If this Court were to issue a new injunction, the terms of its order would either be redundant or conflict with the terms of the existing consent decree. Indeed, it is difficult to see how granting the relief requested here would not effectively overrule, or supersede, the consent decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the circumstances, plaintiff's equitable claims for relief are barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion.
