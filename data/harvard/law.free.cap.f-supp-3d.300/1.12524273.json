One is defendant, Dennis M. Gingold's, Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 20], and the second is plaintiff, Lannan Foundation's (\"the Foundation\"), Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Complaint [ECF No. 29]. Gingold's Motion to Dismiss seeks dismissal of the Foundation's Complaint with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1) for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , failure to state a claim and lack of standing. The Foundation's Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Complaint seeks leave to file a supplemental complaint under Fed. R. Civ.

Upon full consideration of the parties' submissions, oral argument held on September 10, 2014, the record in this case, and the applicable law, the Court will deny in part and grant in part Gingold's Motion to Dismiss and grant the Foundation's Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    ALLEGATIONS AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 1996, the beneficiaries of Individual Indian Money (\"IIM\") trust accounts filed a class-action lawsuit against the Secretaries of the Interior and Treasury Departments and other federal government officials to obtain a judicial declaration confirming the scope of the government's trust obligations and an injunction compelling the performance of those obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cobell v.

The D.C. Bar Committee addressed its rationale for exception (5) in its comments to the Rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Subparagraph (a)(5) permits a lawyer to share legal fees with a nonprofit organization that employed, retained, or recommended employment of the lawyer in the matter. A lawyer may decide to contribute all or part of legal fees recovered from the opposing party to a nonprofit organization. Such a contribution may or may not involve fee-splitting, but when it does, the prospect that the organization will obtain all or part of the lawyer's fees does not inherently compromise the lawyer's professional independence, whether the lawyer is employed by the organization or was only retained or recommended by it. A lawyer who has agreed to share legal fees with such an organization remains obligated to exercise professional judgment solely in the client's best interests. Moreover, fee-splitting in these circumstances may promote the financial viability of such nonprofit organizations and facilitate their public interest mission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Rule 5.4, Cmnt. [11]. Because neither the Foundation nor the BRDF employed, retained, or recommend Gingold, Rule 5.4(a)(5) and Comment 11 are not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   However, the Rule and its comments reflect a clear stance by the Committee that the public policy and professional independence concerns of Rule 5.4(a) are not implicated when fees are shared with a non-profit, and more explicitly, a 501(c)(3) organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In Ethics Opinion 329, from which exception (5) sprouted, the D.C. Bar Committee evaluated and sanctioned a similar arrangement to those of the Grant Agreements here. D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Op. 329 (2005). There, a nonprofit organization paid an attorney an annual retainer of $10,000 in exchange for a promise from the attorney that the $10,000 would be repaid from the first $10,000 the attorney received in contingent fees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Committee made clear that when the fee arrangement with the non-profit is limited to the recouping of out-of-pocket costs, and not otherwise tied to the amount of fees collected by the attorney in the representation of a particular client, the sharing of fees is ethical.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On February 1, 2007, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals amended the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct to formally incorporate the principles of Opinion 329. In doing so, the court elected to go one step further and expand upon the exception described in Opinion 329-to allow an attorney to share an unlimited amount of fees with a non-profit, un-anchored to the nonprofit's out-of-pocket expenses. Such further broadening of the fee-sharing exception suggests to the Court that while the situation at bar has not been directly addressed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, that court would either find the Grant Agreements at issue here to be consistent with \"promot[ing] the financial viability of [ ] nonprofit organizations and facilitat[ing] their public interest mission making legal services more readily available to the public,\" or as discussed below, determine that the Grant Agreements are not fee-sharing agreements at all. Rule 5.4, Cmnt. [11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Here, if the plaintiff's allegations are credited, which they must be, the Grant Agreements establish that Gingold agreed to pay the BRDF one half of any attorney's fees and/or costs and/or expenses of the Litigation until the grant is repaid in full. Compl. \u00b6 65. While the Foundation did not employ, retain, or recommend Gingold, the Grant Agreements here likely did not interfere with Gingold's professional judgment in the\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   litigation. As attorneys' fees are generally collected from the class pool, the Grant Agreements are consistent with a class action plaintiffs' attorney's incentive to maximize the value of the class claim. The larger the pool, the better result for all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, the Court will not refuse to recognize the Grant Agreements because the Agreements are akin to a lender making a loan to a law firm under an arrangement to secure that loan with part of the lawyer's contingency fees. Such arrangements have been enforced in courts around the country and indeed are often not even considered fee-sharing agreements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Capital VII, LLC, I v.

As described above, the Acknowledgment Condition falls under the main heading of \"Grant Conditions\" and under the subheading of \"Reversion of Grant Funds.\" If the Acknowledgment Condition merely meant that Gingold \"recognizes the agreement as valid,\" the paragraph would serve little to no purpose as a \"Grant Condition.\"\n   <em>\n    N.W. v.

Indeed, the Acknowledgment Condition would not be a condition at all. The Court\n   is reluctant to read such provision as non-binding surplusage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   There are, however, other factors that point to the non-binding nature of the Acknowledgment Conditions. As Gingold points out, the Foundation knew how to draft language that would more clearly create legal obligations. It did so elsewhere in the Grant Agreements. For example, under the same \"Reversion of Grant Funds\" subsection, the Grant Agreements state \"The Grantee will return all unexpended funds upon termination of the Litigation unless other arrangements have been made with the Foundation.\" Compl. Ex. A. at 2 [ECF No. 1-2]. Moreover, the Acknowledgment Condition does not state that Gingold \"agrees,\" \"guarantees,\" \"promises to,\" or \"will\" repay any funds. The condition simply states that he \"acknowledges\" that the funds shall be repaid to the BRDF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Gingold also asserts that no contracts were formed because he is not a \"party\" to the Grant Agreements. The agreements explicitly state in their first paragraph that each \"Agreement ... is made between the Lannan Foundation ... and Blackfeet Reservation Development Fund, Inc.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Gingold argues that his omission from this list of parties necessarily excludes him from participation in the agreement. Gingold, however, undisputedly signed each agreement. His signature appears on each of the seven Agreements under the column \"GRANTEE\" and below the heading \"Plaintiffs' Counsel.\" In the District of Columbia, when there is a signed, written contract, the signature satisfies the objective test and \"indicates a mutuality of assent to which a party is bound unless he can show some special circumstance such as fraud, duress, or mutual mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    Watson v. Gold N Diamonds, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217783\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/736/266/#p269\">\n    736 F.Supp.2d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (D.D.C. 2010). Gingold has not brought any potential \"special circumstances\" to the Court's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Instead, Gingold avows that his signature does not render him personally liable, but is rather the signature of an agent of the\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   Class. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 320 (1958) (\"Unless otherwise agreed, a person making or purporting to make a contract with another as agent for a disclosed principal does not become a party to the contract.);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

It is not clear, however, whether Gingold \"b[ound] himself by definite words or stipulation\" or \"otherwise agreed\" to become a party to the contract. As discussed above, the Agreements contain a specific clause directed at Gingold and he signed each agreement despite the signature of his disclosed principal. The words \"Plaintiffs' Counsel\" do not weigh so heavily that the Court can say, without more evidence, that Gingold was not a party to the agreements. Indeed, \"Plaintiffs' Counsel\" may simply indicate that Gingold has signed on behalf of all counsel for the Class, present and future, and not as an agent for the Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Finally, Gingold asserts that the Foundation provided no consideration for his acknowledgment. He argues that \"[n]either [the Foundation] nor [the] BRDF promised anything to Gingold in exchange for his acknowledgment\" and \"there is no authority that holds that an acknowledgment by a non-party of terms and conditions to which the contracting parties have agreed binds that non-party to the parties' agreed upon terms.\" Mot. to Dismiss at 11-12 [ECF No. 20].

If it is bargained for and given in exchange for the promise, the promise is not gratuitous.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 71 (1981), cmnt. e. Thus, the inquiry is not necessarily whether Gingold was promised anything in exchange for his acknowledgment, but whether each party promised to \"do something [the] party otherwise is under no legal obligation to do, or to refrain from doing something [the] party has a legal right to do ....\"\n   <em>\n    Eastbanc, Inc. v.

If the Court finds that Gingold's \"acknowledgment\" was a promise to repay the funds, consideration exists. The Court, however, holds that it cannot make such a determination without reference to extrinsic evidence not available to it at this stage in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Pernice v.

Thus, the Court cannot say as a matter of law that the Foundation has failed to state a claim based on the face of the Complaint and the documents attached thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   At this stage, the Court accepts all facts as alleged as true and construes all inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. The Foundation's Complaint states a claim that Gingold breached a contractual obligation to repay money awarded in the\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   suit. The Complaint refers to the relevant portions of the Grant Agreements and states that Gingold breached his obligations when he failed to pay the outstanding balance to the BRDF. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79-85. The Complaint contains sufficient factual allegations to state a claim for a breach of contract and Gingold's motion to dismiss on this basis is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Conditions Precedent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Gingold next asserts that even if a valid contract was formed, the Foundation's breach of contract claims fail because conditions precedent have not been satisfied. Specifically, he argues that the language in the Acknowledgment Condition \"recovered from the United States\" creates a condition precedent that has not been satisfied-i.e. that the money paid to him and his co-counsel was not \"recovered from the United States.\" Second, he argues that the Grant Agreements dictate that they need only be repaid if the funds received in settlement were specifically earmarked as repayment for expenses paid with grant funds. The Court finds that the attorneys' fees paid to Gingold and his co-counsel were \"recovered from the United States\" and that the Grant Agreements do not limit their repayment requirement to only funds specifically reimbursed as expenses paid for by grant monies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The fee award paid to Gingold and his co-counsel was money \"recovered from the United States.\" Class counsel, presumably including Gingold himself, negotiated the Class Action Settlement Agreement with the United States Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of the Treasury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement\n   Agreement at 1,\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   [ECF. No. 3660-2]. Class counsel also negotiated the Agreement on Attorneys' Fees with an Associate Attorney General of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Notice Regarding Counsel Fees and Incentive Awards at 5\n   <em>\n    Cobell,\n   </em>\n   1:96-cv-1285 (D.D.C. Dec. 17, 2010) [ECF. No. 3664-1]. The Settlement Agreement and Agreement on Attorneys' Fees required an act of Congressional approval, the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, which was then signed into law by President Obama. Pub. L. No. 111-291, \u00a7 101(c)(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%203064\">\n    124 Stat. 3064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3066. The money was paid from an account funded by the United States Treasury. Settlement Agreement at 26-27,\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   [ECF. No. 3660-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   While the Court was required to act as a fiduciary in approving the fee award, and the money may have otherwise have gone to the class members, the fee award nonetheless derived from the United States Treasury. To say otherwise would be to contort the words \"recovered from\" beyond all recognition and fail to recognize that the United States was the defendant in the\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   case and paid to settle it. The Court finds that the attorneys' fees award constitutes money \"recovered from the United States\" and denies Gingold's motion in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Second, the Grant Agreements' repayment provisions do not limit the repayment requirement to\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   those scenarios where the funds are recovered in some sort of itemized form. Gingold relied on the phrase \"if certain payments that were originally paid with funds from the grant are recovered.\" He argues that this phrase expressly ties the repayment of each Grant Agreement to the recovery of expenses or fees related specifically to each particular Grant Agreement. Mot. to Dismiss at 15. The Court disagrees. The language quoted above has been plucked from the \"Amount\" clause in the Grant Agreements. After identifying the amount of the grant, the second sentence of the clause states in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   As set out below, this grant shall be repaid, in part as set out below, if certain payments that were originally paid with funds from the grant are recovered, through successful litigation or negotiation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Compl. Ex. A at 1 [ECF No. 1-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   While the sentence is not a model of precision, the Court notes that it explicitly defers to additional clauses in the Grant Agreements for further expansion upon the repayment terms. Those repayment clauses have been discussed above and provide that the parties to the Grant Agreement will repay the grants out of \"one-half of any attorney's fees and/or costs and/or expenses recovered from the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Volvo Powertrain Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4158747,4341805\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/330/\">\n    758 F.3d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (D.C.

Thus, the Grant Agreements require payment under three scenarios, recovered costs, recovered expenses, and attorneys' fees. Certainly, as was the case here, if attorneys' fees were recovered they would be based on the Class Representatives' assertions regarding their attorneys' hard work, not itemized expenses or costs. The Agreements, nonetheless, require repayment of the funds upon payment of attorneys' fees. The Court denies Gingold's motion in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Failure to State a Claim: Count IV-Tortious Interference With Contractual Relations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Next, Gingold contends that he did not tortiously interfere with the Grant\n   Agreements and that the Foundation has failed to state a claim for tortious interference. To state a claim for tortious interference with contract, a plaintiff must allege \"four elements in the District of Columbia: (1) existence of a contract; (2) knowledge of the contract; (3) intentional procurement of breach by the defendant; and (4) damages resulting from the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Dean v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861877\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/876/10/#p14\">\n    876 F.Supp.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14 (D.D.C. 2012),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (July 10, 2012) (citations and quotations omitted). Gingold does not dispute that the Foundation has alleged the four elements above. Rather, Gingold asserts that his conduct was privileged and/or legally justified. Such a privilege exists when a defendant acts to protect an existing economic interest and if \"he does not employ improper means.\"\n   <em>\n    Temps &amp; Co. v. Finova Mezzanine Capital, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 1:00-cv-1349,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20503249\">\n    2001 WL 503249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.D.C. May 9, 2001). To determine whether a defendant utilized \"improper means,\" the District of Columbia looks to the factors supplied by the Restatement (Second) of Torts.\n   <em>\n    Onyeoziri v. Spivok\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7313528\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/44/279/#p291\">\n    44 A.3d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291 (D.C. 2012). The Restatement lists seven factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   (a) the nature of the actor's conduct, (b) the actor's motive, (c) the interests of the other with which the actor's conduct interferes, (d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor, (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other, (f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor's conduct to the interference and (g) the relations between the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767 (1979). This standard is also met if the plaintiff shows malice, or spite. Said another way, \"motive or purpose to disrupt ongoing business relationships is required to establish liability, not merely intent to interfere or knowledge that conduct will harm plaintiff's business dealings.\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Allison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832899\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/908/186/#p202\">\n    908 F.Supp.2d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 202 (D.D.C. 2012),\n   <em>\n    aff'd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=554%20Fed.%20Appx.%2020\">\n    554 Fed.Appx. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

The Foundation does, however, allege that Gingold breached his fiduciary obligations to the\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94. The Foundation further alleges that Gingold knew that the BRDF and the\n   <em>\n    Cobell\n   </em>\n   Representatives' ability to repay the Grant Agreements through the attorneys' fees award would require cooperation of class counsel, and that even knowing this Gingold refused to repay the funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=554%20Fed.%20Appx.%2020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Construing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could apply the restatement factors above to find that Gingold utilized improper means to interfere with the BRDF's repayment of the Grant Agreements.

Failure to State a Claim: Count VI-Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Gingold next asks the Court to dismiss the Foundation's aiding and abetting claim. He argues that the District of Columbia does not recognize the tort of aiding and abetting. While, it is true that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has never expressly decided whether a cause of action exists for aiding and abetting the breach of a fiduciary duty, courts applying District of Columbia law have nonetheless found aiders and abettors liable\n   for the underlying tort when certain criteria are met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chen v.

Those actors are liable when: (1) they assist \"the primary violator in performing a wrongful act that causes an injury;\" (2) they are \"generally aware of [their] role as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity at the time [they] provides the assistance; and (3)\" they \"knowingly and substantially assist[ ] the principal violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804906\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/121/#p140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotations and citations omitted). Gingold has not challenged the sufficiency of the underlying allegations and the Court will not address them\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   here.

Failure to State a Claim: Count VII-Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Gingold also asserts that the Foundation has failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment. To state a claim for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must establish that: \"(1) they conferred a legally cognizable benefit upon defendants; (2) defendants possessed an appreciation or knowledge of the benefit; and (3) defendants accepted or retained the benefit under inequitable circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Oceanic Expl.

Compl. \u00b6 14, n.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    The Court notes that both parties recognize that this count is brought as an alternative to the breach of contract counts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    Gingold also argues that the Foundation cannot assert a claim against the fee award for breach of fiduciary duty because such a claim is not actionable \"unless injury accrues to the beneficiary or the fiduciary profits thereby,\" and neither the class was injured, nor did Gingold profit from the alleged breach. Opp'n at 11 [ECF No. 32] (quoting\n    <em>\n     Randolph v. ING Life Ins. and Annuity Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7298202\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/973/702/#p709\">\n     973 A.2d 702\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 709 (D.C. 2009) ). As the Court has held above that the Foundation has adequately pleaded that it was injured and Gingold profited from the retention of fees that would otherwise have paid back to the Foundation, the Foundation's claim survives.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    Of course, because this action is not one for malpractice, considerations regarding the potential creation of a \"marketplace\" for malpractice actions are not implicated. The claim for breach of fiduciary duty is limited to the pecuniary interest of class plaintiffs, not their relationship or confidences expressed to former counsel. The adequacy of Gingold's representation of his clients with respect to their legal claims in the\n    <em>\n     Cobell\n    </em>\n    case is not questioned here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    That issue remains undecided on remand from the Court of Appeals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    Similarly, the Court is not persuaded that this assignment should be deemed unenforceable because the BRDF and the Foundation\n    <em>\n     might be\n    </em>\n    adversaries in the future.
