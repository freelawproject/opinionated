Plaintiff's Motion requests the following relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Defendant be temporarily and preliminarily enjoined and restrained from using or disclosing to any person any Confidential Information and trade secrets of Cerro and from violating the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   B. Defendant be temporarily and preliminarily enjoined and restrained from directly or indirectly working for or providing services or information to Brass Aluminum or any other direct competitor of Cerro;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   C. Defendant be temporarily and preliminarily enjoined and restrained from contacting customers of Cerro, regarding the purchase of any products or services of any kind or nature provided or sold by Cerro for a period of time deemed proper by the Court to protect\n   Cerro's trade secrets and preclude them from being misappropriated and from assisting Brass Aluminum or another Cerro competitor in doing so;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   D.

Following the hearing, the parties each filed a supplemental brief in support of their respective positions (Docs. 42, 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff's motion having been fully briefed and a preliminary injunction hearing having been held, the motion is now ripe for disposition. For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunctive relief will be granted in part and denied in part as set forth in this memorandum opinion and the accompanying order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Tony Campbell, Cerro's President, John Bucher, Cerro's Product Development Manager, and Defendant George Solanick, each testified at the evidentiary hearing held on January 26, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Solanick obtained a degree in Tool Design Technology from Williamsport Area Community College (now the Pennsylvania School of Technology). He then began working at Garland Commercial Industries in 1984 and earned an Associate's degree in Business from Penn State while working at Garland. At Garland, Solanick was an industrial engineer, and \"worked at setting up assembly lines and working on manufacturing processes for sheet metal.\" Solanick voluntarily left Garland in 1988 and went to work for Mideast Aluminum, which later became Sapa. During his 23 years at Mideast Aluminum/Sapa, Solanick had the following jobs, in chronological order: (1) Engineering Estimator where he \"would do costing on jobs, quotes coming in, developed the processes, developed the tooling\"; (2) Fabrication Supervisor; (3) New Product Development, where he was responsible for any new projects that the company launched and worked to coordinate the projects within the facility and with the customer; (4) General Manager, the highest level at the\n   facility. Solanick left Mideast Aluminum/Sapa voluntarily in 2011 to work for Cerro. (Solanick Test., at 145-149, 152;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   , Solanick Resume, PI. Ex. 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Mideast Aluminum/Sapa, was a manufacturing facility. The company only worked with aluminum and extruded components for several firearms manufacturers. The only machine that Mideast Aluminum/Sapa did not have which Cerro did have was a forge machine. (Solanick Test., at 148-149).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. Solanick was recruited to work at Cerro by a former employee of Sapa who was an executive at Cerro's parent company. (Solanick Test., at 149-150).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   5. Cerro's manufacturing operation and offices are in Weyers Cave, Virginia. (Campbell Test., at 111).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   6. Cerro currently has \"just over 100 employees\" and \"well-over\" 100 customers. (Campbell Test., at 111, 117, 124).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   7. Cerro is a \"forging and machining operation providing aluminum brass components into a number of end user markets\", which include firearms, power sports, defense safety, and other industrial-type companies. (Bucher Test., at 20).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   8. At Cerro, Solanick's first job was Plant Manager/General Manager. After six months in this position, Solanick became Firearms General Manager and handled the firearm and power sports equipment half of the company. Bucher ran the other half of what he termed the \"collectum,\" which was the industrial-type product line. Solanick was subsequently promoted to President of Cerro and served in that capacity for approximately one year. Solanick then assumed the role of a Technical Sales Segment Manager. (Solanick Test., at 151-155, 158).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   9. At the time Campbell and Solanick worked together at Cerro,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Solanick worked remotely from his home in Pennsylvania. (Campbell Test., at 111).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   10. Solanick signed an \"Invention, Conflict of Interest, Confidentiality Policy and Agreement\" (\"Confidentiality Agreement\", PI. Ex. 1) on January 25, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   11. In the section entitled \"Confidential Information and Trade Secrets\", the Confidentiality Agreement states:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I will retain in confidence during my employment and thereafter any and all confidential information and trade secrets belonging to, developed by, licensed to or in the possession of the Company or its affiliates which may come into my possession during my employment. I understand and agree that the phrase \"confidential information and trade secrets\" includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Inventions, discoveries, processes, methods, designs and improvements not yet patented or published, computer source code, and research and development data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Business information such as product costs, vendor and customer lists, lists of approved components and sources, unpublished price lists, production schedules, business and marketing plans, sales figures and other financial information\n   not yet announced or publicly disclosed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Any other information not generally available to the public or to competitors of the Company or its affiliates which, if disclosed, would materially damage the Company or its affiliates or would aid or benefit a competitor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I will not do any of the following acts with respect to such confidential information and trade secrets without the consent in writing of the Company, either during my employment or thereafter: (1) communicate such confidential information or trade secrets to any other person, firm, association or corporation, or (2) use such confidential information or trade secrets for the private benefit of myself or for the benefit of any other person, firm, association or corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   All materials of any nature whatsoever that belong to the Company (whether prepared by me or by others) which relate to the products or business of the Company, shall remain the sole property of and shall be returned to the Company upon termination of my employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (Confidentiality Agreement, at 1-2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   12. Solanick did not sign any non-compete agreement other than the Confidentiality Agreement which prohibited him from \"directly solicit[ing] or attempt[ing] to solicit employees of the Company: (1) to leave its employ, or (2) to accept employment with any person or company whose business in any way competes with that of the Company\" (Confidentiality Agreement, at 2). The restriction on soliciting or attempting to solicit employees of Cerro is not at issue in the present motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   13. The Confidentiality Agreement does not contain an agreement not to solicit customers of Cerro. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , Confidentiality Agreement).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   14. Cerro never asked Solanick to sign a restrictive covenant or other non-compete or non-solicitation agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Solanick Test., at 152, 154, 155, 158).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   15. Campbell was hired as President of Cerro in October, 2017. (Campbell Test., at 112, 132). Despite only working at Cerro for four months at the time of the evidentiary hearing, Campbell explained that the basis for his information and knowledge in this case is the result of \"interactions with other people in the facility, it's reading emails, it's looking at documents, it's a full gamut, it's not time-based, it is information based.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 133).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   16. Bucher has been in \"the industry\", and worked for Cerro, for over 30 years. (Bucher Test., at 27-28; 75). Bucher has worked in Cerro's sales department for over 10 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   17. In Bucher's current position as Product Development Manager, he \"develop[s] new business and maintain[s] business, existing business.\" Prior to Solanick's departure from the company, Bucher shared this position with Solanick. (Bucher Test., at 18).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   18. Bucher and Solanick were both market segment sales managers at Cerro. In this capacity, Solanick tried to penetrate and develop business in the firearms and power sports market segments and Bucher focused on aluminum brass specialty, which included all other business segments other than those\n   covered by Solanick. (Bucher Test., at 19). Since Solanick's departure from Cerro, Bucher has assumed responsibility for the firearms side of the business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   19. Bucher described the industry in which Cerro is competing as a \"narrow\" and \"niche\" market wherein finding customers \"takes penetration, sometimes a lot, to develop those relationships and develop knowledge of who would use [Cerro's] products.\" (Bucher Test., at 35).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   20. Cerro is in a \"competitive business\" in terms of pricing, quality of parts, and performance of deliveries. (Bucher Test., at 36).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   21. The firearms component market has had a number of \"ups and downs\" over the last ten years. (Bucher Test., at 76). When the firearms market is down, Cerro tries to reduce costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Bucher admitted that in his experience with Cerro, the company \"was always evaluating [its] business\" and at times this included trying not to do business with certain firearms customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-82). Sometime during Jim Napick's tenure as President of Cerro, which was from 2014 to 2017, there was a down market with firearms, and Napick was challenged to reduce the firearm customer base, which caused Cerro to fire \"lots of customers\" who eventually went to competitors of Cerro, including Brass Aluminum Forging Enterprises, LLC (\"Brass Aluminum\"). (Solanick Test., at 160-161). According to Solanick, as a result of firing so many customers, for two years at Cerro he dealt with comments about Cerro not wanting to be in the firearm industry. (Solanick Test., at 162). Further, Campbell confirmed that, as President, he challenged Cerro's involvement in the firearms industry, but that is \"not where we landed\" and Cerro continues to invest in the firearms industry. (Campbell Test., at 115).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   22. Solanick stated that he \"know[s] manufacturing\" and therefore \"it doesn't matter if you put me in a sheet metal plant, a forging plant or a machine shop.\" (Solanick Test., at 151). Solanick admitted that he did not have any forging manufacturing experience prior to working for Cerro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185). In Bucher's opinion, Solanick's resume (PI. Ex. 4) \"clearly indicates a strong experience in extrusion but limited exposure to the whole forging process.\" (Bucher Test., at 33). Bucher further opined that, exclusive of the raw material, the extrusion manufacturing process does not have anything to do with the business in which Cerro is engaged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34). Bucher acknowledged that when Solanick started at Cerro, Solanick was knowledgeable about the manufacturing process \"as a whole\" and had experience in how to operate a large plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   23. Cerro asserts that the following information constitutes confidential information and trade secret information:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (a) confidential information as to pricing, margins, customer proposals, pricing strategies, product differentiation, competitive intelligence, and positioning and bidding strategies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (b) product costs, vendor and customer lists, lists of approved components and sources, unpublished price lists, production schedules, business\n   and marketing plans, sales figures and other financial information not yet announced or publically disclosed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (c) marketing plans, strategic plans, business plans, costs of services, profitability of various products, and internal financial information (including but not limited to from which products Cerro derives its revenue from a customer, what products are being provided to a customer, and which products are the most profitable);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (d) product capabilities, functionality, features, and designs, and sourcing strategies to maintain competitive costs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (e) bids, proposals, presentations, sales pipeline information and information concerning customers and potential customers and their needs and requirements (including but not limited to identity, revenue, volume, profitability as to each product and overall, requirements, needs, preferences, concerns, plans, experiences, and key contacts and decision-makers), and customer lists and prospects;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (f) research and development projects, and new products, product enhancements, and services being developed and business plans and strategies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (g) financial and accounting data, operating costs, and costs of goods sold; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (h) manufacturing methods and techniques; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (i) methods of operation, technologies, inventions, and designs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (Amended Compl., Doc. 33, at \u00b6 11; Decl. of Campbell, Def. Ex. 4, at \u00b6 7).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   24. On cross-examination, Campbell was unwilling to admit that the above-alleged trade secrets \"touch upon just about every aspect of Cerro's business\", arguing that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   You don't mention my employees, you don't mention the experience of my employees, you have not mentioned the size of my facility, you've not mentioned other key factors of our business that are also part of our business, so this doesn't touch everything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (Campbell Test., at 134-135). Campbell did not elaborate on what \"other key factors\" may consist of within his company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   25. Bucher stated that \"secret information\" about Cerro's business which he would not want competitors to know about included:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   a. \"[T]he pricing side of the business [ ] how we price and the strategy of pricing. Components of that would be cost, our internal costs, and also our margins to which we will price to.\" (Bucher Test., at 37;\n   <em>\n    see also, id.\n   </em>\n   at 39).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   b. Pricing, which includes rates and capabilities of rates, which is \"critical\" to understanding what quantities Cerro can produce by an operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   c. Components of \"cost\", which would be material, including the types of material used, and labor and the process itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   d. The \"pipeline\", which is prospective business, and includes \"customers, specific part numbers that we may be penetrating, maybe markets, and within that development, then we also would understand there's a spectrum of near completion and just starting the project.\" The \"pipeline\" is \"critical\" to Cerro as it develops its long term strategy, which includes determining the advantage of aluminum versus brass and different\n   types of market segments to penetrate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   e. The company's strategy, i.e., where Cerro \"want[s] to go and who the customers are that we would like to penetrate\" and maintain. This includes the company's current customer base and Cerro's contacts with those customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42;\n   <em>\n    see also, id.\n   </em>\n   at 44).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   f. The temperature \"that can be worked on internally.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   26. Bucher gave the following equivocal and noncommittal answers with respect to the following alleged trade secrets and/or confidential information:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   a. In response to Attorney Poplstein's question whether \"there [are] any special types of methods that you use in manufacturing parts such as that that would be, basically, something that is considered secret within your operation\", Bucher replied:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   So in the forging process, it\n   <em>\n    could be\n   </em>\n   things such as tool steel, die design, it\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   also be the lubrication that is used in forging, in the forging process, and\n   <em>\n    sometimes those are unique\n   </em>\n   to the forging operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Lubrication could depend on the design of the part, so oftentimes, it takes a lot of experience, from the forge personnel, to understand the design of the parts which is the best lubrication to use that could be unique to parts and design the parts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (Bucher Test., at 23) (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also, id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, 95 (stating that the lubrication process and lubrications that Cerro uses \"\n   <em>\n    could be\n   </em>\n   \" another type of \"secret information\") (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   b. Butcher admitted that \"it's as much of an art as a science in producing the parts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   c. In response to Attorney Poplstein's question whether Cerro \"developed any type of special manufacturing methods, in relation to the manufacture and production of a forged aluminum part\", Bucher replied:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   So tooling and processing,\n   <em>\n    maybe\n   </em>\n   , which machines we may run our product on\n   <em>\n    may be unique to us\n   </em>\n   , though, someone else may run the same product. So there are some unique characteristics that we would have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26) (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   27. Bucher later explained that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [t]he concerns that I might have [about Solanick working for Brass Aluminum] is the knowledge that was taken and learned at Cerro that could provide an advantage that otherwise would not be available.... [I]n the forging industry, it's a process, it's a science, but it's as much of an art. And Mr. Solanick being president had access to a lot of information and detailed information that most folks do not. So [ ] in terms of being able to-for him to know our customer base, our processes, it's quite a unique insight into one of the chief competitors of Cerro Fabricated Products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (Bucher Test., at 74).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   28. Campbell testified that he agreed with Bucher's list of what constitutes a trade secret for Cerro. (Campbell Test., at 116). Campbell elaborated on the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   a. He is concerned that information with respect to what direction he is going to take the company in, which includes important internal\n   discussions and strategy-related discussions, will become public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   b. With respect to strategy regarding margins\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , profits, and costs, he viewed the following information as confidential: whether Cerro is making money, and how much; whether the company can execute well financially; its long term capital outlook; and investments in the company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   c. Knowledge of the customer and the company's ability to respond to the information they have about the customer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   d. The identity of Cerro's single source customers is \"highly valuable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   , Declaration of Tony Campbell (Def. Ex. 4, at \u00b6 7) (outlining the information and trade secrets that Cerro contends are confidential).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   29. Campbell further explained:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   I would be very concerned that any conversations that [Solanick] would have, related to pricing, competitive advantage and those sorts of things, just having been a part of Cerro Fabricated Products, he would have an understanding of where we would typically fall, and then we would be learning at his new facility where they do fall and would be able to recognize the gap, if there is one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (Campbell Test., at 124).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   30. With respect to what constitutes confidential information and trade secrets, Solanick admitted the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   a. That he \"would not use any of the pricing information.\" (Solanick Test., at 178).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   b. That he \"shouldn't be discussing margins.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   31. However, Solanick testified that Bucher's identification of pricing, processes, and margins as trade secrets are inapplicable because Brass Aluminum is a different plant, which has different processes and has its own machines and equipment, and develops its own quotes based on its own cost structure. (Solanick Test., at 179).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   32. Working with the bidding, quoting, and estimating for parts is \"a learned skill\", which Bucher testified took him a number of years to develop. (Bucher Test., at 70). These skills include understanding costs and knowing what the rates, prices, and margins should be on a given product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-71).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   33. With respect to the estimating process, the sales department would:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   take that part, which would have a print, the specifications of a customer and quantity. We would send a request for a quote to our Estimating Department, Sales would send[ ] that to the Estimating Department. Estimating would then coordinate with engineering all the cost factors involved, material, labor, processing.

Despite Campbell's assertion to the contrary (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Campbell Test., at 134-135), Cerro's list of purported trade secrets contained in its Amended Complaint (Doc. 33, \u00b6 11) and reiterated in Campbell's Declaration (Def. Ex. 4, at \u00b6 7) is overly broad and non-specific and inappropriately incorporates a large majority of Cerro's business. However, upon review of the case law and the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing, particularly that of Bucher and Solanick, certain information asserted by Cerro does constitute trade secrets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   14. In determining what information is protected as a trade secret, the Court affords Bucher's testimony substantial weight due to his numerous years at Cerro, experience in the industry, and general demeanor and candor at the evidentiary hearing. The Court also affords Solanick's testimony considerable weight for largely the same reasons, although mindful of Solanick's personal interest in the outcome of the hearing. With respect to Campbell, the Court does not give his testimony as much weight or consideration as that of Bucher or Solanick due to Campbell's very limited time with Cerro, and his lack of knowledge and experience in the forging business prior to joining Cerro, although\n   we do note Campbell's business and management experience in \"metals\" and take such experience into consideration when evaluating what may constitute confidential information in business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   15. The evidentiary hearing revealed two areas where it is undisputed by Cerro and Solanick himself that the information at issue constitutes trade secrets. Bucher and Campbell both discussed the needed confidentiality of information regarding pricing and margins, and Solanick admitted that he \"would not use any of the pricing information\" and that he \"shouldn't be discussing margins\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Solanick Test., at 178, 180). Thus, Solanick in essence admitted the confidential nature of this information and the strong possibility that its disclosure would negatively impact Cerro's business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   16. Bucher explained that only a few people had an understanding of Cerro's cost structure and margins. Within a company of over 100 employees, this represents only a small number of senior employees who were privy to this information. Further, both Bucher and Campbell made clear that this type of information is not publicly available and would be highly valuable to a competitor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   17. Cerro's efforts to guard the secrecy of its purported confidential information or trade secrets were not extensive. At no time during his employment at Cerro was Solanick asked to sign a restrictive covenant, non-solicitation agreement, or non-compete agreement. Further, it cannot be said that Cerro's security measures identified by Bucher and Campbell, most if not all of which appear to have only been implemented recently, are strict or comprehensive. However, Cerro's Confidentiality Agreement shows a clear intent by Cerro to identify certain information as confidential and secret and ensure that any employee of Cerro who obtained the information \"retain[ed it] in confidence during [his/her] employment and thereafter.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Confidentiality Agreement, at 1-2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   18. Campbell stated that the time and expense that it took to develop \"this\" information is \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" (Campbell Test., at 125). Although Campbell did not clarify what specific information he was referring to in estimating this monetary value, including whether this was limited to trade secrets or all information needed for Cerro to successfully develop its business, this testimony is further proof of the difficulty, and cost, for other companies to gain certain information in this \"niche\" and competitive market, and the potential value of such information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   19. Plaintiff has met its burden of proving that the following information constitutes trade secrets for purposes of preliminary injunctive relief in this action:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   a. Pricing. Confidential \"pricing\" consists of how Cerro prices, its strategy in determining pricing, the company's internal costs and rates, including any unpublished price lists, and Cerro's margins to which it prices. The company's costs include the cost of labor and cost of its processes used during production.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   b. Margins. Cerro's confidential information regarding margins is defined as the amount of money Cerro is able to make when deducting the total cost (including but not limited to the cost of the product, metal, labor, and overhead) from the sales revenue Cerro makes off any given product. The confidential nature of \"margins\" also includes the precise profitability of specific products and the costs of goods sold.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   c. Internal financial information. Such information includes Cerro's internal financial and accounting data, operating costs, and any other financial information not publicly disclosed or otherwise available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   d. Manufacturing methods and techniques. Any such method or technique that is not commonly used within the forging industry and is not otherwise known or available outside of Cerro.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   e. Inventions and designs. Although Cerro provided little to no evidence of proprietary designs or inventions within the Company, to the extent that any exist, this information is confidential.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   f. \"Pipeline\" information. This confidential information includes prospective markets that Cerro is attempting to penetrate and prospective business and customers that Cerro is attempting to obtain. Encompassed within this definition is necessarily Cerro's long term strategy that it has developed, as well as any internal and confidential steps Cerro may be taking, to accomplish these goals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   g. Cerro's list of single-source customers which is not otherwise publicly available or subject to disclosure through the normal course of business within the industry.

To the extent not already included in the other trade secrets identified by the Court, Cerro's internal marketing plans, strategic plans, and business plans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   20.

Cerro contends that it has a \"strong likelihood of success on the merits of its misappropriation claim because Cerro can demonstrate that Defendant acquired knowledge of trade secrets by virtue of Defendant's employment with Cerro under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain confidentiality, and Defendant is now in a position to use or disclose such trade secrets.\" (Doc. 16, at 10).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   22.

As applicable to the present action, Solanick misappropriated a trade secret if he disclosed or used a trade secret of Cerro without express or implied consent and \"at the time of the disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was ... acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.

Thus, \"the issue ... is not whether [Cerro] took precautions to stop the disclosure of information, i.e., restrictive covenant, but whether [Cerro] possessed information which qualifies as trade secrets and whether a confidential relationship existed between [Cerro] and [Solanick] such that [Solanick] was prohibited from disclosing trade secrets revealed to him during the existence of that confidential relationship to a future employer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"182795\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/296/405/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   27. There is no direct evidence that Solanick has, or has attempted to, disclose any of Cerro's trade secrets since beginning work at Brass Aluminum. Although Plaintiff points to circumstantial evidence, such as losing Anderson's business and the incomplete bid submitted to Polaris/Lincoln, both Campbell and Bucher admitted that they could not definitively say that Solanick was responsible for telling Anderson that Cerro was no longer interested in the firearms industry, and Bucher not only admitted that the incomplete bid was a \"mistake\", but that he was partially responsible since he \"combined in the mistake\" with Solanick. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Solanick took any documents, confidential or otherwise, or information in any other tangible form, when he left Cerro. The limited evidence set forth by Plaintiff would require this Court to make large inferential leaps in order to find that Solanick has already misappropriated any trade secrets. Plaintiff has thus not set forth sufficient evidence which could allow this Court to find that Solanick has already disclosed any of Cerro's trade secrets or other confidential information to Brass Aluminum or any customers/potential customers of Cerro or used any such information in his position at Brass Aluminum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   28. However, despite the fact that there is insufficient evidence to find Solanick has already used or disclosed\n   any of Cerro's trade secrets, there still remains a sufficient likelihood that Solanick may disclose the Company's trade secrets in the near future during his employment with Brass Aluminum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   29. The record demonstrates that Cerro and Brass Aluminum are direct competitors in a narrow and niche market, and that there is a high likelihood that the two companies will repeatedly find themselves in the position of soliciting the same prospective customers, working with the same existing customers, and bidding on the same projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   30. There are a number of similarities between Solanick's job at Brass Aluminum and his prior job at Cerro. In both positions, Solanick was/is a salesperson responsible for obtaining and maintaining business from the same limited group of customers/ potential customers for the same types of products and services. The significant overlap between these two positions in such a competitive and narrow market, with limited business opportunities, increases the likelihood that certain trade secrets may be disclosed in the course of business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   31. Even in the absence of evidence that Solanick took any documentation from Cerro, as both Bucher and Campbell persuasively testified, by virtue of Solanick's time and positions at Cerro, he intellectually possesses, or is likely to possess, a significant amount of confidential information, including certain trade secrets, about Cerro in his memory. This information cannot simply be erased from Solanick's memory. However, upon review of the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing, as well as the nature of the trade secrets, it is this Court's opinion that Solanick is capable of compartmentalizing any confidential information relating to Cerro, and avoiding its use when performing his job duties at Brass Aluminum. Nonetheless, despite this finding, because Defendant has not presented any evidence of any steps that Solanick or Brass Aluminum have taken or intend on taking in order to prevent the disclosure of any of Cerro's trade secrets or confidential information, the Court still finds that there is a sufficient likelihood that Solanick may disclose a trade secret such that limited preliminary injunctive relief is necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   32. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff has met its burden of demonstrating that it has a likelihood of success on the merits of its Misappropriation of Trade Secrets claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <em>\n    Breach of Confidentiality Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   33. Plaintiff's only direct reference to its Breach of Confidentiality Agreement claim (Count II) in its brief in support of its motion for injunctive relief is found in a footnote, wherein Plaintiff states that \"Cerro has a likelihood of success on its claim for breach of the confidentiality agreement\" because \"it is clear that an agreement existed between the parties[; t]hat agreement imposed a duty of confidentiality on Defendant, who is now working for a direct competitor in what Cerro believes is a similar position to the one he held at Cerro[; and] Cerro has been informed that since resigning, Defendant is using and/or\n   disclosing Cerro's Confidential Information to aid Brass Aluminum in soliciting Cerro's customers.\" (Doc. 16, at 16 n. 4). This brief and generalized assertion fails to satisfy Plaintiff's burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Plaintiff made a slight effort in its Reply brief to address the Breach of Confidentiality Agreement claim (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26, at 14-15), the few arguments raised therein are inappropriately set forth for the first time in the Reply brief, and regardless, still lack the requisite specificity necessary for Plaintiff to prevail in its attempt to obtain injunctive relief on this claim. Further, it cannot reasonably be disputed that the majority, if not the entirety, of the evidentiary hearing focused on the existence and nature of Cerro's trade secrets and the purported threatened misappropriation of those trade secrets. As a result of Plaintiff's failure to set forth the necessary case law, evidentiary information, or substantive argument for this Court to adequately assess the merits of Count II of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits of its Breach of Confidentiality Agreement claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   34. Because Plaintiff has largely failed to brief or otherwise argue the merits of its Breach of Confidentiality Agreement claim, and the Court will find that Plaintiff is entitled to preliminary injunctive relief with respect to the threat of disclosure or misappropriation of a number of trade secrets, as well as the fact that the trade secrets and protections of certain information in the confidentiality agreement overlap to a large extent, the Court declines to otherwise address Cerro's likelihood of success on the merits on its Breach of Confidentiality Agreement claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Doc. 16, at 7-8).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   38. The facts that Solanick is currently employed at Brass Aluminum, a competitor of Cerro in a narrow market with limited projects and customers within the industry, engaging in business with some of the same customers as he worked with at Cerro, and where Brass Aluminum is in competition with Cerro to both retain customers and gain new customers as well as to obtain new projects, and such competition is both presently occurring and will continue to occur, the Court finds that the threat of misappropriation is imminent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   39. Here, the industry in which Cerro and Brass Aluminum work is narrow and competitive, wherein, as Bucher explained, margins can be \"very tight\" and there is a challenge to be \"very effective\" in order to be competitive. In this environment, the disclosure of one or more trade secrets could make a significant impact on Cerro's ability to compete with Brass Aluminum or other companies in the same business. For example, the disclosure of Cerro's trade secrets could allow Brass Aluminum to improve or otherwise alter the technology it uses and the processes it applies, as well as allowing Brass Aluminum to solicit clients and/or projects of which they may have previously been unaware or unable to anticipate. Brass Aluminum would also be in a stronger position to predict how Cerro's capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses can be used to Brass Aluminum's advantage, including how Cerro would respond to certain requests for quotes, and therefore modify its own bids accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   40. Campbell was unable to state with any specificity how much business or business opportunities Cerro would lose if Solanick disclosed Cerro's purported trade secrets, explaining that the amount of any losses depends on how many customers Cerro would lose if Solanick used certain information that he knew about Cerro, which in turn would impact Cerro's ability to employ people and turn a profit. Thus, Campbell's testimony makes clear that some of Cerro's damages can be quantified in monetary terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   41. Nonetheless, compensation in money alone cannot atone for all of the damages that Cerro may suffer as a result of any misappropriation of\n   trade secrets. As explained, because both Cerro and Brass Aluminum are competitors in a narrow and niche market, any information gained as the result of the disclosure of one or more of Cerro's trade secrets would give Brass Aluminum a critical advantage in securing and maintaining business. Any unlawful disclosure further may result in the loss of business opportunities or market advantage. The disclosure of Cerro's trade secrets undoubtedly puts Cerro at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis Brass Aluminum and any of its other competitors in the industry. This disadvantage is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify in terms of financial damages and is therefore incapable of being adequately remedied through the use of other legal means. Additionally, the variety of ways that Solanick could use the above-identified trade secrets while employed at Brass Aluminum are so subtle and intertwined with other non-trade secret factors that attempting to impose a remedy solely in the form of monetary damages is very likely to be met by the insurmountable obstacle of an inability to quantify what damages flow from the unlawful disclosure or use of trade secrets in any transaction in which Solanick participates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   42. As a result, the Court finds that it is more likely than not that Cerro will suffer imminent and irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Extent to Which Solanick will Suffer Irreparable Harm if Injunction is Issued\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   43. Cerro requests that Solanick \"be temporarily and preliminarily enjoined and restrained from using or disclosing to any person any Confidential Information and trade secrets of Cerro and from violating the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement\", as well as \"be[ing] temporarily and preliminarily enjoined and restrained from directly or indirectly working for or providing services or information to Brass Aluminum or any other direct competitor of Cerro.\" (Doc. 6, at 11-12).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   44. Here, there is no evidence that Solanick will suffer any harm if he is enjoined from revealing Cerro's above-listed trade secrets and confidential information. In particular, there is no evidence that Solanick would lose his job at Brass Aluminum or be demoted in any way if he is enjoined from revealing the information found by this Court to constitute a trade secret. Even if Solanick did suffer some form of undetermined harm, such harm is certainly outweighed by the harm Cerro would suffer if one or more of its trade secrets were revealed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   45. However, Solanick would suffer significant harm if enjoined from working at Brass Aluminum or other direct competitor of Cerro as Plaintiff requests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   46. \"[E]ven a temporary injunction prohibiting someone from pursuing his livelihood in the manner he chooses operates as a severe restriction on him that a court should not impose lightly.\"\n   <em>\n    Bimbo Bakeries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704296\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/102/#p113\">\n    613 F.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   47.

Additionally, even a temporary injunction preventing Solanick from working at Brass Aluminum while this case proceeds would constitute a significant hardship on Solanick. In this Court's experience, a case such as this may take over a year to proceed to trial, even if the parties agree to an expedited case management schedule, and, should Defendant file any dispositive motions, this may further prolong the adjudication of this action. It would be a substantial hardship on Solanick to be unemployed for this significant period of time or be forced to attempt to find a new position at a different company when there is no evidence that he would be capable of obtaining a comparable job. It is further unreasonable to believe that Solanick has the financial means to be unemployed for any lengthy duration of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met its burden with respect to its entitlement to certain preliminary injunctive relief. Plaintiff has demonstrated that it has a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets and that it is more likely than not to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of some preliminary injunctive relief. On balance, these two factors, in conjunction with the extent to which Defendant would suffer irreparable harm and the public interest, balance in favor of granting limited preliminary injunctive relief to Cerro. Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 6) will therefore be granted in part and denied in part as set forth in this memorandum opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on January 25, 2018 (Doc. 33).
