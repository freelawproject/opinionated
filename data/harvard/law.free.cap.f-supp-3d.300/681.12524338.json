Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following relevant facts, which the Court accepts as true for the purpose of deciding the pending motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was hired as the Superintendent of Ambridge Area School District (\"AASD\") on March 20, 2013. (Docket No. 1 at \u00b6 29). At the time of her hiring, several school board members opposed her selection and preferred to hire a male candidate who was a high school principal from the area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). As a consequence of Plaintiff's hiring over the male candidate, Defendants Roger Kowal and Brian Padgett began a targeted retaliatory campaign to foster a hostile working environment and recruited other board members to further their discriminatory objective. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37). The pattern of retaliation and creation of a hostile work environment was consistent and pervasive from the outset of Plaintiff's employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During a board meeting on June 12, 2013, Defendant Padgett screamed, \"You mother fucker, you better watch yourself. I will go after you. You better watch yourself, you mother fucker,\" and \"I will get you,\" at Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-44). Defendant Padgett was subdued by other board members, who separated him from Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46). Defendant Kowal laughed during the threat and thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47). After Plaintiff filed a police report on June 13, 2013, Defendant Padgett was charged with harassment and terroristic threats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51). After word circulated that Defendant Padgett was going to shoot Plaintiff at a future board meeting, police were present at subsequent board proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). Defendant Padgett concluded his term on the school board in November 2013 and pled guilty to the harassment charges in July 2014 after Plaintiff refused to withdraw the criminal complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-56). After Defendant Padgett entered his plea, Defendant Kowal informed Plaintiff, \"I will ruin you if it's the last thing I do; if it means ruining this school district.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). Concerted activity was thereafter undertaken by Defendants Kowal, Badgett, and Mealie for the purpose of causing harm to Plaintiff's professional reputation and employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59). For example, Plaintiff was publicly and falsely accused of running a meth lab and engaging in Satanic worship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62). Defendants engaged in a deliberate, malicious, and ongoing pattern of abusive and threatening behavior to cause Plaintiff physical, emotional, and economic harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2014, School Resource Officer Nate Smith mistreated and restrained without authorization J.H., an African American student with a documented disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67). Based upon video surveillance and school policy, Plaintiff reported that incident to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Bureau of Special Education, as an improper restraint and requested that the local police department remove Smith from his role as a School Resource Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 68-74). After Defendant Kowal informed the police chief that he should not heed Plaintiff's concerns, Smith remained on school grounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 75-77). When Plaintiff suggested offering a summer school graduation ceremony for students with special needs, Defendant Locher stated, \"Fuck those kids.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 77-78). Several board members directly interfered with Plaintiff's attempts to satisfy the rights of special needs students in an effort to force her resignation through an oppressive and retaliatory work environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80-82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2015, Plaintiff advised the board that she had received a report that school district funds were being stolen by the Baden tax collector. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83). Defendant Kowal, a personal friend of the auditors serving the district and tax collector, became defensive, verbally abusive, and challenged Plaintiff's need to report the information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-86). The tax collector was convicted in federal court of mail fraud and filing false income tax returns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87). Plaintiff's report was met with animosity and hostility to create an oppressive work environment to compel her to resign or be terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also, in March 2015, a teacher filed a complaint, alleging that Defendant Mealie was subjecting her to sexual harassment by making unwelcome visits to her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89-90). The teacher turned over sixty pages of text messages demonstrating that the harassment had occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91). Plaintiff suspended Defendant Mealie pending an investigation and participated as a witness in the district's independent investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-93). In addition to revealing sexual harassment by Defendant Mealie, the text messages between February and March 2015 illustrated collusion between board members and Defendant Mealie to create a hostile work environment for Plaintiff, an intent to physically harm Plaintiff, a desire to effectuate Plaintiff's discharge, and malice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 94-97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2015, Plaintiff was denied a 2% pay increase, after all other active administrators were given a 2% pay increase and one-time bonuses ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98-99). Defendant Locher indicated that the board would not give raises to any individual who had not yet had an evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101). Pursuant to school district policy and the terms of Plaintiff's employment contract, the board was required to perform her annual evaluation prior to the end of the school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 102-103). By refusing to perform the evaluation, the board denied Plaintiff an increase which she was otherwise due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104). Additionally, the board interfered with Plaintiff's ability to attend educational conferences and required her to exhaust vacation days to attend same, despite conference attendance being permitted under the terms of her contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 105).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 12, 2015, Defendant Keber told custodial staff members that if they came to a special board meeting and looked up, they would see Plaintiff with her head in a noose hanging from the bridge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 109). Thereafter, the board members engaged in intensifying public actions to foment public antipathy toward Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 110). After outlining Defendants' actions and text messages between June 2013 and October 2015, Plaintiff alleges that she was hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 112-117). As a result of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, requiring her to take medical leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 119-120). The medical leave, which commenced less than twenty-four hours after Defendant Keber's noose comment, was extended, and Plaintiff was ultimately not released to return to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 121-122).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff asserts nine claims against Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 123-236). Relevant to the pending motions to dismiss, Plaintiff asserts the following claims: (1) a claim for sex discrimination and retaliation at Count III against Defendants AASD, Keber, Kowal, Locher, and Padgett, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 147-153); (2) a claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at Count IV against all Defendants, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 154-164); (3) a claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at Count VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   against Defendants Keber, Kowal, Locher, Mealie, and Padgettt, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 179-191); and (4) a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations at Count VIII against Defendants Keber, Kowal, Locher, Mealie, and Padgett, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 204-220).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
