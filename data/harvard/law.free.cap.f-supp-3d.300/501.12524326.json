More fundamentally, Plaintiff's Complaint fails to set forth allegations plausibly supporting a Fourth Amendment claim.

Plaintiff appears to advance two bases for these constitutional claims. First, Plaintiff asserts a deprivation of liberty on the basis of state intrusion into his residence. Doc. 18 at 22 (\"Liberty interests are implicated whenever the state intrudes upon the most essential and basic aspect of familial privacy, this would include a disabled person in his home, his residence.\"). Second, he asserts a due process violation premised on the action and inaction of state actors. In this connection, Plaintiff contends that Defendants are liable for both their approval of building applications and their failure to prevent private actors from engaging in construction on the Subject Premises that resulted in \"toxic environmental conditions\" there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 12 (\"The City failed numerous times to stop the owners from filing false documents, or documents containing false information.\"), 28 (\"The City of New York completely failed to enforce compliance\" with its rules and regulations), 32 (\"the City continued to\n   fail to enforce code compliance\"), 72 (Count 6, asserting Defendants had an \"affirmative duty to intervene\").
