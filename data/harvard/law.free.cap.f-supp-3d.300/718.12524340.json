Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Adobe Systems Incorporated (\"Adobe Incorporated\") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Jose, California. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 11. Adobe Incorporated is a large software company that markets and licenses its products to customers through its sales force and also distributes its products through a network of distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, independent software vendors, retailers and original equipment manufacturers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Adobe Systems Federal LLC (\"Adobe Federal\") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adobe Incorporated and a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in McLean, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Gardiner was employed by Adobe Federal from 2005 to March 3, 2017, and served as a sales representative within Adobe's Public Sector team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The Public Sector team oversees the marketing of Adobe Connect, which is a software designed to facilitate web conferencing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16. Adobe does not license Adobe Connect directly to the federal government; rather, Adobe typically licenses Adobe Connect to a distributor who then licenses it to the federal government directly or through an Adobe Connect authorized reseller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. As an Adobe Connect sales representative. Gardiner was responsible for generating interest in Adobe Connect amongst resellers and the federal government and providing distributors or authorized resellers with bid requests from end users.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Gardiner is also alleged to be the sole owner and principal corporate officer of Open Market Energy LLC (\"OME\"). OME is an energy advisor that helps clients find deals on electricity and natural gas, with its principal place of business at 7625 Wisconsin Ave., Suite 300, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814. Defendant Plurality became an authorized reseller in September 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. At that time, Defendant Gardiner was an officer of Plurality\n   and held the title of Vice President.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Plurality is a Mississippi company with its principal place of business in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi but also maintains an office at 7625 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 300.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. VAR Solutions LLC (\"VAR Solutions\") is a Maryland corporation also with its principal place of business at 7625 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 300.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. VAR Solutions is owned by Matthew Gardiner, Defendant Gardiner's brother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Adobe Connect Program Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To become an authorized Adobe Connect reseller, an interested company must be approved by Adobe and execute an Adobe Connect Value Added Reseller Agreement (\"Reseller Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The Reseller Agreement contains restrictions on the reseller's use of confidential information provided by Adobe and allows Adobe to terminate the contract should the reseller misuse the confidential information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Authorized resellers can also participate in the Adobe Connection Deal Registration Program, which offers incentives of up to 20% of the value of the deal to resellers that help facilitate licenses of Adobe Connect to end users.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Resellers typically obtain credit for such deals by registering them in a Salesforce.com database.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Adobe maintains the database and relies on its sales representatives to confirm the reseller's involvement in the underlying deal registration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plurality was an authorized reseller and participated in the Adobe Connect Deal Registration Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Authorized resellers must also comply with the authorized reseller Program Guide and complete the North America Vendor Questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23. Per the Program Guide, \"[resellers] agree to only enter valid information\" when registering deals, and \"deals which are already being managed by an Adobe Sales Rep, in which no partner involvement is required\" do not qualify for deal registrations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Per the Vendor Questionnaire, resellers agree not to \"pay, promise or offer to pay, directly or indirectly, any money or any other thing of value to any person for the purpose of improperly influencing any decision or action on behalf of Adobe\" and must disclose if any of its \"employees, owners, officers or directors\" are \"also current or former employees of Adobe or spouses or close family members of Adobe employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. The Vendor Questionnaire also requires authorized resellers to follow Adobe's Business Partner Code of Conduct (\"Partner Code\"), which provides that \"Adobe employees and their family members may not hold any significant economic interest in any entity that does business with Adobe and business partners are required to avoid such relationships with Adobe employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Gardiner, as an employee of Adobe, was subject to the same Conflicts of Interest Policy contained in the Partner Code and was required to periodically execute Adobe's Conflicts Questionnaire, in which he was obligated to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest with his work for Adobe, \"including whether he or a related party is employed by, or holds an investment in, any Adobe customer, channel partner, or supplier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Gardiner completed the Conflicts Questionnaire in 2014, 2015, and 2016 and answered each pertinent question pertaining to conflicts of interest in the negative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similar prohibitions on conflicts of interest\n   are contained in Adobe's Business Conduct Code, Anti-Corruption Policy, and Public Sector Code to which Gardiner and Plurality were obligated to follow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Alleged Kickback Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Adobe alleges that Gardiner facilitated approval of Plurality as an Adobe Connect reseller in September of 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Specifically, on September 21, 2012, Gardiner organized via email a \"Plurality Reseller Discussion\" with the officers of Plurality and later represented to Adobe that Plurality was interested in becoming an authorized Adobe Connect reseller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Plurality did not meet the requirements to become a reseller, Gardiner was able to push through Plurality's approval even though Plurality had not yet completed the business plan and paperwork as required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 5, 2012, Gardiner organized another meeting with Plurality officers, with the calendar invitation titled \"Plurality Company Structure and meetings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this same time, Gardiner, through his wholly-owned company OME, wired $20,000 to Plurality as a loan and on October 24, 2012, sent an email to Plurality indicating that \"OME would loan Plurality more money 'so we can meet our numbers.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. At no point did Gardiner or Plurality disclose Gardiner's role as Vice President of Plurality or any association with OME.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Once Plurality became an authorized reseller, Gardiner allegedly directed a scheme whereby he would provide Plurality with confidential information regarding deal registration opportunities, allowing Plurality to either match or beat potential bids from other resellers or obtain credit for deals generated by, or solely directed to, Gardiner even though Plurality had not contributed to the deal in a meaningful way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40. Gardiner used his role at Adobe to approve the deal registrations whenever Plurality ran into problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Cumulatively, Adobe has paid over $5 million to Plurality in deal registration payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to Plurality, Adobe alleges that Gardiner shared confidential information with, and directed deals to, other resellers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. These resellers did not compensate Gardiner directly; rather, VAR Solutions would obtain payment from these resellers through fabricated invoices for consulting services, \"despite VAR Solutions having not contributed to the deal or provided\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   consulting services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. VAR Solutions then transferred payments relating to the deal registrations to Gardiner either through transfers to OME or investments made on Gardiner's behalf, including investing in the entity that owns the Bethesda building housing offices for OME, VAR Solutions, and Plurality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Adobe alleges that Plurality coordinated a similar effort to compensate Gardiner for his role in securing their deal registrations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Moreover, Plurality allegedly shared its ill-gotten proceeds with Gardiner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.

Adobe has provided the Court with a copy of an Employee Inventions and Proprietary Rights Assignment Agreement (\"Assignment Agreement\") that, similar to the Value Added Reseller Agreement, is subject to California law, ECF No. 30-1 at 11. However, the Complaint makes no mention of the Assignment Agreement nor suggests how the Assignment Agreement relates to the Employment Agreement that Gardiner allegedly violated. During the hearing, Adobe indicated that the \"Employment Agreement\" referenced in the Complaint was likely a collection of documents signed by Gardiner, but Adobe was unable to state whether this collection included the Assignment Agreement itself. Therefore, the Court has no basis to find that California law applies to Gardiner's alleged breach of the Employment Agreement, and the Court will dismiss the Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing claim against Gardiner. However, because California law does apply to the Reseller Agreement, the Court will not dismiss this claim against Plurality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Without more, the mere fact that Gardiner allegedly misrepresented his interest in OME as part of his effort to enrich himself, while also being an agent of OME, is insufficient to impute his liability for fraud onto OME through their agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plurality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plurality argues that Adobe fails to \"state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\" ECF No. 18 at 6. However, Adobe's complaint adequately pleads fraud on the part of Plurality. Adobe alleges that Plurality knowingly registered for deals generated without its involvement, causing Adobe to pay commissions to Plurality that it did not earn. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 38. While Plurality argues that \"there is nothing pled that implies that Plurality should have known that it should not act on leads provided by [Gardiner] or that it was fraudulent to then register sales.\" Adobe does not allege that Plurality merely acted on improper leads to then effectuate product sales. Rather, Adobe alleges that Plurality registered for deals, and accepted commissions, without doing any actual work. By registering sales in Adobe's database, Plurality effectively represented to Adobe that it was entitled to receive compensation for sales attributable to other resellers. Such allegations state a claim for fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

ECF No. 1 \u00b6 98. Because Adobe has adequately pleaded a claim for fraud against Gardiner and Plurality, the Court may consider whether any of the Defendants conspired to commit such fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alleco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031316\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/176/#p201\">\n    340 Md. at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031316,2031311\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/665/1038/\">\n    665 A.2d 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (courts \"should not entertain a claim for civil conspiracy to commit fraud unless the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an underlying fraud\").

ECF No. 12-1 at 8-9. However, Adobe's Complaint sets forth sufficient details to suggest that Gardiner and Plurality engaged in an agreement to conspire. Gardiner organized a meeting with Plurality officers at Plurality's headquarters on October 5, 2012, around the time in which Gardiner was trying to add Plurality as an Adobe Connect reseller. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. In addition, Gardiner allegedly provided Plurality with confidential deal registration information so that Plurality could fraudulently register these deals and, when Plurality ran into problems, it requested the assistance of Gardiner in order to obtain approval. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39. Beyond conclusory allegations, Adobe alleges the exact dates this correspondence occurred and the language Gardiner used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 (\"For instance, on October 19, 2012, Mr. Gardiner shared with Plurality via email a confidential internal quote for an Adobe Connect licensing opportunity to the U.S. Department of State. In sharing this confidential information with Plurality, Mr. Gardiner stated: 'here is a lay up for 8k.' \"). These communications between Gardiner and Plurality are sufficient to establish their mutual agreement; Adobe need not allege that Gardiner and Plurality brokered a specific, formal arrangement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Windesheim v.

While Plurality suggests that \"[t]hese allegations do not appear in the least bit conspiratorial, but rather they appear to be the typical interactions one would expect to find between Adobe and one of its resellers,\" ECF No. 18 at 8. Adobe has pled with particularity that Plurality, by understanding or agreement, conspired to defraud Adobe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. VAR Solutions and OME\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Unlike its claim against Plurality, Adobe has not set forth sufficient details necessary to establish that VAR Solution or OME took specific action in planning or executing the underlying fraudulent kickback scheme. Adobe's Complaint alleges that VAR Solutions and OME were owned and operated by either Gardiner or an immediate family member and likewise operated within Gardiner's corporate office space, facts highly suggestive of their shared interests, close coordination, and position to profit from the alleged kickback scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

OME's only overt act was wiring $20,000 to Plurality in September of 2012 ECF No. 1 \u00b6 36. But Adobe fails to connect the act to the alleged fraud. The Court would have to assume that the funds were somehow used to enable Plurality to become an authorized reseller and, if so, further assume that OME knowingly provided the funds for this purpose. Similar to Count V, Adobe has not established that Gardiner was acting on behalf of OME as its agent such that it is liable for Gardiner's conduct. Without more, Adobe's conclusory allegations as to OME's role in the alleged conspiracy are insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

ECF No. 15. Therefore, VAR Solutions' motion to dismiss, filed on June 6, 2017, was not timely pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1)(A)(i). VAR Solutions response to Adobe on this point is not persuasive.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 36 at n. 1.
