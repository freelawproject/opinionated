INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter comes before the court on Defendants Everett School District and Carol Whitehead's (collectively, \"the District\") first and second motions for summary judgment (1st MSJ (Dkt. # 57); 2d\n   MSJ (Dkt. # 59) ), and Defendant Craig Verver's motion for summary judgment (Verver MSJ (Dkt. # 61) ). A.T. opposes the motions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1st Resp. (Dkt. # 63); 2d Resp. (Dkt. # 69); Verver Resp. (Dkt. # 68) ), and all Defendants have filed replies (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1st Reply (Dkt. # 66); 2d Reply (Dkt. # 74); Verver Reply (Dkt. # 77) ). Having considered these submissions, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law, the court, considering itself fully advised, GRANTS the District's first motion for summary judgment (1st MSJ) and GRANTS Mr. Verver's motion for summary judgment (Verver MSJ). The court also DENIES the District's second motion for summary judgment (2d MSJ) as moot. Accordingly, the court dismisses this case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.T.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   attended Cascade High School in the Everett School District from 1999 to 2003. (1st Resp. at 6.) Mr. Verver was one of A.T.'s teachers during the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 school years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC (Dkt. # 28) \u00b6 7.) A.T. was also a cabinet member of the National Honor Society, for which Mr. Verver served as a faculty adviser. (1st Resp. at 6.) During the 2001-2002 school year, Mr. Verver singled out A.T. in class, teased her,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and gave her special attention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Cochran Decl. (Dkt. # 65) \u00b6 15, Ex. N (\"A.T. Interrogatories\") at 202.) Mr. Verver told A.T. that she would need to take \"calculated risks\" to be exceptional enough to stand out for college admissions. (SAC \u00b6 9.) At the end of the school year, Mr. Verver encouraged A.T. to run for Honor Society president, a position that required working closely with him in his capacity as faculty adviser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) A.T. was elected Honor Society president for the following year, and Mr. Verver gave A.T. his personal contact information so that they could be in touch over the summer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 1st Resp. at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2002, while A.T. was 17-years-old, A.T. attended a school dance. (A.T. Interrogatories at 198.) After the dance, A.T. stayed to help clean up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While there, Mr. Verver kept A.T. for hours and engaged her in conversation about their \"unique relationship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver also told A.T. that \"he worried about his role in her life and was envious of her parents because A.T. might leave him after graduation while she would always be her parents' child.\" (SAC \u00b6 11.) Mr. Verver expressed to A.T. that he was concerned about her future and protective of who she may choose to date or marry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver also shared with A.T. that he was having marital problems. (A.T. Interrogatories at 198.) At the end of their conversation, Mr. Verver gave A.T. \"a very long and close hug.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After this date, Mr. Verver frequently hugged A.T. closely when she left his classroom if she had been there on the weekends or after school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 200.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around two weeks after the school dance, Mr. Verver confided in A.T. that his wife was pregnant and that he was \"crushed about the news.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-99.) A.T. also began confiding in Mr. Verver about her relationships with boys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 199.) During one conversation, A.T. told Mr. Verver that she was uncomfortable being physical with her boyfriends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Mr. Verver sat next to A.T. on the couch in his classroom and asked,\n   \"[D]o you feel uncomfortable about me sitting here?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He then put his hand on A.T.'s thigh and asked A.T. whether she would be able to say \"no\" if a date put his hand on her thigh. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.T. turned 18 on January 5, 2003. (SAC \u00b6 14.) Later that month, she visited Mr. Verver's classroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver greeted A.T. with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.T. Interrogatories at 203.) The next time A.T. saw Mr. Verver, he asked her how she felt about the kiss. (A.T. Interrogatories at 203.) A.T. told Mr. Verver that it made her nervous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver kissed her again on the cheek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the end of January 2003, A.T. was in Mr. Verver's classroom on a weekend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204.) Mr. Verver told A.T. that he was going to \"steal a kiss\" and kissed A.T. on the mouth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. became \"physically upset\" and \"started trembling and twitching uncontrollably.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver told A.T. that he was going to \"steal another kiss\" and kissed her again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver suggested that they move to the couch, and Mr. Verver kissed A.T. and tried to put his hands up her shirt, though A.T. resisted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. felt \"humiliated\" and \"scared\" about making Mr. Verver angry \"if she said that wasn't what she wanted\" and \"blamed herself for making him have that misunderstanding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204-05.) When A.T. returned home that day, she \"hid in her closet\" and cried uncontrollably. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205.) The next school day, Mr. Verver pulled A.T. aside before school started to discuss what had happened between them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver told A.T. it could never happen again, but then pulled her in and kissed her, saying, \"[W]ell, we both knew we couldn't help ourselves.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The sexual relationship between A.T. and Mr. Verver continued to escalate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205-06.) After school, on the weekends, and even sometimes during school hours, Mr. Verver would invite A.T. into his classroom, lock the door, and engage in intimate contact with A.T. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The sexual contact occurred two to three times a week for the rest of A.T.'s senior year, ranging from kissing to sexual intercourse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205-11.) The first time A.T. and Mr. Verver had sexual intercourse was on April 26, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208.) A.T. went to Mr. Verver's classroom to gather supplies for a car wash. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Verver produced a condom and asked A.T. to put one on him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. hesitated, and Mr. Verver told her, \"If you want me to wear this then you have to put it on me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. acquiesced, and the two had sexual intercourse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After this encounter, Mr. Verver and A.T. had sex on multiple occasions in his classroom and in other locations at the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Throughout the 2002-2003 school year, teachers who frequently stopped by Mr. Verver's classroom after school and on the weekends would find A.T in his classroom. (SAC \u00b6 19.) On some occasions, Mr. Verver's door was locked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Upon Mr. Verver opening the door, teachers would find A.T. on his couch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, teachers also saw Mr. Verver give A.T. rides home from school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.T. graduated from high school in summer 2003, and began attending the University of Washington that fall. (1st Resp. at 8-9; A.T. Interrogatories at 213-14.) A.T. eventually graduated from the University of Washington in 2008, with bachelor's degrees in English and French. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While A.T. studied at the University of Washington, she and Mr. Verver continued their sexual relationship. (1st Resp. at 9.) On January 8, 2006, A.T. journaled about discussing the relationship with Mr. Verver: \"[A]nd then we moved onto the topic of possible damage done and why we yet don't stop.\" (Leitch Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. B at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In fall 2008, A.T. began graduate school at UCLA to pursue a PhD in French\n   Studies. (1st Resp. at 9.) Near the end of 2009, A.T. was teaching an undergraduate French class when she had a \"significant reaction\" to being the teacher in a classroom of students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. subsequently fainted on campus, and her PhD supervisor advised her to see a therapist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. took her supervisor's advice and sought counseling at UCLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the beginning of her therapy sessions, A.T. told the therapist that she had an \"on and off\" relationship with an older married man. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) On April 18, 2010, A.T. told the therapist that she felt guilty and frustrated with aspects of her relationship with Mr. Verver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) A.T. received her first psychological diagnosis at this session: Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Around September 2011, A.T. moved abroad to Cambridge to continue her studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In June 2012, A.T. returned to UCLA to defend her dissertation prospectus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On this trip, she traveled to Seattle to confront Mr. Verver and tell him that she no longer wanted a sexual relationship with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Mr. Verver agreed to stop the sexual relationship, but on the way home from dinner, Mr. Verver pulled over in an abandoned parking lot, undid his pants, and demanded oral sex. (A.T. Interrogatories at 219.) A.T. \"numbly complied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After Mr. Verver ejaculated, he \"laughed, let out a satisfied sigh, and said ... '\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   I guess it's okay if you go.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After A.T. returned to Cambridge, she journaled extensively about the relationship. In a January 29, 2012, entry-when A.T. was 27-years-old-A.T. wrote that she \"feel[s] damaged by [the] relationship.\" (Leitch Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. C at 3.) On September 12, 2012, A.T. wrote an email to her PhD supervisor at UCLA regarding the relationship and the grief it caused her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, Ex. E at 3.) A.T. explained in this email that, since she taught her French class in 2009, she \"realized the power dynamics that had been operative ... [and] had a really difficult time teaching that whole year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On September 27, 2012, A.T. called Mr. Verver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, Ex. G at 2-3.) A.T. detailed the phone call in her journal: \"I think this is when I let loose a flood of my feelings and hurt and shame about everything ... about wanting to kill myself, about feeling like I had zero integrity ... and that I felt groomed and manipulated, regardless of whether he meant to.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The next day, on September 28, 2012, A.T. went to Cambridge University Counseling Service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Cochran Decl. \u00b6 11, Ex. J (\"Cambridge Counseling\") at 146.) A.T. wrote her reason for seeking counseling services was because she was \"getting out of a harmful relationship and [she] need[s] some help right now while [she's] feeling very fragile.\" (Cambridge Counseling at 146.) A.T. further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The relationship was with a teacher, and it began while I was still in his class ... I have only just recently (like, for two months) allowed myself to think about this relationship as harmful, and admitting that has been incredibly painful.... This whole thing shuts me down fairly often (where I don't get out of bed or eat really for several days at a time); I used to think of harming myself, but not for the last two years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Around this time, the people A.T. confided in about the relationship described Mr. Verver's actions as \"abuse\" and \"coercion\" and \"grooming.\" (Leitch Decl., Ex. D at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While A.T. was at Cambridge, she had been exploring her sexual and gender identity. (1st Resp. at 10-11.) A.T. eventually began to identify as genderqueer and married another genderqueer individual,\n   Jack, in October 2013. (Cochran Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex. A (\"A.T. Depo. Vol. 1\") at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.T. returned to the United States in 2013. (1st Resp. at 11.) On April 24, 2013, A.T. again sought therapy at UCLA. (Leitch Decl. \u00b6 11, Ex. I at 3.) On the intake form, A.T. reported \"ongoing issues around an abusive relationship,\" and that she was concerned about \"Anxiety, fears, or nervousness ... Depression ... [and] Sexual abuse or assault.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. also wrote that she was previously in counseling \"six months ago for the sexual abuse issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. then met with the counselor, who noted A.T.'s diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.T. returned to UCLA counseling in May 2013, telling the therapist that she was in \"recovery from a past power abusive relationship with [a] former teacher.\" (Leitch Decl. \u00b6 12, Ex. J at 3.) A.T. also reported that she became aware of the power abusive nature of the relationship when she started a teaching role in graduate school (presumably referring to the 2009 French class). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The counselor noted that A.T. had symptoms of anxiety, depression, and difficulty concentrating, and reiterated A.T.'s diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.T. completed the fall 2013 quarter at UCLA, but then quit her PhD program because she \"had a lot going on\" and \"never obtained secure housing.\" (1st Resp. at 11-12.) A.T. and Jack then moved to San Francisco where A.T. worked as a housekeeper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) In February 2015, A.T. had a double mastectomy to obtain a \"more masculine torso profile.\" (Cochran Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. B at 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In fall 2015, A.T. went to two job fairs to consider becoming a substitute teacher and going back to school to earn a teaching certificate. (1st Resp. at 12.) At both events, A.T. was \"unusually hypervigilant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Looking around the room at these events, A.T. was overwhelmed with the thought that all of these people could be abusing or hurting students, and that A.T. becoming a teacher would make her complicit in the abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the second event, A.T. had a panic attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. alleges that fall 2015:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [I]s when she realized that she had suffered an actual psychological injury due to Craig Verver's actions: When she realized that the physical and psychological consequences of his abuse prevented her from successfully pursuing the career that she had trained for, and prevented her from being able to complete her graduate degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. claims that she \"first saw an attorney relating to anything Verver\" in November 2015, after the job fairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) After A.T. described her history with Mr. Verver to the attorney, the attorney confirmed that A.T. could file a lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In November or December 2016, A.T. saw her primary care physician. (A.T. Depo. Vol. 1 at 7.) At this appointment, her doctor diagnosed A.T. with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This was the first time A.T. was diagnosed with PTSD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to A.T., however, \"ever since things began with Craig Verver,\" she has \"experienced nightmares and different manifestations of PTSD, anxiety kind of things, [and] hypervigilance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. is not sure when she \"would call that PTSD because ... [her] understanding of that[ disease] evolved,\" but \"it was most disorienting after [she] ended contact with [Mr. Verver] in 2012.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.T.'s expert consultant for this case, Dr. Gilbert Kliman, reviewed A.T.'s medical records and relevant testimony, and described A.T.'s situation in the following manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The situation of the plaintiff is like that of a person who at one point has a minor seeming skin rash and does not know that it is going to proceed to be a major disorder, Lyme Disease, which will affect many systems of her body....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In this case, the plaintiff years ago received diagnoses of adjustment reaction disorder, a minor disorder which is defined as a reaction to a stressor. The stressor was identified as a relationship with a married former teacher of the stressed person. The plaintiff was aware of the stressor, but she was not aware of the future consequences of which we now know. Nor could she have been aware....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PTSD] is a major mental disorder which went undiagnosed by a mental health professional until 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Kliman Decl. (Dkt. # 64) \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.) Dr. Kliman admitted that A.T. \"underwent fairly significant therapy in 2012.\" (Cochran Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. D (\"Kliman Depo.\") at 84.) But, according to Dr. Kliman, PTSD is different from A.T.'s earlier diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and adjustment reaction disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86 (explaining that \"PTSD is not considered an anxiety disorder,\" that PTSD is \"clearly differentiated\" from depression, and that PTSD is not the same as \"adjustment reaction disorder ... by a long shot\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 23, 2016, A.T. \"presented\" a tort claim to the District. (1st MSJ at 7; 1st Resp. at 14; Leitch Decl. \u00b6 16, Ex. N);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RCW 4.96.020(2) (\"A claim is deemed presented when the claim form is delivered in person or is received\" by the entity's designated agent\"). On September 30, 2016, A.T. filed her first complaint in the present case, asserting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims against Mr. Verver and the District, and Title IX claims against the Everett School District only. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt. # 1).) A.T. alleges that Mr. Verver sexually \"groomed\" and assaulted her in violation of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. (SAC \u00b6 25.) A.T. further alleges that the District acted deliberately indifferent to her wellbeing, safety, and educational environment in violation of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.)

Thus, Dr. Kliman's assessment that \"PTSD is not considered an anxiety disorder,\" that PTSD is \"clearly differentiated\" from depression, and that PTSD is not the same as \"adjustment reaction disorder ... by a long shot\" (Kliman Depo. at 86), does not compel a finding that A.T. suffered a \"different injury\" for the purposes of RCW 4.16.340(1)(c),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carollo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=240%20P.3d%201172\">\n    240 P.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A.T. saw a second counselor at the end of September 2012, this time at Cambridge, to seek help after \"getting out of a harmful relationship,\" that she \"only just recently (like, for two months) allowed [herself] to think about this relationship as harmful.\" (Cambridge Counseling at 146.) A.T. additionally told the Cambridge counselor that her relationship with Mr. Verver \"shuts [her] down fairly often,\" causing her to not get out of bed or eat for several days at a time.

Therefore, the court finds that A.T.'s state law negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims are untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    A.T.'s Federal Claims are Untimely\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although state law \"determines the length of the limitations period, federal law determines when a civil rights claim accrues.\"\n   <em>\n    Lukovsky v.

Under the federal common law discovery rule, the limitations period for A.T.'s section 1983 and Title IX claims begin to accrue \"when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5893561\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1044/#p1048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties do not dispute that the federal common law discovery rule applies to A.T.'s federal civil rights claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verver MSJ at 8; 1st Resp. at 25; 1st Reply at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the court finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that, by May 2013, A.T. knew or had reason to know of the injury which is the basis of her federal claims.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.D.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lukovsky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5893561\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1044/#p1048\">\n    535 F.3d at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, A.T.'s section 1983 and Title IX claims are also untimely. A.T., however, makes an additional argument regarding her federal claims' accrual that the court now addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On August 9, 2017, A.T. deposed Sarah Kelsey, a teacher at Cascade High School when A.T. attended school there. (Cochran Decl. \u00b6 7, Ex. F at 113.) Ms. Kelsey testified that she was aware that another teacher saw Mr. Verver \"caressing\" A.T.'s face in an \"oddly intimate\" way on the couch in Mr. Verver's classroom in the early 2000s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Kelsey reported this incident to then Principal James Dean at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Kelsey, however, did not know if Mr. Dean ever acted on her report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.T. subsequently deposed Mr. Dean on November 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cochran Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. G.) In that deposition, Mr. Dean testified that he did not remember Ms. Kelsey telling him about the caressing incident, nor does he remember ever investigating Mr. Verver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Based on this information, A.T. argues that she only learned about the District's knowledge of Mr. Verver's abuse-and therefore its deliberate indifference-after deposing Ms. Kelsey and Mr. Dean. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1st Resp. at 29);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reese v. Jefferson Sch. Dist. No. 14J\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453227\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/208/736/#p739\">\n    208 F.3d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding a school district liable for damages under Title IX \"only where it has 'actual knowledge' of the abuse\");\n   <em>\n    Duvall v. Cty. of Kitsap,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499275\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1124/#p1139\">\n    260 F.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (9th Cir. 2001) (\"Deliberate indifference requires both knowledge that harm to a federal protected right is substantially likely, and a failure to act upon that ... likelihood.\"). A.T. appears to argue that the new information she learned from Ms. Kelsey and Mr. Dean should somehow restart the limitations period for her federal claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1st Resp. at 29.) To the extent that is A.T.'s argument, it is not correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The federal discovery rule focuses on \"when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   which is the basis of the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Lukovsky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5893561\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1044/#p1048\">\n    535 F.3d at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The rule does not, as A.T. suggests, focus on when the plaintiff learns that the \"injury constitutes a legal wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5893561\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1044/#p1048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1049 (citing\n   <em>\n    Oshiver v.

In other words, A.T.'s federal claims began to accrue when she knew or had reason to know of the injury that forms the basis of her federal claims, not when A.T. learned an additional fact about the District's alleged knowledge that would bolster her claims. Moreover, although A.T. may have found support for aspects of her claims through the discovery process, uncovering better evidence does not restart the statute of limitations for an already pleaded claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wasco Prods., Inc. v. Southwall Techs., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936219\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/989/#p991\">\n    435 F.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991 (9th Cir. 2006) (\"[F]ederal courts have repeatedly held that plaintiffs seeking to toll the statute of limitations on various grounds must have included the allegation in their pleadings; this rule applies even where the tolling argument is raised in opposition to summary judgment.\") (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Thus, the court finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that A.T. knew or had reason to know of the injury which forms the basis of her federal claims by May 2013. May 2013 is more than three years before A.T. filed her federal claims on September 30, 2016. A.T.'s federal claims are therefore untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court GRANTS the District's first motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 57) and GRANTS Mr. Verver's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 61). The court also DENIES the District's second motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 59) as moot. Accordingly, the court dismisses this case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The court previously granted A.T. permission to proceed under a pseudonym.

(Dkt. # 58) \u00b6\u00b6 6, 14, Ex. D at 19, Ex. L at 3.)
