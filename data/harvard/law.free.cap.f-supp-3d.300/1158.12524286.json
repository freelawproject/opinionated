North American seeks summary judgment on Lynch's claims, and its counterclaim for declaratory relief on the grounds that the life insurance policy it had issued was properly terminated. The Court conducted a hearing on the motions on December 12, 2017. After hearing oral argument, reviewing the parties' memoranda, and researching relevant authorities, the Court will deny North American's motion for summary judgment, and sustain, in part, Lynch's evidentiary objection to the affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kathleen Kelly Sharpe (the \"Insured\") applied for a $750,000 life insurance policy on or around September 13, 1989, listing Kristi Lynch, the Insured's stepdaughter, as owner and beneficiary. John Cookman, then a broker at MCN Insurance Brokers, Inc., helped the Insured complete the application. Cookman submitted the application to CPS Insurance Services, that in turn submitted the application to North American. A flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy, policy number LW00006377, was issued to Lynch, on or around November 7, 1989 (the \"Policy\"). The Policy has a Specified Amount of $750,000 and, per the Application, names Lynch as owner and beneficiary. The Policy's planned periodic premium was $9,625 annually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Policy's terms provide that, after November 7, 2004, the Policy will lapse when the surrender value is insufficient to cover the next monthly deduction. Upon a lapse, the Policy will enter a 61-day grace period during which the owner may make a premium payment to keep the Policy in force and avoid termination. The Policy further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Notice of the premium required to keep the policy in force is mailed to your last known address at least 30 days prior to termination. Such premium is due on such Monthly Anniversary Day and if not paid within the grace period, all coverage under this policy terminates without value at the end of the 61 day period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lynch's mailing address has been the same post office box in Picabo, Idaho, since late 2011. Lynch made regular premium payments from November 1989 to November 2006, but did not make any payments from December 2006 to December 2009. Lynch also tendered a partial surrender of $14,716 on or around September 24, 2009, to receive a check in that amount. The Policy then entered a grace period on December 7, 2009, and North American sent Lynch a grace notice informing her she had to remit either the planned periodic premium or at least $626.88 to prevent the Policy from terminating. The grace notice also informed Lynch that sending the $626.88 \"minimum payment will provide coverage for this month only and will not prevent your policy from entering the 61 day grace period again next month, perhaps for a different amount. This minimum payment will not provide for the planned long term performance of your policy.\" The grace notice further instructed Lynch to contact North American if she had questions about her premiums or the Policy's performance. Lynch did not contact North American but instead made the minimum $626.88 payment on or around January 5, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lynch did call North American on at least two occasions. On September 2, 2010, she called North American inquiring about a personal \"note\" she found that discussed premium payments. Lynch also called North American on August 12, 2011, because she had misscheduled a payment and was afraid the policy had lapsed. The North American representative suggested that Lynch set up automatic payments. Although North American sent Lynch paperwork to do so, Lynch did not follow\n   through on the suggestion. Lynch instead continued to make either a minimum payment or a payment in an amount not indicated in the Policy or any grace notice, causing the Policy to enter a grace period on numerous occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   North American sent Lynch 36 grace notices between December of 2009 and May of 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each grace notice contained the same or similar information as the December 7, 2009 grace notice. The Policy entered another grace period on June 7, 2015, because the monthly deduction exceeded the Policy's surrender value. North American asserts it mailed a grace notice to Lynch on June 8, 2015, following its standard mail room procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   John Robbins, Associate Vice President for Life and Variable Services for North American's parent company, Sammons Financial Group Member Companies, submitted an affidavit describing North American's mail room procedures. As Associate Vice President, Robbins oversees the Policy Billing and Accounting Team. The Policy Billing and Accounting Team is responsible for all billing procedures and matters, including the generating, issuing, and mailing of grace notices and termination of policies. Accordingly, Robbins testified he has \"firsthand knowledge of the policies, procedures, and processes for generating, issuing, and mailing grace notices North American had in effect before, during, and after June of 2015.\" Robbins Aff. \u00b6 4. (Dkt. 50 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his affidavit, Robbins explains that, \"[p]er North American's policies and procedures, June 7, 2015, was a Sunday so North American's computer system (\"LifeComm\") reviewed the Policy on June 8, 2015, and determined the Policy had entered a grace period.\" Robbins Aff. \u00b6 19. Robbins explained that LifeComm then printed three grace notices-the Owner Grace Notice to send to Lynch (the \"Lynch Grace Notice\"), the Agent Grace Notice to send to CPS Insurance Services, Inc. (the \"CPS Grace Notice\"), and the File Copy Grace Notice for North American to retain (collectively, the \"Grace Notices\")-in the computer room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The addresses of record for Lynch and CPS Insurance Services at the time were the post office box in Picabo, Idaho, and 4400 MacArthur Blvd 8th Floor, Newport Beach, CA 92660, respectively. The computer room routed all grace notices printed on June 8, 2015, including the Grace Notices, to Policy Billing and Accounting, which sorted the grace notices and delivered them to the Advanced Processing Support team (\"APS\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Robbins indicated the grace notices would have then been placed in the outgoing mail bin, which the mail room picked up and delivered to North American's mailing vendor. North American's mailing vendor next would have used a folding machine to place the grace notices in envelopes, with the addresses printed on the grace notices visible through the envelope's window. The envelopes containing the Lynch and CPS Grace Notices were then run through a postage reader for postage and sent out as first class mail on June 9, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Neither the Lynch nor CPS Grace Notices were returned as undeliverable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. CPS Insurance Services received the CPS Grace Notice. The June 8, 2015 Grace\n   Notice informed Lynch (and CPS) that a $2,000 premium payment was received on May 19, 2015, but that a $935.18 \"minimum additional premium\" was required by August 7, 2015, to avoid termination of coverage. The grace notice also stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Payment of the minimum additional premium reflected above to avoid termination of coverage will not prevent the Policy from entering another grace period on its next monthly deduction day. Also, please note that payment of any regularly scheduled planned premiums for which you may receive premium notices or which may be automatically paid from your bank account may no longer be sufficient to prevent your coverage from terminating. We strongly encourage you to contact your agent or our office at (877) 872-0757 to obtain additional information to assist you in determining a planned premium payment amount and schedule that reflects your current goals for the Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During their depositions, both Kristi Lynch and her husband, Philip Lynch, testified they did not know whether the June 8, 2015 Grace Notice was delivered to their post office box. More specifically, Kristi Lynch testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. So going back to this big packet of grace notices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. From May 7th, if you could turn the page to June 8, 2015. So the second to last page\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A.

Is it possible that the grace notice was delivered to your PO Box but somehow Phil missed it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A.

All right. So the next, we'll say, four documents: February 9, 2015; March 9, 2015; May 7, 2015; and June 8, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A.

For the whole time frame?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A. Yes. Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. Do you know if these documents were delivered to your mailing address at the time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. So that's true for the February, March, May and June 2015?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. Yes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Philip Lynch Depo. at 107:7-108:3, Dkt. 53 at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In her affidavit, Kristi Lynch explained that, to date, she has paid approximately $182,631.21 in premiums on the Policy. She testified she never received the June 8, 2015 Grace Notice letter stating an additional $935.18 was required on or before August 7, 2015, to prevent termination of coverage under the Policy. In response to previous letters from North American, Lynch had sent three checks of $2,000.00 each in March, April, and May of 2015, under her belief premiums were approximately $1,000.00 per month, and that her payments covered six months of premium payments. Lynch Aff. \u00b6 3. (Dkt. 62 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Similarly, Phil Lynch, who regularly picks up the couples' mail, testified he never picked up or saw a copy of the June 8, 2015 Grace Notice in their post office box, and never saw one in the house where they usually kept the mail. No one else was responsible for picking up their mail during this time period. Lynch Aff. \u00b6 5. (Dkt. 63 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Lynch did not submit a premium payment to North American on or before August 7, 2015, so coverage under the Policy terminated effective August 8, 2015. Lynch received a letter dated August 11, 2015, terminating the Policy without further notice. Lynch attempted to reinstate the Policy, sending a check for $20,343.96 in advance premium payments, which North American refused. Instead, North American offered to reinstate the Policy subject to medical underwriting, but Lynch rejected the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Lynch claims that mis-deliveries and failed deliveries of mail at their rural post office were not uncommon. North American did not send the June 8, 2015 Grace Notice by certified mail. North American, on the other hand, claims Lynch never told North American she had difficulty receiving mail prior to the Policy termination and did not designate a Secondary Addressee to receive grace notices or other correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Before considering the motion for summary judgment, the Court will address Lynch's motion to strike portions of the Affidavit of John Robbins. (Dkt. 50, 64.) Specifically, Lynch argues Robbins's testimony stating unequivocally that LifeComm (the computer system) printed three grace notices (the Lynch Grace Notice, the CPS Grace Notice and the File Copy Notice); routed all three grace notices to Policy Billing and Accounting, which sorted them and delivered them to APS; and the Lynch and CPS Grace Notices were sent out in the mail on June 9, 2015, should be stricken because Robbins lacks first-hand knowledge. At best, Lynch argues Robbins can establish the general procedures for issuing and mailing grace notices, but Robbins does not possess actual knowledge whether the three grace notices at issue were printed and mailed consistent with his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In response, North American argues Robbins's affidavit detailing the company's policies and procedures is admissible to\n   show the grace notices were mailed. North American cites several authorities which it contends support its argument that evidence of the custom and business practices of the company is proper proof of notice, and that receipt (by CPS) of the notice can constitute evidence the company's practices were followed.\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank of Independence v. Mid-Century Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926395\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/559/50/\">\n    559 S.W.2d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. Ct. App. 1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Only admissible evidence may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Orr v. Bank of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446550\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/764/#p773\">\n    285 F.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773 (9th Cir. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. P. 56(c), \"an affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\" Federal Rule of Evidence 602 states, \"[a] witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness's own testimony.\" Federal Rule of Evidence 406 allows introduction of evidence of an organization's routine practice, instructing that the evidence \"may be admitted to prove that on a particular occasion the ... organization acted in accordance with the habit or routine practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Based upon these rules, it is clear Robbins' testimony is admissible insofar as he describes the customary mailing process he is aware North American used for preparing and mailing grace notices in 2015. However, there is no direct evidence establishing the June 8, 2015 Grace Notices were prepared and mailed using the same process. At best, the Court concludes Robbins's testimony establishes the company's general mailing procedures, and based upon customary practice, he assumes the Grace Notices were prepared and mailed using the same process. However, there were several steps in the mailing process, which consisted of the computer recognizing the deadline had lapsed, and then printing, sorting, delivering, folding, and finally, stuffing envelopes and affixing postage by various individuals or machines. And it was not just the Lynch policy notices that were subject to this process; presumably, there were hundreds of similar notices. But, other than the Grace Notice received by CPS and North American's file copy the Robbins affidavit contains no computer logs, vendor receipts, or other similar records to confirm the customary process was actually followed on this one occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Consequently, the portions of the Affidavit of John Robbins where he asserts that the June 8, 2015 Grace Notices were actually prepared and mailed according to customary mailing procedures are stricken and these statements will not be considered by the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Robbins' Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 26, and 31 (Dkt. 50.) However, the testimony is properly considered to establish the usual and customary mailing practice followed by North American. The evidentiary objection will therefore be sustained in part, as the testimony will not be entirely disregarded. The Court will discuss the effect of its evidentiary ruling in more detail in the context of its analysis pertinent to the motion for summary judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In that case, the court explained the insurance company's mailing policies and procedures created a \"rebuttable presumption\" that the company mailed notice of its policy exclusions, and the insured's mere denial of receipt of that notice was insufficient to rebut the presumption upon summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"442546\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/13/424/#p425\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the court reviewed whether the insured had received notice of new coverage exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Here, in contrast, the Court is construing a specific policy provision requiring notice to the insured of policy termination. There is no Idaho authority creating a rebuttable presumption under similar facts.

There, the issue was whether copies of ordinances enacted during a board of supervisors meeting were forwarded to the appropriate governing body. The Neighbors challenged the validity of the ordinances on procedural grounds, claiming the ordinances, once adopted, were not properly forwarded to the appropriate governing body and therefore of no effect. During the administrative hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board of East Buffalo Township, the Township offered the testimony of its Township Solicitor, who testified he forwarded copies of the ordinances to the correct department. The Solicitor testified also regarding his customary procedures for mailing correspondence from his office. The board credited the Solicitor's testimony, and voted to dismiss the Neighbors' procedural challenge to enactment of the ordinances based upon insufficient mailing. The trial court reversed the board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Upon appeal, the appellate court held the trial court impermissibly reconsidered the weight to be accorded to the Solicitor's testimony, and invaded the province of the fact finder (the board).\n   <em>\n    Neighbors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8196653\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/856/#p861\">\n    960 A.2d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The insurance company submitted testimony of the custom and business practice in mailing cancellation notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The court, sitting without a jury, found in favor of the insurance company, considering the evidence of custom and business practice, and receipt of the notice by others, as evidence that the practice was followed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926395\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/559/50/\">\n    559 S.W.2d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon appeal, the bank argued consideration of the custom and business practices of the insurer was improper. However, in affirming the judgment of the trial court, the appellate court specifically commented: \"[s]uch evidence was for consideration of the trier of fact in that regard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926395\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/559/50/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the jury will be the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The last case North American cites is\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Toys \"R\" Us\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061795\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1197/#p1201\">\n    527 F.Supp.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1201 (C.D. Cal. 2007). North American argues\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   allows the Court to infer personal knowledge based upon an employee's review of internal documents and records, and that the individual may thereafter testify to acts or conduct he or she did not personally observe. The issue in that case was whether Toys \"R\" Us had properly implemented a software update to comply with the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (\"FACTA\"). In addition to employee affidavits concerning review of internal documents and records, the court had before it testimony from those with personal knowledge concerning the software update that caused the alleged violation under the FACTA. The sole issue upon summary judgment was whether the violation was \"willful.\" In\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , the court held it was proper for the court to consider affidavits describing the internal process for updating Toys \"R\" Us cash registers, given the affiant's job responsibilities included overseeing the software programming and maintenance of defendant's cash registers.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061795\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1197/#p1201\">\n    527 F.Supp.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also had before it deposition testimony, emails, test results, and meeting minutes discussing the software modification process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061795\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1197/#p1201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061795\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1197/#p1201\">\n    at 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast here, there is no information in the Robbins Affidavit indicating he reviewed any records other than the Grace Notices (CPS's and the file copy) when reaching his conclusion that customary practices were followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Synthesizing the conclusions of the above case law, the crucial distinction here is the procedural posture of this case. North American asks the Court to infer, based upon custom and practice, that its custom and practice was followed at each and every point of the mailing process, and the June 8, 2015 Grace Notice was mailed in the customary manner on that occasion. North American asks also that the Court infer North American mailed the grace notice to Lynch based upon CPS's receipt of its copy of the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lynch's testimony, and that of her husband, indicates they received every single grace notice previously mailed to them, as evidenced by their payments to North American to prevent the Policy from lapsing on more than 36 separate occasions. Yet, on this one occasion, Lynch claims she did not receive the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Lynch's testimony is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact. While the testimony regarding North American's custom and practice may be admissible, the inferences to be drawn from that evidence, together\n   with Lynch's testimony of non-receipt, are for the jury to make. Additionally, Lynch would have the opportunity to cross-examine Robbins, and elicit testimony concerning the mailing vendor or other entities responsible for carrying out North American's customary mailing practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Based upon all the authorities the Court considered, the Court finds North American's other arguments-which focus upon delivery and receipt-irrelevant. The issue here is proof of mailing, which the Court finds is sufficiently disputed upon summary judgment by Lynch's claim of non-receipt of the June 8, 2015 Grace Notice, and her receipt of and response to 36 other grace notices at the same postal address. It is the province of the jury to weigh the evidence and determine if North American establishes proof of mailing of the June 8, 2015 Grace Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     Constructive Notice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   North American alternatively argues Lynch had constructive notice that the Policy had lapsed, based upon the 36 grace notices mailed and received prior to June of 2015, as well as two telephone conversations in 2010 and 2011. However, the Policy's language is unambiguous that notice of termination must be mailed. Nothing in the Policy suggests otherwise, and North American has not presented sufficient authority applicable in the context of insurance contracts supporting its reliance upon constructive notice when termination of an insurance policy is at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v.
