ENGELMAYER, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The lead plaintiff in this putative class action claims that Xerox Corporation (\"Xerox\") violated federal securities laws by dissembling about the challenges it faced as it struggled to make profitable a new business venture. Xerox had purchased Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (\"ACS\") in 2010, and then sought to develop ACS's Medicaid Management Information System, known as Health Enterprise, into a platform Xerox could profitably market to state governments. The putative plaintiff class consists of purchasers of Xerox's common stock between April 23, 2012 through October 27, 2015 (the \"Class Period\"). Lead plaintiff the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System (\"APERS\") alleges that Xerox falsely claimed that it had a replicable, \"plug-and-play\" \"platform\" that could be readily reused by Xerox's state clients; that implementation of the Health Enterprise system was \"going well\"; and that implementation of Health Enterprise was profitable. APERS alleges that Xerox's share price was artificially inflated for more than three-and-a-half years by these alleged falsehoods and that, when Xerox eventually revealed, over several disclosures, that implementation of Health Enterprise was going badly, Xerox's share price dropped from a high of $14.32 to $9.29 on the last day of the Class Period. APERS sues Xerox as well as corporate officers Ursula M. Burns, Luca Maestri, Kathryn A. Mikells, Lynn R. Blodgett, Robert Zapfel, David H. Bywater, and Mary Scanlon (the \"individual defendants,\" and, with Xerox, the \"defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Xerox and all individual defendants except Zapfel have filed a joint motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Zapfel has separately moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court grants both motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Xerox Buys ACS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In February 2010, Xerox acquired ACS for $6.4 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 59. ACS specialized in business-process outsourcing. This entailed providing for clients various back-office services, including call centers, claims processing, and information technology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Chief among ACS's customers were government clients, from which ACS generated approximately 40 percent of its revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 62. ACS provided a range of services to such clients, including-relevant here-developing, designing, and implementing Medicaid Management Information Systems (\"MMIS\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. As described by APERS, an MMIS is a computer system that manages the processing of payments to healthcare providers, the storing of beneficiary information, and all other aspects of a state's Medicaid program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. States are required by law to have such a system,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62; these allow states to process payments to healthcare providers participating in the state Medicaid program,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. The federal government provides 90 percent of the financing for the design and development of a state's MMIS and 75 percent of the financing for its operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ACS offered to state governments a proprietary software product-known as Health Enterprise-that served as a replacement for states' existing MMISs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 69. Health Enterprise was intended to perform four key functions for state governments: (1) benefit plan administration, (2) financial management, (3) information storage and retrieval, and (4) reporting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The acquisition of ACS helped transform Xerox-historically a manufacturer and distributor of photocopiers and other hardware-into a service business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Of Xerox's two primary business segments-Document Technology, home to the company's hardware business, and Services-the service segment became, after the acquisition of ACS, the largest segment in the company, accounting for between 52 and 56 percent of total revenue per year during the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Within the Services segment, Xerox offered three distinct services (1) business process outsourcing, (2) information technology outsourcing, and (3) document outsourcing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Business process outsourcing-which represented a significant majority of the total Services revenue-included Xerox's \"Government Healthcare Solutions\" offering.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Implementation Issues in Six States\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the time of Xerox's acquisition of ACS, ACS had contracted to provide its Health Enterprise software to New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Alaska.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 70. Pursuant to its acquisition of ACS, Xerox took control of these contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Plaintiffs allege that ACS, and from 2012 forward Xerox, experienced delays and cost overruns as they performed these contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In late 2005, ACS contracted with New Hampshire to provide the state a new MMIS system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. ACS initially projected that the MMIS would be implemented by 2008; the system was completed (after Xerox had acquired ACS) in April 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. ACS had proposed that implementation of the New Hampshire MMIS would cost $60 million; the actual cost exceeded $117 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Also in late 2005, ACS contracted with North Dakota to implement the state's MMIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. The North Dakota MMIS was scheduled to be completed by July 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. ACS-and later Xerox-missed that deadline,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-83; Xerox instead completed the North Dakota MMIS in October 2015,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. This six-year delay was attributable to Xerox's efforts to conform the computer code from the New Hampshire MMIS for use in North Dakota.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. The cost of implementing the North Dakota MMIS increased from $37 million, as projected in June 2006, to $65 million as of its 2015 completion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In October 2007, ACS contracted with Alaska to replace the state's MMIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. Implementation of that MMIS, too, suffered from delays and cost overruns. Implementation was scheduled to conclude on June 1, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the MMIS first went \"Live\" on October 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. Through 2014, Xerox continued to address ongoing defects in the MMIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97-100. The cost of implementation grew from an original estimate of $32 million to a final cost of approximately $146 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In March 2010-shortly after acquiring ACS in February 2010-Xerox was awarded a $1.7 billion contract to implement a MMIS for California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119. The California MMIS Independent Project Oversight Consultant (IPOC)-a third-party observer-issued several reports detailing Xerox's progress on the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121-31. These described a series of delays\n   .\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, as of May 2015, California had not paid Xerox for its work on the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131. In April 2016, California terminated its contract with Xerox.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134. Xerox and California reached a settlement of their claims against each other, under which Xerox was required to pay the state $123 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In April 2012, Xerox was awarded a contract to implement a MMIS for Montana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. That process, too, was marked by delays. The MMIS was originally scheduled to be implemented by February 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But throughout 2013 and 2014, Xerox missed milestones and Montana refused to make interim milestone payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-112. On July 18, 2014, Xerox and Montana renegotiated their contract and set a May 2017 completion deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113. Through 2015, Xerox continued to miss interim milestone deadlines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-15. Xerox did not complete implementation of the Montana MMIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, in April 2015, Xerox was awarded a $564 million contract to implement a MMIS for New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138. Xerox never completed the New York MMIS project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Xerox Spins Off Business Process Outsourcing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 26, 2015, at the conclusion of the Class Period, Xerox announced that it would review its portfolio of businesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 286. Following that review, on January 29, 2016, Xerox announced that it would separate the company into two separate businesses: a business-process outsourcing company and another company focused on document technology and document outsourcing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 8, 2016, Xerox announced that it would effect this reorganization by spinning off its business-process outsourcing services into a new company to be called Conduent Incorporated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 287. On January 3, 2017, Xerox announced that it had completed that spin-off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 288.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Alleged Misstatements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While Xerox was struggling to implement Health Enterprise in the six states in which it had been awarded MMIS contracts, APERS alleges, Xerox officers made materially false or misleading statements about the company's progress. APERS groups these statements into three categories: (1) that Xerox had a platform that was transferrable, reusable, replicable, and scalable, and possessed plug-and-play characteristics (the \"Platform Statements\"); (2) that implementation of Health Enterprise was successful and/or going well (the \"Success Statements\"); and (3) that implementation of Health Enterprise had or would become profitable, and that profitability would be achieved because of the low-cost nature of the Health Enterprise platform (the \"Profitability Statements\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141. The Court summarizes these statements below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Platform Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, APERS alleges that Xerox officers made a series of statements during the Class Period that falsely or misleadingly described Health Enterprise as a \"platform.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Beginning at the start of the Class Period, Xerox officers described the MMIS application as a \"platform\" and extolled the benefits the company expected to enjoy from that platform.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 172, Appendix Nos. 3, 4; Am. Compl. \u00b6 143. In particular, Xerox officers predicted that the company would be able to \"reuse\" the MMIS platform, lowering Xerox's costs on future contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 145, 175; Appendix No. 7;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 146, 184 (alteration omitted); Appendix Nos. 13, 14 (\"Platforms across the board help us to have repeatable solutions.\"). Company officers continued to describe Health Enterprise as a platform and to attribute Xerox's competitive advantage to that platform throughout 2013 and into 2014.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 190, 191, 194; Appendix Nos. 23, 24, 25, 27. Xerox officers also explained to investors and analysts that, as Xerox implemented Health Enterprise on future contracts, the company would be able to \"modify for every engagement a little bit of the system but not as big a modification as before,\" resulting in efficiencies. Am. Compl. \u00b6 206;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appendix Nos. 40, 41, 42;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6 203; Appendix Nos. 35, 36; Am.

Success Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, APERS alleges that, during the Class Period, Xerox officers made several false or misleading statements about the company's success in implementing Health Enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Throughout the Class Period, Xerox officers discussed the progress the company was making in implementing Health Enterprise for its several state clients. At times, Xerox officers spoke generally about the company's success. For example, in describing Xerox's fourth quarter 2013 results, Burns said that the company was \"making progress\" on \"government healthcare\" and was \"stabilizing more and more.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 213; Appendix Nos. 45, 46;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am.

Beginning in May 2012, Xerox officers described the implementation of Health Enterprise in California as going \"well,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 181; Appendix No. 10 (\"We're happy the State of California implementation has gone very well.\"), and continued to do so through 2013 and 2014,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am.

Compl. \u00b6 219; Appendix No. 50 (\"California is going fairly well, and MMIS is actually going pretty well and we're now at the point where we're starting to lean out our implementation on California and drive it to increased profitability.\"). Xerox officers made similar statements about Alaska, Am. Compl. \u00b6 202; Appendix No. 32, and New Hampshire,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am.

Profitability Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third and finally, APERS alleges, Xerox officers made several false or misleading statements about the present-day profitability of Health Enterprise and the company's expectations for its future profitability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   During the Class Period, Xerox officers made a series of statements predicting that the company's margins on implementation of Health Enterprise would improve over time, leading to increased profitability for the company as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., Am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 162; Appendix No. 1; Am. Compl. \u00b6 171; Appendix No. 2 (\"[W]e're shifting a lot of our work to platforms, our new MMIS platform that was a significant investment is the kind of thing that will help drive higher margins.\"). The company also represented that implementation of Health Enterprise would entail high up-front costs, followed by a period of lower costs and increased profitability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 174; Appendix No. 5 (\"[A] lot of the start-up cost, the ramp being of-the investment in platforms that we made on some of the services business have already taken place and now we're getting to a much more normalized level of margins on a lot of these new contracts.\");\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am.

Compl. \u00b6 205; Appendix No. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   During the Class Period, Xerox officers also represented that the profitability of the company's Health Enterprise contracts was currently improving. For example, on an April 23, 2013, conference call with analysts and investors to discuss the company's financial results from the first quarter of 2013, Burns said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   State government we are seeing some good news particularly in healthcare. We have a strong position as you know in MMIS around the United States, and California is our big contract; New Hampshire just went live. We're doing well there .... So healthcare is a big segment for us. We do well there. And our profitability is improving in that segment actually very, very well. So I'm bullish about healthcare[,] government healthcare services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 198; Appendix Nos. 28, 29. Later, in 2014, Burns added that Xerox had achieved \"flat profitability\" on its California contract and expected, going forward, \"growing profitability in a very predictable kind of a standard way.\" Am.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court begins with Xerox's motion to dismiss. Xerox argues that, for two reasons, APERS' Amended Complaint fails to state a Section 10(b) claim: First, it fails to allege any actionable misstatements because none of the statements at issue was false or misleading; and second, it fails to plead loss causation. And, because the Amended Complaint fails to state a 10(b) claim, Xerox argues, APERS' derivative Section 20(a) claim must also be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court's analysis begins-and ends-with Xerox's first argument. Xerox argues that the statements in each of the three categories at issue (Platform Statements, Success Statements, and Profitability Statements) are not actionably false or misleading, both because the Amended Complaint does not plead falsity with the required particularity, and because the statements are non-actionable puffery. For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees the challenged statements are not actionable. This holding obviates the need to address Xerox's alternative argument based on the pleadings as to loss causation, and Zapfel's arguments particular to himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court begins by eliminating certain statements whose theory of falsity the Amended Complaint does not explain or which qualify as puffery. The Court then analyzes, category by category, the remaining statements at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statements Lacking Particularized Allegations of Falsity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   As to certain statements, APERS alleges only conclusorily, and with far from the required particularity, how the given statement was false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For example, APERS faults Blodgett's statement at the Barclays Capital Global Technology, Media, and Telecommunications Conference on May 23, 2012, that \"the sole driver of margin decline had to do with the significant set up in bookings and in growth rates\" and that this growth rate \"was driven almost exclusively by the State of California and by a couple of other major contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Statements Representing That Xerox Had a Platform\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Statements that merely asserted, without more, that Xerox had a platform were not misleading for a simple reason: Health Enterprise was a \"platform.\" For example, at Xerox's November 13, 2012 annual investor conference, Burns stated, \"We have [a] platform we call Enterprise. Enterprise is the newest Medicaid platform.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 185; Appendix No. 15.

Compl. \u00b6 212; Appendix. No. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Statements of this kind were not misleading because Health Enterprise was justifiably termed a \"platform.\" As Xerox notes, a \"platform\" is simply computer architecture upon which other applications may run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Br. at 10-11. But those criticisms went to the\n   <em>\n    quality\n   </em>\n   of Xerox's platform, not to its existence. Relevant too, Xerox's own descriptions of its product, reviewed in the next section, did not ever define \"platform\" in such a way as to exclude Health Enterprise from that definition.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v.

There, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   I think we win [contracts] because we have great technology. People look at our platforms and they realize that this stuff's pretty complicated.

Compl. \u00b6 193; Appendix No. 26. But those statements, to the extent they described Health Enterprises as a platform, were not misstatements, and to the extent they expressed enthusiasm for that platform, were non-actionable puffery.

Statements Describing the Platform\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   During the Class Period, Xerox officers also made statements describing the Health Enterprise platform's features or functionality.

The Court, therefore, considers the statements as made, not APERS's repeated claim in its brief that Xerox falsely held out Health Enterprise as a \"platform that was transferrable, reusable, replicable, and scalable, and possessed plug-and-play characteristics.\" Although Xerox officers represented Health Enterprise using some of those terms, APERS does not point to any statement in which they used that phrase in its entirety (or anything like it).

Quite the contrary: Plaintiffs do not dispute that Health Enterprise existed and that it was intended to be used for the purpose Xerox described. Nor do plaintiffs anywhere contend that Xerox's Health Enterprise was incapable of being \"reused.\" On the facts pled, Health Enterprise clearly was capable of being reused, albeit (as Xerox did not hide) with modifications customized for the needs to the particular state.

Those statements were forward-looking-they described Xerox's expectations as to how implementation of Health Enterprise would benefit the company in the future-and were accompanied by meaningful cautionary language.

APERS, notably, does not allege that Xerox failed to disclose the rupture of any state contract or any such decisive event. And it cannot so allege: as pled, there was no repudiation of these contracts by any of Xerox's state clients until California did so in April 2016, some six months after the Class Period ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   APERS instead faults Xerox for not disclosing \"the litany of current adverse facts known\" to it. Pl. Br. at 14. But, as Judge McMahon's explanation of why Hi-Crush had not had a duty to disclose its strained relationship with its contract partner reflects, Xerox here did not have a duty to disclose the implementation challenges it was confronting.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Express Scripts Holding Co.

Profitability Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The third category of challenged statements, Xerox's Profitability Statements, are also all non-actionable. For the most part, Xerox officers in the Class Period described the company's expectations as to the\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   profitability of Health Enterprise. These statements were forward looking and, as discussed below, fall within the PSLRA's safe harbor.

These are non-actionable for a separate reason: As pled, they were not misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Forward Looking Statements About Profitability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   On several occasions, Xerox officers made statements articulating the expectation that Health Enterprise in general, particular state contracts, or the company's Service business would become profitable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   These forward-looking statements, however, are clearly non-actionable, as they were accompanied by meaningful cautionary language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Among the statements predicting that the company would enjoy improved margins or improved profitability in the later years of its MMIS contracts are the following.

And Xerox accompanied each with meaningful cautionary language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   These statements are not, therefore, actionable under Section 10(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Statements About Xerox's Current Financial Status\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Other statements in this category concerned Xerox's current financial status. These, however, are non-actionable because, as pled, they were neither false nor misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   First, on an April 23, 2012, conference call, Burns said, \"[a]nd our profitability is improving in th[e healthcare] segment actually very, very well. So I'm bullish about healthcare, government healthcare services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 198; Appendix No. 29. Burns thus represented that Xerox's profitability was improving. And because her statement articulated facts about a verifiable metric of significance to investors-the current state of Health Enterprise's profitability-it is, in theory, a viable target for a claim of falsity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Burns's statement, however, is not adequately pled as false or misleading. APERS bases its claim of falsity on the allegation that Xerox's profitability in\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   was not then improving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 200. But Burns's statement was not limited to California. Her statement instead was that the profitability of the company's healthcare segment as\n   <em>\n    a whole\n   </em>\n   was improving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 198 (\"Our profitability is improving\n   <em>\n    in that segment\n   </em>\n   actually very, very well.\"). And the Amended Complaint does not allege why, factually, that statement was false. On the contrary, on the same call, Burns gave a detailed summary of the company's Q1 2013 results. She explained that \"services\" revenue had increased 4%, that 60% of Services revenue came from Business Process Outsourcing, and that that segment was \"benefitting from strong growth in transactional processing and state government services.\" Atkinson Decl., Ex. 21 at 3-4. Those allegations provide data support for Burns's statements, and the Amended Complaint does not plead any facts that call this data into question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Second, on July 25, 2014, Xerox held a conference call to discuss its Q2 2014 results. Am. Compl. \u00b6 226. On that call, Burns again commented on implementation in California. She stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   And if you look at some of the contracts that are more mature, moving towards more maturity, California for example, we have been able to literally move that contract from investment phase to flat profitability, now to looking for growing profitability in a very predictable kind of a standard way. It took a little bit longer, but on a go-forward basis, California is going to be beautiful and we expect as we implement New York to be beautiful as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 227; Appendix No. 53. Much of that statement, including the \"beautiful\" future that Burns anticipated for the company's contracts in California and New York, is classic puffery. APERS, however, faults Burns for claiming that Xerox had \"been able to literally\" convert the California MMIS contract \"from investment phase to flat profitability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   That statement provides a viable basis for a Section 10(b) claim, insofar as it is not puffery, opinion, or forward-looking. It makes a verifiable claim about a financial metric: whether the California contract was then in the \"investment\" phase-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   losing money in anticipation of future earnings-or whether it had achieved \"flat profitability,\" presumably meaning it was no longer losing money. Burns represented the latter. APERS faults this statement, noting that Xerox had yet to receive any revenue on the California contract at the time Burns spoke. Xerox counters that this statement was not false or misleading. As Xerox explains, it was authorized, under applicable accounting rules, to recognize revenue based on the percentage of the contract that it had completed, without regard to whether the company had yet actually received any cash from its customer. It therefore could fairly claim to have moved beyond the \"investment phase,\" and, as a result of its recognition of revenue, its financial statements accordingly were consistent with \"flat profitability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply Br. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court holds with Xerox on this point, too. Burns's statement to the effect that Xerox had moved beyond the \"investment phase\" to \"flat profitability\" did not\n   embed any other factual representations. Burns did not, for example, represent that the company was then taking in cash receipts. Nor did she state that the company's cash flow on the project was positive or flat. And APERS does not allege any concrete manner in which Burns's statement was factually false. To be sure, Burns's colloquial use of the somewhat indistinct terms \"investment phase\" and \"flat profitability\" left room for interpretation. Different listeners might make different assumptions about what precisely those phrases connoted. But an indistinct statement does not inherently constitute a false or misleading statement. And APERS does not plead facts calling into question Xerox's proposition that, under the accounting rules, it was entitled to recognize revenue on the California contract at that juncture. Nor does APERS challenge Xerox's financial statements or claim that these were inconsistent with \"flat profitability.\" Indeed, APERS does not challenge any numeric statement or accounting results reported in the company's various 8-K and 10-K filings, including as to revenue recognition. Under these circumstances, there was a factual basis for Burns's statement. That Xerox had reached the point where it was entitled to recognize revenue on the California contract gave Burns a valid factual basis on which to claim to have moved past the \"investment phase\" in connection with that contract, and APERS does not allege facts exposing as false her accompanying claim of \"flat profitability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   For the reasons above, the Court holds that none of the challenged statements in the Amended Complaint satisfies the fundamental requirement of a Section 10(b) claim: that it be false or misleading. Each challenged statement instead was either puffery, a non-actionable statement of opinion, a protected forward-looking statement, or otherwise not factually pled as a false or misleading statement of fact. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim under Section 10(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Loss Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Because the Court holds that the Amended Complaint fails to allege any material misrepresentation or omission by the defendants, the Court has no occasion to reach defendants' alternative argument that the Amended Complaint does not adequately plead loss causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

A reasonable portion of that is not having another big impairment charge, which we had associated with Nevada and which is kind of completely behind us.

A material, forward-looking statement unaccompanied by meaningfully cautionary language may\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    be non-actionable if the plaintiff fails to prove that it was made with actual knowledge of its falsity or misleading nature.

She stated: \"I'm very pleased that we've actually been able to stand up exchanges and MMIS system actually operating, taking customers' calls, et cetera.

While aspects of this statement can be read as forward-looking and/or as statements of opinion, one aspect-Burns's representation that Xerox \"ha[d] done it now\"-was factual and related to present events. But that representation is not actionable because it is not alleged to have been untrue. On the contrary, as APERS admits, as of October 24, 2013, Xerox\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    implemented Health Enterprise, in that the New Hampshire implementation had been completed in April 2013, Am.
