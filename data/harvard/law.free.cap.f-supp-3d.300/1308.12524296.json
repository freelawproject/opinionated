I have carefully reviewed the parties' briefs and attached exhibits, the entire case file, the case law cited by the parties, and the arguments advanced by counsel during the July 13 hearing. The court also has conducted its own legal research.

The Second Claim alleges Defendants violated Plaintiff Tonjes' First Amendment right to freedom of association by taking adverse action against Mr. Tonjes based upon his association \"with former Undersheriff [Monte] Gore regarding their joint belief that Defendants Wegener and Hancock had acted recklessly and inappropriately regarding the Wirth situation, which led to the death of two individuals and serious injuries against two others.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at \u00b6 54.

Mr. Tonjes points to specific provisions of the employee Manual as promising formal processes for demotions and discipline. Policy 309(IV)(A)(4) states that employment is \"at will,\" but it also states that the employee may be dismissed for the reasons set forth in the policies of Section 320-the section that provides formal processes for discipline or corrective action that Defendant Wegener allegedly did not follow. Policy 318(IV)(B) also provided that complaints of rudeness or discourtesy could lead to only limited forms of discipline that did not include demotion, and Plaintiff Tonjes alleges Wegener purported to base his demotion on this type of complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Tonjes' allegations contrast to cases in which the court has dismissed a government employee's claim for lack of a property interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rooker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911906\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/1212/#p1216\">\n    841 F.Supp.2d at 1217-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (employee manual provided an opportunity to be heard before termination, but also specified at-will employment and \"failure to adhere to any provision hereof shall not create any additional rights or remedies\");\n   <em>\n    Jeffers v.

Jun. 19, 2014). Moreover, a pleading alleges facts sufficient to assert a plausible claim under the First Amendment based upon a \"broad array\" of circumstances that include temporal proximity, intervening antagonism or retaliatory animus, inconsistencies in the employer's articulated reason for taking adverse action, or \"any other evidence of record sufficient to support the inference of causality.\"\n   <em>\n    Behne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201689950\">\n    2014 WL 1689950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, Defendants Wegener and Hancock's assert qualified immunity, but particularly since\n   <em>\n    Merrifield\n   </em>\n   , the law in the Tenth Circuit clearly recognizes that public employees retain their First Amendment right to associate for expressing speech on a matter of public concern. A reasonable officer in the Sheriff's Department would know that demoting a deputy, when substantially motivated by retaliation for the deputy's association with another who expressed an opinion on the Wirth incident, would violate the deputy's First Amendment rights. Defendants Wegener and Hancock are free to raise this issue on a broader record, but the court concludes that the second claim for relief withstands challenge under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    C.

To assert a viable deprivation of a liberty interest, Plaintiff must come forward with evidence plausibly demonstrating the Defendants Wegener and the Sheriff's Office made: (1) a statement that impugned Mr. Tonjes' good name, reputation, honor, or integrity; (2) the statement was false or \"gave a false impression;\" (3) the statement was made during the course of termination and foreclosed other employment opportunities; and (4) the statement was publically disclosed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

Defendants contend that Mr. Tonjes' third claim for relief must be dismissed because the Complaint fails to allege facts that would support the first, second, or third elements of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Complaint alleges that on February 29, 2016, Plaintiff Tonjes was told by Sheriff Wegener that he was being demoted three levels because he allegedly had \"yelled\" at Corporal Carrigan and Master Deputy Edward Goodman on some unspecified occasions. Although Plaintiff denied that he had engaged in improper behavior toward either subordinate, Sheriff Wegener \"ignored Sgt. Tonjes' rebuttal\" and told him to report to work the next day as a patrol officer. The Complaint also alleges that Defendant Wegener did not give Plaintiff Tonjes notice of any allegations made against him and did not follow Sheriff Office policies that would have allowed Mr. Tonjes an opportunity to appeal the demotion decision. On that same day, Plaintiff Tonjes resigned after concluding that \"his working conditions had become intolerable and that it was no longer reasonable for him to continue working for the Sheriff's Office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Complaint further asserts that on March 2, 2016, Sheriff Wegener told a Denver news reporter that he had \"made the decision to demote Sgt. Tonjes and that 'it was related to the handling of how\n   the deputies responded [at the Wirth scene].' \" The reporter subsequently announced that \"a Park County Sheriff Sargent was in the process of being demoted and then resigned Monday over the tactics that lead [sic] to the Feb. 24 death of Cpl.

Plaintiff's response brief focuses on Wegener's statement to the reporter as the basis for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In the oral argument, the parties and court discussed several issues with respect to this claim, including whether Plaintiff Tonjes had to allege a literally false statement or if a statement that gives a false impression suffices. In the court's further research after the oral argument, the Tenth Circuit clearly holds the latter.\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265121\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1202/#p1212\">\n    769 F.3d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff Tonjes plausibly alleges that Sheriff Wegener's statement to the reporter gave a false impression that the fatalities and injuries incurred in the Wirth incident were Mr. Tonjes' fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, Defendants are correct that the third element (statement made during the course of termination and foreclosed other employment opportunities) requires foreclosure of other employment opportunities, and Mr. Tonjes does not allege such facts. At oral argument, Mr. Tonjes argued this is not required because (in his view) he alleges the statement occurred in the course of his demotion and constructive discharge. Although in some earlier cases the Tenth Circuit \"phrased th[e] third element disjunctively, it should have been phrased conjunctively.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonald,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265121\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1202/#p1212\">\n    769 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1212 n.3 (collecting cases). The Tenth Circuit has thus made clear that foreclosure of employment opportunities is required, regardless of whether the defamatory statement occurs in the course of demotion or discharge. This is because \"[u]nder the Due Process Clause, public employees have a liberty interest in their reputations, but only in the context of their employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Ut.

Assuming without deciding that the now-dismissed Paragraph 85 can still support the third claim for relief, it is conclusory.

Nor do they dispute that Sheriff Wegener personally executed the demotion of Plaintiff Tonjes and made the alleged statement to the news reporter. Defendants rely on inapposite cases, in which the plaintiff did not sue a municipal entity for the decision of its final policymaker, but rather attempted to argue a county board was responsible for the decisions of the sheriff, a city council was responsible for a police chief's actions, or a sheriff's office was responsible for an officer's actions by deliberate indifference in training or supervision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Isenbart v.
