Hood, Senior U.S. District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case is best summed up by two common expressions: (1) nothing is certain except death and taxes, and (2) better late than never. These age-old sayings contain a wealth of wisdom. But as with all well-known adages, exceptions exist to the general rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant presents a hodgepodge of arguments that he falls within the exceptions. If he does not, then Defendant will have to fork over nearly half a million dollars in purported unpaid income taxes. He argues that the Government has put forward inadmissible evidence, failed to produce the agreement at issue, incorrectly determined the amounted owed, and simply filed this lawsuit too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But the Government wants paid. So the United States has come to this Court seeking\n   to reduce federal tax assessments against Thomas Nugent to judgment. [DE 1]. Nugent agrees he owes the government money. [DE 5, p. 1, \u00b6 6; 17, p. 1 \u00b6 4]. But the parties disagree over how much Nugent should pay. The difference is hundreds of thousands of dollars. The United States has moved for Summary Judgment. [DE 13]. Nugent has also moved for Summary Judgment or, in the alternative, Judgment on the Pleadings. [DE 12]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   All Motions are now fully briefed and ripe for the Court's review. For the reasons stated herein, Nugent's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Judgment on the Pleadings is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . The Government's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts are straightforward. A delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury made an assessment of $109,367 and $61,489 against Nugent on September 11, 2006 for unpaid federal income taxes for 2003 and 2004, respectively. [DE 1, p. 2, \u00b6 5]. In 2008, a delegate also assessed $18,535, $24,760, and $16,066 against Nugent for unpaid taxes for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Internal Revenue Service's (\"IRS\") account transcripts for Nugent indicate that it established an installment agreement on February 12, 2009. [DE 13-3 at 3]. The transcripts further reflect that Nugent made a series of monthly payments until November 19, 2010, when payment was dishonored. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. By July 11, 2011, the account transcripts stated that Nugent was \"[n]o longer in installment agreement status.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government filed this lawsuit on October 5, 2016 to collect the assessments for unpaid federal income taxes made against Nugent for 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. [DE 1]. Nugent filed his Answer, admitting that he has tax liability for 2005, 2006, and 2007. [DE 5]. He asserts, however, that the Government's claim for unpaid taxes for 2003 and 2004 is time-barred. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Because those claims are time-barred, Nugent further insists that the Government's total assessment of $496,499, plus penalties and interest, on October 3, 2016 is incorrect. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On January 17, 2017, the Court held a hearing and set a truncated discovery period. [DE 7, 8]. The parties later filed the instant Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As part of its Motion for Summary Judgment, the Government attached a declaration from Revenue Officer Glenda Granville in addition to Nugent's account transcripts. [DE 13]. Nugent filed Motions to Strike the Granville declaration and the transcripts. Specifically, Nugent argued the transcripts were not properly authenticated and thus inadmissible. [DE 16]. Nugent also argued the transcripts were inadmissible on two theories: (1) under Rule 56(d) because he did not have an opportunity to depose Granville since the Government failed to turn over her information during discovery, and (2) under Rule 56(c)(4) because Granville's statements were not based on personal knowledge. [DE 15]. The Court rejected Nugent's arguments in a September 2017 Memorandum Opinion and Order. [DE 22]. In that Opinion, however, the Court reopened discovery to allow Nugent to depose Granville. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Nugent later waived his right to depose Granville stating there \"is no further need to take the deposition.\" [DE 23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Presently before the Court are the parties' cross Motions for Summary Judgment and Nugent's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. Nugent has asked for Summary Judgment only on the 2003-2004 years because, he argues, the Government filed its lawsuit after the ten-year statute of limitations. The Government argues that an installment agreement with Nugent\n   suspended the statute of limitations for thirty days, which gave the Government until October 11, 2016 to file this lawsuit. As to the 2005-2007 tax years, the Government has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment to which Nugent has responded, and the Government replied. The motions are now ripe for the Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Nugent instead focuses on excluding Granville's declaration and the transcripts, but the Court has already ruled that evidence is admissible. [DE 22]. Nugent also argues that the government's own assessments show it can recover only $230,217 rather than the full $496,499 in the Government's petition. [DE 18, p. 2]. Nugent is correct that the assessments amount to $230,217. But Nugent fails to rebut-or even address-the fact that the Government made the assessments between nine and eleven years ago. [DE 13-1, p. 1]. Over the last decade, while the Government awaited payment, interest and penalties accrued as the account transcripts indicate. That interest and those penalties, when added to the original assessment amounts of $230,217, total $496,499. [DE 13-3]. The general denial, without more, does not rebut the assessments nor raise a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nugent also argues that the IRS sometimes gets assessments wrong, and thus\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   assessments might be wrong. He attaches an affidavit from a former IRS and PricewaterhouseCoopers (\"PWC\") employee who has experience in \"verification of additions to tax calculations as asserted by the Internal Revenue Service.\" [DE 18-1]. The employee, Kathy Gale, states that during her time working for the IRS and PWC she found \"a substantial number of the additions to tax calculations of the IRS are not accurate.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3]. Gale does not claim to have knowledge about Defendant's case-including the records, agreements, and assessments at issue. Instead, Gale makes a blanket statement regarding her experience in different cases while working in a different location. She presents only \"vague and general denials\" of the accuracy of IRS assessments in general, not \"affirmative evidence\" that \"contradicts the Secretary's assessment\" in Nugent's case.\n   <em>\n    Rohner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=634%20Fed.%20Appx.%20495\">\n    634 Fed.Appx. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Beyond his denials and the Gale affidavit, Nugent does nothing to rebut or refute the Government's assessment amounts. He has presented no evidence that the amounts listed in the transcripts are incorrect. Nugent engaged merely in the \"vague and general denials\" of the accuracy of the Government's assessment that does not rebut the presumption of correctness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540236\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/915/#p918\">\n    909 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   922 ;\n   <em>\n    Rohner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=634%20Fed.%20Appx.%20495\">\n    634 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   499 ;\n   <em>\n    Hammon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=277%20Fed.%20Appx.%20560\">\n    277 Fed.Appx. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In short, Nugent has not rebutted the Government's case with a scintilla of evidence. As to the 2005-2007 tax years, there is no genuine dispute of material fact.

If it did, its assessments can be reduced to judgment. But if the Government filed late, then Nugent\n   does not have to pay. And whether the Government timely filed its lawsuit depends on the existence of an installment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Several key facts are not in dispute. First, there is no dispute that the Secretary assessed Nugent's 2003-2004 tax years on September 11, 2006. [DE 13-1, p. 1]. Second, no dispute exists that the statute of limitations gives the Government ten years to reduce assessments to judgment-which here would give the Government until September 11, 2016 to file this lawsuit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206502\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

To prove its case, the Government depends on two items of evidence: (1) the account transcripts, and (2) Revenue Officer Granville's declaration. [DE 13-2; 13-3]. Granville's knowledge of Nugent's case comes only from the transcripts; she was not personally involved in the creation of the agreement. [DE 13-2]. The revenue officer originally assigned to the case died. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Government presents no witness\n   to tell us anything about the agreement. And the Government does not produce the original agreement, a copy of the agreement, or any evidence other than the transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nugent, and Farmer, who represented Nugent before the IRS, state they never signed, or received a copy of, an installment agreement.

Although the Government argues that Nugent merely denies\n   <em>\n    signing\n   </em>\n   and not in fact entering an installment agreement, the affidavits from Nugent and Farmer, taken together, amount to a denial of the agreement's existence since an agreement requires a proposal and acceptance, and it must in writing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206159\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20301.6159-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6159-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government's only evidence that Nugent made a proposal comes from the data entries in the transcripts. The Government's argument, therefore, is that because the transcripts refer to the agreement, there must have been a proposal, acceptance, and a writing. But Nugent and Farmer deny signing anything, deny receiving confirmation, and deny making such a proposal. In fact, Farmer claims he proposed and negotiated a levy payment that would \"be within Mr. Nugent's ability to live\" and not an installment agreement. [DE 12-7]. Farmer states he \"never discussed or received an IRS Installment Agreement\" with the IRS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Nugent swears that although he agreed to pay money to the IRS, it was not under an installment agreement. [DE 12-6]. The Government argues that Nugent's affidavit \"is not dispositive of whether or not he entered into [an] installment agreement with the Service.\" [DE 13-1, p. 7]. True, but the Court must decide only whether the affidavits create a genuine issue of material fact not whether they are dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A District Court in the Southern District of New York recently faced a similar question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McConnell v.

The Government moved for summary judgment and used account records and a revenue officer's declaration to argue the agreement existed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The taxpayer had no specific evidence to refute the Government's argument other than his own sworn statement that he never entered the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ruling that the \"existence\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of the installment agreement\" was a genuine issue of material fact, the Court denied summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The Court ruled that a factfinder could determine that the taxpayer did not execute an installment agreement despite the account records and officer's declaration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And the Court rejected the Government's argument that the taxpayer could not \"rely on his 'own self-serving statements' to defeat summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.9. As the Court noted, \"it is not clear what other evidence would exist to negate the Government's circumstantial evidence and to prove the non-existence of the installment agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the absence of sworn statements denying the existence of an installment contract, courts have granted summary judgment for the Government. For example, the Seventh Circuit found no genuine issue of material fact where the taxpayer presented only an\n   <em>\n    unsworn\n   </em>\n   response to the Government's motion and \"never denied under oath\" the Government's claims regarding an installment agreement.\n   <em>\n    Seagrave v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Fed.%20Appx.%20457\">\n    221 Fed.Appx. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 (7th Cir. 2007). In fact, the taxpayer \"never denied at all\" the existence of an installment agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Fed.%20Appx.%20457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the taxpayer never denied the Government's arguments, the Government won summary\n   judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Fed.%20Appx.%20457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But in\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   , the Court found a genuine dispute of material fact even though the taxpayer offered no \"evidence other than his own affirmations in support of his position that he never executed an installment agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20167917\">\n    2017 WL 167917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As there, so here. Nugent and his accountant have denied, under oath, the existence of the agreement. The reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Seagrave\n   </em>\n   does not apply since Nugent presents sworn statements. Farmer, the Enrolled Agent practicing before the IRS, says that he negotiated what he believed to be a \"reduced levy payment\" on Nugent's behalf. [DE 12-7, \u00b6 3]. Farmer also states that he \"never\n   <em>\n    discussed\n   </em>\n   or received an IRS Installment Agreement\" with the IRS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5]. Thus, in Farmer's mind, he negotiated a payment, but specifically not an installment agreement. And Nugent claims in his affidavit that Farmer never presented him with an installment agreement to sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In short, the IRS argues that the data entries on Nugent's account transcripts create no genuine dispute that an installment agreement was proposed, accepted, reduced to writing, and either signed by Nugent or delivered to Nugent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20301.6159-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6159-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nugent and Farmer have denied, under oath, that these steps occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The United States presents a credible, even persuasive, case. Indeed, the Government's argument is compelling and it very well could prevail at trial. The Government has produced evidence supporting its argument. But so too has Nugent. And although Nugent's evidence consists solely of sworn affidavits denying the agreement, the Court does not know what else Nugent could do to prove a negative; that is, the non-existence of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20167917\">\n    2017 WL 167917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.9. The \"existence\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   \" of the agreement is thus in dispute, and that fact is material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. And when both parties present evidence that amounts to a genuine dispute of material fact, the proper mechanism for resolution is trial, not summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.
