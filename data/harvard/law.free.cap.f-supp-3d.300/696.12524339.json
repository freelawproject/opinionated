(ECF Nos. 1, 141.) Ultimately, as a result of either Orders of this Court or by agreement between the parties as to some Defendants, only four claims against one Defendant, Mr. Goldstein, proceeded to the jury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 56, 311, 312, 320, 333, 356.) On November 21, 2017, the jury returned a verdict in Plaintiff's favor on all claims and awarded him $15,000,000.

The parties' submissions have been reviewed and no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). For the reasons set forth below, the Defendant's Renewed Motion Under Rule 50 (ECF No. 376) is DENIED, and the Defendant's Motion Under Rule 59 (ECF No. 411) is also DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Michelle Dyson was murdered on October 5, 1994. The BPD investigated the crime, and Mr. Burgess, Dyson's boyfriend at the time, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on June 13, 1995. At trial, Laura Brokaw (f/k/a Laura Shach) prosecuted the case as an Assistant State's Attorney for Baltimore City, and Gordon Tayback represented Mr. Burgess. The trial court sentenced Mr. Burgess to life in prison plus 20 years. While incarcerated, Mr. Burgess was sentenced to five years for rioting. (Def.'s Rule 59 Mot. Ex. M, ECF No. 411-16.) To this day, Mr. Burgess, has maintained his innocence as to Michelle Dyson's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2014, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted Mr. Burgess' Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, which the State of Maryland had not opposed, and Mr. Burgess was released after having served almost twenty years in prison. (11/17/2017 Trial Tr. at 305-306.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Burgess filed this federal action against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Defendant Gerald Goldstein and other individual officers of the Baltimore Police Department on March 23, 2015.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This case proceeded through discovery and motions practice.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 56, 311, 312, 320, 332, 333.) Plaintiff's claims for trial included (1) violations of the principles of\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    -based claim that Defendant Goldstein withheld (a) evidence that Brain Rainey was an exculpatory witness and (b) other exculpatory information provided by the FBI as recited in Plaintiff's Trial Exhibits 121 and 122;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n    2.

Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) During the Conference on Jury Instructions, this Court adjusted the description of the first claim to include a reference to Plaintiff's Trial Exhibit 372. (11/21/2017 Trial Tr. at 11, 179.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    On November 21, 2017, the jury returned a verdict in Plaintiff's favor on all four claims and awarded Mr. Burgess $15,000,000.

First, under Rule 59(a)(1)(A), a court may grant a new trial on all or some issues \"for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 59. In the Fourth Circuit, a court \"must set aside the verdict and grant a new trial[ ] if ... (1) the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, or (2) is based upon evidence which is false, or (3) will result in a miscarriage of justice, even though there may be substantial evidence which would prevent the direction of a verdict.\"\n    <em>\n     Knussman v.

While Rule 59(e) does not provide a standard itself, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has recognized \"three grounds for amending an earlier judgment: (1) to accommodate an intervening change in controlling law; (2) to account for new evidence not available at trial; or (3) to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n    <em>\n     Pac.

He was interviewed by police on the night of his mother's murder, and when asked if his mother's boyfriend was involved, Rainey testified that he told police officers that Mr. Burgess was not involved. (11/17/17 Trial Tr. at 229-232.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The Defendant asserts that \"there is no evidence\" that Mr. Goldstein was ever made aware of Brian Rainey's exculpatory eyewitness account. (Def.'s Rule 50 Mem. 6-8.) This argument is without merit. First, Defendant Goldstein, the lead detective on the Dyson homicide investigation,\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    admitted that he would have seen the children had they been there while he was on the scene. (11/15/17 Trial Tr. at 95-96.) Second, Goldstein testified that he arrived on the scene at 10:45 p.m. (11/13/17 p.m. Trial Tr. at 15.) Third, Officer John Skinner testified that the children left the scene at 11:23 p.m. (11/17/17 Trial Tr. at 174-175.) Fourth, Officer Robert Patton testified that a lead detective would normally \"talk to the children that were present in a home on the night of a murder.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11/8/17 Trial Tr. at 125-126.) These four pieces of evidence support a reasonable inference to be drawn by the jury that-despite his denials-Goldstein interviewed Brian Rainey himself. Alternatively, Goldstein testified that if any other officer on the scene had interviewed Rainey, the officer would have shared that information with him. (11/13/17 p.m. Trial Tr. at 20.) Additionally, Defendant Goldstein does not deny having possession of Detective Lehmann's note indicating \"Child Bryan ? a witne[ss].\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 372) Again, the evidence supports a reasonable inference that, even if Goldstein did not interview Rainey himself, he would have been made aware that Brian Rainey was a witness with exculpatory information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Defendant next asserts that there is \"no evidence\" that the information in the \"Child Bryan\" note was withheld from the Office of the State's Attorney or from defense counsel Gordon Tayback. (Def.'s Rule 50 Mem. 9-13.) Defendant Goldstein points to his own testimony about his file-sharing\n    practices, the parties' stipulation that \"the complete contents of the Prosecutorial File are unknown\" (Joint Trial Ex. 503), and to Laura Brokaw's notes saying, \"brother-back room by himself ... Sabein-told mother to go to basement\" (Def's Ex. 99). The Defendant therefore contends that \"no party can establish, in total, what was ever in the possession of [the prosecution].\" (Def.'s Rule 50 Mem. 10.) The Defendant misses the mark for several reasons. First, Defendant's logic assumes that documents are the only method of proof available to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff, however, elicited testimony from Ms. Brokaw that Brian Rainey's name means nothing to her and that she doesn't remember the Dyson children having anything to do with the murder trial. (11/16/17 Trial Tr. at 215-216.) She also testified that Mr. Tayback was a good, diligent attorney who would have followed up on any exculpatory lead disclosed to him. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 196-198.) Second, Brokaw's note indicating that a \"brother\" may have heard \"Sabein-[tell] mother to go to basement\" is inculpatory, not exculpatory. Given that the evidence supports a reasonable inference that Defendant Goldstein knew Brian Rainey's account was exculpatory, the\n    <em>\n     inculpatory\n    </em>\n    nature of the Brokaw note actually supports an inference that Defendant Goldstein withheld the true content of Rainey's eyewitness account from both Ms. Brokaw and Mr. Tayback.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Defendant's final argument regarding the Rainey evidence is that there is \"no evidence\" that any withholding was done in bad faith. (Def.'s Rule 50 Mem. 13.) In response, Plaintiff notes that bad faith may be established by \"the nature of the withheld material that would negate any negligent or innocent explanation for the actions of the part of the police.\"\n    <em>\n     Jean\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244729\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/656/#p660\">\n     221 F.3d at 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Beyond the clearly exculpatory nature of Rainey's eyewitness account, Plaintiff argues that ten additional pieces of evidence support an inference of bad faith.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Defendant responds by challenging Plaintiff's characterization of testimony, but he also asks this Court to weigh \"contradictory\" evidence when considering the evidence identified by the Plaintiff. (Reply 25-32.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    As the jury was instructed (11/21/17 Trial Tr. at 180), \"bad faith\" simply means that the police officer(s) \"intentionally withheld the evidence for the purpose\n    of depriving the plaintiff of the use of that evidence during his criminal trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Jean\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244729\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/656/#p660\">\n     221 F.3d at 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In this case, there was substantial evidence from which the jury could conclude that Defendant Goldstein withheld the explicitly exculpatory testimony of Brain Rainey, the victim's son. The nature of this evidence negates any innocent explanation for the Defendant's withholding.\n    <em>\n     Jean\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244729\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/656/#p660\">\n     221 F.3d at 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Furthermore, the Defendant's statement that the Dyson murder \"wasn't a whodunnit\" (11/13/17 p.m. Trial Tr. at 63-65) and his apparent failure to investigate Detective Patton's information about Howard Rice's confession to killing Ms. Dyson (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    11/8/17 Trial Tr. at 146-47) also support a reasonable inference that he was intentionally depriving Mr. Burgess of material exculpatory information in seeking-and later protecting-Mr. Burgess' conviction. The evidence related to Brian Rainey's eyewitness account, by itself, was sufficient to support the jury's verdict on the\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     -based\n    </em>\n    withholding claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <strong>\n     2. FBI Communications\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The jury's verdict on the withholding claim was also supported by evidence of FBI communications before Mr. Burgess' criminal trial. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Exhibits G, H, Plaintiff's Trial Exhibits 121 and 122, respectively.) The first memo indicates that, according to the FBI's sources, \"[t]hree subjects were involved in the murder of Michelle Dyson,\" two black males and black female, and \"Dyson was killed because of drug related problems. She may have blown a package or drugs and/or a money package.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 121.) The first memo further provides that \"Dyson's babysitter [redacted] knows the details of the motives for the murder and preceding threats,\" and a name-redacted barber at Hair Dimension, Sinclair Lane Shopping Center, who fathered children with the victim is a \"drug underworld player\" and \"knows a lot about the background of Dyson's killers.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The first FBI memo states that the information above was \"furnished to Det. [Redacted] and Det. [Redacted] of the BPD-Homicide Unit (410) 396-2116. Det. [Redacted] is the case detective and he advised that the information appeared to be accurate and resulted in leads on the case.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The second FBI memo states, \"[Redacted] was a babysitter for Michelle Dyson. [Redacted] witnessed numerous events and heard numerous conversations between the victim and others, which directly relate to the motive for the victim's murder.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 122.) The second FBI memo concludes, \"On 11/8/94, after 2130 hours, det. [Redacted], the case detective BPD Homicide Unit (410) 396-2116 was provided with the above-stated information.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Defendant argues that (a) Mr. Goldstein never received this FBI information; (b) there is \"no evidence\" that the information contained in these FBI documents was withheld from the prosecutor or from Mr. Tayback; and (c) there is \"no evidence\" of bad faith. On each point, there is ample evidence for the jury to conclude otherwise. The fact that Goldstein was the lead detective on the Dyson case (11/13/17 a.m. Trial Tr. at 7-8; 11/16/17 Trial Tr. at 105-108) gives rise to a reasonable inference that he was the \"case detective\" who assessed the information in the memo, which focuses entirely on Michelle Dyson's murder. His status as the lead detective would also mean that even if another officer received this information (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , even if\n    Goldstein could not be directly reached at (410) 396-2116), that officer would have shared it with Goldstein. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11/8/17 Trial Tr. at 146-47.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Additionally, Goldstein's own notes closely track information in the FBI memos, such as the identity of Troy Williams as an \"old boyfriend\" who \"works at 'Hair Dimension' Sinclair Lane Shopping Center\" and the reference to a \"babysitter\" for Michelle Dyson. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Trial Ex. 10 at BPD 002674; Pl.'s Trial Exhibits 121 and 122; Resp. 21.) The Defendant's argument that his notes contain\n    <em>\n     more\n    </em>\n    information (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    last names, addresses, and phone numbers) than the memo ignores that the memo memorializes the\n    <em>\n     prior\n    </em>\n    furnishing of\n    <em>\n     information\n    </em>\n    , not of the memo itself. The jury could therefore reasonably infer that the prior communication involved additional details not captured in the one-page note.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    There is also sufficient evidence that Goldstein never shared this information with Ms. Brokaw. Again, a complete Prosecutorial File is but one method of establishing what information was disclosed. At trial, Plaintiff elicited testimony from Ms. Brokaw indicating that she had no FBI-based evidence that Ms. Dyson's murder was drug-related or that there were two or three alternate suspects. (11/16/17 Trial Tr. at 223-226.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    As the Defendant's bad faith argument has already been addressed above, this Court finds that the evidence of Defendant's knowledge and withholding of the exculpatory information in Plaintiff's Exhibits 121 and 122 was independently sufficient to support the jury's verdict. Defendant essentially asks this Court to view the jury's sound reasoning as mere \"speculation.\" Especially when all reasonable inferences must be construed in the Plaintiff's favor,\n    <em>\n     Whalen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"361354\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/769/221/#p224\">\n     769 F.2d at 224\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , this Court must decline the Defendant's request.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

Plaintiff alleged that Defendant Goldstein fabricated a police report saying:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    At the time of this incident there were three children sleeping in a center bedroom. Continuing back from there is ... a rear bedroom. In this last bedroom another child was asleep ... The victim's four children who were asleep were turned over to the Department of Social Services.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    (Goldstein Office Report dated October 14, 1994, Def.'s Ex. 99 at BURGESS 3760 and 3761.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Defendant challenges the fabrication verdict by asserting that (a) there is insufficient evidence that Mr. Goldstein knew Brian Rainey was awake; (b) Mr.\n    Goldstein was entitled to rely upon a fellow officer's statement that the kids were asleep; (c) the statement that the children were \"asleep\" was literally true; and (d) there is \"no evidence\" of bad faith. This Court has already found that there was sufficient evidence at trial for the jury to conclude Goldstein knew Rainey was a witness and acted in bad faith when concealing (via withholding or fabrication) this fact from the prosecutor and Mr. Burgess' defense attorney. Goldstein's purported entitlement to rely on a fellow officer's report that the children were asleep is irrelevant when, as discussed above, the jury could reasonably conclude Goldstein knew that Rainey was a witness. Defendant's argument that Goldstein's report is literally true assumes that the report says Rainey was asleep \"when the police arrived.\" The timeframe in the report, however, is \"at the time of this incident.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at BURGESS 3760.) The \"incident\" in question could reasonably mean either (a) the arrival of police or (b) the murder itself. The jury was entitled to view it as the latter. This Court therefore finds that the evidence of Defendant's fabrication in the Goldstein Office Report (Def. 's Ex. 99 at BURGESS 3760 and 3761) was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Malicious Prosecution\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    A malicious prosecution claim requires a showing that a defendant \"(1) caused (2) a seizure of the plaintiff pursuant to legal process unsupported by probable cause, and (3) criminal proceedings terminated in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n    <em>\n     Humbert v.

A police officer may only be found liable where he or she \"misled or pressured the prosecution\" to pursue charges.\n    <em>\n     Evans v Chalmers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869795\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/636/#p647\">\n     703 F.3d 636\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 647 (4th Cir. 2012). When challenging the veracity of a warrant application, Plaintiff must show \"that the officer(s) deliberately or with a 'reckless disregard for the truth' made material false statements in the warrant application, or omitted from that application 'material facts with the intent to make, or with reckless disregard of whether they thereby made, the [application] misleading.' \"\n    <em>\n     Humbert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275547\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/546/#p555\">\n     866 F.3d at 556\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Defendant concedes that this claim turns upon whether Goldstein omitted material facts from the warrant application. (Def.'s Rule 50 Mem. 24.) This question is intricately tied to the Defendant's knowledge of Mr. Rainey's exculpatory statements. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) For the reasons set forth above, there was sufficient evidence at trial for the jury to reasonably conclude that the Defendant knew Mr. Rainey was an exculpatory eyewitness. The omission of this fact from the warrant application reasonably supports the jury's verdict on the malicious prosecution claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In Maryland, the elements of an intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") tort claim are: \"(1) The conduct must be intentional or reckless; (2) The conduct must be extreme and outrageous; (3) There must be a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress; [and] (4) The emotional distress must be severe.\"\n    <em>\n     Lasater v.

Having determined that the jury could reasonably return a verdict on the withholding, fabrication, and malicious prosecution claims, this Court also finds that substantial evidence supported the jury's finding that Defendant's conduct was \"extreme and outrageous.\" That is not to say that every due process violation gives rise to an IIED claim, but in this case there was evidence showing that Defendant Goldstein concealed\n    <em>\n     multiple\n    </em>\n    pieces of exculpatory evidence and that he later ignored Howard Rice's confession to the very crime for which Mr. Burgess was serving-and enduring-a life sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Accordingly, this Court denies in all respects Defendant's request for judgment as a matter of law under his renewed Rule 50 motion (ECF No. 377).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

Under Rule 59(a), Defendant seeks a new trial by asserting that the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence, the result of errors of law, and based on false evidence. Under Rule 59(e), Defendant asks this Court to alter or amend the amount of judgment in light of Mr. Burgess' rioting conviction.

Weight of the Evidence\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Defendant argues that the jury's verdict on all four claims was against the clear weight of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     a)\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Brady\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     -based Withholding\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    A single\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    -based withholding claim was submitted to the jury (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    11/21/17 Trial Tr. at 179-80), and Defendant argues that the any finding of liability for the Rainey testimony or the FBI communications was against the clear weight of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In terms of the Rainey evidence, Defendant argues-in addition to the grounds raised in his Rule 50 motion-that (a) Brian Rainey and Tawanda Dyson (who corroborated Rainey's account of having told the police what he saw)\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    were not credible witnesses, (b) Dyson's government interviews discharged Goldstein's\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    obligations, and (c) Mr. Goldstein's testimony about his file-sharing practices was not outweighed by circumstantial evidence of any withholding. (Def.'s Rule 59 Mem. 3-12.) Regarding witness credibility, Defendant argues that this Court should disregard Rainey's\n    <em>\n     entire\n    </em>\n    testimony due to inconsistencies with other trial evidence and with his own prior statements.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    These inconsistencies\n    are reasonably excusable given the passage of over 20 years and the need for Mr. Rainey to recall a memory from when he was six years old. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Ex. 56 at BPD.2483.) What never changed, however, was Rainey's memory that Mr. Burgess, his mother's boyfriend, was definitively\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    among the intruders who killed his mother. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11/17/17 Trial Tr. at 229.) Defendant also fails to address the crucial credibility question: why would Rainey testify at trial to exonerate the man he either witnessed killing his mother or, if Rainey saw nothing, whom a jury convicted of having killed his mother? Furthermore, as addressed above, even if Goldstein did not personally interview Rainey, the officer(s) who did would have passed along Rainey's exculpatory account to the lead detective, Mr. Goldstein. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11/8/17 Trial Tr. at 125-126, 131-132; 11/16/17 Trial Tr. at 105-108.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Regarding Mr. Dyson's interviews with the government, Defendant claims that because Mr. Dyson relayed to the police that Rainey was \"asleep\" and to the prosecutor that two additional persons were involved, it was \"established\" at trial that Brian Rainey's testimony to the contrary was unbelievable. (Def.'s Rule 59 Mem. 10.) First, it is reasonable to credit Rainey's personal observations over Dyson's admittedly third-hand knowledge, which had allegedly been passed from the children to other family members to Mr. Dyson. (11/15/17 Trial Tr. at 271-72, 274.) Second, as addressed above, Defendant hardly \"established\" at trial that Ms. Brokaw knew Rainey was a witness, let alone an\n    <em>\n     exculpatory\n    </em>\n    witness. Ron Dyson's testimony does not warrant a finding by this Court that Mr. Rainey's\n    <em>\n     entire\n    </em>\n    testimony at trial was unbelievable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In terms of evidence that Goldstein withheld Rainey's exculpatory eyewitness account, Defendant argues that circumstantial evidence merely shows that the prosecutor, not Goldstein, failed to make disclosures. Plaintiff, however, points out that in Goldstein's deposition, which was played at trial, Goldstein admitted, \"I can't say for sure that these notes were copied\" when he shared his file with the prosecution. (11/13/17 p.m. Trial Tr. at 75-76 (citing Goldstein 11/9/2016 Dep. 304:20-305:7).) Additionally, as addressed above, the Plaintiff elicited testimony from Ms. Brokaw indicating that she was never made aware of Brian Rainey's status as an exculpatory eyewitness. (11/16/17 Trial Tr. at 196-198, 215-216.) That Defendant continues to insist that Rainey was asleep, which the jury evidently did not believe, further supports the view that he would not have given the prosecutor information to the contrary. This Court therefore cannot say that a finding of liability based upon the withholding of Rainey's exculpatory eyewitness account was against the clear weight of evidence. The verdict on the withholding claim will stand based upon the Rainey evidence alone, but this Court will nevertheless address the Defendant's arguments as to the FBI communications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    In terms of the exculpatory FBI information (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 121 and 122), Defendant argues that (a) the phone number in Plaintiff's Exhibits 121 and 122 was not Goldstein's number, (b) his own notes (PL's Trial Ex. 10) show that-rather than having relied on the FBI-he developed the common information on his own, and (c) Mr. Goldstein's testimony about his file-sharing practices was not outweighed by circumstantial evidence of an, withholding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    (Def.'s Rule 59 Mem. 13-16.) This Court has already disposed of each of these contentions. To reiterate, Goldstein was the lead detective on the Dyson homicide investigation, so the most natural reading of Plaintiff's Exhibit 121, which focuses entirely on Michelle Dyson's murder, is that Goldstein was the \"case detective\" who assessed the information in the memo. Even if another officer received this information (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    even if Goldstein could not be directly reached at (410) 396-2116), the officer would have shared it with the lead detective, Goldstein. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11/8/17 Trial Tr. at 146-47.) The commonalities between the memos and Goldstein's own notes (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 10) further support the conclusion that Goldstein was made aware of the FBI information, and any additional details in Goldstein's notes are consistent with the fact that the information \"resulted in leads on the case.\" Moreover, Goldstein admitted, \"I can't say for sure that these notes were copied\" when he shared his file with the prosecution, (11/13/17 p.m. Trial Tr. at 75-76 (citing Goldstein 11/9/2016 Dep. 304:20-305:7)), and Plaintiff elicited testimony from Ms. Brokaw indicating that she never received the exculpatory information in the memos. (11/16/17 Trial Tr. at 223-226.) Again, the Defendant has not established the withholding verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     b) Fabrication\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    As this Court has noted, and the parties have consistently acknowledged, the viability of the Plaintiff's fabrication claim rises and falls with Defendant Goldstein's knowledge of Rainey's exculpatory eyewitness account. Having already determined under Rule 50 and Rule 59 that there was sufficient evidence introduced at trial from which the jury could find that Defendant Goldstein knew Rainey was an exculpatory eyewitness, this Court also finds that the jury's verdict on the fabrication claim was not against the clear weight of evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     c) Malicious Prosecution\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Defendant's challenge under Rule 59 to the jury verdict on the malicious prosecution claim rests entirely upon his Rule 50 arguments. (Def.'s Rule 59 Mem. 17.) Again, there was sufficient evidence that the Defendant knew Mr. Rainey was an exculpatory eyewitness. The omission of this fact from the warrant application justifies the jury's verdict on the malicious prosecution claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <strong>\n     d) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Defendant's final \"weight of the evidence\" challenge is also meritless. Defendant again rests entirely upon his Rule 50 arguments and concedes that this claim is tied to the underlying due process claims. (Def.'s Rule 50 Mem. 17; Def.'s Rule 59 Mem. 24.) In this case, the evidence showed that Defendant Goldstein concealed\n    <em>\n     multiple\n    </em>\n    pieces of exculpatory evidence and that he later ignored Howard Rice's confession to the very crime for which Mr. Burgess was serving-and enduring-a life sentence. The jury's verdict on the IEED claim was therefore not against the clear weight of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <strong>\n     2. False Evidence\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Defendant's second line of attack under Rule 59(a) is that the jury's verdict is based upon false evidence. Defendant specifically contends that portions of Plaintiff's counsel's closing argument constituted \"false evidence.\" (Def.'s Rule 59 Mem. 30-33.) First, Defendant asserts that, even though this Court only permitted a\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    claim based upon Rainey's eyewitness account and the FBI memos to go to trial, Plaintiff's counsel argued in closing that Defendant withheld \"six difference pieces of exculpatory information.\" (11/21/17 Trial Tr. at 31.) Second, Defendant notes that Plaintiff's counsel argued an unpleaded claim that Defendant fabricated the content of Mr. Burgess' written interview\n    statements. Third, Defendant claims that Plaintiff's counsel \"misrepresented\" the content of the State's Attorney's file. Defendant contends, \"The simple fact is that we do not know whether the jury improperly based its verdict on any of the new theories warrants a new trial.\" (Def.'s Reply 43 (citing\n    <em>\n     Jones v.

At the hearing, the Court established that the vast majority of the information contained in the documents was offered to prove notice to the BPD rather than for the truth of the matters asserted therein. This Court therefore discussed a limiting instruction to that effect. (11/6/17 Hr'g Tr. at 154.) Those portions of the documents regarding the\n    <em>\n     transmission\n    </em>\n    of the information to the BPD (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , \"This information was furnished to Det.

Though not briefed by the parties, all parties discussed the applicability of Rule 807 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the \"Residual Exception\" to the rule against hearsay. Defendant specifically objected under Rule 807(b) that the declarant's name was redacted. (11/6/17 Hr'g Tr. at 149.)

First, he claims this Court erred by instructing the jury to consider Plaintiff's Exhibit 372 in relation to the due process claims. (Def.'s Rule 59 Mot. Mem. 24-26.) Second, he contends this Court erred by rejecting a proposed instruction on the permissible use of GSR evidence. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    26-28.) Third, he argues that this Court should have provided a limiting instruction on evidence of uncharged or dismissed claims. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    29-30.) In order for \"errors of law\" in the form of errant jury instructions to warrant a new trial the errors must ''result in a miscarriage of justice.\"\n    <em>\n     Sergent,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591798\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/681/631/#p633\">\n     681 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    633-35 ; Fed.

While the note also contained other information that\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    support the already dismissed claim that Howard Rice information was withheld (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 311 at 26), this Court would have invaded the province of the jury by inserting a line-by-line analysis of the exhibit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Noel v.

Additionally, this Court immediately followed the mention of Plaintiff's Exhibit 372 with an overview of the elements of a due process withholding and/or fabrication claim.

The instruction itself was therefore not erroneous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Defendant's insistence at trial that \"Little Man\" was not Howard Rice (11/9/17 Trial Tr. at 78, 246-247; 11/21/17 Trial Tr. at 88) undermines his argument that Plaintiff's counsel's \"Little Man\" arguments contravened this Court's Order, which assumed that \"Little Man\" was a nickname for Howard Rice. (ECF No. 311 at 26.) This Court therefore does not view counsel's arguments as an improper violation of a court order. If the \"Little Man\" reference in Plaintiff's Exhibit 372 was insufficient to support a due process claim, counsel simply wasted his breath. Moreover, there has been no prejudice or \"miscarriage of justice\" when this Court accurately enumerated the elements of the withholding and fabrication claims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sturges v. Matthews\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572907\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/659/#p661\">\n     53 F.3d 659\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 661-63 (4th Cir. 1995) (finding no prejudice from extraneous instruction when underlying elements were properly provided), and when the jury's verdict was independently supported by other evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    This Court's rejection of the requested limiting instruction regarding GSR evidence was also proper. The Defendant submitted the following instruction:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n    The gunshot residue evidence in this case has been presented by the Plaintiff in support of his claim for damages based on his alleged innocence. It has not been offered and cannot be considered in deciding liability against the Defendants.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 351 at 48. At the instruction conference, this Court rejected the instruction because it would confuse the jury. (11/20/17 Trial Tr. at 370.) The Defendant's brief has not changed this Court's view, especially when the instruction on the due process claims excluded GSR evidence as potential ground for liability. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11/21/17 Trial Tr. at 178-79.) Defendant's claim of prejudice on this count is also meritless. He complains of having made strategic decisions based upon an alleged \"agreement\" the instruction would be provided. At the motions hearing, however, this Court indicated that it would \"consider\" a requested instruction on GSR evidentiary value. (11/6/17 Hr'g Tr. at 184-185.) Defendant had no guarantee the instruction would be given, so his strategic decisions assumed the risk that this Court would decline to provide the instruction. The denial did not result in a \"miscarriage of justice\" as the jury is presumed to have followed this Court's guidance on the viable due process claims.\n    <em>\n     Caro\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220597\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/608/#p631\">\n     597 F.3d at 631\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    For the same reason, Defendant's claim of error regarding a rejected instruction on uncharged or dismissed claims is meritless. This Court effectively provided the jury with the requested guidance (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Rule 59 Mot. Mem. 29) by specifically identifying three forms of allegedly withheld evidence and one allegedly fabricated police report. (11/21/17 Trial T. at 178-79.) The requested instruction was therefore \"substantially covered by the court's charge to the jury.\"\n    <em>\n     Noel v. Artson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205905\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/580/#p587\">\n     641 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    586 (citing\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Again, the Defendant has not overcome the presumption that the jury followed the narrowly tailored due process instructions. Furthermore, there has been no \"miscarriage of justice\" when the withholding and fabrication claims were independently supported by the evidence of Brian Rainey's exculpatory eyewitness account and the evidence of the FBI memos.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Motion to Alter or Amend the Amount of Judgment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Under Rule 59(e), Defendant seeks to alter or amend the amount of judgment based upon the Plaintiff's five-year \"concurrent\" sentence for rioting while he was serving almost twenty years of his lifetime plus twenty sentence. (Def.'s Rule 59 Mot. Mem. 34-35.) Specifically, he requests that this Court reduce the judgment from $15 million to $11,153,846.14.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    35.)

Plaintiff argues, despite his earlier concession to the contrary (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 311 at 19 n.6), that the sentence was consecutive. Mr. Burgess also argues that he \"never would have been present in the yard at all had he not been [wrongfully convicted].\" (Pl.'s Resp. 62.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Notwithstanding Plaintiff's counsel's prior comments, the Circuit Court Commitment Record establishes that the rioting conviction would be served \"consecutive to the last sentence to expire of all outstanding and unserved Maryland sentences.\" (Pl.'s Ex. Q, ECF No. 385-18.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    The parties have not presented a clear record of how the state court handled the consecutive sentence upon Mr. Burgess' release, but the status of the consecutive sentence has no bearing on this Court's consideration of the damages related to the Plaintiff's nearly twenty-year wrongful imprisonment for Michelle Dyson's murder.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    The possibility of parole on the rioting sentence also weighs against any offset in this case. The Defendant's request for a reduced judgment is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    For the reasons set forth above, the Defendant's Renewed Motion Under Rule 50 (ECF No. 376) is DENIED, and the Defendant's Motion Under Rule 59 (ECF No. 411) is also DENIED. Because Plaintiff's only remaining claim, the bifurcated\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim against the Baltimore Police Department, remains STAYED (ECF No. 408), the entire case will now be STAYED pending resolution of any and all appellate proceedings related to the verdict on November 21, 2017.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-107\">\n     Mr. Burgess cites two Fourth Circuit cases that he contends stand for the rule that a court may not weigh evidence or consider credibility under Rule 59.
