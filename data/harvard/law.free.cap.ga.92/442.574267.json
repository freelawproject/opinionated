This discretion is entrusted by law, not to the Supreme Court, but to the judges of the superior courts. In the present case the application being a novel one, and the evidence being conflicting, there was certainly no abuse of discretion in denying the injunction.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b458-7\">April 10, 1893.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"Art\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-8\">Petition for injunction. Before Judge Miller. Bibb county.

His last contract was made m July, 1891, to terminate on May 1, 1893. Upon the material issues the evidence was conflicting.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-10\">H. Y.
