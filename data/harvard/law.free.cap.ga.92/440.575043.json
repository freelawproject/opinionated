When the case was called, defendants\u2019 counsel moved for a continuance because of the absence of Steed, stating that there was no defence as to him, that he was a witness for Mrs. Steed, that he had not been subpoenaed, but that they proposed to show he was sick and unable to attend court. A showing was made, but the motion to continue was overruled; and a verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the plaintiff'. Mrs. Steed moved to set aside the judgment upon the grounds, that her husband had the management of the defence and was a material witness, but was sick and unable to attend court on the day of the trial; that she had a good defence, having signed the note as security for her hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>band and being owner of a separate estate, which fact was known to plaintiff\u2019s agents; and that through her husband she had secured attorneys and prepared her plea which was filed in the clerk\u2019s office. To this motion plaintiff demurred on the ground, among others,, that the judgment could be set aside only for error appearing on the face of the record. The demurrer was overruled, and after hearing testimony of Steed and wife relating to the sickness of the former at the time of the trial, the court set aside the judgment.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AeG\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>J.
