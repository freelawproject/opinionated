If the declaration was defective in matter of form in failing to allege that the company\u2019s negligence consisted in keeping the pole in use, either with knowledge of its condition or negligently without knowledge, this was matter for special demurrer. The declaration being good in substance, the court did not err in overruling a general demurrer thereto.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b414-13\">April 10, 1893.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A3l\">By two Justices.</judges>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"Ae5\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-14\">Action for damages.

The usual and necessary way to do this work was to climb the poles to the point from which the wires were suspended and held in place. While so en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>gaged, under tbe orders of the defendant and in the careful discharge of the duties incident to his employment, Wesley Jenkins by the defendant\u2019s carelessness and negligence was thrown violently from one of the poles from which he was then engaged in disengaging the wires of the line, so that he was fatally injured and died in a few hours. He was without any fault or negligence on his part, and the injury was wholly caused by the negligence of the defendant in having and maintaining a rotten and insecure pole unequal to its office, which condition was concealed from and unknown to Wesley Jenkins, so that when he was at the top of the pole in the careful and proper discharge of his duties, the pole through its inherent weakness broke and fell, causing the injuries aforesaid.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ANui\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>A general demurrer to the declaration was overruled.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b415-6\">J.
