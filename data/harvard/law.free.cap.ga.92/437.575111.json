To this the garnishee excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion alleged, that the. order discharging the garnishee was granted on March 26,1892, without notice to plaintiff or either of its attorneys, and without any knowledge whatever that any motion would be made to discharge the garnishee. Neither of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys were present, nor were they in duty bound to be present, at the time the order was taken. The case was not then in order for trial, and was not called for trial.\" The garnishee was not required to answer at all until the first day of the March term, 1892, did not answer until March 15, 1892, and the case was not called at all by the court until April 30,1892. Upon the calling of the case no one answered for the garnishee, and the court was about to mark the case in default, when the clerk stated that the garnishee answered and had been discharged. For the first time this fact was brought to the attention of plaintiff's counsel, the statement of the clerk being found to he' true. Petitioner has the whole of the term, as matter of law, to traverse the answer, and alleges that the garnishee is indebted to defendant in <em>fi. fa. </em>(McGhees &amp; Company) in a sum more than sufficient to discharge this debt.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AQh\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Upon the hearing the following appeared: McWilliams was summoned to answer at the March term, 1892, which began on March 14th. On March 16th, he filed his answer denying any indebtedness. On March 26th, the court announced that the juries would be discharged that day for the term. In the evening of that day, after this announcement, counsel for the garnishee moved for an order of discharge. The court then sounded the case and inquired publicly, while the court was in session, if any traverse had been filed, or if there was any objection to the discharge of the garnishee, and no objection being made, passed an order discharging him. After-wards on the game day, the juries were discharged for the term, and the court took a recess until April 30, 1892. On the last named day when the appearance docket was being called, the garnishment case not having been stricken was sounded (being a garnishment at common law on a judgment), and plaintiff\u2019s counsel then learned, from the statement of the clerk and an inspection of the record, that the garnishee had been discharged by order dated March 26th, and then entered on the record, and did not know until then that the garnishee had answered and been discharged. Plaintiff\u2019\u2019s counsel then made the motion to set aside the order of discharge and asked leave to file a traverse to the answer, and on May 10th, the court, after hearing the garnishee\u2019s answer and all the facts, granted plaintiff\u2019s motion. Plaintiff filed a traverse on April 30th, and refiled same May 10th. The court finally adjourned May 13th. It was and is the practice of the court, to call the docket and set certain cas\u00e9s for particular days, and to discharge from attendance upon the court all counsel and parties not engaged m the trial of cases upon the day\u2019s calendar. On March 26th, the court was trying criminal cases, and counsel and parties interested on the civil side of the docket were excused from attend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>anee. It was the practice to set only issues and. to take up default eases at any time, and grant orders and rules therein. Further than having set cases according to the practice, no special leave of absence was granted to plaintiff\u2019s counsel; and the practice does not dispense with any rule of pleading, nor excuse a failure to file proper pleadings in all cases pending in the court.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b456-5\">Dabney &amp; Fouoh\u00e9, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b456-6\">J.
