These were issued and levied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Donaldson filed a traverse in each, case, denying that at the time of suing out the attachment he was a resident of said county, and alleging that at said time he was a resident of Dodge county. The issue thus made was, by consent, heard by the judge without a jury, the cases being consolidated. The evidence adduced was directly conflicting. The judge ordered that the traverses be sustained and the attachments removed, on the ground that the superior court of Baldwin county had no jurisdiction of the defendant at the time of the issuance and levy of the attachments.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A4h\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Roberts &amp; Pottle, for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b359-4\">R.
