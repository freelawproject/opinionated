Anthanissen <em>v. </em>Dart <em>et al.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b425-5\">1. Under the act of Feb. 24,1877 (Pamphlet p. 106; Code Add. p. V),. the special bailiff of a county court is authorized to serve a summons of garnishment upon the sheriff'of the county, and when such bailiff had made an entry of service signing the entry as bailiff, although it was error to allow the return of service to be so amended as to make it appear that the officer was an \u201c acting constable\u201d in making the service, the error was harmless, the facts showing that the service was good.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b425-6\">2. The fact that the attorney at law of the plaintiff in attachment, signed the plaintiff\u2019s name to the attachment bqnd when the latter had himself made the affidavit to obtain the attachment, does not necessarily require a dismissal of the attachment. If signing the plaintiff\u2019s name by the attorney was not, under the circumstances, lawful, the bond was amendable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b425-7\">3. Where property expensive to keep was levied on by virtue of'an-attachment and sold by the sheriff under an order of the judge of the superior court according to the provisions of section 3648 of the code, the sheriff retaining the money subject to the order of the court, and thereafter both the attachment and the declaration based thereon were, on motion of the defendant, dismissed for fatal defects, the money in the sheriff\u2019s hands was subject to garnishment by virtue of a second attachment at the instance of the plaintiff in the first. After the first attachment was dismissed, the money held by the sheriff belonged to the party from the sale-of whose property it was realized, he having ratified the sale by contesting the garnishment and moving to dismiss a second attachment upon which the garnishment was issued.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b425-8\">April 10, 1893.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Arz\">By two Justices.</judges>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AjN\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\">Attachment. Before Judge Sweat. Glynn superior court. May term, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-10\">Attachments were sued out against Anthanissen, master of the Norwegian bark Svalen, and the unknown, owners of that hark, for services rendered under contract for rescuing the bark from a position of peril on the bar of the Brunswick harbor. They were levied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>upon the bark with her cargo, and by subsequent proceedings before the judge of the superior court the vessel and cargo were sold separately, and the money derived from the-sale remained in the hands of the sheriff under order that it should stand in lieu of the vessel and cargo, and that the lien of the attachments should apply to the fund. The attaching creditors filed their declarations, setting up the foregoing facts, and asking for judgments against the fund. Because of defects appearing on the attachments and declarations they were dismissed. Afterwards the plaintiffs again sued out attachments against the same defendants. They were issued by Lambright, a justice of the peace, and made \u2022returnable to the superior court, and were executed by serving summons of garnishment upon the sheriff. The return of service was signed by Driver as special bailiff of Glynn county court. Defendant\u2019s motion in each case to dismiss the attachments was overruled, and he excepted. One ground of the motion was, that the attachment was directed to all and singular the sheriff's and constables of the State, and the levy was made by a person having no authority, by direction of the attachment or otherwise, to levy an attachment issued out of the justice\u2019s court and returnable to the superior court. In reply to this ground, plaintiff' moved to amend the return of service by having Driver substitute for his \u2022official signature the words, \u201c acting constable, justice\u2019s court, 26th district G. M., Glynn county, Georgia.\u201d In support of the motion to amend, Driver testified, that he had held the office of special bailiff of the county court for the past ten years, during which time he served and executed papers for Justice 'Lambright\u2019s court, who delivered to him the summons of garnishment in question, which he served; and that he had never held the \u2022office of constable of any justice\u2019s court in Glynn county. The court allowed the return to be amended over defendant\u2019s objection.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b425-14\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\n<em>Judgment affirmed, in both cases.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Another ground of the motion to dismiss was, that \u2022one of the attachments was issued upon the affidavit of Dart, while the bond was signed, not by him, but with his name by his attorneys at law.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b427-5\">The remaining ground was, that the attachment was levied by process of garnishment upon the sheriff, from whose untraversed answer it appeared that he had in his possession $1,437.60 which came to his hands under an order of the court directing him to sell certain perishable property and hold the proceeds until further order, and that he held the same under such order as an officer, and not as an individual.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b427-6\">Crovatt &amp; Whitfield and H.
