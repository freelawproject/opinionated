Where a declaration setting forth all the facts as to the purchase by the defendant from the plaintiff of certain stock, and the pledging thereof as collateral security for the payment of a promissory note given for part of the' price, prayed only for a judgment subjecting the stock to the payment of the note, it was not error to allow an amendment praying a general judgment against the defendant both for the amount of the note and for an additional sum which the declaration alleged the defendant had agreed to pay for the stock.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b448-9\"><em>'2. </em>The transfer of the stock to the defendant and the issuing of a certificate in her name, together with the fact that she described the stock as her own in a promissory note given for its purchase, and therein pledged it as security for the payment of the note, is sufficient evidence of the delivery of the stock and its acceptance by her, whether she actually received the certificate or not. The stock having been delivered and accepted, the sale was complete and the statute of frauds does not apply.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b448-10\">3. The note given for the purchase of the stock being \u201cfor value received,\u201d and absolute and unconditional on its face, parol evidence was inadmissible to show that the defendant purchased the stock upon condition that it would thereafter pay a certain dividend, and in the event it failed to pay such dividend the note was not to be paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b448-11\">4.

He delivered her the stock, which was duly transferred to her upon the books of the company. She made and delivered to him her promissory note for $1,300 due six months after date, copy of which is attached. The note was intended by both to be negotiated at the Exchange Bank, and for that reason was made payable to the bank, but it was petitioner\u2019s property and delivered to him as;sueh by her. On failure to negotiate the note at the bank it was therefore indorsed to him by the cashier thereof, as set out on the copy attached. The stock attached hereto as collateral is in his possession, the same being defendant\u2019s property subject to his lien thereon; and he prays that the stock may be sold and its proceeds applied to the payment of the note. She promised to pay him $120 cash in addition to the $1,300, which she has failed to do. The note is due, and she has failed and refused to pay it. Attached was a copy \u25a0of the note signed by Mrs. Dinkier, made payable to the Exchange Bank of Macon or order, and indorsed : \u201cPay D. J. Baer or order without recourse on me in any event. J. W. Cabaniss, cashier.\u201d The note contained a statement, that having deposited with the bank, to secure the prompt payment of the note, thirteen shares of the Macon Brewing Company, the maker constituted the president, vice-president and cashier of said corporation, jointly and severally, her attorney or attorneys to collect, sell or otherwise dispose of the whole or any portion of said collaterals, either publicly or privately and without notice to her, in case of the non-performance of this contract, applying the proceeds to the payment of this note, including interest, and accounting to her for the surplus, if any, etc.; also, that in case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>default the maker agreed to pay ten per cent, attorney\u2019s fees and all costs of court that might be incurred in securing the rights of the bank, and collecting any amount or balance which might remain unpaid under this instrument. Plaintiff' was allowed to amend his declaration and pray for a general judgment against defendant for $1,420 principal, with interest upon $120 from February 18, 1891, at seven per cent, per annum, and interest upon $1,300 from February 18, 1891, at eight per cent, per annum, and the further sum of $130\u2019 as attorneys\u2019 fees upon the $1,300, as specified in the note; the stock to be sold as directed by the court, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the principal* interest and attorneys\u2019 fees, as specified in the note.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b450-5\">Defendant pleaded, not indebted; the statute of frauds; and that the note was given upon the condition and guaranty that the stock was to pay a ten per cent, dividend m the following July, which it did not do, whereby she was released. The court directed a verdict in favor of Baer for principal, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees as prayed for in the amendment, and that the stock be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of the principal, interest and attorney\u2019s fees as specified in the note, and the balance to be paid to defendant. She moved for a new trial, which was denied, and she excepted. The motion contained the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary id=\"b450-6\">1. Error in allowing the amendment, the declaration containing nothing to amend by, and the amendment making a new and distinct cause of action.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b450-7\">2. Error m failing to grant a nonsuit upon defendant\u2019s motion, upon the grounds, that the evidence showed the transaction was within the statute of frauds; and that the evidence utterly failed to show that the Exchange Bank, or J. <em>W. </em>Cabaniss, ever turned over to-the plaintiff the stock held by him as security. And the verdict is contrary to law and evidence, for the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>son that the evidence failed to show that the Exchange-Bank or J. W. Cabaniss had ever turned over to the plaintiff the stock to hold as collateral security for the note; the evidence simply disclosing that J. W. Cabaniss indorsed the note over to Baer as cashier, but had not transferred to him the stock as collateral, and the evidence further showing that the defendant never agreed for the plaintiff to hold the stock as collateral. The law required that the stock should have been delivered to defendant before plaintiff was entitled to a general verdict, and said verdict should have provided that the stock should be delivered to defendant.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b451-5\">3. Error in excluding the answer of plaintiff to the following question by defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201c On February 19th, just prior to the making of this note, didn\u2019t you state to Mrs. Dinkier, if this stock didn\u2019t declare a dividend the following July of ten per cent., she need not pay this note and take the stock ?\u201d And in excluding the following parts of defendant\u2019s testimony: \u201cHe [plaintiff] says, \u2018 Take the stock; it will pay a good dividend in July\u2019; and I says, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 and he says, \u2018It will pay ten per cent, dividend in July.\u2019\u201d Also : \u201c The stock declined, and of course Mr. Baer was anxious to get the money, and I told him if it didn\u2019t pay the dividend it was no trade, because he had guaranteed the stock to me.\u201d All of this evidence was admissible to show that Baer had practiced a fraud upon defendant, and that the trade was void upon the ground that it was induced by fraud.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b451-6\">4. Error in directing a verdict, for the reason that, the evidence being conflicting and sworn pleas having been filed, the court invaded the province of the jury in undertaking to direct a verdict, but should have charged the jury the law of the case and left the facts and pleading with the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b451-7\">Robert Hodges, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b451-8\">R.
