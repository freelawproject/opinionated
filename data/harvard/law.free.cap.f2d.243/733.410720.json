W. E. Hedger Transp. Corp. v. Gallotta, 2 Cir., 145 F.2d 870; The Salvore, 2 Cir., 36 F.2d 712, certiorari denied United States Steel Products Co. v. Navigazione, etc., 287 U.S. 653, 53 S.Ct. 117, 77 L.Ed. 565. Appellants, two damage claimants, seek reversal of the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the tug owner\u2019s petition because it does not in terms allege his lack of privity and knowledge as to the accident. But the rather extensive petition does set forth the \u201cfacts and circumstances,\u201d as directed in Admiralty Rule 51 \u2014 which is the carefully drawn rule proposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, as shown by its Reports of Oct. 1-4, 1946, 23, 24, and Sept. 25-27, 1947, 21-25, following proposals of the Maritime Law Association of the United States, and which contains no requirement for the pleading of the legal conclusions desired of the court. There is nothing in the background of the rule \u2014 and no reason is disclosed \u2014 why admiralty practice should be more hypertechnical than ordinary procedure under the civil rules. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>See, e.g., </em>Gins v. Mauser Plumbing Supply Co., 2 Cir., 148 F.2d 974, 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><em>The </em>allegation in the petition that the petitioner was himself handling the hawser aboard the tug at the time of the accident is not incompatible with limitation of liability. \u201cPrivity and knowledge\u201d is a term of art meaning complicity in the fault that caused the accident, and if the petitioner is free from fault his actual knowledge of the facts of the accident does not prevent limitation. The 84-H, 2 Cir., 296 F. 427, certiorari denied 264 U.S. 596, 44 S.Ct. 454, 68 L.Ed. 867; 3 Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7 489 (6th Ed.1940). Of course petitioner must establish such facts at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
