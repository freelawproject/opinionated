It issues life insurance contracts which it calls certificates rather than policies, for premiums which it calls payments. Roland M. Farris was issued a certificate of insurance in the amount of $3,000 by the Society in 1945. On August 4, 1954, Virgil P. Miller, District Manager of the Society, called at the Farris home and talked about an educa- ,. , . <em>,\u00bfY </em>tional insurance certificate lor the young son of Farris and his wife. This conversation being concluded, Miller discussed with Farris the need of the latter for additional insurance. An application was signed and a Preferred Risk Whole y-&lt; i <em>\u2022 r* </em>i / L, \u2022 \"u Life Certificate (which is substantially the same as an ordinary life policy, issued by a life insurance company) for .$2,000, with a twenty-year term benefit rider in the amount of $3,000 attached, was later issued and delivered to Farris. Farris died on December 23, 1954, of heart failure. Farris had a rheumatic heart disease dating back at least as far as November 1, 1948. The Society de-dined to make payment of the amount of the Certificate and tendered the amount of the payments which Farris had made. The tender was refused. His widow, Sarah Estelle Farris brought suit on the - Certificate and recovered judgment for $5,000 on the Certificate, $1,000 attorneys\u2019 fees, interest and costs. The Society has appealed. The plaintiff married while the suit was pending and she is before us as the appellee, Sarah Estelle Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"AHU\">, .. . . , The testimony was m sharp conflict , , , , , ,, as to what was said and done when the , , application for insurance was taken. Miller, the District Manager of the Society, testified that at the time of his meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Farris he had with him the form that was used in applying for insurance when no medical examination was had. Miller, so he testi-tied, asked Farris the questions as they appeared on the form, and the answers of Farris were written down by Miller. The form shows the question, \u201cHave you, within the past ten years, had any mental or bodily disease or infirmity, or have you within that period of time, consulted, bcen attended or examined by a physifaf? If state wbicb&gt; wben, giving *uil Particulars and name of physician, ^rris as noted by Miller, was N\u00b0- The form contained the question Are y\u00b0u now m <em>sood </em>health to the oest of y\u00b0ur k\u2122^edf and beliffj If,not\u2019 ^ve cause _ Mifier recorded Farris an- \u201d as bemS .Jes The form con-tamed a request that the applicant Give \u201e , , name and address of your personal phy- \u201c \u25a0 Fa(rJls JSP\u2122Se\u2019 *^5\u201c by J\u00dc1Jas None \u25a0 Jbe application containfd tbe ^presentation that I have ffd each of fo/egoing questions and the answers thereto, and represent that _ . . ^ \u201e fch \u00b0Jsald Jfu11\u2019 complete and true whether written by my own hand or The a^wers to the questions quoted wefe untraf; JlUer sald Jat F\u201c\u2122 sJJed \u201c atlon J blank \u00b0n Yhlcb Miller, after returning to his office, typed m tbe answers as given to lum by Far- \u2122 and sJntQthe application to the home office of the Society in 0maha\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"Abj\">The testimony of the widow of Farris, ^be beneficiary named in the certificate, was mucb different from that given by Miller- Her stOTy was tbat Miller save Farris the card of the doctor who was the examining physician for the Society. Farris stated that he had a rheumatic heart condition for which he had been treated some years before but he then felt fme. Miller stated he would put it through without a medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"alg-dedup-0\">In addition to the recital that the applicant had read the questions and an- ,. ,. , . . ,, \u201e , swers, the application contained the fol- . . lowing provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atj-dedup-1\">_ \u201d1 have read each of the forego3n\u00a3 Questions and the answers there-3'\u00b0&gt; and represent tbat each of said answers is full, complete and true, whether written by my own hand or no3:\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdYf\">\u201cAll statements purporting to be made by the applicant shall be deemed representations and not warranties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201cI further agree that no statement or information given by or to any person soliciting or taking this application, or by or to any other person, nor any knowledge possessed by any such person, shall be binding on this Society or in any manner affect its liability unless such statement or information be presented in writing to the Medical Director of said Society at the Home Office prior to the issu- . ance of said benefit certificate, and agree that there shall be no liability on the part of the Society for the payment of benefits unless the applicant shall have made at least one monthly payment to the Society for the benefit applied for, and unless this application shall have been approved by the Medical Director of the Society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdCq\">^ The certificate contained, on the outer-fold, this notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_v\">important</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQm\">\u201cNo Camp or officer thereof nor any employee or representative of this Society has authority to waive any of the conditions of this benefit certificate or of the Constitution, Laws and By-Laws of the Society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKRN\">The certificate was issued \u201cin consideration of the application therefor, includ,ing the statement of insurability.\u201d A photostat copy of the application was attached to and made a part of the certificate. In Section 127 of the Society\u2019s Constitution and Laws it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2D\">\u201cSec. 127. (a) No employee, state manager, field man or agent of the Society or the Sovereign Camp, Head Camp or of any Camp, has the power, right or authority to waive any of the conditions upon which beneficiary certificates are issued, or to change, vary or waive any of the provisions of this Constitution or these Laws, nor shall any custom or course of dealing on the.part of any Financial Secretary or of any Camp or any number of Camps\u2014 with or without the knowledge of any officer of the Society \u2014 have the effect of so changing, modifying, waiving or foregoing such laws or requirements. Each and every beneficiary certificate is issued only upon the conditions stated in and sub-jeet to the Constitution and Laws, then in force or thereafter enacted, nor shall the knowledge or act of any employee of this Society constitute a waiver of the provisions of these laws by the Society or an es-toppel of this Society,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayj-dedup-0\">\u00ab(b) The Articles of Incorpora-t\u00edon&gt; the Constitution, Laws and ByLaws of the Society&gt; the application and medieal examinatioil) or decIaration of insurability, if accepted in lieu of medical examination, signed by tbe applicant&gt; and all amend_ ments to each thereof) the benefit certificate, and any riders attached thereto or endorsements made thereon by the President or Secretary of the Society shall constitute the contract between the Society and the member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVKX\">The widow beneficiary of Farris brought suit in the Florida court and the Society removed to the Federal district court because of diversity. The plaintiff&gt; in ber complaint alleged the issuance of the certificate, the death of the insured and the denial of liability by the Society. The Society answered asserting that the certificate was not in effect because of false statements and representations of the insured in his application. To this the plaintiff filed a reply asserting that the Society had waived and was estopped to assert the defense set forth in its answer because, it was alleged, full disclosures were made by the insured to Miller, the Society\u2019s authorized agent, and no false answers were given nor were any misrepresentations made, that premiums were accepted with knowledge of the insured\u2019s heart condition. At this juncture the Society moved, under Rule 15 Fed.Rules Civ. Proc., 28 U.S.C.A., to file an additional defense, inconsistent with its original defense as is permitted by Rule 8 Fed. Rules Civ.Proe. Leave of court being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>given, the additional defense was filed and by it the Society asserted that Far-ris told Miller of the rheumatic heart condition and Miller processed the application without medical examination, all of which was fraud, collusion and concealment on the part of the insured barring recovery. When all of the evidence had been presented the court declined to submit the Society's additional defense to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">The verdict of the jury having re~ solved the fact issues against the Society, it urges that reversal is required on three grounds; first, that the knowledge of the Society's agent Miller of the heart condition and medical history of the in~ sured Farris is not attributable to the Society; second, that Miller and Farris perpetrated a fraud on the Society; and third, that attorneys' fees are not recoverable in Florida against a fraternal benefit society.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-25\">If the appellant were an insurance company we would have no doubt but that an affirmance would be required by the pronouncements of the Supreme Court of Florida. It has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-30\">\"The law in this state is that when the agent of an insurance company fills in an application for insurance, his act in doing so is the act of the company. If the applicant fully states the facts to the agent at the time and the agent writes the answers incorrectly or contrary to the facts stated by the applicant, the company is estopped from making a defense in an action on the policy by reason of the false answer.\" Stix v. Continental Assur. Co., 147 Fla. 783, 3 So.2d 703, 704.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-44\">In the Stix case the court followed Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. v. Williams, 123 Fla. 560, 167 So. 12, and distinguished Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Hilton-Green, 241 U.S. 613, 36 S.Ct. 676, 60 L.Ed. 1202. The rule was again announced in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-52\">\"In this jurisdiction it is well settled that if the insured gives truthful answers to questions contained in the application for life insurance, and the company's agent, either through fraud or mistake, inserts answers in the application which do not accord with the information given, the insurer cannot insist on breach of warranty, but is estopped from making such defense.\" Colum-bian National Life Ins. Co. v. Lani-gan, 154 Fla. 760, 19 So.2d 67, 70.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-66\">In a later case, Gulf Life insurance Co~ v. Ferguson, Fla., 59 So.2d 371, procedural questions controlled the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-69\">The appellant contends that as it is a fraternal benefit society the rule announced by the Stix case and those following it does not apply. By statute it is provided in Florida</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-74\">\"Except as provided in this chapter, [Fia.Stat.Ann. ch. 637], such societies shall be governed by this chapter, and shall be exempt from all provisions of the insurance laws of this state, not only in governmental relations with the state, but for every other purpose, and no law hereafter enacted shall apply to them, unless they be expressly designated therein.\" Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 637.11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-86\">The Society's Constitution and Laws, quoted supra, deny to its employees, state managers, field men and agents any power to waive any of the conditions upon which beneficiary certificates are issued. So also it is provided that the Articles of Incorporation, Constitution, Laws and By-Laws, the application and medical examination, or declaration of insurability, if accepted in lieu of medical examination, and the certificate shall constitute the contract. The statute authorizes such provisions. The statute declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-100\">\"The constitution and laws of the society may provide that no subordinate body, nor any of its subordinate officers or members shall have the power or authority to waive any of the provisions of the laws and constitution of the society, and the same shall be binding on the society and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>each and every member thereof and on all the beneficiaries of members.\u201d Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 637.30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ8e\">The statute is valid. Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias, etc. v. Moore, 120 Fla. 761, 163 So. 108; Grand Lodge, Knights of Pythias of North America v. McKee, 5 Cir., 1938, 95 F.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"A-4A\"> But when we reach the conclu.sion that Miller, as the Society\u2019s agent, had no right to waive any provision of the Society\u2019s Constitution and Laws, we have not answered the question which is posed by the record. Farris signed a blank form. He gave, or at least the verdict of the jury requires us to assume that he gave Miller the correct answers. It was not shown that he knew or had reason to believe that false answers were to be written in over his signature. The knowledge of Miller, the agent, of the true facts and of the falsity of the answers, is imputed to his principal, the Society. Columbian National Life Ins. Co. v. Lanigan, supra. The Medical Director of the Society testified that all applications were delivered to and exam-med by him, and if he found the applicant to be an acceptable insurance risk he returned the application to the Secretary of the Society for the issuance of a certificate. It is the Society which, having the imputed knowledge of the true facts and of the falsity of the application, waives the requirements and assumes the obligations of the insurance contract. It is the Society which is es-topped to assert a defense by reason of the false answers. Stix v. Continental Assurance Co., supra. The district court properly excluded the fraud issue from consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AU4\">The jury\u2019s verdict and the court\u2019s judgment included an attorneys\u2019 fee of $1,000. The appellant takes the position that no attorneys\u2019 fees are allowable against a fraternal benefit society, and so contending it points again to the statute which exempts such societies from all provisions of the insurance laws except as provided in Chapter 637, and that no law thereafter enacted shall apply to them unless they be expressly named therein. The general statutory law of Florida dealing with insurance contains a provision that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0t\">\u201cUpon the rendition of a judgment or decree by any of the courts of this state against any insurer in favor of the beneficiary under any policy or contract of insurance ex-futed <em>h? </em>such \u201csurer, there shall . \u00b0r decreed against such insurer, and in favor of the beneficiaiy named in said policy or contract \u00ae insurance, a reasonable ^ sum as ^ees or compensation for his attorne^s. or solicitors prosecuting the SU1^ m which the recovery is had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKj9\">\u201cThe amount to be recovered for fees and compensation for attorneys and solicitors against such insurer shall be ascertained and fixed by the court in chancery cases or a jury in common law actions, from testimony adduced for that purpose, and shall be included in the judgment or decree rendered in such cases.\u201d Fla. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 625.08.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ame-dedup-0\">Chapter 637 had itg origin in a compre_ hensive act pagsed in 191B Lawg of Florida, Actg 1915, ch. 6970. At that time attorneys&gt; feeg might be awarded againgt \u00abany Hfe or fire ingurance com_ pany\u00bb. Lawg of Florida\u00a1 Actg of lg93 Cb. 4173. In 1917 thig wag amended so ag to permit recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees againgt \u00bbany pers company; eorpora. t\u00edon&gt; co-partnership, association, fraternal benefit societieg or others \u00bb Laws of Fiorida&gt; Acts of 1917 ch. 7295. In tbe statutory revision of 1941 the quoted wordg inaerted in 1917 were deleted and for them wag substituted \u201cany insurer\u201d, Laws of Florida, Acts of 1941, Ch. 20719. \u201cInsurer\u201d is defined as \u201cany person, firm, partnership, association, corporation or other organization or group who issue, or enter into, contracts or policies of insuranee, indemnity or surety with another who is called the insured.\u201d Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 625.01(6). This definition, adopted by the 1941 compilation, does not ex-pressly designate fraternal benefit societies and, it being subsequent to the 1915 enactment, they would be excluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>it. The 1915 statutes, as amended in the interim, were incorporated in the 1941 compilation. In such a case we look behind the revision to ascertain which act of the legislature is expressive of its intent. See Lykes Bros. v. Bigby, 155 Fla. 580, 21 So.2d 37. We are of the opinion that the statutory provision authorizing recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees does not apply to actions against fraternal benefit societies. In the absence of statutory authority or a contract provision attorneys fees cannot be recovered, 46 C.J.S. Insurance \u00a7 1405b, p. 712.</p>\n<p id=\"ApR\">As to that part of the judgment for the amount of the certificate with interest thereon and costs, it is affirmed; as to that part providing for attorneys\u2019 fees it is reversed. One-sixth of the costs of the appeal shall be taxed to the appellee and the remainder to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"AZC\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
