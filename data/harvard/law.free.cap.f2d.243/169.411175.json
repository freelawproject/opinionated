However, the facts alleged show only controversy as to the title and the right to possession of New York real estate and appurtenances allegedly owned by a church of which the plaintiff is the alleged minister and as to the legality of acts of the defendants in evicting the plaintiff therefrom. Diversity of citizenship was not alleged. Thus the real controversy was essentially local. The assertion that the controversy was one arising under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>laws of the United States is clearly an artificial attempt to create federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The action was rightly dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
