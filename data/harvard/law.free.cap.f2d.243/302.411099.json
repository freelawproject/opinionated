Henry Kutz and Kenneth E. Levin, Attorneys, Department of Justice, Washington, D.

From April 1, 1950 until after the close of 1951, the petitioner was employed at the President Hotel in Long Beach, New York, about 15 miles from his Laurelton home. The petitioner\u2019s employer required him to reside at the hotel during the five or six days&gt; per week that he worked there. A room was furnished by the hotel for living accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">In filing his tax returns for the years 1950 and 1951 O\u2019Toole entered as deductions the traveling expenses between Laurelton and Long Beach, and the cost of his maintenance at Long Beach. Although the petitioner admitted by stipulation, that part of the deductions, representing railroad fares from Long Beach to Laurelton, should be disallowed, he maintains that expenses of $710. and $800. for meals while employed at Long Beach, during 1950 and 1951 respectively, are deductible under \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A). That section allows as deductions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">\u201cAll the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including * * * traveling expenses (including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business -X- -X- <em>&gt;&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Upon these facts the Tax Court found that petitioner\u2019s home, for the purpose of the statute, was at Long Beach where he was engaged in full time employment and that petitioner\u2019s maintaining another home at Laurelton was \u201cimmaterial.\u201d Thus the expenses were not incurred \u201cwhile away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business.\u201d This finding is clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">Though we are becoming more and more a nation of city-hoppers and commuters, \u201ctraveling expenses\u201d including meals, which are incurred in the suburban and exurban commuters\u2019 pattern of life are not deductible if they arise from the taxpayer\u2019s choice not to bring his home close to his place of work. \u201cHome\u201d as used in the statute means the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of business or employment. The job, not the taxpayer\u2019s pattern of living, must require the traveling expenses. Carragan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 246, 249; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Flowers, 1946, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
