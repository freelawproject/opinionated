Rule 56(d), F.R.C.P.\u201d No formal judgment or further action by the court has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-20\"> Judge Dimock\u2019s citation demonstrates what the facts disclose, namely, that this is but \u201ca partial summary judgment,\u201d which, under well settled rules, is not appealable. See Tye v. Hertz Drivurself Stations, 3 Cir., 173 F.2d 317, an action for overtime compensation, and see also, e.g., King v. California Co., 5 Cir., 224 F.2d 193; Wynn v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 9 Cir., 212 F.2d 953, 955-957; Audi Vision, Inc., v. RCA Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 136 F.2d 621, 147 A.L.R. 574; 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 2311 (2d Ed. 1953). We must raise the question even though the parties have not. Tye v. Hertz Drivurself Stations, supra, 3 Cir., 173 F.2d 317. Appeal is therefore premature, before the amount of recovery is fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-21\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
