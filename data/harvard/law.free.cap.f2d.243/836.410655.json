Whaley because he gave testimony adverse to its interests in a prior Board proceeding, and that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the respondent\u2019s motion that the case be remanded for the purpose of taking additional evidence. We further hold that, under the evidence in the record, the Board was warranted in concluding that the discharge of a supervisor for testifying under the Act interfered with, restrained and coerced non-supervisory employees in violation of Sec. 8(a) (1) [See N. L. R. B. v. Tallade-ga Cotton Factory, Inc., 5 Cir., 213 F.2d 209, 215-217, 40 A.L.R.2d 404], and that a contrary conclusion is not required by Section 8(a) (4) of the Act. Compare Pedersen v. N. L. R. B., 2d Cir., 234 F.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">The order is therefore Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">.
