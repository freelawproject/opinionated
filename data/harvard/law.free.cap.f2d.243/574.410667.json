Olivieri, 5 Cir., 202 F.2d 492 and Tucker v. Texas Co., 5 Cir., 203 F.2d 918, together with Thibodaux v. Sun Oil Co., 218 La. 453, 49 So.2d 852, and the other controlling Louisiana cases, and making findings of fact and conclusions of law, granted the motion and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">Seeking reversal of the judgment, plaintiffs are here putting forward three points of error<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, under these points, urging upon us in a scholarly presentation of their views as to the purpose, meaning and effect of the sections under construction, that the district judge gave a wrong construction and application to them, and, therefore reached a wrong result.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">We do not think so. On the contrary, we are of the view that his excellent opinion, detailing the undisputed facts and canvassing and applying the teachings of the cases, correctly construed and applied the Act to the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Accordingly, without undertaking what would be merely a repetitious re-discussion of the record and the cases, we conclude that the judgment was right and that it should be affirmed on the grounds and for the reasons given in the opinion of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AP3\">. \u201c(1) That the court erred in holding that plaintiff, Louis Fontenot, and decedent, Eugene Laviolette, were, as a matter of law, engaged in the trade, business or occupation of defendant, Stanolind Oil Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">\u201c(2) That the court erred in holding that no question of fact for the jury was presented by the pleadings and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-20\">\u201c(3) That the court erred in maintaining defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
