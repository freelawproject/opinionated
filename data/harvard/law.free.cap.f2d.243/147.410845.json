The facts were stipulated and so far as pertinent are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The taxpayer is a Pennsylvania corporation and was organized on October 31, 1939. Its stock is all owned by the West Shenandoah Land Co., another Pennsylvania corporation. On December 30, 1939, the latter deeded the property involved here to the taxpayer in return for the taxpayer\u2019s stock. The property covered by the deed is the southerly portion of that known as the Moore &amp; Miller Tract. The West Shenandoah Land Co. had acquired that tract from the individual owners on December 1, 1938, in an exchange whereby the owners received stock in the West Shenandoah Land Co. in proportion to their respective interests in the tract. Those owners were then holding the tract as heirs or the trustees for heirs of the two individuals who had acquired title to the tract in 1863 and 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The mining of coal from the Moore &amp; Miller Tract first began in 1870 through the operation of three principal collieries known as West Shenandoah, Turkey Run and Kohinoor. Subsequently, in 1874, the Moore &amp; Miller Tract was leased to the Philadelphia and Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company, and the latter company conducted mining, operations thereon until 1938 when it instituted bankruptcy proceedings and had its lease cancelled prior to December 1st of that year. From December 1, 1938 until sometime in 1941, the portion of this tract which is now owned by the taxpayer under its deed of December 30, 1939, was not actively operated. During that period the property comprised underground coal workings which had been worked by the prior lessee, coal, culm and refuse banks placed on the surface of the property by the prior lessee, and coal stripping areas. The coal, culm and refuse banks were accumulated prior to October 1932 and principally between 1902 and 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Under a lease executed February 11, 1941, the taxpayer leased to the Kohinoor Coal Company certain coal, culm and refuse banks which had been accumulated during the course of previous mining operations on the property. This lease and the parties are those referred to in the case of Kohinoor Coal Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 880, certiorari denied 337 U.S. 924, 69 S.Ct. 1168, 93 L.Ed. 1732. On November 15, 1945 the same parties entered into a new lease. The taxpayer on January 13, 1947, leased the remaining portion of its property to the Mahanoy Valley Coal Company. On February 10, 1948 that lease was assigned to the Gilberton Coal Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">During the two taxable years in question all of taxpayer's property was operated under the leases. The lessees were engaged in three operations, namely, the extraction of coal from underground coal workings, the extraction of coal from coal, culm and refuse banks and from coal stripping operations. During each of the taxable years in question the taxpayer received a majority of its coal royalty income from coal extracted from coal, culm and refuse banks by the lessees. The taxpayer, in its income tax returns for these two years, claimed a deduction for percentage depletion based upon 5 percent of the coal royalties earned during the year \u25a0from coal extracted from the coal, culm and refuse banks as well as from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>underground workings and the stripping operations. The Commissioner allowed the deductions for percentage depletion on royalties due from coal extracted from the underground workings and from the stripping operations but disallowed the depletion deductions claimed on royalties due to coal extracted from the coal, culm and refuse banks. He assessed a deficiency for the taxable year 1948 in the sum of $1,655.58 with interest and for the taxable year 1949 in the sum of $1,603.73 with interest. These deficiencies, which were largely due to the disallowance of a portion of the claimed depletion deductions, were paid on September 3, 1952. Claims for refund of taxes attributable to the disallowed deductions were filed on December 15, 1952, and were disallowed on July 2, 1953. The present suit was instituted on July 31, 1953. On consideration of the stipulated facts the district court concluded that the taxpayer was entitled to the depletion deductions with respect to the coal extracted from the coal, culm and refuse banks which the Commissioner had disallowed. The court accordingly entered judgment in favor of the taxpayer. 139 F.Supp. 43. The present appeal by the Government followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The appeal raises the issue whether the district court erred in holding that the taxpayer was entitled to depletion deductions under section 23 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 23 (m) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from royalties received by the taxpayer for coal extracted from coal, culm and refuse banks on its property which had been created many years before in <em>mining </em>operations by lessees of its predecessors in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In Kohinoor Coal Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 880, certiorari denied 337 U.S. 924, 69 S.Ct. 1168, this court had before it a similar claim by a lessee of the present taxpayer. Under its lease Kohinoor had merely the right to load, prepare and take away the coal contained in the coal, culm and refuse banks. We held that since Kohinoor had no economic interest in the coal in place, its interest being confined solely to the coal in the culm or refuse banks which had already been extracted from the earth, it was not entitled to the depletion allowance granted with respect to coal mines by the Internal Revenue Code. Our decision was based upon the firmly settled propositions that an economic interest in a mine is a prerequisite to the allowance of a depletion deduction from the income derived therefrom,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that a culm or refuse bank deposited on the surface in the course of mining operations is not itself a mine within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>meaning of section 23 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We fully adhere to our decision in the Kohinoor case and to the legal premises upon which it was based. However, for reasons which will be stated we cannot accept the argument of the Government that the legal rules applied in that case are applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In the present case the taxpayer is the owner of the co\u00e1l, culm and refuse banks in question, of the land upon which they lie and of the coal mines from which they were extracted. It, therefore, has the economic interest therein which the Internal Revenue Code requires and which Kohinoor as lessee did not have. It is immaterial here that the coal, culm and refuse banks are not themselves mines since the actual mines from which they were extracted are also owned by the taxpayer. The extraction of coal from the banks was but a final step in the process of mining, as defined in section 114(b) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(b) (4) (A, B),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which began when the material comprising the banks was extracted from the mines and deposited on the surface. The royalties received by the taxpayer for the coal extracted from the banks therefore constituted income from mining from which the depletion allowance was deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The fact that an interval of time elapsed between the original mining from the earth of the material comprising the banks and the final extraction of the coal from the banks is immaterial. Commissioner of Internal Rev. v. Kennedy Min. &amp; M. Co., 9 Cir. 1942, 125 F.2d 399. In the ease just cited, which involved a depletion claim in connection with gold mining, Judge Mathews said at page 400:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-17\">\u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s contention must be rejected. The tailings from which the taxpayer derived part of its gross income and all of its net income during 1935 and 1936 were ores. They were ores from the taxpayer\u2019s mine, just as were the newly mined ores which the taxpayer treated in 1935 and 1936. Income derived from the ores called tailings, as well as that derived from the newly mined ores, was income from the mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-18\">\u201cIt is true, but not material, that the ores called tailings were mined prior to 1935. The mining of ores and the receipt of income therefrom are seldom, if ever, simultaneous. The two events are usually months apart and not infrequently years apart. Thus income from a mine during a taxable year may, and usually does, include income from ores mined prior to that year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-19\">\u201cNor is it material that these ores (now called tailings) were, prior to 1935, subjected to treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>whereby part of their gold content was removed. The ores so treated remained after such treatment, as they were before, the property of the taxpayer and were thereafter, as theretofore, ores from the taxpayer\u2019s mine. Income derived from their subsequent treatment was income from the mine, just as was that derived from their first treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We are in accord with these views of our brethren of the Ninth Circuit. The Government, however, urges that it must appear that at the time the operators of the mine brought to the surface the material comprising the banks they had a present intention to extract the coal from the bank material. For this proposition it cites a dictum in Chicago Mines Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Rev., 10 Cir. 1947, 164 F.2d 785, 787, certiorari denied London Exchange Min. Co. v. C. I. R., 333 U.S. 881, 68 S.Ct. 913, 92 L.Ed. 1156. If by this argument it is meant that there must be shown a present intention to proceed with the extraction of the coal from the bank at a definite future time we do not agree. It has long been recognized that the culm and waste banks in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania contain valuable quantities of coal which merely require favorable market conditions to make their extraction economically feasible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It may, therefore, be fairly assumed without proof of a specific subjective intent that the operators of coal mines who deposited this material in banks upon their surface lands did so with the intention of giving it further treatment for the extraction of coal just as soon as and whenever it might prove profitable to them to do so. For certainly one who is operating a mine for profit intends to make every legitimate profit therefrom which is available to him both immediately and in the future. We think it is clear therefore that the extraction of coal by the taxpayer from these coal, culm and refuse banks was hut a continuing step in the original mining operation and that the royalties derived from such extraction accordingly constituted income from mining operations within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We are satisfied that this is so even though the taxpayer was not the owner of the mines when the material constituting the banks was deposited. For as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said in New Idria Quicksilver Mining Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Rev., 1944, 144 F.2d 918, 921, a case involving this very question, \u201cThere is no legal distinction between the rights of the successor in interest and the rights of the original owner with respect to depletion claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The cases of Atlas Milling Co. v. Jones, 10 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 61, certiorari denied 312 U.S. 686, 61 S.Ct. 613, 85 L.Ed. 1124; Consolidated Chollar G. &amp; S. M. Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Rev., 9 Cir., 1943, 133 F.2d 440; Chicago Mines Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Rev., 10 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 785, and Hoban v. Viley, 9 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 459, upon which the Government relies, are clearly distinguishable from the present case since the taxpayers in those cases, just as in the Kohinoor case, were not the owners or successors in interest of the owners of the mines from which the tailings or bank material had come. They, therefore, did not have the requisite economic interest in the mine to support their depletion claims. We think that the same is true of London <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Extension Mining Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 785, a companion case to the Chicago Mines Co. case. But to the extent that the London case denied a depletion allowance to a taxpayer which had an economic interest in the mine from which the material in the bank had come it is in conflict with the rule of the Kennedy and New Idria cases, with which we are in accord, and we do not follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">. \u201c(m) Depletion. In the ease of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary. In any case in which it is ascertained as a result of operations or of development work that the recoverable units are greater or less than the prior estimate thereof, then such prior estimate (but not the basis for depletion) shall be revised and the allowance under this subsection for subsequent taxable years shall be based upon such revised estimate. In the case of leases the deductions shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee. In the case of prope'-ty held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the deduction shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowed to the life tenant. In the case of property held in trust the allowable deduction shall be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trustee in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the instrument creating the trust, or, in the absence of such provisions, on the basis of the trust income allocable to each.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\">.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, cited by the majority, we unequivocally subscribed to these two propositions:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">(1) Coal, culm and refuse banks are not \u201cmines\u201d within the meaning of Section 23 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 [171 F.2d 885] \u201c * * * because they are not a natural mineral deposit\u201d, or otherwise stated, \u201cminerals in place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">(2) Section 114(b) of the 1939 Code, which deals with the basis for depletion, has not-broadened the meaning of the term \u201cmines\u201d in Section 23 (m) to include the extraction and processing of coal from culm or refuse banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The majority adheres to the first proposition but holds to the contrary as to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">That that is so is readily apparent upon comparison with what we said in Kohinoor as to Section 114(b) and what the majority has said on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">In Kohinoor we said, 171 F.2d at page 885:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">\u201cThe taxpayer\u2019s contention here that Section 114(b) (4) (B) * * * has broadened the meaning of the term \u2018mines\u2019 in Section 23 (m) to include'the extraction and processing of coal from a culm bank was also raised in the Chicago Mines case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are in accord with the ruling there that such a contention cannot be sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-15\">\u201cSection 114(b) as amended deals with the <em>basis </em>for depletion, and does not come into play unless the taxpayer has an economic interest in a \u2018mine\u2019 or natural deposit within the meaning of Section 23 (m), which is defined in Treasury Regulations 111 as \u2018minerals in place\u2019. In view of the fact that the culm and refuse banks were not a \u2018mine\u2019 within the meaning of Section 23 (m) because they are not a natural mineral deposit, there is no occasion to ascertain the basis for depletion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">The majority says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-17\">\u201cThe extraction of coal from the banks was but <em>a final step in the process of </em>mining, as defined in section 114(b) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(b) (4) (A, B) which began when the material comprising the banks was extracted from the mines and deposited on the surface. The royalties received by the taxpayer for the coal extracted from the banks therefore constituted income from <em>mining </em>from which the depletion allowance was deductible.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-18\">It must immediately be noted that in the Kohinoor case, 171 F.2d at page 882, we specifically rejected the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the provisions of Section 114(b) (4) extended to \u201c * * * <em>the ordinary treatment processes normally applied by coal mine </em>operators\u201d and were not confined to \u201cthe extraction of ores or minerals from the ground.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-19\">The majority premised its view upon these conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-20\">(1) \u201cIt is immaterial here that ' the coal, culm and refuse banks are not themselves mines since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>actual mines from which they were extracted are also owned by the taxpayer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">(2) \u201cThe fact that an interval of time elapsed between the original mining from the earth of the material comprising the banks and the final extraction of the coal from the banks is immaterial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">(3) \u201cIt may be fairly assumed without proof of a specific subjective intent that the operators of coal mines who deposited this material in banks upon their surface lands did so with the intention of giving it further treatment for the extraction of coal just as soon as and whenever it might prove profitable for them to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">(4) \u201c * * * the extraction of coal by the taxpayer from these coal, culm and refuse banks was but a continuing step in the original mining operation * * * \u201d and that \u201c * * * this is so even though the taxpayer was not the owner of the mines when the material constituting the banks was deposited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The sum of the majority\u2019s position is that culm banks are a \u201cmine\u201d under the 1939 Code if they were deposited from a mine <em>presently owned </em>by a taxpayer irrespective of the time lapse between the deposit and the extraction of the coal from the banks and irrespective of the fact that the taxpayer was not the owner of the original mine source at the time the culm banks came into being.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">In the instant case the culm banks were all accumulated prior to 1932\u2014 <em>principally between 1902 and 1919 </em>\u2014 by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co. which had conducted mining operations under a lease entered into in 1874 (and subsequent renewals) with the then owners. The Philadelphia &amp; Reading was an entity completely independent of control by the lessors. It operated the mines until 1938 when it instituted bankruptcy proceedings and its lease was for that reason terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">Between 1938 and 1941 the mining properties were not actively operated nor were the culm banks. In 1938 the heirs of those who had leased the mines to Philadelphia &amp; Reading in 1874 conveyed their interests to the West Shenandoah Land Co. in exchange for its entire capital stock. In 1939 this company conveyed to the taxpayer part if its mining property (here involved) in exchange for its entire capital stock. In 1941 the taxpayer leased to the Kohinoor Coal Company certain of its culm banks (involved in the Kohinoor case) and in 1945 the parties entered into a <em>new </em>lease under which Kohinoor was given the right not only to work the culm banks involved in the prior lease but also the right to operate the underground coal workings and to conduct strip mining operations. On January 13, 1947, the taxpayer leased the unleased portion of its mining properties to the Mahanoy Valley Coal Company on terms similar to the 1945 lease to Kohinoor. On February 10, 1948 Mahanoy assigned its lease to the Gilberton Coal Company. During the taxable years involved (September 1, 1947-August 31, 1949) all of the taxpayer\u2019s property was operated under the leases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">To say that the extraction of coal in 1948 and 1949 from culm banks accumulated between three and four decades earlier (1902 to 1919) by the then lessee, \u201cwas but a continuing step in the original mining operation\u201d because \u201cit may be fairly assumed without proof of a specific subjective intent that the operators of coal mines who deposited this material in banks upon their surface lands did so with the intention of giving it further treatment for the extraction of coal\u201d is scarcely justifiable. It disregards these well-settled rules (1) in considering tax questions the courts will look to the substance \u2014 the hard realities \u2014and not the shadow, of the situation; (2) tax deductions are permitted as a matter of legislative grace and \u201cdo not turn upon general equitable considerations\u201d and the taxpayer must clearly establish that he or it comes within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>deduction specifically authorized by Congress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In the instant case, under the 1874 and subsequent leases to the Philadelphia <em>&amp; </em>Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co. the then owners of the coal lands here involved had conferred upon their lessees, without reservation, the right to mine these lands and to operate such mines as they deemed proper. They did not reserve to themselves the right to extract coal from culm banks which might be accumulated in the course of the lessee\u2019s mining operations and there can consequently be no assumption that they had \u201ca specific subjective intent\u201d to ultimately extract coal from such banks. Indeed the record discloses that the then lessee-operator had an \u201cexclusive\u201d right to work the culm banks which it accumulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The taxpayer here was clearly not a successor to the rights of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading. Further, it and the West Shenandoah Land Co. from which it acquired title to the coal lands, are not only separate legal entities for tax purposes but both are also separate from the prior individual owners and the taxpayer cannot rely on any rights, assuming they existed, of prior owners in establishing its claim for depletion. The corporate veil will not be pierced in order to permit invocation of the legislative grace of a deduction in the absence of a clear provision permitting it to be done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Apart from the considerations mentioned it is difficult to reconcile the majority\u2019s professed subscription to our holding in the Kohinoor case that culm banks are not \u201cmines\u201d within the meaning of either Section 23(m) or Section 114(b) (4) (B) of the 1939 Code and its ruling that such banks are \u201cmines\u201d within the latter section in the instant case, particularly in view of the fact that the identical culm banks are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">The majority seeks to distinguish the instant case from Kohinoor on the ground that the taxpayer there was merely the lessee of the culm banks and as such had no \u201ceconomic interest in the coal in place\u201d and it says we premised our disallowance of depletion on the absence of such \u201ceconomic interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">I cannot subscribe to that construction of our ruling in the Kohinoor case. We there premised our disposition squarely on the ground that culm banks are not \u201cmines\u201d, viz., \u201cminerals in place\u201d within the meaning of Sections 23 (m) and 114 (b) (4) (B) of the 1939 Code. In doing so we merely observed that even in the case of a \u201cmine\u201d a taxpayer seeking depletion allowance must have an \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in it and noted parenthetically that Kohinoor under its then lease had no \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in the culm banks as to which it claimed depletion. The observation we made on the score of \u201ceconomic interest\u201d was patently, putting it colloquially, \u201cdriving another nail in the coffin\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s contention in view of our holding there that a culm bank is not a \u201cmine\u201d under the 1939 Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">On the score of our ruling in Kohinoor [171 F.2d 885] that culm banks are not \u201cmines\u201d under the 1939 Code because they are not a \u201cnatural mineral deposit\u201d or \u201cminerals in place,\u201d the Supreme Court of the United States has time and again ruled that under the 1939 Code and its predecessors, oil, gas or minerals as to which depletion allowance is sought must be \u201cin place\u201d before the owner of an economic interest therein can receive such allowance. The Supreme Court spoke of \u201core in place\u201d in United States v. Biwabik Mining Co., 1918, 247 U.S. 116, 123, 38 S.Ct. 462, 464, 62 L.Ed. 1017; \u201coil in place\u201d in United States v.

That identification has been necessary because, although the majority did not advert to it, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, for the years following its enactment, specfically provides in Section 611 (a), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(a) that \u201c * * * the term \u2018mines\u2019 includes deposits of waste or residue, the extraction of ores or minerals from which is treated as mining under section 613(c).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The changes made in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 with respect to culm banks are pertinent in the determination of the issue presented in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The Committee on Ways and Means, H. Rep. No. 1337, 83rd Cong., 2d <em>Sess., </em>p. 59, 3 U.S.C. Cong, and Adm. News, 1954, pp. 4017, 4085, in its \u201cGeneral Statement\u201d of its Report (accompanying H.R. 8300) relating to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, specifically stated with respect to Section 613 \u201cMine Tail-ings\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">\u201cDepletion allowances under present law are allowed with respect to mines and natural deposits. In mining operations frequently residue is accumulated which is currently waste material. Subsequently, technological innovations or changes in conditions of supply and demand may make it commercially feasible to recover the mineral content from that residue. <em>Present law has been interpreted to deny depletion allowances with respect to minerals produced from such dumps or tailings.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuAB\">\u201cYour committee\u2019s bill would <em>extend percentage depletion </em>at the appropriate rates to mine owners <em>for minerals recovered from the residue that had accumulated from their mine. </em>It is in the public interest to encourage the production of minerals from these accumulations as well as from the mine itself.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">The same House Report in its \u201cDetailed Discussion of the Technical Provisions of the Bill\u2019, H.Rep. No. 1337, supra, p. A183, 3 U.S.C. Cong, and Adm. News, supra, p. 4323, stated concerning Section 611, \u201cAllowance of deduction for depletion\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-14\">\u201cThis section is derived from section 23 (m) of the 1939 Code. Certain changes in wording and arrangement have been made for the purpose of simplification and consistency <em>but, with one exception, there has been no substantive change in present law. The term \u2018mines\u2019 is defined to include deposits of waste or residue of mines, the extraction of ores or minerals from which is treated as mining under section 613(c).

Thus, a depletion allowance may be permitted when based on the extraction of minerals or ores from waste or residue of mining, such as a tailings dump or a culm bank, <em>if performed by the mine owner or operator </em>* * *\" (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The Senate Finance Committee, S. Rep. 1622, 83rd Cong. 2d Sess., 3 U.S.C. Cong, and Adm. News, 1954, pp. 4621, 4712, in its \u201cGeneral Explanation\u201d of its Report, had this to say with respect to the section in its. Bill dealing with \u201cMine Tailings\u201d, Section 613:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">\u201cDepletion allowances under present law are allowed with respect to mines and natural deposits. The House and your committee\u2019s bill <em>extends percentage depletion </em>at the appropriate rates to mine owners <em>for minerals recovered from the residue </em>that had accumulated from their mine. The provision does not apply in the case of a purchaser of such waste or residue or to a purchaser of rights thereto.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The same Senate Report in its \u201cDetailed Discussion of the Bill\u201d at p. 329, 3 U.S.C. Cong, and Adm.

Section 611 of the House bill made certain clerical changes in existing law, but <em>made no substantive change other than to provide that the term \u2018mines\u2019 includes deposits of waste or residue of mines, </em>the extraction of ores or minerals from which is treated as mining under section 613(c). <em>The effect of this provision of the House bill is to extend allowances for depletion to the extraction of ores or minerals from waste or residue of prior mining.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Again with respect to Section 613, \u201cPercentage depletion\u201d, at page 333, S. Rep. 1622, supra, 3 U.S.C. Cong, and Adm. News, supra, p. 4973, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP5\">\u201cSection 613(c) (3) of the House bill <em>extended depletion </em>to deposits of waste or residue of <em>prior mining </em>by adding a provision that the term \u2018extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground\u2019 includes the extraction by mine owners or operators of ores or minerals from the waste or residue of prior mining.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">It is true, as pointed out by counsel for the taxpayer, that S. Rep. 1622, supra, p. 333, 3 U.S.C. Cong, and Adm. News, 1954, 4621, 4974, states that \u201cNo inference can be drawn from the reclassification of certain minerals and other actions as to the meaning of present law.\u201d Nevertheless, in view of the fact that the issues are specifically admitted and discussed by the House and Senate Reports, it is permissible and proper to draw such inferences. It is clear from the unambiguous statements in the legislative committee reports that the 1954 Code changed the prior law by incorporating in the definition of \u201cmines\u201d culm banks such as are involved in the instant case and specifically \u201cextended\u201d depletion allowance to culm banks. The Government has correctly summarized the taxpayer\u2019s position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>with its statement that the taxpayer seeks to have this Court adopt the 1954 provisions in interpreting Section 23 (m) and Section 114(b) (4) (B) but the 1954 provisions are not retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">One final comment:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">While the 1954 Code makes academic, with respect to the years following its enactment, the issue presented in this appeal, its resolution is of critical importance in the application of the prior revenue laws because of the tremendous scope of culm bank operations prior to 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">For the reasons stated I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-13\">.
