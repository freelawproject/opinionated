On October 5, 1943, they secured a copyright on it in the name of the mother by registering a manuscript copy with the Library of Congress, as provided by \u00a7 11 of the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 12. On December 27, 1943, appellant and his mother entered into a contract with Joseph Carlton, purportedly a publisher, assigning to him their song \u201cincluding the title, words and music thereof, and the right to secure copyright therein throughout the entire world, and to have and to hold the said copyright and all rights of whatsoever nature thereunder existing * i:' * for a period of three years from date of this contract.\u201d Thereafter, Carlton printed 2,500 copies of the song, each copy bearing the notice \u201cCopyright 1944 by Joseph Carlton.\u201d About 2,000 of these copies were distributed to various persons in the music business. On August 1, 1953, appellant obtained from his mother an assignment of the 1943 copyright and recorded the assignment in the Copyright Office as provided by 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 30. Thereafter, as proprietor of that copyright, he brought this suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was grounded on the theory that appellant \u201cis not the proprietor of a valid copyright in the work which he alleges to have been infringed.\u201d That theory is a composite of two contentions: (1) that appellant is not the proprietor of the copyright; and (2) that the copyright is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>The Proprietorship of the Copyright.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> In support of the first contention, appellee argues that the contract with Carlton was an assignment to the latter of the 1943 copyright, so that appellant has no interest to complain of infringement. The contract does not expressly assign the 1943 copyright. Indeed, it does not even mention it. Appellee contends, however, that there was an assignment of <em>all </em>of the owners\u2019 rights in the song, so that the assignment carried with it the copyright. Since the contract shows on its face that it did not assign all of the owners\u2019 rights, we cannot accept appellee\u2019s contention. In the first place, while a copyright runs for 28 years, with a right to renew for an additional 28 years, the rights conveyed to Carlton by this contract were for a term of only three years. Moreover, the licensing powers Carlton received under the contract were narrowly circumscribed by a series of rights reserved to the assignors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the assignors did not assign <em>all </em>of their rights to Carlton, we can imply no assignment of the copyright, for the copyright proprietor \u201cmay transfer the legal title to his copyright only in totality; the copyright may not be split up and partially assigned as to the various rights encompassed therein.\u201d Finkelstein, The Copyright Law \u2014 A Reappraisal, 104 U.Pa.L. Rev. 1025, 1060 (1956).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">\n<em>The Validity of the Copyright.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\"> The contention that the copyright relied on is invalid rests on the statutory requirement that the notice of copyright appearing on copies of a published musical work must correctly state the name of the registered copyright proprietor and the year of the copyright. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 19. Since appellant\u2019s mother remained the registered proprietor of the copyright despite the contract with Carlton3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and since the copyright was secured in 1943, it is claimed that publication of the song with a notice reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201cCopyright 1944 by Joseph Carlton\u201d rendered the copyright invalid and abandoned the song to the public domain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">This contention depends initially upon an assumption that a notice of copyright was required to appear on the copies of appellant\u2019s song.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While such a notice is an indispensable part of the process by which copyrights of <em>published </em>works are secured, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 10, appellant\u2019s copyright was obtained before publication, under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 12, requiring merely the filing in the Copyright Office of an application and a manuscript copy of the song. Section 12 provides, however, that \u201cwhere the work is later reproduced in copies for sale,\u201d the requirement of \u00a7 13 for deposit of copies will apply. That requirement is for the deposit of two copies \u201cwith the notice of copyright as provided in section 10 * * By \u00a7 10, the notice must \u201cbe affixed to each copy * * * published or offered for sale in the United States by authority of the copyright proprietor * * So the printed copies of appellant\u2019s song were required to bear a notice of copyright only if, under the circumstances revealed by the record, (1) they were \u201creproduced for sale\u201d (\u00a7 12) or \u201cpublished or offered for sale\u201d (\u00a7 10); and (2) such reproduction or publication or offering was \u201cby authority of\u201d appellant\u2019s mother, who was the copyright proprietor at the time in question. Since it cannot be concluded from this record, beyond any issue of fact, that either of these conditions was satisfied, the summary judgment entered below cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The terms \u201creproduced for sale\u201d and \u201cpublished\u201d are apparently used interchangeably.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cPublication\u201d is not defined in the Copyright Act. The Act defines \u201cthe date of publication\u201d as \u201cthe earliest date when copies of the first authorized edition were placed on sale, sold, or publicly distributed.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 26. That definition, however, \u201cwas an enactment to fix the date from which the copyright term should begin to run, and not a general definition of what constituted publication.\u201d Cardinal Film Corp. v. Beck, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1918, 248 F. 368; see also Patterson v. Century Productions, 2 Cir., 1937, 93 F.2d 489, 492, certiorari denied 1938, 303 U.S. 655, 58 S.Ct. 759, 82 L.Ed. 1114. What constitutes publication, so as to validate or invalidate a copyright, must be determined, therefore, in each case by considering its facts in the light of the policy of the Copyright Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">A finding that a work has been published may have various effects. It may serve to destroy a common-law copyright, White v. Kimmell, 9 Cir., 193 F.2d 744, certiorari denied 1952, 343 U.S. 957, 72 S.Ct. 1052, 96 L.Ed. 1357, or a statutory copyright secured under \u00a7 12, as\u00eds here contended. On the other hand, it may serve to validate a statutory copyright secured under \u00a7 10, where publication is a necessary precondition. Or it may invalidate a \u00a7 10 copyright where the alleged publication bears a defective notice of copyright. See Heim v. Universal Pictures Co., 2 Cir., 1946, 154 F.2d 480. From the results of the decided cases, the principle is discernible that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>it takes more publication to destroy a common-law copyright than to perfect a statutory copyright.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The late Judge Frank, in his recent opinion in American Visuals Corp v. Holland, 2 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 740, 744, after a most persuasive review of the decisions, articulated the principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\">\u201cCases such as these indicate that, as we said above, the courts apply different tests of publication depending on whether plaintiff is claiming protection because he did not publish and hence has a common law claim of infringement \u2014 in which case the distribution must be quite large to constitute \u2018publication\u2019 \u2014or whether he is claiming under the copyright statute \u2014 in which case the requirements for publication are quite narrow. In each case the courts appear so to treat the concept of \u2018publication\u2019 as to prevent piracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We think the authorities he cites and others warrant the more generalized observation that it takes more in the way of publication to invalidate <em>&lt;my </em>copyright, whether statutory or common law, than to validate it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\"> We cannot conclude from the circumstances appearing on this motion for summary judgment that there was such general publication as to vitiate appellant\u2019s copyright.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> All the record shows is that 2,500 copies of appellant\u2019s song were printed and that some $2,000 of them were distributed to broadcasting stations and professional musicians for \u201cplugging\u201d purposes, chiefly through Broadcast Music Incorporated, named on the copies as a licensing agent. Not a single copy was sold. No license or other permission was given to anyone to perform or otherwise use the song. Nothing was said or done, beyond the described distribution, to give any recipient of a copy the impression that he could make any use of it without first obtaining the proprietor\u2019s license through the stated licensing agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">So far as appears from the record, this distribution was no more a general publication than the sending of samples to dealers for the purpose of enabling them to give orders. Falk v. Gast Lithograph &amp; Engraving Co., 2 Cir., 1893, 54 F. 890, 893.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellee says there was a general publication here because the copies distributed were not labeled \u201cProfessional.\u201d There is no rule of law to that effect. If a trade custom is relied on, it must be proved. On this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>record summary judgment may not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Even if it were possible to conclude that there was a publication of appellant\u2019s song, we think there is an issue of fact as to whether the publication was \u201cby authority of the copyright proprietor,\u201d at that time appellant\u2019s mother. It does not appear from the record that either appellant or his mother authorized Carlton to do anything more than circularize the trade for the purpose of stimulating interest in the song. Although appellant \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the form of notice of copyright Carlton had placed on the copies, both he and his mother \u201cquestioned it and [Carlton] said that was normal procedure.\u201d If it is to be found that there was an authorization of the particular kind of \u201cpublication\u201d Carlton made,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it must be upon more evidence than is contained in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">. The song allegedly infringing the copyright was featured in the motion picture \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d distributed by appellee in 1052. The issue of infringement, though argued by appellee here, was not considered below and is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">. Paragraph 4(m) of the contract provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">\u201cThe Publisher shall not, without the written consent of the Writer (s) in each case, give or grant any right or license (a) to use Hie title of the musical composition, or (b) for the exclusive use of said composition in any form or for any purpose, or for any period of time, or for any territory, or (c) to give a dramatic representation of the said musical composition or to dramatize the plot or story thereof, or (d) for a vocal visual rendition of said composition in synchronization with a motion picture.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-11\">. \u201cIn relation to the right to sue for an infringement, a copyright is an indivisible thing, and cannot be split up and partially assigned either as to time, place, or particular rights or privileges, less than the sum of all the rights comprehended in the copyright [sic]. Certainly the statute authorizing assignments of copyright contains no recognition of such partial assignments. Of course, such exclusive rights may be granted, limited as to time, place, or extent of privileges which the grantee may enjoy; but the better view is that such limited grants operate merely as licenses, and not as technical assignments, although often spoken of as assignments.\u201d M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Pastime Amusement Co., E.D.S.C.1924, 298 F. 470, 474-475, affirmed 4 Cir., 1924, 2 F.2d 1020; Eliot v.
