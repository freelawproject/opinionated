The essential facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">There were formerly four dealers in Packard cars in Baltimore. In 1953 there were three, of which Webster was one. The usual dealer contract in the automobile business, and the contract between Packard and Webster, were for one year, with no option of extension. It was the custom in the business to extend contracts, from year to year, \u201cbarring some reason for cancellation.\u201d Webster and Packard had extended their contracts from year to year a considerable number of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-19\">In 1953 Zell Motor Car Company, the largest of the three Baltimore dealers in Packard cars, told Packard that Zell was losing money and would quit unless Packard gave it an exclusive contract. Packard told Zell it would do so, and told Webster and the other Baltimore dealer that their contracts would not be renewed. After Webster protested and threatened suit, Packard offered Webster the usual one-year renewal but refused to promise more. Packard told Zell, in effect, that this would be Webster\u2019s last renewal. Webster declined Packard\u2019s offer, quit the business, and brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-20\">The District Court submitted to the jury the question whether there was an unreasonable restraint of trade, and also whether there was an agreement or attempt to monopolize. The jury found for the plaintiff and awarded $190,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>damages, which the court trebled in accordance with the statute. Motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial, were denied. The court held that the jury had \u201ca right to reach the conclusion that an agreement on the part of the manufacturer with one of its own dealers to terminate the franchise of all competitors and to grant to him a monopoly within a certain area, is an agreement in unreasonable restraint of trade, or an agreement to monopolize.\u201d Webster Motor Car Co. v. Packard Motor Car Co., D.C., 135 F.Supp. 4, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We think the defendants were entitled to judgment. We agree substantially with Schwing Motor Co. v. Hudson Sales Co., D.C.D.Md.1956, 138 F.Supp. 899, affirmed 4 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">1. There was no monopoly, or attempt or conspiracy to monopolize, within the meaning of the Sherman Act. The cellophane case, which had not been decided when the present case was tried, makes this clear. The Supreme Court there said: \u201cthis power that, let us say, automobile or soft-drink manufacturers have over their trademarked products is not the power that makes an illegal monopoly. Illegal power must be appraised in terms of the competitive market for the product.\u201d And the Court held that \u201cIn considering what is the relevant market for determining the control of price and competition * * * commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes make up that \u2018part of the trade or commerce\u2019, monopolization of which may be illegal.\u201d The Court accordingly held that, although du Pont produced about 75% of the cellophane sold in this country, there was no monopoly, because \u201cthe relevant market\u201d was flexible packaging materials, including such things as glassine, waxed paper, and foil, as well as cellophane, and cellophane accounted for only 17.9% of this market. United States v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., 351 U.S. 377, 393, 395, 399-400, 76 S.Ct. 994, 1006, 1007, 100 L.Ed. 1264. Since there are other cars \u201creasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes\u201d as Packard cars and therefore in competition with Packards, an exclusive contract for marketing Packards does not create a monopoly. And there is no evidence of any attempt or conspiracy to create a monopoly, since there is no evidence of any attempt to get control of the relevant market.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">2. There was no contract or conspiracy in restraint of trade within the meaning of the Sherman Act. As the court informed the jury, it has long been clear that only unreasonable restraints of trade are unlawful. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L.Ed. 619. When an exclusive dealership \u201cis not part and parcel of a scheme to monopolize and effective competition exists at both the seller and buyer levels, the arrangement has invariably been upheld as a reasonable restraint of trade. In short, the rule was virtually one of <em>per se </em>legality\u201d until the District Court decided the present case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of Packard\u2019s 1600 dealers, 1100 were the only Packard dealers in their cities, some of which were nearly as large as Baltimore, and such a ratio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>was typical in the automobile industry. The fact that any other dealers in the same product of the same manufacturer are eliminated does not make an exclusive dealership illegal; it is the essential nature of the arrangement. The fact that Zell asked for the arrangement does not make it illegal. Since the immediate object of an exclusive dealership is to protect the dealer from competition in the manufacturer\u2019s product, it is likely to be the dealer who asks for it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The short of it is that a relatively small manufacturer, competing with large manufacturers, thought it advantageous to retain its largest dealer in Baltimore, and could not do so without agreeing to drop its other Baltimore dealers. To penalize the small manufacturer for competing in this way not only fails to promote the policy of the antitrust laws but defeats it.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">3. Though Packard had formerly expressed an intention not to renew its contract with Webster, Packard offered and Webster refused the usual renewal. That Packard had agreed with Zell not to renew Webster\u2019s contract again when the proffered renewal expired is immaterial, not only because the agreement was legal but also because it inflicted no damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The judgment in favor of Webster is reversed. Webster\u2019s cross-appeal concerning the amount of Webster\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">No. 13152 reversed; No. 13153 dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">.

Cresent City Co., 1884, 111 U.S. 746, 4 S.Ct. 652, 28 L.Ed. 585, concurring opinions of Mr. Justice Field and Mr. Justice Bradley.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b473-9\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AAPU\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Webster and Zell were competing Packard automobile dealers in Baltimore. In 1952 Packard served notice of termination of Webster\u2019s dealership, but then, after Webster\u2019s protest, offered to renew the dealership for only one year without further renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">I think the court properly instructed the jury upon the law applicable to conspiracies or combinations in restraint of trade in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act and that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding in respect thereto. It is therefore unnecessary to decide whether the determination below of a conspiracy to monopolize in violation of \u00a7 2 may also be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">There was evidence that Zell had asked Packard to eliminate Webster as a competing Packard dealer; that Packard had never before considered that one dealer could be adequate representation in Baltimore; that Packard had found Webster to be a satisfactory dealer with a good organization; that there was an \u201cunderstanding\u201d between Zell and Packard, and that Packard had \u201cagreed\u201d with Zell that Webster\u2019s franchise be ended; and that, when Webster balked at his demise and threatened to bring an action for damages, Packard had offered Webster a renewal of its franchise in the usual form for one year, which Packard had agreed with Zell would be a final renewal. As a Packard memorandum put it: \u201cThis * * * was reviewed in detail and agreed to by Mr. Zell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">From this evidence the jury could have found \u2014 as it apparently did \u2014 that Webster\u2019s elimination as a dealer resulted not from a unilateral decision by Packard in selecting its customers, but rather from an agreement between Packard and Zell to eliminate Zell\u2019s competitor and make Zell the sole distributor of Packard cars in Baltimore; in simple terms, that it was an agreement which amounted to a combination or conspiracy to get rid of Webster.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">The \u201ccommon right\u201d of an individual to engage in a lawful calling was pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tected against restraints at common law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is encompassed within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and forms the very basis of the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The purpose of the Act is to protect the individual business man as well as to assure to the consumer the benefits flowing from free competition. Applied to a dealership situation, the Act does not interfere with the manufacturer\u2019s right to select his dealers but it does prevent him from combining and conspiring with one not to deal with another.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Schwing Motor Co. v. Hudson Sales Co., D.C.D.Md.1956, 138 F.Supp. 899, affirmed 4 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 176, disagrees with the decision here under review. The latter case would limit the manufacturer\u2019s right to select his own customers by the requirement that he make no agreement with one to exclude another. Schwing would recognize this limitation only \u201cif the agreement is a horizontal one between competitors, or if the manufacturer dominates the market in the commodity.\u201d 138 F.Supp. at page 906. In this I think Schwing is wrong. The Supreme Court has held that, even apart from monopolistic effect, a <em>vertical </em>agreement which excludes a competitor of one of the parties from a substantial market violates \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">To avoid the application of the Sherman Act Packard contends that, because Webster rejected the proffered one-year renewal, the jury could not find that Packard refused to deal with Webster. But this contention is not persuasive. The record contains ample evidence from which the jury could have found that the renewal offer was not made in good faith, was prompted by Webster\u2019s threat to sue, and resulted from an agreement between Packard and Zell that it would be the last renewal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ACz\">. We are not called upon to decide whether \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act applies to a manufacturer who, after a discussion with one dealer, decides to make the latter his exclusive distributor, cutting off all others, for the purpose of improving the manufacturer\u2019s competitive position vis-a-vis more powerful mamifacturera. Cf. Schwing Motor Oo. v. Hudson Sales Co., D.C.D.Md.1956, 138 F.Supp. 899, 906, affirmed 4 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 176.
