The defendant denied that it was responsible for the default, asserted that it was willing to convey, and counterclaimed for the balance of the purchase price together with damages for alleged fraud on the part of the plaintiff and others.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayg\">mi, \u201e \u201e , , . ., \u201e The case came on to trial before a jury ... , , ,. , . . \u201e which rendered a verdict m favor of the ,, , , . .c... plaintiff for the down payment of $5,000, +t, <em>* A &lt;*in j. </em>interest thereon of $1,375, and $40 out- \u00bb\u201e \u25a0, , L \u25a0 , of-pocket expenses. The jury did not ,, , . ,n award the plaintiff any consequential damages and they found ^ fayor of the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. A judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $6,415 was entered on the verdict. The defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"A58\">We have carefully considered the defendant\u2019s contentions but find them to be without merit and to require no detailed discussion here. It is sufficient to say that the issues in the case were basically factual and were submitted to the jury by Chief Judge Kirkpatrick by interrogatories and a comprehensive charge based upon the applicable law of Pennsyl-vama to which the defendant took no . . valid exceptions. There was ample evi- , , , , dence to support the jury s verdict. It . <em>K </em>, , \u201e , , , must, therefore, stand as a final deter- ... \u201e , \u2019 , , mmation of the controversy between the ,. parties.</p>\n<p id=\"A4s\">In the plaintiff\u2019s brief in this court his counsel made a number of scurrilous and scandalous attacks upon the defendant\u2019s counsel which were wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>improper and to which the latter has quite properly objected. We cannot condone such conduct on the part of a member of our bar. Accordingly on motion of counsel for the defendant the brief filed for the plaintiff appellee in this case will be suppressed and removed from thJ 8 .flleS-, lD ;lddl!fn th6 ?lam' tiff will be denied costs m this court.</p>\n<p id=\"A36\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
