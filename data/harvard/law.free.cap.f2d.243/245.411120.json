We find the order of dismissal proper in all respects, save as to Count II insofar as it is brought against appellees Augie C. Ur-ciolo and J. John Urciolo. As to them, we think, it'cannot be said, as the District Court\u2019s order does, that Count II does \u201cnot state a cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">Count II is denominated \u201cClaim for damages \u2014 fraud, deceit, misrepresentations.\u201d It alleges that (1) appellant was \u201cunskilled\u201d in real estate matters and therefore relied wholly upon the direction, advice and representations of the Urciolos, real estate brokers; (2) they knew of her inexperience and her reliance upon them; (3) to induce her to enter into the real estate exchange here in question, they represented to her, in substance, that the value of the property she was to receive was equivalent to what she was to give for it; (4) they knew or should have known that this representation was false; (5) she relied upon the representation and made the exchange; (6) she \u201chas now learned\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of the falsity of the representation;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (7) by reason of her reliance on the false representation, she paid some $20,-000 for property worth only $14,000. There are thus alleged in this count all of the elements of a fraud complaint. Southern Development Co. of Nevada v. Silva, 1888, 125 U.S. 247, 250, 8 S.Ct. 881, 31 L.Ed. 678. We think \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud\u201d have been stated with sufficient particularity to save the count against a motion to dismiss. Rule 9(b), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A.; Brady v. Games, 1942, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 47, 128 F.2d 754. Deficiencies in appellant\u2019s case against the brokers may, of course, appear in subsequent proceedings. We hold only that their motion to dismiss should not have been granted as to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-14\">. This allegation of discovery of the alleged fraud contemporaneously with the filing of a complaint disposes of appellees\u2019 contention based on the statute of limitations, D.C.Code, \u00a7 12-201 (1951), at least for purposes of the motion to dismiss. See Wiren v. Paramount Pictures, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 347, 206 F.2d 465.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
