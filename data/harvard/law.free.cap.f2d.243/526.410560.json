On motion for a new trial, the-district court entered judgment for $25,-000 without obtaining the consent of appellant, concluding that in view of the testimony on the extent of injury the-\u201cverdict was so excessive as to shock the conscience of the Court.\u201d There-is no question under these circumstances-that the trial judge had the discretionary power to order a new trial, but the district court committed error by reducing the verdict without giving appellant the-option of either accepting a remittitur or of having a new trial.
