Testimony from them was obviously necessary and appropriate, since the defendants controlled the corporate books. Denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for a bill of particulars was quite proper, particularly in view of the extensive details supplied defendants by the United States Attorney. There was no error in the admission of testimony, including a defense witness\u2019 prior statement, with a portion shown to have been deleted, as it had been because of defense objections. The trial conduct of the prosecuting attorney was unexceptionable and the judge\u2019s charge fair and adequate. The appeal is quite without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
