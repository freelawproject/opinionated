On September 21, 1952 he was working on making up a train consisting of a large string of electric, self-propelled, multiple-unit cars. As he inserted one end of the buss jumper into car number 359 the free end of the jumper made contact with the grab iron of the car and caused a flash explosion which burned his face and hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Guegan alleged that the head of the buss jumper must have been defective in order for the accident to have occurred. He testified that it was his job to inspect the jumper to make sure no foreign matter was in the head and that he had done so, finding nothing wrong. The defendant\u2019s expert witness testified that there was no structural defect in <em>the </em>jumper itself, and the flash could have been caused by the presence of some foreign substance in the jumper head such as moist earth, which would act as a conductor of electricity. Therefore from all the testimony and from examination of the actual jumper head presented in evidence, the jury could have found that there was no structural defect in the jumper at the time of the accident, and that some dirt or foreign object could have caused the spark. Hence they could have further found that the injury to plaintiff was not due to the negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">These were the issues which were clearly set forth in the judge\u2019s charge. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel took no exception to the judge\u2019s charge insofar as it dealt with causation or proof of facts constituting negligence. Likewise, no exception was taken to the judge\u2019s supplemental charge to the jurors in answer to a note from them after they had deliberated for almost three hours. The note indicated that the jury had drawn the conclusion that the jumper was not defective, as it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201cYour Honor, the jury is in agreement that the buss jumper in question was not defective at the time of the accident. The jury would like to know whether this constitutes final decision or whether it is then in order to decide if there was other contributory negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akp-dedup-0\">Judge Palmieri then commented on this intermediate report and reviewed for the jury the other matters to be considered before reporting a general verdict. No exception was taken to these proceedings or to any part of the judge\u2019s supplemental instructions. The jury retired and, after deliberating further for thirty-eight minutes, reported a general verdict for the defendant. As we have said, this verdict was not contrary to the \u25a0weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">At the conclusion of the case the plaintiff requested a charge that the self-propelled car was a locomotive under 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23. Judge Palmieri refused to so charge, saying that he did not believe that a self-propelling car came within the intent or purview of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">Although plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the district court referred to this section as being a part of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq., it is not a part of that Act. Section 23 is part of a statute of 1911 which, with subsequent amendments, is known as the Federal Boiler Inspection Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 22-34. In order to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, negligence must be shown, whereas the Boiler Inspection Act imposes an absolute liability if it be shown that the locomotive was not in proper condition and safe to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The plaintiff brought suit under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act; the second paragraph of the complaint so states. Paragraph Eleventh alleges that the injuries were caused by reason of the railroad\u2019s negligent operation and maintenance of its cars, appliances and equipment. The defendant\u2019s answer alleged that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff \u201cwere brought about or contributed to by reason of his own negligence.\u201d The trial was addressed to these issues of negligence and contributory negligence and the evidence was adduced and witnesses were examined as if the suit were based on the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. This was a sufficient and a compelling reason for the judge to deny the request to charge. Moreover, neither party offered evidence or argument on which the trial court could properly determine whether the self-propelled car, under the circumstances of this case, was a locomotive within the meaning of 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
