The Tax Court held that it was such income and upheld the Commissioner\u2019s computation of the taxpayers\u2019 income tax liability for the year <em>1951 </em>on that basis. In so doing the Court followed and applied the decision of our brethren of the Second Circuit in Folker v. Johnson, 1956, 230 F.2d 906, in which this question was squarely raised and decided. We find ourselves in complete accord with the conclusions reached in that case and think it unnecessary to elaborate them here. It is sufficient to say that the decision under review must be affirmed upon the authority of that case and that to the extent that Hughes v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 1930, 38 F.2d 755, decides otherwise we think it wrongly decided and do not choose to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
