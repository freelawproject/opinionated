He also found that, the employee\u2019s post-injury wages do not. fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity, and therefore fixed the wage-earning capacity at $54.90. The-award was based thereon, although wages-actually received before and after the injury were higher than this figure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(h). This conclusion, like a determination of whether-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>certain conduct is covered by the Act, \u201cconcerns a combination of happenings and the inferences drawn from them. In part, at least, the inferences presuppose applicable standards for assessing the simple, external facts. Yet the standards are not so severable from the experience of industry nor of such a nature as to be peculiarly appropriate for independent judicial ascertainment as \u2018questions of law.\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Leary v.
