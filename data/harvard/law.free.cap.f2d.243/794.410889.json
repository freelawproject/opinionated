The Tug Pejepscot, proceeding north, passed through the bridge as the draw opened and continued at full speed of about 8 knots on a course set to clear the Catherine McAllister\u2019s stern by 50-75 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>The evidence, although highly conflicting, supported the critical findings (1) that the Catherine McAllister was at fault in that she backed into the course of the approaching Pejepscot without sounding an alarm signal, and (2) that the Pejepscot was equally at fault in that she set a course dangerously close to the Catherine McAllister and continued thereon at full speed after the Mc-Allister began backing and until the collision was inevitable. We cannot say that these findings were clearly erroneous. McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
