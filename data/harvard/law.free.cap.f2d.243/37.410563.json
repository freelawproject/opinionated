It urges that the Division Engineer was not a duly authorized representative of the Under Secretary as the latter had never delegated to the Division Engineer the discretionary right, acquired by the agreement, to reopen the renegotiation. The delegation of authority under which the Division Engineer had entered into the agreement was rescinded by a new delegation of February 26, 1944. Whatever authority the Division Engineer had at the time of the attempt to reopen must stem from this new delegation. It includes the authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amx\">\u201cto reopen renegotiation with the contractor or subcontractor in cases in which the renegotiation agreement permits such reopening after statements showing the actual result of operations covered by the renegotiation agreement become available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Petitioner contends that this applies only to agreements entered into subsequent to the delegation since the subject of the delegation was the Under Secretary\u2019s authority under the Renegotiation Act and not authority granted him by a contract entered into previous to the delegation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His contractual authority, however, was derived from his statutory authority to insert the reopening clause in renegotiation agreements, section 403(c) (4) of the Renegotiation Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 984, 50 U.S.C.Appendix, \u00a7 1191 (1952), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1191. A delegation of this statutory authority, containing an explicit grant of the right to reopen renegotiation under agreements of this kind, must be deemed to include a delegation to reopen this agreement even though it was concluded before the date of the delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">2. Petitioner also contends that the Division Engineer\u2019s letter of June 5, 1944 did not constitute a reopening, even if he had the requisite authority. We lack jurisdiction to review this question. See section 403(e) (1) of the Act. In United States v. Martin Wunderlich Co., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 8, 211 F.2d 433, and also in United States v. Northwest Automatic Products Corp., 100 U.S.App.D.C.-, 241 F.2d 439, we held that we have no jurisdiction to review a determination of the Tax Court as to the timeliness or commencement of a renegotiation proceeding. And see United States v. California Eastern Line, 348 U.S. 351, 354, 75 S.Ct. 419, 99 L.Ed. 383. The question whether or not the letter of June 5, 1944, constituted a reopening of renegotiation we think is jurisdiction-ally indistinguishable from the question of timeliness or commencement involved in Wunderlich and Northwest Automatic Products.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\">. Hanlon-Waters, Inc., v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 5, 222 F.2d 798. Details of the agreement are contained in that opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-16\">. Paragraph VI provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-17\">\u201cThe finding herein shall be deemed a final and conclusive determination of the profits of contractor * * * subject to the right of the Under Secretary of War or Ms duly authorized representative, (a) to reopen the renegotiation in his discretion at any time within sixty (60) days after the contractor shall have filed with the Under Secretary of War a statement of financial statements provided for in Paragraph V herein, if the actual figures * * * prove to be materially at variance with the estimates on which finding herein was based * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-31\">.
