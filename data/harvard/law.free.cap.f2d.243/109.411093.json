We are, upon the present record, without adequate information to weigh the legal and equitable rights of the various claimants against the assets in the hands of the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">Except as herein modified, our opinion upon original submission is reaffirmed, and appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
