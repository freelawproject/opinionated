The other, for sale of a certain adulterated article of food, to wit, one and more quarts of milk from which a certain valuable and necessary constituent and ingredient had been in part abstracted. The plea was not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-11\">It appeared from the evidence that this was an effort to convict a milk dealer in the city of Philadelphia of a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment or both, for selling, as skimmed milk, milk from which the cream or butter fat, or the greater proportion thereof, had been removed by means of what is technically known as the separator or centrifugal process in contradistinction to other processes for producing a like result, such as 'hand skimming, the Cooley process of deep setting, etc. The prosecution was brought under the Act of General Assembly of June 26,1895, P. L. 317, popularly known as the Pure Food Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-12\">The defendant had been conducting the milk business at 1333 South Juniper street, Philadelphia, continuously since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>1877. In the month of October, 1895, the chief inspector of milk under the board of health of the city of Philadelphia took, at the bakery of Louis J. Kolb, 1409 South Tenth street, Philadelphia, certain samples of milk out of some nine forty-quart cans said to have been delivered from Mrs. Hufnals, and, upon analysis of these samples, procured her arrest and prosecution. These samples yielded, according to the analysis of the chemist of the board of health, 9.48 per cent total solids, of which .34 of one per cent was butter fat and 9.09 per cent solids not fat. The percentage of ash, constituting a part of the solids not fat, was .71 of one per cent. This analysis disclosed a percentage of total solids, and of solids not fat, above that required for skimmed milk by Ordinance of City Councils, approved September 23, 1890 (0. 297), and entitled \u201c An ordinance to prohibit the sale of adulterated milk in the city of Philadelphia,\u201d which ordinance was printed and circulated amongst the milk trade under the supervision of the board of health. An offer on behalf of the defendant to prove such ordinance and the fact of such circulation was rejected by the court upon the trial of the c.ause. The milk was contained in cans conspicuously labeled \u201c skimmed milk,\u201d as required by the ordinance. The commonwealth offered no evidence that the milk in question was different from other skimmed milk, containing a like percentage of total solids, obtained by any process in vogue for effecting a removal of the cream, or butter fat, from the whole milk. The only proof, apart from the voluntary admissions of the defendant herself, offered to show that the milk was obtained by a process of centrifugal separation, was the analysis above given and the inferences of the witnesses drawn therefrom, and from the general appearance of the milk. The defendant admitted that the milk had been delivered by her to the bakery : that it was milk obtained by the centrifugal, or so-called separator, process of removing the cream from the whole milk, and that it was obtained by her from a creamery in Delaware county in the same condition in which it was delivered to her customer. She also admitted that she delivered to the same bakery large quantities of such milk daily during certain seasons of the year, when the exigencies of the trade made it needful for her so to do, by reason of the general scarcity of milk, and her inability in consequence thereof, to produce at her own establishment from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>whole milk received by her sufficient quantities of skimmed milk to meet the demands of her customers for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\">Louis J. Kolb, the proprietor of the bakery at which the samples of milk were obtained, testified that he received from the defendant some five or six hundred quarts of milk daily for use in his bakery; that the milk received by him was skimmed milk, and that, at certain seasons of the year, this milk was so-called separator-skimmed milk, or milk from which the cream had been removed by the centrifugal process, and that it was delivered to him with' his full knowledge of that fact. It was also testified on the trial of the cause that there are in use amongst dairy and creamery people three general processes for the removal of the cream or butter fat, or certain portions thereof, from milk as obtained from the cow (or, as it is designated by the trade and dairy experts, \u201cwhole milk\u201d), namely, 1. The old and familiar process of setting the milk away in shallow pans until the cream, or fat globules, rise to the surface, when they are removed by a hand skimmer or ladle; 2. The Cooley and other deep-setting processes, wherein the milk is placed, immediately after being drawn from the cows, in large, deep vessels, so arranged that they can be surrounded with iced water, and thus rapidly cooled, whereby the rising of the cream or fat globules to the surface of the vessels is facilitated and hastened, and the separation rendered more complete. In this process, instead of removing the cream as in ordinary hand skimming by a ladle or skimmer, the milk is usually drawn off by means of a tube and spiggot from the bottom of the vessels leaving the cream as a residuum in the vessels themselves. 3. The separator or centrifugal process, wherein the milk soon after being drawn from the cow, or at any other time before coagulation takes place, is delivered by a tube, as a continuously-flowing stream, into a so-called separator bowl, which is caused to rotate at a high rate of speed, whereby, through centrifugal action, <em>the </em>milk and cream are parted from each other and discharged in small streams from separate outlets provided for them. An offer on behalf of the defendant to demonstrate the character of the last mentioned process, and show the real nature of its action upon the milk, was rejected by the trial judge, and an exception taken and allowed to his ruling therein. It was also testified that the skimmed milk obtained by these several processes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>separation is, in each case, essentially the same product, except as they may vary in the percentage of cream or butter fat remaining in one or the other, and except that the milk obtained by the separator process, under like conditions of cleanliness, is freer than the others from foreign contaminating matter and bacteria of various kinds generally present in milk products. It was also testified that a more or less perfect separation of the milk and cream can be effected by any of the foregoing processes, but that the last mentioned, or centrifugal process, is, under ordinary conditions, the most effective in removing the cream or butter fat where a perfect separation is the object in view; that by the second or deep-setting process, a separation almost as complete can be secured; and that, by careful man ipulation, under favorable conditions, nearly as perfect a separation can sometimes be obtained by the old hand-skimming operation. The general object where any of the processes are used is, to remove from the rest of the milk all the cream which can be obtained within the limits of a wise commercial economy. The centrifugal process, in common with the others, can be so used as to remove any desired proportion of the cream from the whole milk, thus obtaining both cream and skimmed milk of varying degrees of richness, so far as butter fat is concerned, down to the limit of effectiveness, which in every instance in dairy practice falls short of a perfect separation. Yerdict of guilty and sentence thereon to pay a fine of $50.00 and costs of prosecution, and stand committed until the judgment be fully complied with. i</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-3\">The court, Hake, P. J., charged the jury as follows: There is no doubt of the principle which the counsel for the defendant has advanced, or, rather, of the fact which he has stated, that in the course of time the meanings of words often undergo a gradual modification, so that a word which at one time designates a particular article or commodity, may at length come to be understood as meaning something quite different. There is, however, at the same time, always a presumption that the meaning has remained unchanged. As we see in the case of our own language words mean pretty much the same thing to-day as they did in the days of Shakespeare and Milton, as for instance, sugar, milk, water, bread and butter, flour, trees and a variety of other thing's. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>[Therefore, speaking from our own knowledge, and we- have a right in such matters as the ordinary usage of words, to speak from our own knowledge as well as from any evidence heard before us, we have reason to believe, and perhaps to know, that twenty years ago \u201c to skim \u201d had a definite meaning, and that \u201c skimming \u201d was a process of a particular kind by which matter on the surface of any fluid, which it was desirable to remove, could be taken off by some appropriate implement, such as a large spoon or perhaps a ladle, or some other utensil adapted to the purpose, and that milk when treated in this mannner was said to be \u201cskimmed,\u201d and when sold was known as \u201c skimmed milk.\u201d We shall not readily believe that the term \u201c skimmed milk \u201d means anything different from what it used to mean, or that milk which has been treated by a different process and is a different article, by reason of the entire absence of a valuable ingredient, can come under the designation of \u201c skimmed milk.\u201d] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-4\">[It does not follow that because a man is an expert chemist or mathematician that he is an expert in the use of language, and, therefore, when a man was produced here who did not profess to be a philologist, or specially skilled in the study and meaning of words, and, from his knowledge of chemistry, was asked to say what \u201cskimmed milk\u201d is, I considered that he was not an expert to that end and ruled out his testimony. But books may treat scientifically of the meaning of words, and where the men who write them may be supposed to speak after careful investigation and thorough study, such books become authorities upon the subjects treated in them. Therefore, independently of what the jury or the judge would probably and presumably assert without hesitation to be the meaning of \u201c skimmed,\u201d or the meaning of \u201c skimmed milk,\u201d a dictionary may be resorted to as an authority for the purpose of confirming, or, may be, to some extent, if it should so follow, of shaking the impressions antecedently carried in our own minds. Looking at one of these dictionaries, you will observe that the definition of \u201cskimming\u201d and of what is done \u201cskimmingly,\u201d and of what has been done to milk when it has been \u201cskimmed,\u201d is throughout the same. That is, that \u201c skimming \u201d is the application superficially of some appropriate means to take off from the surface of a liquid that which it is not thought desir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>able to have remain, or which is to be abstracted in view of its valuable qualities. If this definition be entirely' correct, the question, What is shimmed milk? is easily settled. It is milk which has been superficially deprived of its cream by the use of something which answers the purpose of a skimmer. If, however, for this method of superficially removing the cream from the milk you substitute some other process, the question arises whether the milk left as the result of such process should be called \u201c skimmed milk.\u201d It may possibly give room for inquiry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-3\">One of the first things for consideration is whether the process is the same, or whether it is actually a new process, acting differently and not upon the surface nor so as to separate what is superficial from what lies below. If different forces are employed, as, for instance, the centrifugal force of rotation, that would be a reason for supposing that 'the result is not the same; that what is produced by the centrifugal force whirling the milk around and around may not be the same thing as that which results from the application of a ladle or spoon to remove what of its own nature and by the operation of natural forces has arisen to the top of the liquid and is then in a condition to be removed. But, if in addition to this difference of process, when we come to examine the thing produced, we find that the result is not the same, that there is a material point of difference, not only in the means employed, but in the product itself, then I think we shall have reason to suppose that such product is not that which is generally known as \u201c skimmed milk,\u201d but that it should have some other designation, if an accurate meaning is to be conveyed to the minds of the hearers, and in the case of a sale, if the purchasers and consumers are to understand what is offered to them by the dealers.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\">[Whether the introduction of a new process varies the result so that milk from which the cream had been extracted by the new method could or could not be properly called skimmed milk does not arise here. You are all familiar with the method in which milk is set for cream and allowed to cool, and the separation which takes place by levity of the cream from the milk and how it is then removed by a spoon or ladle. If you were to substitute for that method a process like the Cooley process, where the milk is cooled and the cream allowed to rise of its own motion to the top, as in the old method, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the simple difference that instead of raising the cream off the surface of the milk, you allow the milk to flow out below through a narrowing channel, so that you really get the superficial part, what is on top, separted from the rest, which flows out below, and I were asked whether the milk so obtained would be \u201c skimmed milk,\u201d within the proper meaning of the term, so that it could be properly sold as such by a vendor, I could not answer that question until it had been ascertained whether the product was substantially the same as if the cream had been removed by skimming, and if such proved to be the fact, that is-to say, if the ratio or proportion of cream remaining in the milk after the Cooley process was the same, or nearly the same, as that remaining after the milk had been skimmed in the old method, then I would incline to the conclusion that it might be called skimmed milk, because the scum on top had been removed, although in a different way. But that is not the case here. The question is not with regard to milk obtained by the Cooley process. It is in regard to milk obtained by a process radically different; not a process which allows the cream to rise by its own levity to the top, there to be superficially removed; or a process by which all that is merely milk is drawn off from below, leaving a scum on top, so that there is effected a separation of the scum, or what rises, from that which remains below, although in a somewhat different'way; but it is a process in which the whole body of the milk is subjected to a centrifugal force which operates on every particle of the liquid, which propels each particle to the side, and, as it is said, drives off all the lighter particles, including the cream, or so nearly all, that what remains is not worth considering. This process, I should say, the means being different and the result different, is not skimming. Milk so treated is not skimmed milk, and, therefore, cannot properly take its place in the ranks of skimmed milk for the purposes of sale.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\">It is, no doubt, true that various products may be obtained from the same substance by the abstraction of one or more of its valuable ingredients, and yet that no law has been made, and that no law ought to be made, to interfere with their sale. It is not worth while to consider whether the manufacturer of chocolate falls within that rule, or whether it would apply to the different grades of flour. You could not have a better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>instance of the application of the principle that it is not necessarily wrong to abstract a valuable ingredient from any substance, and to sell the residue, than in the case of milk itself which may be legally sold, although a part or the whole of the cream has been removed by skimming, or in any other way. If the liquid which remains after the entire or partial abstraction of the cream be subjected to the action of rennet, there is another separation into curds and whey. In all these cases valuable elements have been abstracted, and yet the product may be sold under its appropriate name, which can mislead no one. The whole milk, milk which has been skimmed and thus lost so much of its cream as floats upon the surface, milk which has been whirled in a separator and lost all its cream, and finally milk which has been separated into curds and whey may each be sold under its proper designation. I would not say that the legislature could not prohibit such sale, but it certainly could not do so wisely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-3\">What the legislature has endeavored to secure in this enactment is that each of them shall be sold under its proper name; that each shall be sold so as to indicate fairly to the buyer that he is getting something different from that which the article was before the separation was effected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">When milk is sold as milk, simply and purely, everyone knows what he has a right to expect, and if that which is sold is not whole milk, a wrong is done to the purchaser, and the case is within the statute if it is adulterated either by the addition of water or by the abstraction of solid matter. Skimmed milk has lost a portion of a valuable ingredient, but the name carries notice of that fact with it. Everybody of common sense who buys skimmed milk knows he is buying milk which has lost some valuable portion of its original ingredients. There is no deception, because he knows he is to pay less and get a different thing, a thing in general less nutritious, but which in some particular cases may be better. So a man who buys separator milk, which has been properly labeled, might not know the exact fact that from that milk all the cream had been withdrawn, but he would know that there had been a separation, and if he did not choose to inquire more closely it would be his own fault, and finally in a very little while this particular product, being sold as separator milk, would become known as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>such, and would be bought and sold for just what it is, with reference to the amount paid and the particular article received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-4\">I need hardly go further, for I have sufficiently pointed out the idea. If a man sells the curds which he has taken out of the milk and then sells the whey which is left, everybody knows that whey means something from which the curds has been withdrawn. No man could be held liable uiider the statute because he was selling whey which he had obtained by withdrawing from the milk, by a process of cheesemaking, something which was very valuable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">What the legislature intended was this: That any particular product which differs from that which has hitherto been known under a certain name in being less valuable by reason of the abstraction of some ingredient, shall not be sold under that name. It must be given some name which will carry warning with it, which will prevent the public from being imposed upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">[It seems that, within a few years, that which could not be thoroughly effected before, has been accomplished by a new process of separation, and while, taking the average, milk that was skimmed contained two fifths as much cream as it did before skimming, it is possible by this process to take all the cream out, leaving the cheesy matter practically untouched. The product of this process should, therefore, be sold for what it is, a new product, so that everybody may know it.] [10] The statute does not forbid the process by which it is produced, by which it came into vogue, any more than it prohibits the sale of cheese because cheese has lost a portion of the matter which was originally in the milk and is now whey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">[It seems to me, therefore, if you come to the conclusion that skimmed milk means milk which has been skimmed, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, by the removal superficially of the scum or cream that has risen to the surface, and that it has certain valuable ingredients always present to an appreciable or to a large extent; and that the removal of the cream by the separator process, while it affects the 'taste and appearance of the milk to some degree, yet does not so materially do so as to put everyone on his guard, but does really diminish the nutritive properties of the article produced by the abstraction of all the cream instead of leaving two fifths thereof in-the milk, your verdict should be for the commonwealth, if the article was sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>generally as skimmed milk, because the new product does not answer to the old name, because it bas been obtained by the entire abstraction of a valuable ingredient, and because, although it may be useful for some purposes it is not as useful for other purposes, and, finally, because it is the right of the buyer or consumer, when he goes to buy, to- get what he wants. If he wants something which is not forbidden by law and which suits his palate, though it may not be quite as good as something else, he is entitled to get it. But he is not to be palmed off with a different thing, because there is evidence that for some purposes that different thing is as good as anything else. In point of fact, in this case, we have positive proof that for general purposes milk which loses part of its cream is rendered thereby less valuable. A valuable ingredient is partially gone, and the legislature forbids its sale for the thing that it was before such valuable ingredient was removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\">If it then be subjected to another process and what is left of the valuable ingredient be also taken out, and it is then sold for what it was before, this is also-a breach of the legislative enactment, and if the jury find that this has occurred in the present case, their verdict should he for the commonwealth.] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\">I do not understand the defense to deny the proposition that,if a man should skim milk carefully and exactly, and remove all the cream that he could get by that process and leave what would undoubtedly be skimmed milk, containing, we will say, two fifths of all the cream originally in the milk, and then should hand it over to the separator process and, by subjecting it to a very different force, take all the rest of the cream out, he would thereby have made a change in the conditions of the substance which would not leave him entitled to sell it for what it was before the second change was made. I suppose that would be conceded by the defense, but, whether it is or not, I think if a man, after skimming the milk and removing all the cream he could get off in that way, should say, \u201c There is something left here which I might turn to account and yet sell this milk for as much as I did before; now, I will put it into this separator and get all the cream out and still call it skimmed milk, and put it on the market with the chance of getting the same price; I won\u2019t call it separator milk, because that will put people on their guard.\u201d I think, I say, that would be a case really against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>statute, and. it cannot be right, because the result is the same price for a different article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-4\">Again, if the effect of the separator process had been to take out all the cheese as well as all the cream, or a part of the cheese and a part of the cream, I do not understand the defense to deny that it would be a violation of the statute to sell such product as skimmed milk, or to claim that in such case the defense could rely on the fact that the value had not been changed, and say: \u201c There is too much cheese in milk, the stomach won\u2019t bear it.\u201d The question would be: \u201c Have you taken out some portion of the cheese which was originally there, and do you call it the same thing after the cheese is gone ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-5\">[If taking .part of the cheese from the milk and selling it still as skimmed milk, or by any other name you pleased, that did not indicate the result, would be a breach of the statute, why is the removal of the remaining part of the cream not a violation of the statute also ?] [12]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-6\">[I do'not know in this instance that it is expressly contended that this defendant did not sell contrary to the statute. It is said the person to whom she sold knew all about it. But the act does not say after you have effected a change you may sell it to people who know all about it. It says it shall not be done, and for a very good reason, because you ought to sell it by some name that would signify what it really is.

L. p. 317. The errors in this respect (that is, the errors of interpretation,) complained of may be most appropriately divided into two classes, although they are closely intertwined with each other and in great part infringe against the same principles of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-10\">1. Those which have led to the conclusion on the part of the court, and to the instruction to the jury, that the sale of skimmed milk obtained by the separator, or centrifugal process, when sold as \u201c skimmed milk,\u201d is a sale forbidden by the act in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-11\">2. Those which have led to the conclusion on the part of the court, and to the instruction to the jury, that the defendant should be convicted under the act, although every imputation of a \u201c guilty mind \u201d on her part had been completely negatived, and there remained no semblance of an intent by her to defraud or deceive, or purvey to her customers an article either injurious or unwholesome in itself, or misrepresented as to its true nature and quality. (See particularly the 13th and 14th specifications of error.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-12\">It is a cardinal and elementary principle of interpretation that penal statutes are to be construed strictly: U. S. v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76; Bucher v. Com., 103 Pa. 528; Warner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>v. Com., 1 Pa. 154; United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482; Stewart v. Com., 10 Watts, 306.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-3\">It is equally a principle o\u00ed law, applicable to the interpretation of statutes, alike consonant with common sense and common justice and founded upon necessity and reason, that, in determining what is the general object of the legislature, or the meaning of its language in any particular passage, that intention and that meaning which appears to be most agreeable to convenience, justice and reason, should in all cases open to doubt be presumed to be the true one. See Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 245: Bishop on Statutory Crimes, (2d ed.,) sec. 82; 1 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\">The cases in which the courts have made a practical application of these principles, in their various phases, to the interpretation of statutes are almost without number: Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., 152 U. S. 197; United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358; Phila. v. Ridge Ave. Railway Co., 102 Pa. 190; Oates v. Bank, 100 U. S. 239. See, also, as cases more or less fully illustrating these principles: Reiche v. Smythe, 13 Wall. 162; United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 91 U. S. 72; Aldridge v. Williams, 3 How. 9; Murray v. Gibson, 15 Plow. 421; Hines v. R. R. Co., 95 N. C. 434; Vane v. Vane L. R., 8 Ch. 383; Clohessy v. Roedelheim, 99 Pa. 56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">There is another principle of law, not specifically or exclusively a principle of statutory interpretation, but, nevertheless, one of importance in its bearing upon the meaning of the act here under consideration. It is thus briefly stated by Mr. Bishop, in his New Criminal Law, sec. 287: \u201c There can be no crime large or small, without an evil mind.\u201d See also sec. 303 A, n. 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">Does the act forbid the sale, under the generic name of \u201c skimmed milk,\u201d of milk which has been skimmed, or had a part or the whole of the cream or butter fat removed from it by the centrifugal or separator process, or by the Cooley process, or by any other process than that of hand skimming, so long as such removal of the cream does not result in a deterioration of the milk otherwise than by leaving it without the cream? To state the question seems like answering it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">Supposing for the moment that the learned judge of the court below was right in his conclusion that separator-skimmed milk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>i.s not \u201c sldnamed milk \u201d within the meaning of the act, or even within the usages of trade, does it follow that the defendant here has been justly convicted? Can it be true that, under this act, one who sells an article of food, neither injurious nor unwholesome in itself, nor misrepresented by word or act in respect to either its quality, composition or derivation, nor sold in direct violation of the plain, unmistakable, unequivocal mandate of the statute itself, can be convicted and criminally punished for a breach of the law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-4\">Indeed, when we came to view the statute in its entirety from end to end, to compare and construe all its parts together, as the common law and common sense says should be done, and then apply the just and salutary principles which have been cited in this brief, there is apparently but one rational interpretation which can be put upon it, and that interpretation makes it clear, consistent with itself and with the principles of right and justice, with the wholesome principles of criminal jurisprudence, with the honest liberty of the citizens of a free and intelligent community, and even with those decisions of our courts which hold that a man may be convicted and punished for unwittingly doing what a statute peremptorily and unqualifiedly forbids. The evident purpose of the enactment of this statute, as gathered from its language upon a proper comparison and construction of all its parts, is to prevent and punish the fraudulent and corrupt foisting upon the public of food products, which have been adulterated by additions or abstractions whereby their quality and value have been deceptively reduced or injuriously changed, or Avhich have been fraudulently manipulated so as to conceal some damaging or deleterious defect; and likewise to prevent and punish the purviewing to the public, as sound and good, food products, which have undergone decomposition, become tainted or rotten, or been derived from an infected source \u25a0whereby they become the vehicle of disease and injury to the public health. The very gist and kernel of the act, so far as regards its purpose, is the prevention and punishment of a public injury having its basis, its roots, in deception and falsehood, in a wilful disregard of honest dealing, or in a wilful disregard of the public health; and to constitute an offense under it, there must be either an intent to deceive, to foist upon the public something under the cover of a falsehood, or an in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tent to purvey to the public that which is unwholesome and injurious in its nature, or else such negligence or lack of care in ascertaining the quality of the article so purveyed, as is held by the law to be tantamount to an evil mind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-3\">But a conclusive demonstration of the intent and scope of the act is to be found in the history of its origin and the uniform construction that has been placed upon the definitions incorporated in it both by the scientific expert from whose brain it was evolved and by the legislatures and courts of the several states in which it was originally enacted and from whose statute books it has been copied, in an emasculated form, by our own legislature. This history of the act shows that it had no reference whatever to the infinite variations in quality to be found in all manufactured and natural products, but was alone directed to the end of preventing sophistication and fraud and protecting the commercial and consuming public against the sale of actually deleterious drugs and foods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\">The act had its origin in an essay upon food and drug adulteration by Geo. W. Wigner, a distinguished analyst of England, written in response to an invitation by the national board of trade of this country for the submission of competitive essays on that subject, in which should be incorporated the draft of an act \u201c designed to prevent injurious adulteration, and to regulate the sale of food without imposing unnecessary burdens upon commerce.\u201d The prize offered by the board of trade for the best of these essays was duly awarded to Mr. Wigner on October 27, 1880, and the essay itself with the report of the committee will be found in \u201c The Analyst \u201d of January, 1881, pp. 3-9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">That Mr. Wigner had no thought of his definitions ever being so construed as to be'applied to the prohibition of unsophisticated articles of commerce is conclusively shown by the fact that he recommends the adoption by the legislature directly or through a properly constituted board, of certain limits of excellence for articles named by him. In this connection are found, inter alia, the following suggested limits:</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">\u201c Milk shall contain not less than 9 per cent by weight of milk solids, not fat, and not less than 2.50 per cent of butter fat. \u201d \u201c Siam milk shall contain not less than 9 per cent by weight of milk solids, not fat.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">\u201c Butter shall contain not less than 80 per cent of butter fat.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201c Cocoa shall contain at least 20 per cent of cocoa fat.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">\u201c Vinegar shall contain not less than 8 per cent of acetic acid.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">Almost immediately following the approval and publication of this essay, on March 25, 1881, the act as' recommended was adopted, almost totidem verbis, by the legislature of New Jersey and even a superficial examination of this and the accompanying legislation must demonstrate that the purpose .of the enactment was conceived as being that here contended for, and unquestionably that conceived by Mr. Wigner himself. See General Statutes of New Jersey, published under the authority of the legislature, March 20, 1895, p. 1175 et seq., under heading \u201c Food and Drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">A like act incorporating the recommendations and definitions of Mr. Wigner\u2019s essay was enacted in the state of New York also in 1881. See the Revised Statutes, Codes and General Laws of the state of New York, etc., by Clarence F. Birdseye, 1890, p. 82 et seq.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">Also see p. 35 of same edition of the New York Statutes, a sample resolution of the board of health of the state of New York, adopted under the provisions of the above act, fixing the limit of strength or acidity for vinegar, as proceeding directly in conformity with the recommendation of Mr. Wigner and with the universally accepted purpose of the act itself and the definitions contained in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-9\">The same act without material modifications was adopted in the state of Ohio, March 20,1884. See Revised Statutes of the state of Ohio, edited by Florien Gianque, 7th ed., p. 2223 et seq.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-10\">All the foregoing acts cover drug as well as food adulteration according to Mr. Wigner\u2019s original draft and are more careful specimens of legislation than the Pennsylvania act of 1895; but so far as it goes the Pennsylvania act differs in no substantial respect from those of which it is a copy, and incorporates, without material change, the definitions of Mr. Wigner\u2019s essay in so far as they relate to food adulteration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-11\">Aside from the particular interests involved in the present case any interpretation by the Pennsylvania courts of these carefully wrought out and highly approved definitions out of harmony with their original and generally accepted purpose and meaning would be nothing short of a public misfortune. The interpretation given to them by the learned judge of the court below is clearly such a perversion of their original intent.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>April 12, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-2\">It appears to be clear error that his honor, in the portions of his charge assigned for error, practically, indeed for every useful purpose, wholly withdrew from the jury the determination of the question whether centrifugally-separated milk was \u201c skimmed milk\u201d or something other than \u201cskimmed milk.\u201d This was certainly a question of fact to be found by the jury, and, upon the view of the statute taken by the court at the trial, a vital fact in the prosecution of the cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-3\"><em>Samuel A.

L. 817, to which the defendant pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">This act of assembly to provide against the adulteration of food, and providing for the enforcement thereof, defines by section 2, \u201c The term \u2018 food \u2019 as herein used, shall include all articles used for food or drink by man, whether simple, mixed, or compound,\u201d and by section 3, \u201c An article shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of the act: <em>(a) </em>In the case of food, (1) If any substance or substances have been mixed with it so as to lower or depreciate or injuriously affect its quality, strength or purity. (2) If any inferior or cheaper substance or substances have been substituted wholly or in part for it. (3) If any valuable or necessary constituent or ingredient has been wholly or in part abstracted from it. (4) If it is an imitation of, or if sold under the name of another article. (5) If it consists wholly or in part of a diseased, decomposed, putrid, infested, tainted or rotten animal or vegetable substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>whether manufactured or not, \u2014 or in case of milk if it is the produce of a diseased animal. (6) If it is colored, polished, or powdered, whereby damage or inferiority is concealed, or if by any means it is made to appear better or of greater value than it really is. (7) If it contains any added substance or ingredients which is poisonous or injurious to health; provided that the provisions of this act shall not apply to mixtures or compounds recognized as ordinary articles or ingredients of articles of food, if each and every package sold or offered for sale be distinctly labeled as mixtures or compounds, and are not injurious to health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The defendant was convicted and brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The health of the people of the commonwealth must stand at the very head of legislative considerations, and the interpretation of this statute must be made by the same rules which have always determined questions affecting the life, liberty, and happiness of our people. All new laws, though penned with the greatest of technical skill and passed upon the fullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal until their meaning is fixed and ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications: Dwarris on Statutes, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It is legislative language we are to construe, and it must be received, not necessarily according to its etymological meaning, but according to its popular acceptation, and especially in the sense in which the legislature is accustomed to use the same words: Phila. &amp; Erie R. R. Co. v. Catawissa R. R. Co. 53 Pa. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The sense given to particular words by our great lexicographers is always entitled to weight, yet where a word is used in an act of assembly, regard must be had to the circumstances surrounding its use: Penna. R. R. Co. v. Price, 96 Pa. 256. The term \u201cskimmed milk\u201d is not a technical word, or term of art, and the parties must be presumed to have used it in its known sense: Garman v. Potts, 135 Pa. 506. The testimony of experts would not aid the jury in determining the meaning or signification of a well known and frequently used word in the community by explaining how that particular term was used, or what it was understood to mean in 'the dairy trade or by the public at large. The jurors were as competent as the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Where the circumstances can be fully and adequately described to the jury, and are such that their bearing on the issue can be estimated by all men, without special knowledge or training, opinions of witnesses, expert or nonexpert are not admissible: Graham v. Penn. Co., 139 Pa. 149; Com. v. Gibbons, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">It is the duty of the courts so to construe statutes as to meet the mischief and to advance the remedy, and not to violate fundamental principles; to bring sense out of the words used and not to bring a sense into them, to give the words a reasonable construction: Dwarris on Statutes, p. 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The commonwealth proved, that the article seized by the milk inspector of the board of health of Philadelphia was what is known as separator skimmed milk in a forty-quart can \u2014 \u25a0 marked with the name \u201c E. &amp; B. Darlington, Chadds Ford\u201d and \u201cskimmed milk,\u201d and the manner o\u00a3 producing the different grades of skimmed milk was as follows: plain slum milk is secured by allowing whole milk to stand until the cream rises to the surface and then by means of a dipper or similar implement the cream is skimmed from the surface and the residue is slummed milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">By the Cooley process, milk is immersed in cool water, and after the cream has risen, the milk is drawn from beneath the cream, and that which is drawn off from beneath the cream is called Cooley slummed milk, and has less of the butter fat than hand skimmed milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">By the separator process, the milk is passed through a centrifugal separator under rapid motion by which the cream and fats are forced to the sides of the apparatus and the product left is separator skimmed milk, \u2014 with nearly all the butter fats abstracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">As shown by the evidence in this case, milk is not regarded as a definite chemical compound, nor even as a mixture of bodies in fixed and invariable proportions. The cows of different breeds and even the milk of the same animal may be subject to wide differences. The age, food, health, habits and treatment of the animal always affect the quantity and quality of the milk. And while the ordinary method of separating the cream, either for direct use or for butter making, is by allowing it to form on the surface and skimming it off with a spoon, ladle, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>similar implement, ingenious adaptations of machines have been introduced to more rapidly and effectively part the butter fats from the other constituents.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The residuary product has its distinctive name, separator skimmed milk, to indicate just what has been accomplished\u2014 that a valuable and necessary constituent has been wholly or in part abstracted from it, not only from the original milk, but as well, from the milk known to the trade as skimmed milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">It cannot be urged that she was careful, honest, or innocent in selling under the label, in large letters, \u201c Skimmed Milk,\u201d that which she knew was not so recognized in the trade, or by the board of health of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">She must have known that it tended to cheat the public by the false name which she gave to it, and admitted it was not as nutritious or valuable as a health food.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The name on the milk cans, taken with her knowledge of the contents, was a concealment and misrepresentation of its quality and food merit; one of the things which the legislature intended to prevent in this Pure Food Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The fact that scientific experts may pronounce a manufactured article, intended for human food, to be wholesome and not injurious, and that in a pure state it may be thus good for food, does not render it incompetent for the legislature to prohibit the manufacture and sale of the article, if in the judgment of the legislature, and not of the courts, it is necessary to the protection of the lives, health and property of the citizens, and to the preservation of good order and the public morals: Commonwealth v. Powell, 114 Pa. <em>265; </em>affirmed in Powell v. Commonwealth, 127 U. S. 678; Commonwealth v. Shirley, 152 Pa. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">By the means used in this case a fraud is practised on the public, in delivering to the purchaser, a cheaper as well as an entirely different article, and on the honest dealer who must be driven from the market by such deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Skimmed milk, as such, is a legitimate article of trade and is sold in large quantities for uses to which the purchaser can properly apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Usage and custom have not only given this product a name, but qualities and attributes which are associated with the name. As such, it is purchased and used for special purposes. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>demand for tbe different grades of milk has been met by new devices which furnish new results, and each should be given a distinctive name to truthfully represent the strength, purity, and health merit of the product. The. sale of these is not prohibited by the act of 1895, if they are honestly made as articles, or ingredients of articles, of food; and each and every package, sold or offered for sale, be distinctly, labeled as mixtures or compounds; and are not injurious to health.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\">This difference was certainly known to the defendant, as her testimony not only discloses full knowledge of the different grades, but as well, that the product which she sold as indicated by the marked can, \u201c Skimmed Milk,\u201d was not that which she recognized as \u201c Skimmed Milk \u201d but an entirely different article called \u201c Separator Skimmed Milk; \u201d the.market value of the latter being one half the former, with nearly all the butter fats extracted by mechanical means. When selling to retail customers she would put in the \u201c Separator Skim Milk \u201d some hand-skimmed milk to render it more like the hand-skimmed article.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">She also testified that she did not buy skimmed milk but separator milk. And on cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Q. \u201c Are you able to tell his honor and the jury whether or not any valuable ingredient or constituent had been taken from the separator milk before you sold it ?. \u201d A. \u201c That I could not say, I sold it just as I received it.\u201d Q. \u201c You know the fat is taken out of it do you not?\u201d A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Q. \u201cDo you regard the fat as a valuable ingredient in milk as a food ? \u201d A. \u201c I suppose it is.\u201d Q. \u201c And the fat is taken out of the separator milk you sell?\u201d A. \u201cA portion of it.\u201d Q. \u201cIs it not almost all; substantially all?\u201d A. \u201cThat is the cream, you mean?\u201d Q. \u201cYes, I mean the butter fat.\u201d A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Q. \u201cSubstantially all of it is taken out?\u201d A. \u201cYes, sir. I suppose.\u201d In this, the defendant plainly admits the sale to have been made in direct violation of the prohibition contained in the statutory definition of adulteration \u201c6 th . . . . or if by any means it is made to appear better or of greater value than it really is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Again, the ordinance to prohibit the sale of adulterated or impure milk in the city of Philadelphia, offered in evidence in her defense, and the Act of Assembly, July 7, 1885, P. L. 260, to which frequent reference was made during the trial, puts the question of her knowledge past all doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The learned jndge under this evidence was right, referring to the separator skimmed milk, \u2014 in saying to the jury, \u201c Milk so treated is not skimmed milk, and therefore, cannot, properly take its place in the ranks of skimmed milk for the purpose of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The sale of nine forty-quart cans of separated milk was admitted. The sole question was, whether there had been any valuable or necessary ingredient or constituent wholly or in part abstracted from it. And under the defendant\u2019s evidence there was no dispute as to this. The argument of counsel to show that separator skimmed milk, Cooley skimmed milk, and plain skimmed milk are one and the same article is not convincing in view of the defendant\u2019s admission, and the testimony of her witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The merit of this admittedly inferior article of milk for general purposes as a health food, as compared with other grades, is largely a matter of opinion based on training and experience, but the legislature evidently intended that sales of all articles of food'or drink for use by man should be so marked and sold as to not leave in doubt, questions affecting their strength, quality or purity; and to prohibit sales being made under a label which deceitfully misleads, and by which the article sold, \u201c6th is made to appear better or of greater value than it really is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">There was no error in saying: \u201c It seems to me, therefore, if you come to the conclusion that skimmed milk means milk which has been skimmed in the ordinary acceptation of the term, by the removal superficially of the scum or cream that has risen to the surface, and that it has certain valuable ingredients always present to an appreciable or to a large extent; and that the removal of the cream by the separator process, while it affects the taste and appearance of the milk to some degree, yet does not so materially do so as to put every one on his guard, but does really diminish the nutritive properties of the article produced by the abstraction of all the cream instead of leaving two fifths thereof in the milk, your verdict should be for the commonwealth. If the article was sold generally as skimmed milk because the new product does not answer to the old name, because it has been obtained by the entire abstraction of a valuable ingredient, and because, although it may be useful for some purposes it is not so useful for other purposes, and finally, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>it is the right of the buyer or consumer, when he goes to buy, to get what he wants. If he wants something which is not forbidden by law, and which suits his palate, though it may not be quite as good as something else, he is entitled to get it, but he is not to be palmed off with a different thing because there is evidence that for some purposes that different thing is as good as anything else. In point of fact, in this case, we have positive proof that for general purposes milk which loses part of its cream is rendered thereby less valuable. A valuable ingredient is partially gone and the legislature forbids its sale for the thing that it was before such valuable ingredient was removed. If it then be subjected to another process, and what is left of the valuable ingredient be also taken out, and it is then sold for what it was before, this is also a breach of the legislative enactment, and if the jury find that this has occurred in the present case their verdict should be for the commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">The commonwealth, it is true, relied on the sale made to the baker, but the defendant deemed it necessary to - answer, and admitted having made sales to the public almost continuously since 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The defense is not required to take up any burden until the prosecution has made out a case sufficient to support a verdict. Burden of proo f is a very different thing from presumption of innocence. The first is a formal rule confined to determining the order in which the proofs are to be brought forward; a rule that ceases to apply as soon as sufficient proof has been introduced to sustain a verdict. The second is a substantial rule, operating during the whole trial, and continuing to operate until the case is finally determined: Wharton\u2019s Crim. Evid., sec. 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Her admission of facts, under cross-examination on the trial, though not meant to be inculpatory, are as sufficient to sustain the verdict, as if the same facts had been adduced by the commonwealth in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The case was carefully tried, and the verdict was fully warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed. The record to be remitted to the court below to the end that its sentence may be executed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Dissenting Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AJOi\">Reeder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATM\">April 12, 1897 :</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">I cannot unite with the majority of the court in their interpretation of the law as applied to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">First. \u2014 I believe that the proper definition of skimmed milk is milk from which the cream has been wholly or partially removed no matter by what process. The only method known for removing cream from milk was by skimming it from the top with a spoon or some similar utensil until recent years, when other methods were invented. The purpose of both the old and the new methods was to remove as much cream as possible from the milk. The method used by the old process gave the residuum the name of skimmed milk \u2014 the new process only differing in its effect upon the milk by the removal of more cream; the residuum by the latter process only differing from that in the former in this, that the cream is more successfully removed. In my opinion it is still proper to designate and sell this as \u201c skimmed milk.\u201d Indeed many if not most of the lexicographers define \u201c skimmed milk \u201d as \u201c milk from which the cream has been removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Second. \u2014 The sales made to the baker Kolb, the only ones proved by the .commonweath when their case closed was made with his full knowledge that the milk that he was buying was milk from which the cream had been removed by the centifrugal process. In fact he said the defendant herself told him so when he bought the milk. The act does not prohibit the sale of \u201cseparator milk\u201d when sold as such so long as it retains all the constituents it had when it came from the separator.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Third. \u2014 -Any failure of the testimony to justify the conviction of the defendant by sales to Kolb, the testimony of the commonwealth relating only to sales tp him, could not be supplied by her admission in cross-examination that she had made sales to other persons, as the commonwealth\u2019s case related to, and they relied for conviction only upon, the sales made to Kolb.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">For these reasons I cannot concur in the opinion of the majority of the court and file this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b356-9\">Wickham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADv\">I concur in the above dissenting opinion, for the first and second reasons given in support of the same.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
