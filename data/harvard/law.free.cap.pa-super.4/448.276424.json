That in pursuance of said agreement the said plaintiff, on tiie 14th day of November, 1895, paid to the said defendant $100 on account of the purchase money of said lot of ground; and further, that on the 1st day of April, 1896, tendered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>balance of said alleged purchase money, to wit: $600, (six hundred dollars), etc. Plaintiff therefore prays a decree for specific performance, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">The defendant in her answer, avers, inter alia, as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">1. That the alleged agreement in writing set forth in plaintiff\u2019s bill, was not completed or delivered to said plaintiff, but that possession of it was obtained by said plaintiff from said defendant by misrepresentation of the facts, and by false statements and deceit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">2. That she, said defendant, specifically denies that there ever was any contract for the sale of the lot of ground described in paragraph 2 of said bill; and avers that there never was any sale of said lot either by said alleged written agreement, or in any other manner whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">8. That said defendant denies that she accepted the sum of $100, or any other sum from the plaintiff on account of the purchase money of said lot, but avers that the sum of $100 was left on her table by said plaintiff when he received from her the alleged agreement, under the circumstances detailed in paragraph 3 of answer.

That she is not bound in law or equity to execute and deliver to him a deed for the lot claimed, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-10\">The defendant therefore prays the court that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be dismissed at his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-11\">Plaintiff moved the court to rule that the answer is not responsive to the bill and that unless defendant mates out a defense by independent testimony the decree will be made pro confesso. This motion was overruled by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-12\">The court below held, inter alia, \u201c It is not denied by the defendant that the agreement was signed by her, yet she alleges that it was not completed or delivered to said plaintiff, but obtained by said plaintiff by misrepresentation of the facts, and by false statements and deceit.\u201d These allegations are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>responsive to the bill and. upon the defendant rested the burden of proving by clear and satisfactory evidence some facts which would justify the conclusion that she had been deceived.or overreached by the plaintiff. She has entirely failed to do this and we are satisfied that the bill gives a correct version of the transaction between the parties, and that no element of fraud or deceit on the part of the plaintiff has been shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">The court decreed specific performance. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in refusing to permit the following question to be answered by the defendant, when testifying on the trial of the case. \u201cQ. By Judge Henderson. We propose to ask, under paragraph 4 (of answer), the witness on the stand whether she ever made any agreement of sale for a lot on South Hanover street, or any other lot to her brother; we offer that as a fact, not as a question of law, whether she ever agreed to sell or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">By Mr. Biddle: Objected to, that under the pleadings the question as to whether there was an agreement to sell is a question of law, and not of fact, and the witness is therefore incompetent to testify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">By the Court: The purpose and effect of the question is merely to elicit from the witness her opinion as to whether or not she and the plaintiff made an agreement in reference to the lot in question; this is the only matter in dispute in the case, and is a mixed question of law and fact. We think the objections are well taken; they are sustained; defendant excepts and bill sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">(2) In sustaining objection to the following question: By Mr. Henderson: \u201c Miss Spotts, state if you please, if you ever contracted for the sale of a lot described in paragraph 2 of plaintiff\u2019s bill, to wit: A lot on South Hanover street, 21 feet, including a three foot alleyway on the northern side immediately south of said other land of said Tillie F. Spotts, and extending in depth two hundred and forty feet (240) to the alley on the east, did you ever contract for the sale of such a lot?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">By Mr. Biddle: The same objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">By the Court: The objection sustained; defendant excepts and bill sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>(8) In finding that the answer of defendant was not responsive to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">(4) In making the following decree: \u201c And now, J anuary 12, 1897, this case came on to be heard and was argued by counsel, whereupon after due consideration, it is adjudged and decreed as follows : That within twenty-one days hereafter, the defendant, Tillie F. Spotts, shall execute and upon receipt of the remaining six hundred dollars of purchase money shall' deliver to the plaintiff, Daniel A. Spotts, a good and sufficient deed in fee simple for the lot of ground described in the agreement of November 12, 1895, according to the true tenor thereof and also give to him possession of said lot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">It is further ordered that the defendant pay the costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-6\"><em>J. Webster Henderson </em>and <em>R. M. </em>Henderson, for appellant.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOe\">The answer is responsive and the bill in its entirety is denied: Eaton\u2019s Appeal, 66 Pa. 483; Pusey v. Wright, 31 Pa. 387; Bell v. Bank, 131 Pa. 318.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-7\">Specific performance is a matter not of right but of judicial grace: Pennock v. Freeman, 1 Watts, 401; Henderson v. Hays, 2 Watts, 148.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-8\">And though a contract be valid at law equity will not enforce a specific performance, unless tbe transaction be free from suspicion of fraud or surprise: Campbell v. Spencer, 2 Binney, 129; Patterson v. Martz, 8 Watts, 374; Brady\u2019s Appeal, 66 Pa. 277.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-9\">Doors of equity are shut against one who in his prior conduct in the very subject-matter at issue, has violated good conscience, good faith and fair dealing: Orne v. Coal Co., 114 Pa. 172; Cortelyou\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 576.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-10\"><em>F. M. Biddle, Jr., </em>and <em>F. F. Beltzhoover, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_6G\">\u2014 The court below found as a fact that the bill gives the correct version of the transaction between the parties and no element of fraud or deceit on the part of the plaintiff has been shown. Parties to a contract may not testify as to their undeclared intentions at the time the contract was formed: Spencer v. Colt, 89 Pa. 314; Building Association v. Hetzel, 103 Pa. 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-11\">The answer was not responsive to the bill. If a contract be set forth and the defendant be called on to answer it, a denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>that it exists, modo et forma, would not be good; the defendantshonld state how it existed and wherein it had no existence: Pusey v.

Bank, 131 Pa. 318.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJ1\">April 19, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-4\">The answer not being responsive and having been replied to the court below properly held that upon defendant rested the burden of proving, by clear and satisfactory evidence, some facts which would justify the conclusion that she had been deceived or overreached by the plaintiff: Audenreid\u2019s Appeal, 89 Pa. 114; Naglee\u2019s Est., 52 Pa. 154.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">The terms of the written agreement were sufficiently certain to sustain a decree for specific performance: Thompson v. Coal Co., 7 Phila. 617; Payne v. Howard, 117 Pa. 579.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">A description by quantity is, in its nature, the least certain. It is to the boundaries the grantee must look; he has a right to all the land within them. The quantity is a matter of calculation, and be it more or less, it passes: Large v. Penn, 6 S. &amp; R. 488; Koch v. Dunkel, 90 Pa. 264.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AWN\">Smith, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The material averments of the bill ill this case set forth a written contract for the sale of a lot of ground, part payment of the purchase money, a tender of the balance, and demand for a deed as called for in the writing. The prayer was for specific performance. The answer denies that the contract was completed and alleges that the writing was not delivered to the plaintiff in execution of the agreement but to be handed to the defendant\u2019s attorney, and that the plaintiff retained it without authority. The cause was tried before the president judge who, after hearing the evidence submitted by both parties and the arguments of counsel, granted the prayer of the bill. From this decree the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The testimony was abundant to warrant the action of the court. There was a written agreement signed by both parties, in which the land was described with sufficient certainty, and the price, the time of payment and when the deed was to be delivered, were accurately stated. The first payment was made when the plaintiff received the written agreement and the balance was tendered at the time called for in the contract. When the tender was made two witnesses who were present testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>that they saw the money offered to the defendant which she refused. They also stated that they heard her admit that she had sold the lot to the plaintiff by written agreement and that he had paid 'her $100 of the purchase money. The testimony of these witnesses is substantially the same as that of the plaintiff as to what then occurred and was not denied by the defendant. The testimony of these witnesses with that of the plaintiff as to the entire transaction, the written contract held by him, the payment of the first instalment and its retention by the defendant, were clearly sufficient to outweigh the denial of the defendant and the additional testimony adduced in her behalf. It is not alleged that the price was inadequate or the bargain improvident.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The remarks of the learned judge that some parts of the answer were not responsive to the bill and therefore the burden as to those matters was cast upon the defendant are of no importance because, at the hearing, the plaintiff was required to prove his entire case irrespective of any alleged defects in the answer, and the motion to the effect \u201c that the answer is not responsive to the bill, and that unless the defendant makes out a defense by independent testimony the decree will be made pro confesso <em>\u201d </em>was overruled by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The offers of evidence the exclusion of which is complained of in the 1st and 2d assignments of error, called for conclusions rather than statements of fact and were properly overruled. Furthermore, the defendant subsequently testified substantially concerning them. It is needless to enter upon a discussion of the law applicable to the facts, as it was duly observed by the learned court in the disposition of the case. The controlling question was one of fact and that was determined in accordance with the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The specifications of error are overruled and the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
