Also services at No. 235, January term, 1880, common pleas No. 2, of Allegheny county, with writ df error to Supreme Court at No. 28, October term, 1880; and other services in counsel and advice not specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-10\">2.

B. </em>Rodgers, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0s\">\u2014 The law giving the right of appeal from a refusal to open a judgment imposes on the court the duty of weighing the evidence, and making order or decree accordingly; inclining to submission of the question to a jury in case of doubt: Klopfer v. Ekis, 155 Pa. 41, citing Jenkintown National Bank\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 337. See also La Roche Electric Works v. Emery, 173 Pa. 331. And failing so to do, the court did not properly exercise the discretion vested in it, which was a sound discretion and not an absolute or arbitrary one: Wernet\u2019s App., 91 Pa. 319; First National Bank v. Muncy, 106 Pa. 68; Kelber v. Plow Co., 146 Pa. 485.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b638-8\"><em>Daniel </em>Harrison, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av8\">\u2014 A judgment will not be opened when the answer of the plaintiff is responsive to the petition, and denies under oath every allegation therein, unless such answer is overcome by testimony of two witnesses, or of one witness corroborated by circumstances equivalent to another: Hoffman v. Jacobs, 12 Lanc. Rev. 25; Mangan v. McHale, 6 Kulp, 459.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Aj73\">Willard, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">This is an appeal from the order and decree of the court below discharging a rule to show cause why judgment No. 212 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>November term, 1896, in said court should not be opened and the defendant let into a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">On a careful consideration of the petition and answer, we are satisfied that the answer was resp\u00f3nsive to the petition, and the allegations of the defendant were fully met and explained by the oath of the legal plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Tbe receipt of October 4, 1880, purporting to be in full of all professional services to that date, was executed and delivered three months before the note on which this judgment is founded became due and payable, and the language of the receipt in no way necessarily impeaches the validity of the note given for past services dated on the third of January, 1880, payable in one year, nor does it show that said note was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The proceeding in this case was an equitable one, and was argued before and decided by a full bench of the court in banc in common pleas No. 3 of Allegheny county.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The only question for us to determine is whether the court rightly exercised its. discretion in refusing to open the judgment: Jenkintown National Bank\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 337; Applebee\u2019s Appeal, 126 Pa. 385; Klopfer v. Ekis, 155 Pa. 41; Walter v. Fees, 155 Pa. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">We are of the opinion that the discretion of the court was rightly exercised, and its decree is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
