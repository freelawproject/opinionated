Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-12\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) refusing to strike out evidence of John Nale, a witness for plaintiff. The evidence of Nale being to the effect that he had assisted in building the walk between the 19th and 26th of May, 1894, that its condition was bad at the time, that the walk was patched and rotten and that from the appearance there had not been any immediate change in that walk in the last four or six weeks previous to the repair. Defendant moved to have this evidence stricken from the record as incompetent; (2) in not affirming the defendant\u2019s third point which point and ruling thereon was as follows: That the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>dence of the plaintiff in this case-is not sufficient to charge the defendant with constructive notice of the footwalk being out of repair on which the alleged accident occurred, and the verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>By this point we are asked to say to the jury that there is no evidence in the cause entitling plaintiff to recover; that there is no evidence of such notice to the borough authorities of the alleged defective sidewalk, and not sufficient evidence to amount to a constructive notice such as to make the borough liable or satisfy the jury in so finding. This is a legal question which we reserve. We therefore refuse the point and submit the case to the jury to render such verdict under the evidence subject to our opinion on said reserved question; (8) in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the reserved question of law in the f olio wing opinion: \u201c As to the reserved question, I am convinced it would have been error to take the case from the jury and direct a verdict for the defendant- as requested in the third point, which was refused with the legal question contained therein reserved. Whether the evidence was sufficient to establish constructive notice to the.borough of the defect in the sidewalk causing the injury in question, was for the jury. There was sufficient evidence to make its submission necessary. The motion for judgment non obstante must therefore be refused; \u201d (4) the court erred in not granting defendant relief from the misbehavior of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the argument of the case to the jury, which misconduct and the opinion of the court thereon i\u00a7 as follows: <em>\u201c </em>The counsel for plaintiff misbehaved himself in making the following statements to the jury in his argument, which were not borne out by the evidence, <em>(a) </em>\u2018 Referring to the street commissioner\u2019s appearance on the stand, counsel stated: He enjoys it more than the people. The borough of Dubois enjoys paying damages to every term of court by reason of his enjoyment.\u2019 <em>(b) </em>\u2018 Wayne swore he bought the plank to build that walk before he went home that day (meaning the day he purchased the property.) \u2019 (c) \u2018 If you can find from this testimony, that this walk was good, we will have this testimony engrossed and put your names to it and bang it up in the courthouse and call the attention of every person to it and say to them that that is the kind of a walk you must have and that kind of a walk you must walk over.\u2019 <em>(cl) </em>\u2018 This is not the first time the borough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>has been in this court, and this is not the first time that this kind of a defense has been set up.\u2019 (e) \u2018 When you put a man on the witness stand as narrow between the eyes as Dr. _ Ross, who will hang onto a little doctor bill because his son-in-law is on the other side of the case.\u2019 (/) Referring to the borough, counsel said: \u2018it has a taxable valuation of 13,000,000 and I don\u2019t believe there is anybody in the borough of Dubois that wanted to set up this kind of a defense. No person has asked this kind of a defense to be made and .... we know the people over there do not want this land of a defense.\u2019 (,^) \u2018 You should not insult this woman by giving her a little verdict of five or six hundred dollars. I say that if you give a verdict of five or six hundred dollars it would be an insult to this plaintiff.\u2019 (/\u00bf) \u2018 Plaintiff\u2019s counsel read to the jury part of a decision of the Supreme Court on which he put his own construction.\u2019 \u201c The strongest ground for new trial is the alleged misconduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the closing address to the jury. He made statements therein not warranted by the evidence, which was highly improper, yet, inasmuch as it was stopped upon attention of the court being called to it, I do not think the jury were influenced by it to the prejudice of defendant\u2019s cause. The rule for new trial is discharged, the motion for judgment non obstante is refused and the prothonotary is directed to enter judgment upon the verdict. Exception noted for defendant; \u201d (5) error in the general charge in not pointing out to the jury the character of a defect of which notice will be imputed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-4\"><em>W.

Was the walk safe, or was it out of repair and dangerous ? Had the borough authorities actual or constructive notice of its alleged defects, and were they negligent in failing to keep it in proper repair? Was the plaintiff injured because of the negligence of the borough officers having charge of the walk, and without fault on.her part? If so, to what extent, and what was reasonable compensation therefor ? There was sufficient evidence in relation to these questions to warrant the submission of the ease to the jury, and this was done with proper instructions for their guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The evidence complained of and made the basis of the first assignment of error was properly admitted, accompanied as it was by testimony that there had been no change in the condition of the footwalk'where the plaintiff was injured between the time of the accident and the time at which it was repaired bjr the witness: Lohr v. Philipsburg Borough, 165 Pa. 109; Davidson v. Sanders, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The defendant\u2019s second point, the refusal of which forms the second assignment, asked the court to declare the evidence insufficient to charge the borough with constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the walk. There was evidence-that the planks were rotten and had been patched in places, and that this had been observed by various persons, for periods ranging from six weeks to one year preceding the accident. With such testimony in the case, it would have been error to withdraw the question of notice from the jury. The facts of this case differ materially from those in Lohr v. Borough, supra. In that case there was no obvious defect in the sidewalk, and from the plaintiff\u2019s evidence it was clear that none could be observed in the exercise of a reasonable supervision by the borough officers. The defect shown was one which was discovered only after a special examination, and the witness who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>made this testified that it could not be otherwise seen. In the present case there was testimony to the effect that the walk was elevated some two feet from the ground, and that its defective condition was obvious to those passing over it, without special examination. Under this evidence, it was for the jury to determine whether the sidewalk should not have received closer attention as its decay progressed. What was observable to the casual pedestrian should also be observable to those who were required by law to give it attention, and we cannot say that the jury erred in holding the borough to a measure of duty commensurate with the existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The allegation that the court failed to point out to the jury the character of the defect of which notice will be imputed to borough officers, as complained of in the fifth assignment of error, is not borne out by the facts. The court told the jury that: \u201c The question is not merely whether the sidewalk was defective but whether the defects' in it were noticeable to all passers by, because if the defect was latent or hidden and not observable by those who used the sidewalk, the borough cannot be held liable for it,\u201d and the learned judge repeated the instruction that \u201c the defect must be so notorious as to be evident to all passers,\u201d and quoted from opinions of the Supreme Court to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">While there is nothing on the record which would justify us in ruling upon and giving effect to the fourth assignment; the matters there objected to deserve to be noticed. References by counsel to the physical infirmities or personal peculiarities of witnesses, having no connection with the matters involved in the issue, are in exceedingly bad taste and grossly violate professional ethics. These, however, are matters which are to be regulated mainly in the forum of honor by an observance of the proprieties. But the statement to the jury that if they should find that the \u201c walk was good, we will have this testimony engrossed and put your names to it and hang it up in the court house and call the attention of every person to it,\u201d has the aspect of a threat, and for that reason should not be tolerated. In his opinion discharging the rule for a new trial the learned judge, in referring to the closing address of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, said: \u201c He made statements not warranted by the evidence, which was highly improper, yet inasmuch as it w;as stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>upon attention of the court being called to it, I do not think the jury were influenced by it to the prejudice of the defendant\u2019s cause.\u201d But whether the jury were influenced by the objectionable language or not, it was impossible for the learned judge to know, and as they were not told that the threat which it contained was not to be carried into effect, it is quite possible that it may have secretly influenced them. For this reason, and as a deserved rebuke to counsel employing such tactics, the court should have granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">Jurors should be absolutely free to discharge their duties undeterred by fear of personal consequences of any description,, and it is the duty of courts under all circumstances not only to protect them from every form of intimidation but to promptly punish any attempt at intimidation, or any other improper influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The specifications of error are all overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
