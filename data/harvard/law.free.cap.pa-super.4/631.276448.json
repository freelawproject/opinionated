The plaintiff\u2019s case rested upon the allegation that the car was run at undue speed. One of the witnesses testified that \u201c the car was \u2022going awful fast,\u201d another that \u201c it seemed to me she was running quite lively,\u201d'another, \u201cI noticed the motorman stopping the car as quick as he could ; \u201d and the same witness, who was uneontradicted, testified, \u201c that the car was stopped in half its length.\u201d There was no evidence of want of care on the part of the motorman, either before or after the child had been seen by him. The trial judge left the case to the jury on the question of negligence \u201c in the fast running of the car and possibly in the unskillfulness of the person having the ear in chai\u2019ge.\u201d The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff of six and one quarter cents. <em>Held, </em>That the defendant was entitled to a compulsory nonsuit, and that the plaintiff had no standing to complain of the charge of the court as inducing an inadequate verdict.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b655-7\">Argued April 21, 1897.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIM\">Appeal No. 143, April T., 1897, by plaintiff, from judgment of C.

It appeared from the evidence that the car was running at a speed of from \u25a0seven to eight miles an hour, that the motorman noticed, before he reached them, some six or seven children near the street car track ahead of him and turned off his current, stopping the car in half its length. Alighting from the car he then found it had struck a little girl in the head, and that plaintiff\u2019s son had been run over and received injuries from which he died the next morning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Other facts appear in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-4\">The trial judge left the question to the jury as to defendant\u2019s negligence arising from the speed of the car and its conduct by the motorman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-5\">Yerdict and judgment for plaintiff for cts. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in charging the jury as follows : \u201c It is not necessary for the purposes of this case, to go into any lengthy explanation of negligence, because it seems that the negligence alleged in this case is the fast running of a car, and possibly the unskillfulness of the person having the car in-charge.\u201d (2) In charging the jury as follows: \u201c Now it was with some hesitation that we entered into the defendant\u2019s side of this case, because the only evidence we had of the rate of speed on the part of the plaintiff was. that one witness said that the car was running pretty fast, and the other one, who was approaching it \u2014 who was going in the opposite direction and could see it approaching him \u2014 made a somewhat similar expression \u2014 that it was running pretty fast, or something of that kind.\u201d (3) In charging the jury as follows: \u201c Well, as we have suggested, it is necessary that these cars should run pretty fast, otherwise they would be useless, but we concluded that we would hear the defendant\u2019s testimony as to how fast it was running and then let you determine whether or not it was an unreasonable rate of speed considering the locality and other circumstances of the case.\u201d (4) In charging the jury as follows : \u201cYou must say whether that was an unreasonable rate of speed, such as would be dangerous, considering the likelihood of people to get on the track there, and all the other circumstances, and if you conclude that it was not an unreasonable rate of speed, that would end the case and you should find a verdict for the defendant.\u201d (5) In charging the jury as follows: \u201c It is entirely clear to us that if this boy had been a grown person, he couldn\u2019t recover here. There is no question at all in our mind, under the law \u2014and indeed it couldn\u2019t be contemplated \u2014 that if a grown person would start to run across the track, or get upon the car in the manner that Mrs. McCaffrey testified that this boy did, he couldn\u2019t recover a cent of damages if he was injured, or anybody else, if he was caught, and why? Because it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>his own fault, and the law is, that where a person contributes to the cause of injury he cannot recover.\u201d (6) In charging the jury as follows: \u201c The law bas not laid down the precise period in the age of a child when this occurs, although some judges have undertaken to place it at about the age of this child\u2014 about six years \u2014 -when its reasoning powers are - developed so that it can be held to a strict responsibility for its acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-3\">But the law is, in regard to children, that unless they are so small and of such tender years that it is apparent to the jury that they can have no responsibility, they must be held to such responsibility in the exercise of discretion as their age would warrant. The jury is permitted to say whether children are of that age and mental capacity, that they are able to judge of the consequences of their acts, and if they are, they are held to a degree of responsibility proportionate to their age and mental capacity.\u201d (7) In charging the jury as follows : \u201c If you believe from the testimony of these two witnesses that these children made a break for the car and got under it, or, as the young man who says he was on the front of the car, testifies, they were playing there \u2014 chasing each other \u2014 and in the excitement of their play they rushed in front of this car so suddenly that the car couldn\u2019t have been stopped, regardless of the rate of speed it was running at, of course, the rate of speed wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the case. If they rushed under, either in play or in an attempt to cross, or in an effort to get on the car as one of the witnesses thinks, then it wouldn\u2019t make any difference about the speed of the car, if they did this so suddenly that the car couldn\u2019t be stopped and the child\u2019s life saved. Now I don\u2019t know of any other instruction we can give-you except as to the measure of damages in cases of this kind.\u201d (8) In charging the jury as follows: \u201c There is no evidence here of any medical attendance being paid for, or any expense for burial, and therefore they would not be elements of expense.\u201d (9) The charge as a whole was misleading and inadequate to the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-4\"><em>Edward Campbell, </em>with him <em>R.

There is no evidence that he saw the child start towards the track; he was not in a position to do so from his place in the front part of the car.

The case of the plaintiff was based upon the negligence of the defend-1 ant which consisted in the alleged unusual and unnecessary speed at which the car, which struck the plaintiff\u2019s child and caused its death, was running at the time of the accident. One witness said \u201cthe car was moving awful fast,\u201d another \u201cit seemed to me she was running right lively.\u201d Another who was immediately beside the car at the time of the accident says: \u201c I cannot tell what the speed of the car was, but I noticed the motorman stopping the car as quick as he could.\u201d The testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>mony of the same witness not contradicted establishes the fact that the car was stopped in a distance of about one half of its length; she also says \u201c the children were more at the side than in advance of the car, the car was pretty near as far ahead as they were at the time they were trying to cross the track; it seemed to me they were trying to cross the. track ahead of the ear,\u201d and on her cross-examination, \u201c I only saw two children, they were running in the same direction as the car and as though they were trying to run around in front of the car.\u201d The facts of this case as shown by the plaintiff are strikingly similar to Moss v. Phila. Traction Co., 180 Pa. 389, in which a compulsory nonsuit was entered in the court below and affirmed in the Supreme Court. The trial judge in the court below however concluded to hear the testimony of the defendant and in consequence of what was therein developed left the facts of the case to the determination of the jury. With the manner in which the facts were so submitted the plaintiff has little cause for complaint. It is evident that the plaintiff suffered nothing from the instructions of the court either as to the negligence of the defendant or the possibility of contributory negligence by the child who was killed, for the former must have been found to exist and the latter to have had no existence, or the verdict could not have been found for the plaintiff. The submission to tho jury of the question of the age at which children become responsible for the consequences of their acts might have been justly complained of, if the verdict had been the other way, but it did the appellant no harm for it was found in his favor and he is therefore in as favorable a position as if the court below had ruled as matter of law that the child was not responsible. The real complaint of the appellant is as to the inadequacy of the verdict, and of this he would have a right to complain in a case which was entitled to be submitted to the jury. The instructions of the trial judge as to the measure of damages were entirely correct and are evidently so regarded by the appellant, for they a.re not assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\">There was no error in saying to the jury \u201c There is no evidence here of any medical attendance paid for, or any expense for burial, and therefore they would not be elements of expense.\u201d If the appellant had paid or was liable to pay for medical attendance or undertaker\u2019s services he should have shown it: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The doctor who attended the child was examined as a witness. If there had been any charge for his services a single question would have developed the fact. He testifies however that he took the child to the hospital where it was cared for.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In our view of this case-however it should not have been submitted to the jury. The appellant should not have been permitted to recover either upon his case as he presented it, or as it was developed by the entire testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">There is therefore no error of which he can justly complain, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
