Before Schuyler, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-6\">The petition of the relators disclosed a landlord\u2019s warrant against Henry F. Menges for recovery of alleged claim for rent which had been placed in the hands of C. W. Huttel, a constable, upon which he had distrained upon personal property; that Camilla Menges claimed ownership of part of the property and Henry F. Menges part of the property and neither of them signed any lease or waived the exemption to which they are entitled under the laws of this commonwealth; that they immediately claimed the benefit of the exemption law and informed said constable in writing of their said claim ; that the constable had refused to allow the exemption; that if the constable sells the property it will cause the petitioners great damage ; that he has removed all of said goods from the premises and retains forcible possession of the same to the great injury and damage of the relators; that the relators are advised under section 2 of the act of April 9, 1849, upon demand made by them, that it becomes the duty of the constable to appraise the exemption they are entitled to out of the said property and they are further advised that the constable cannot be indemnified to sell their exempted property; that they are without other adequate and specific remedy at law and therefore pray for a peremptory mandamus directing the constable to make appraisement of the said exempted property so that they may retain what is exempted to each under the provisions of the act of April 9, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-7\">The motion to quash the writ stated the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-8\">The application for mandamus includes two separate and distinct cases, without a joint interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-9\">The writ only issues where there is a clear and specific right to be enforced, and the record does not show what right the wife had, she being a stranger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-10\">The record must show a right to have the thing done, but the thing sought to be done is that the constable shall give each of the relators his and her exemption, which is an absurdity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-11\">The petition must show on its face that the relator has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>other specific or legal remedy, whereas the relators or either of them has a remedy by an action of trespass or replevin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-4\">The writ must show that it was within the power of defendant to do the act in question, but the petition fails to show that the defendant did not disclaim ownership of the g'oods, and further to show that the goods levied on were not the goods of a stranger so as to put it in the power of the constable to appraise the exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">The constable acting under a landlord\u2019s warrant cannot be compelled to allow the exemption by mandamus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">The court, Schuyler, P. J., quashed the writ and dismissed the petition in the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">On the relators\u2019 own showing they have an adequate remedy at law by writ of replevin or action of trespass and their petition should be dismissed for that reason alone. If there are any peculiar facts in their case which would .render these remedies ineffectual, such facts being jurisdictional, should have been set forth in their petition. Nor can we see upon what principle the wife is joined as corelator. The landlord\u2019s warrant was against the husband alone, and he alone would be entitled to the exemption. But even if the wife was also entitled to an exemption on the theory that a portion of the property levied upon belonged to her, still, her rights being separate and distinct from those of her husband would call for a separate and distinct remedy for their enforcement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-8\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) entering the order and decree quashing the writ and dismissing the petition ,\u2022 (2) refusal to order defendant to file his return to the writ of mandamus.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-9\"><em>'William.

Stump, 1 Woodward\u2019s Rep. 399.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AMU\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The first question in this case is, whether mandamus will lie to compel a constable, charged with the execution of a landlord\u2019s warrant, to have an appraisement made of goods elected to be retained by the tenant under the three hundred dollar exemption law. It should be noticed that the appraisement sought to be enforced is that provided for by the second section of the Act of April 9,1849, P. L. 533, and not the appraisement contemplated by the landlord and tenant Act of March 21,1772, 1 Sm. L. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">No precedent, in Pennsylvania, has been cited, and we have been able to find none, where the remedy by mandamus has been applied in such a case. This is not a conclusive argument against it, but it is not without weight. The manifest inconvenience which would result if it were to be held an appropriate proceeding against a mere bailiff for the determination of the manifold disputes arising out of claims for exemption on dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tress for rent is a still stronger argument why it should not be recognized, except, possibly, in cases where the ordinary remedies would be wholly inadequate. No facts are alleged in the petition which make this case exceptional.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">But aside from this, the general rule is, that two or more persons having separate interests seeking redress by mandamus cannot join in one and the same writ, but should have separate 'writs according to their several interests: 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 219. Where the distinct rights of two or more persons are improperly joined, the writ is hable to be either superseded or quashed: Tapping on Mandamus, 324. In this case the landlord\u2019s warrant issued against Henry F. Menges. Camilla claimed part of the goods distrained, and joined in the petition praying for a mandamus directing the defendant to proceed to make the appraisement \u201c so that your petitioners may retain what is exempted to each of them \u201d etc. Even if she had a standing to demand an appraisement and setting apart to her of the goods claimed by her, she asserts a separate and distinct-right. It may be that she has no such right, but it is enough for us to know that she asserts it, and according to the rule above stated should have prosecuted it in a separate suit. As the objection was made promptly the court committed no error in sustaining it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We remark, although we do not at all rest the judgment on that ground, that except where the writ is sought to enforce a public duty or a duty affecting a particular public interest of the state the proceeding, like an ordinary action, is prosecuted in the name of the party instituting it as plaintiff, and not in the name of the commonwealth as formerly. Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 345, sec. 4. This provision was overlooked in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The decree is affirmed, and the appellants are directed to pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
