That judgments were entered upon single bills given to M. W. Wise, then cashier of the Bank of DuBois, versus E. Fred Vosburg and J. L. Vosburg to Nos. 161,162, February term, 1895, on the 27th day of December, 1894, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\">\u201cNo. 161,\" February term, 1895, amount debt and attorney commission, $1,995 and interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-11\">No. 162, February term, debt, attorney\u2019s commission, $2,100 and interest, and on the same day a judgment upon single bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>was also entered against E. Fred Yosburg and R. Y. Spade-man in the sum of $2,200, debt and attorney\u2019s commission, with interest, to No. 163, February term, 1895. That writs of fieri facias were issued on judgments Nos. 161 and 162, February term, 1895, on 27th December, 1894, and lodged with the sheriff at 5 o\u2019clock and 19 minutes P. M. of said day. These writs of fi. fa. were both in the common or ordinary form, and neither purported to be special writs under the act of 8th of April, 1873. They are docketed to Nos. 40 and 41, February term, 1895. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">3.

Daniel Wisotzkey, who was deputy sheriff at the time of the issue of these writs on judgments Nos. 161 and 162, February term, 1895, testifies \u201cthat when he went to DuBois with the writs he was instructed by Mr. Pentz, attorney for the bank of DuBois to levy on all the personal property of E. Fred Vosburg, and upon his interest in the store in the Third ward, conducted in the firm name of Vosburg &amp; Hay, and that he did so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">The auditor awarded the balance, after deducting costs of the audit, etc. to writs of fi. fa., Nos. 40 and 41, February term, 1895, pro rata.

Spademan instead of awarding it to the general or common fi. fa. on the judgment of the Bank of DuBois.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-7\"><em>A.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The appellee issued a fi. fa. in the ordinary form, and, on December 28, 1894, by direction of his attorney, the sheriff levied upon the defendant\u2019s partnership interest in a drug store. On January 2, 1895, the appellant issued a fi. fa. in the special form prescribed by the Act of April 8, 1873, P. L. 65, upon which the sheriff indorsed the levy made on the prior writ as follows: \u201cNow December 28, 1894, levy made and same is indorsed on this writ, see schedule attached to fi. fa. No. 41, February term, 1895,\u201d (the appellee\u2019s writ). This brief summary of the facts, which are fully set out in the auditor\u2019s report, is sufficient to show the precise question for our determination. The appellant\u2019s contention is that, although prior in time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>first-mentioned writ acquired no lien upon the defendant\u2019s partnership interest, because it was not in the form prescribed by the act of 1873. The auditor and the court below held that the levy on the special fi. fa. was subject to the levy made on the prior writ, and, upon the authority of Dengler\u2019s Appeal, 125 Pa. 12, awarded the fund to the writ first levied. We do not see how they could have done otherwise. The cases are exactly parallel, as the following concise statement of the present chief justice will show: \u201cIn the case at bar, the sheriff, acting under verbal directions, did make an actual levy on the defendant\u2019s interest in the partnership .... at least one day before the appellee\u2019s writ was issued. The levy thus made was good, as against the subsequent special execution and levy, subject to the first levy, and the fund raised by the sale is applicable to appellant\u2019s execution. In any view that can be taken of the sheriff\u2019s returns, whether we regard them as returning the money made out of the sale of defendant\u2019s individual personal property, or out of the sale of his interest in the partnership of which he was then a member, the appellee is not entitled to the fund in controversy.\u201d We need not take time to point out the distinction between this case and Hare v. Commonwealth, 92 Pa. 141, and Kaine\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 273. This was done in Dengler\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The decree is affirmed and the appellant is directed to pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
