Before Stewart, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">Samuel Seibert died April, 1874, testate. It appeared from the report of the auditor, appointed to distribute the balance shown by the final account of the executors of Samuel Seibert, deceased, that testator died in April, 1874. That shortly after his death his executors sold all his personal property and real estate except the house occupied by the wife, which had been devised to her for life, with remainder to children after her death. That Agnes W. Seibert, the widow, owned real estate in her own right. She lived in the property devised to her by the testator until her death. The fund for distribution arises on the sale of the testator\u2019s mansion house, in which Agnes W. Seibert lived, sold under power in the will. On or about April 1, 1878, one of the executors of Samuel Seibert told the widow that there were unpaid claims against the estate of Samuel Seibert to the amount of about $1,000, and that unless she advanced the money to pay these claims against her husband\u2019s estate the property in which she was living, which had been devised to her, would have to be sold to pay the testator\u2019s debts. She told this executor if he could borrow the money he could secure it by a lien on her own property. One thousand dollars was borrowed which Mrs. Seibert gave to the executors of Samuel Seibert who charged themselves with $1,000 received from Agnes W. Seibert, in their first account filed in this estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">The administrator of Agnes W. Seibert sought to recover from the estate of Samuel Seibert the sum of $1,000 which Mrs. Seibert borrowed and gave to the executors of her husband. To this claim of the administrator the heirs of Samuel Seibert pleaded the statute of limitations. No proceedings were had in the orphans\u2019 court by the executors in relation to the loan by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Mrs. Seibert; no obligation was given her by either of the executors at the time she gave the money, nor was it shown that Mrs. Seibert ever requested any obligation or made a demand for its repayment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-4\">About two years after Mrs. Seibert gave the executors the money one of the executors gave her a receipt for $1,000, which purports to be in satisfaction of five years\u2019 rent at the rate of $200 per annum. This receipt in part is as follows: \u201cSaid rent having been collected by me from her for the purpose of paying the debts of said decedent, and having been paid to me at or about the expiration of said term.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">The auditor found as a conclusion of law that the $1,000 claimed by the estate of Mrs. Seibert had been paid to one of the executors on or about'April 1, 1878; that no proceedings had been taken in relation to the matter, no demand having been shown, no obligation given, no suit brought, nor any steps towards its recovery having been taken prior to June 4, 1894, the statute of limitations is a bar to the recovery of this claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">Exceptions were filed to the report of the auditor which were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\"><em>JSrrors assigned </em>among others were (2) In not finding that the widow was induced by false representations to pay the said sum of $1,000 to the executors.

If it was a gift there can be no recovery, and if it was a loan it is, as the auditor finds, barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A0o\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Whether the transaction between Agnes W. Seibert and the executors of her husband\u2019s estate was a gift, a loan, or an advancement under circumstances entitling her to subrogation to the rights of the creditors whose debts were paid was a question of fact. Its decision depended, to a very large extent, upon the veracity and recollection of witnesses. According to the testimony of the executor it was unquestionably a gift. He is the only living witness who was present when the transact tion was consummated, and his testimony is corroborated by the undisputed fact that, although Mrs. Seibert lived more than fourteen years after the transaction, and more than ten years after the executor\u2019s account was confirmed, she never demanded repayment of the money, or asserted in any way that she had any claim therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The testimony of H. C. Seibert relates to conversations had prior to the advancement of the money. It is not irreconcilable with that of the executor, and even if it were more seriously conflicting it would be entitled to less weight than that of the executor, because he does not pretend that he was present when the transaction was consummated. The contention that Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Seibert paid tbe money as rent, in ignorance of ber legal rights, is wholly unsupported by any direct testimony, and there is no evidence of any kind, from which the fact can be inferred fairly. We have not overlooked the receipt of April 1, 1880, in which the money was designated as rent; but this was given sometime after the money was advanced, and cannot affect the question, for these reasons: First, there is no evidence that the person who conceived the idea of designating the payment as rent, and who prepared the paper and presented it to the executor for his signature, had any authority to act for Mrs. Seibert, and there is evidence that she denied having had anything to do with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In view of the executor\u2019s explanation of the circumstances under which the paper was signed, we fail to see how it-shows that Mrs. Seibert was induced to pay the money by his fraudulent representation that she was under legal compulsion to pay rent for the mansion house. She never asserted it, and the allegation has nothing now to support it but pure surmise. But, second, the character of the original transaction is to be determined by what occurred at the time, and there is not a word of testimony that, at the time the money was paid, or before, anything was said or suggested as to her liability to pay rent for the premises. On the contrary, by all the testimony, including that of the appellant\u2019s witness, it was paid so as to avoid the necessity of a sale of the mansion house in which she lived, and there was ample testimony to warrant the conclusion that there was no understanding or expectation on her part that it was ever to be returned to her, or that she was to derive any other advantage therefrom than the continued use and occupancy of the mansion house. Having arrived at this conclusion the court properly held that the attempt to revive and enforce this as a claim against the estate, after'her death and after a lapse of over fourteen years, must fail. \u201c The benefit of substitution is only to be applied in a clear case, appearing from the proceedings in the case:\u201d Chancellor Kent, 4 Johns. 546. This is not such a case. And, even if Mrs. Seibert ever had the right to subrogation it was lost by her laches: Fink v. Mahaffy, 8 W. 384; Bank v. Potius, 10 W. 148; Rittenhouse v. Levering, 6 W. &amp; S. 190, 198; Stout\u2019s Admr. v. Stout\u2019s Admr., 44 Pa. 457; Allegheny V. R. R. Co. v. Dickey, 131 Pa. 86, 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The decree is affirmed and the appellant is directed to pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
