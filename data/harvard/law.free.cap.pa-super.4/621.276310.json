Before Stowe, P.

It is a plate of steel with angle iron bolted to its sides to keep it in shape, and is placed like an inclined plane so that the wire may run up to the rolls. The plaintiff\u2019s duty as a \u201c bender \u201d was to guide the wire across this pan to the next set of rollers. He had worked for two years at the next set of rolls and a number of times at this set, and had been working there for four days prior to the accident. He could see the pan from both positions occupied by him, and the evidence was that he knew and saw or could have known and seen that this \u201c pan \u201d had been warped and turned up at the corners, by virtue of which a \u201clast end\u201d of the wire caught on the corner of the pan and flying round burned plaintiff\u2019s arm. The court below left the question of negligence to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-7\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $400. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, (1) In its answer to the defendant\u2019s fourth point, which point and answer are as follows : \u201c 4. That if the jury find that the pan was so turned up at the edges and also find the plaintiff knew, or ought to have known, that it was, then there can be no recovery by the plaintiff. <em>Answer: </em>This is affirmed unless the evidence leads you to believe that the danger was not so obvious or apparent as to indicate to plaintiff that accident was likely to arise from the fact that the edges were turned up.\u201d (2) In its oral charge to the jury, as follows: \u201cHere was this machine originally in proper condition. We will assume, for the present, that it was allowed to get out of order. The plaintiff saw or was bound to see that it was out of order by the turning up of the corner. If he saw, or had reason to believe as an ordinarily cautious man, that that would increase the danger or risk of employment, and knowing that, worked at it, and this accident occurred by reason of that fact, he could not recover, because he has been guilty of contributory negligence. But if the danger was increased by this condition of the pan, and yet was not so obvious to the plaintiff as to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>manifest to him that it might increase the danger of his working there, but was at the same time such a danger, or such an increased danger arising out of the defect, that the superintendent, with his knowledge of the machinery, and the duty devolving upon him to see that the machines were kept reasonably and properly as safe as they could under the circumstances, having seen it should have known that that would increase the danger to the plaintiff of working at this machine, then although the plaintiff himself saw the defect, the defendant might be liable, because the superintendent had this superior knowledge or assumed superior knowledge. In other words, the defendant might have known that this increased the danger, while it was not manifest in itself to the plaintiff. If this defect was such that the defendant saw, or was bound to see, that it would increase the danger to the plaintiff working there, and the plaintiff not being himself conscious of the increased danger still worked there, the defendant would be guilty of negligence, while the plaintiff would be guilty of no negligence because he did not, in the exercise of common judgment, anticipate danger that was known or should have been known to the defendant. This is drawing a very fine line, but the whole thing turns right there, and when you come to that point you have got to consider that question. Here is the plaintiff, a skilled workman; he sees the condition of things, or is bound to see just as the defendant\u2019s superintendent is bound to see it, and it is for you to determine whether the evidence satisfies you, each of these men seeing that the danger was not manifest to the plaintiff and yet was manifest and apparent to the defendant. If it was not manifest to either, neither of them has been guilty of negligence, and the plaintiff cannot recover. If it was manifest to both, both have been guilty of negligence and the plaintiff cannot recover. But if it was apparent to the defendant, and if, under the circumstances, it was not such as would be apparent to the plaintiff, and, not comprehending or not being bound to anticipate this danger, he worked on when the defendant should have known that the danger was increased, then the plaintiff may recover, because in that case the defendant would be guilty of negligence and the plaintiff would not.\u201d (3) In its answer to the defendant\u2019s eighth point, which point and answer are as follows: \u201c 8.

Hughes, 128 Pa. 194, Justice Sterrett, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, says: \u201c That exception to the general rule is recognized in several cases, among which is Patterson v. The Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad, 76 Pa. 389, in which it is said that \u2018 When the servant, in obedience to the requirement of the master, incurs the risk of machinery, which, though dangerous, is not so much so as to threaten immediate injury, or where it is reasonably probable it may be safely used by extraordinary caution, the rule is different. In such case the master is liable for resulting accident.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-9\">To the same effect is Kehler v.

Although the plaintiff knew it, his continuing to work with the machine does not necessarily constitute contributory negligence which bars his recovery, if the evidence shows that it might be used with safety by the exercise of great care; the evidence shows it could be so used and, whether or not it could have been safely used with great care, and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>whether or not the plaintiff is gnilty of contributory negligence is a question for the jury, as the Supreme Court has said in Patterson v. Railroad Co., 76 Pa. 389; Brownfield v. Hughes, 128 Pa. 194; Kehler v. Schwenck, 151 Pa. 505, 518; Bennett v.

The general instructions of the trial judge in the court below and his answers to the numerous points presented by the defendant were in the main correct. The general principles of law governing the relation of master and servant in the use of machinery were carefully laid down and the relative duties of each fully explained. As to the point complained of the trial judge says: \u201c This is drawing a very fine line, but the whole thing turns right there and, when you come to that point, you have got to consider that question. Here is the plaintiff \u2014 a skilled workman. He sees the condition of things or is bound to see, just as the defendant\u2019s superintendent is bound to see it, and it is for you to determine whether the evidence satisfies you, each of these men seeing, that the danger was not manifest to the plaintiff and yet was manifest and apparent to the defendant. If it was not manifest to either, neither of them has been guilty of negligence and the plaintiff cannot recover. If it was manifest to both, both have been guilty of negligence and the plaintiff cannot recover; but, if it was apparent to the defendant and if under the circumstances, it was not such as would be apparent to the plaintiff, and not comprehending or not being bound to anticipate this danger, he worked on when the defendant should have known that the danger was increasing, then the plaintiff may recover, because in that case the defendant would be guilty of negligence and the plaintiff would not.\u201d The testimony in regard to the condition of the pan, as it was called, or rather the trough through which the wire ran to and from the rolls is very weak and doubtful. It is enough to go to the jury, because they are the judges of the credibility of a witness, and there is little else in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The only testimony upon the subject was that of Edward Gibbons, a helper of the plaintiff, whose regular position was much more distant from the rolls than that of the plaintiff who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>was tbe skilled workman. He testified that the pan was warped on the end of it \u2014 turned up. The plaintiff, who had worked at these rolls, called the first diamond, for four days immediately preceding the accident, and one of his witnesses, Wilson, also a skilled workman who worked at the same place, had neither of them seen it, as they testify. If it existed, it was such a defect as they ought to have seen, and seeing, to have reported to the superintendent of the mill. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony in regard to the danger attending such a condition of the pan as is described by the witness Gibbons,\u2019is clear. Gibbons says in his testimony that he told Mr. Wilson somebody would get hurt there, Wilson being a coemployee. He also says that \u201c it would work all right but it would some day catch it.\u201d Wilson in his testimony says: \u201cIf the rod catches, it is bound to fly; if anything will hold the end it is bound to fly.\u201d Here, then, is a defect which, if it existed, must have been patent to the plaintiff and to anyone working at the rolls. The danger, if the defect existed, must have been also apparent. He had large experience as a roller; had worked at these same rolls previously at sundry times, and continuously according to his turn for four days immediately prior to the accident. He admits in his own testimony that \u201c he could see as well as Mr. Rigley (the superintendent) or anybody else, and that his eyesight was as sharp as anybody\u2019s else.\u201d Leaving out of view all the testimony of the defendant, and considering this question solely from the testimony offered by the plaintiff, what evidence is there for submission to the jury from which they could find or infer that the defect complained of was apparent to the defendant, yet under the circumstances was not such as would be apparent to the plaintiff; and how was it possible, in the absence of any evidence upon that subject, for the jury to find that the plaintiff could continue his work \u201cnot comprehending or not being bound to anticipate this danger, when the defendant should have known that the danger was increasing ? \u201d There are no facts anywhere in the evidence upon which to base such a finding. There is no opinion of any witness, least of all of any expert, from which such a conclusion could be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Upon a careful examination of the whole case, we are of the opinion that the defendant\u2019s fourth point should have been affirmed without qualification, and that his eighth point \u201c that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>under all the testimony the verdict must be for the defendant,\u201d should also have been affirmed, and this upon the plaintiff's case as presented in the testimony adduced by him. The testimony of the defendant strengthens the moral aspect of its case, but not in any way its legal status. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
