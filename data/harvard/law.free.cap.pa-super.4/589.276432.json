Before Lyons, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">It appears from the opinion of the court below that Frederick Strawser and his family, consisting of his wife and three children, became a charge on Monroe township, Juniata county, in November, 1894. On the 18th of January, 1895, two justices of the peace, both of whom resided in Monroe township, granted an order of removal to the overseers of Monroe township which was by the said justices adjudged to be the'last place of legal settlement of Frederick Strawser and family. In pursuance of said order the overseers of Monroe township removed said paupers and delivered them to the overseers of Susquehanna township on January 80, 1895. On March 12, 1895, the order of removal was quashed for the reason that the two justices of the peace who had granted the order, both resided in Monroe township. On April 17,1895, the overseers of Susquehanna township applied for and obtained an order of removal for said paupers to Monroe township and delivered them to the overseers of said township. From this order the Monroe township overseers appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">There was ho evidence to show that the pauper had ever gained a settlement in Monroe township in any way, nor is there any evidence to show that he gained a settlement in Susquehanna township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\">The court below dismissed the appeal and confirmed order of removal back to Monroe township, holding that the costs and expenses of maintaining the said paupers while a charge on Susquehanna township was upon Monroe township, because they became chargeable there, and that as between Susquehanna and Monroe the burden was on Monroe, an'd the order of removal was properly granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-8\">The court also held that there was no evidence to show that the overseers of Susquehanna accepted the paupers in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>instance without an order of removal. They received them and provided for them, but this the act of assembly required them to do. Only one of the overseers had received them, and even if he had accepted them that would not bind the township; it would require the action of both overseers to bind the township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-3\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (1) In dismissing appeal and confirming the order of removal. (2) In deciding that Frederick Strawser and his family had a quasi settlement in Monroe township. (5) In answering plaintiffs\u2019 first point of law. Said point and answer are as follows : \u201c That when the order of removal of date January 19, 1895, under which these paupers were removed from Monroe township to Susquehanna township, was quashed by the court, the said Frederick Strawser, his wife and family continued to remain chargeable to the township of Monroe. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d (6) In answering plaintiffs\u2019second point of law. Said point and answer are as follows : \u201c That when the said order of reproval dated January 19, 1895, was quashed, it was the duty of the overseers of Monroe township to take charge of the said paupers until they could be removed to their last place of lega], settlement. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d (8) In answering the plaintiffs\u2019 fourth point of law. Said point and answer are as follows : \u201c The burden of searching for the last place of legal settlement of these paupers was not shifted to Susquehanna township, by removing them into that township under the order of removal of January 19, 1895, which was subsequently declared void by the court. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d (11) In answering plaintiffs\u2019 seventh point of law. Said point and answer are as follows : \u201c As between the township of Monroe and the township of Susquehanna, the township of Monroe is the place of settlement of these paupers, Frederick Strawser, his wife and children. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d (12) In answering plaintiffs\u2019 eighth point of law. Said point and answer are as follows : \u201c The said Frederick Strawser and his family have a quasi settlement, at least, in the township of Monroe, by reason of their having first become chargeable to said township. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.\u201d (16) In holding that there is no evidence in the case such as warrants us in finding as a fact that the overseers of Susquehanna accepted the paupers as the paupers of that township.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>May 10, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-3\"><em>J.

As to the place of his birth, and where he had resided before this time, we are left practically in the dark. On the 6th of November, 1894, through an order of relief, regularly issued by two justices of the peace, Strawser, together with his wife and children, became a charge on the poor district of Monroe township. On January 19, 1895, two justices of the peace of Monroe township granted an order for the removal of Strawser and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>his family to Susquehanna township, which order was executed by the overseers of the former township, on the 30th day of the same month. An appeal was taken from this order of removal by the overseers of the poor district of Susquehanna township, and on March 12,1895, the order was quashed, for the reason that the justices had no power to grant an order removing a pauper from their own township to another: Overseers of Washington v. Overseers of Beaver, 3 W. &amp; S. 548. The two disti\u2019icts were thus left where they began: West Buffalo v. Walker Township, 8 Pa. 177; but, as Monroe township refused and neglected to take back the paupers, the overseers of Susquehanna township, after an order of relief had duly issued, on April 26, 1895, obtained an order for their removal to Monroe township, and executed it on or about May 4,1895. From this order the overseers of the latter township appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">The court below properly confirmed the order of removal, on the grounds that there was no evidence that the paupers had a settlement of any kind in Susquehanna township, while it clearly appeared that they had a quasi settlement in Monroe. If we felt called xapon -to fully retry the case oar the facts, we would be coaaapelled to agree with the learned trial judge iar all his findings; aror do we discover any error iai his coaaclusioais of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">We are asked, however, in case of affirmance of the decree, to anodify it, by adding express words permitting a secoaad reanoval \u00aef the paupers to Susquehaama, for the reasoai, alleged in the request, but denied by the appellees, th'atStrawser\u2019s derivative settlement is iar-Susquehanna. In other words, we are requested to formally announce, through our decree, that this litigation may be deemed only fairly begun at the point where a law suit usually ends. At the hearing in the court below, the appellants had the right to defend, oai the ground that Strawser\u2019s settlement was in Susquehanna (Overseers of Reading v. Overseers of Cumree, 5 Binn. 81), arad, if they had established that fact, their liability worald have ended. It cannot be denied that they had ample time for preparation, as the opiaiioai of the court was not filed, until aaearly eight months after the taking of the appeal to the quarter sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Whether such a defense caar be saved to furnish the maiaispring for another proceeding, which could have been so easily avoided, is doubtful. It is enough to hold, however, that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the decree is in proper form, and warranted by the law and the evidence, it needs no reformation. As to its ulterior effect on future litigation we may say as was said regarding the same question in Moreland Township v. Davidson Township, 71 Pa. 371, \u201cwe will leave this until it occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Decree affirmed and appellants directed to pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
