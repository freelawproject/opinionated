If the jury find from the evidence that after the goods were delivered to the defendant, the plaintiff called upon him and demanded the goods or pay for them, and the defendant agreed to return the goods and in the plaintiff\u2019s presence put the goods in a box and nailed it, shut and with a chalk or pencil wrote the plaintiff\u2019s name on the top of the box, with his New York address, and then told the plaintiff to take the goods away, and the plaintiff accepted the goods and called a drayman to take them away, there was in law a redelivery of the goods to the plaintiff; and the refusal of the defendant afterwards to allow the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>take the goods away was an unlawful and fraudulent retention of the <em>goods; </em>and the plaintiff is entitled to recover. <em>Answer: </em>This point is affirmed, excepting that, of course, the last clause of it, in regard to the plaintiff being entitled to recover is subject to our other instructions.\u201d (4) To a portion of the judge\u2019s charge, as follows: \u201c The plaintiff says \u2014 and you may have just heard us say \u2014 -that where goods are obtained fraudulently, with the intent to cheat the vendor out of the goods or the proceeds of the goods, they cannot and ought not to be retained. Outside of any other question in the case, the plaintiff maintains that there was a fraudulent intent on the part of this defendant not to pay for these goods, to cheat and deprive the plaintiff of them; and if you believe that frojn the facts in the case, then you would be warranted in finding a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d (6) To a portion of the judge\u2019s charge, as follows:. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s counsel asks us here, in a proposition of law submitted to the court, to say to you that there are no facts in this case, in addition to the allegation of insolvency (which is denied by them) to go to the jury to show intended fraud. We listened with more than usual care to the arguments of the counsel on both sides, in order that we might determine in our mind whether there were other facts, in connection with alleged insolvency, to warrant us in submitting this case to you under the laws of Pennsjd vania, which, taken with the fact of insolvency and knowledge of insolvency, in case you find its existence, would warrant us in submitting the case to you, and we have concluded, after careful consideration, that there are such facts in the case as to warrant their submission at our hands ; and we submit the question to you.\u201d . (7) To a portion of the judge\u2019s charge, as follows : \u201cAll the facts surrounding this transaction have been fully argued on both sides; and you must take them into consideration. Although we direct your minds particularly to the occurrences of the 28th of October, yet you must consider all the transactions from the time the order was given down to .that day, in determining whether there was a fraudulent intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiff out of these goods or the price of them. I do not know, in reference to this feature of the case, of anything further that I can say to you that will aid you in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion on this branch of the case. I simply say to you that this is the law of the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>applicable to the transaction. In case you believe that the defendant repurchased, reacquired title to these goods on the 28th of October, if you are satisfied from the testimony in this case that he did that, at that time being insolvent and lmowing that he was insolvent, and intending to cheat and defraud the plaintiff out of his goods, then you would be warranted in finding a verdict for the plaintiff in this case; otherwise, you would find a verdict for the defendant. And what we mean when we say this is, that if there are such circumstances connected with the transaction as tend to show any trick or artifice or false representation in the transaction by which he acquired the goods, if there was anything to show that, taken in connection with the evidence of insolvency, that would be sufficient to warrant you in saying that this was a fraudulent transaction, and, therefore, finding for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKan\">April 19, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-5\">Stevens, <em>Owens $ </em>Pasooe, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKo\">\u2014 Even if defendant was insolvent at the time of sale and knew it, the concealment of this knowledge by mere silence, without active' misrepresentations, was not such a fraud as would avoid the sale: Shirk v.

The plaintiff denied positively that any such contract was made or talked about, but testified that when he returned to the, store with a drayman for the goods, the defendant refused to deliver them; threatened him with physical violence, and placed the clothing again on the shelves.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The plaintiff caused a writ of replevin to be issued, and when served, the defendant gave bond and retained the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">A verdict for $214.21 was rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">While the original contract was executed in the state of New York, the rescission of it in Pennsylvania left the parties free to contract here, and the whole question in this case was one of fact, viz: Was a new contract made at Tyrone on October 28, by which the same goods were again sold to the defendant by the plaintiff ?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">As it was stated by the learned trial judge to the jury, \u201c Here is a square, plain and simple issue of fact for you to determine. Hid the plaintiff consent that the defendant should retain the goods on the terms testified to by the defendant ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">The contention of plaintiff was, that the proceeding of the defendant was a scheme and trick to get possession of the goods; that he was practically insolvent at the time, and while the means employed were circuitous and novel the object of the original order was to get the goods in his store, and eventually secure them through the means practiced. Tbe defendant urged that the purchase by him October 28, was in good faith, and describes the transaction \u2014 after the original contract had been rescinded, the goods boxed up and marked with the owner\u2019s name, and ready for delivery to the railroad for reshipment to New York, as follows; \u201cWhen I came in the store I seen Davis and his drayman he had called, and as I came in his drayman left the store; I says, \u2018 What\u2019s this ? \u2019 He says \u2018 I want to save you the money to have the goods hauled over; \u2019 then I says, \u2018Davis, what do you take me for?\u2019 I says, \u2018You are doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>a very wrong thing to me; I have treated you like a gentleman; why didn\u2019t you leave your goods alone ? I went out on purpose to get a drayman; if I didn\u2019t want to give you these goods back I could keep them;\u201d and after further conversation on the propriety of plaintiff\u2019s conduct, the defendant continued; \u201che talked to me and apologized over and over; I says, \u2018That\u2019s all right, but you can\u2019t wipe out what you have done; \u2019 I says, T offered you to take the goods back; \u2019 he says, \u2018 Keep the goods,\u2019 he says, \u2018Will you give me a note?\u2019 I says, \u2018You can take your goods; \u2019 then he got to talking around; he says, \u2018 Who will you get to indorse the note?\u2019 I says, \u2018I won\u2019t get anybody; if you wish to take my note, you can do so or take the goods; \u2019 he says, \u2018 No, I don\u2019t want the goods; when will you pay me ? \u2019 I says, \u2018 I will pay you this bill for the amount of the goods maybe today and maybe tomorrow, anyhow not later than the 14th of November.\u2019 Then he again took my hand and shook it and says, \u2018Well, Cosel, good bye;\u2019 he says, \u2018When will I get that check? \u2019 I says, \u2018 Perhaps I will send you that check in a day or two; \u2019 my actual intention was to send that check, as I pay all my bills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On the evening of that day the writ of replevin was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The learned trial judge refused a new trial; saying in the opinion filed: \u201c The case was carefully tried, the usual amount of spirit and energy was displayed between the counsel, as well as the parties. The jury saw the parties, heard their testimony, and in a case where our views are as fully in accord with theirs, as expressed in their verdict, we could not conscientiously impose upon the parties the burden of another trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">A careful review of the testimony fully warranted the verdict returned by the jury, and the court below submitted the whole question to them in a charge which correctly disposed of the legal questions raised by the points.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
