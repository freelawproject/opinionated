Before Lyons, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-8\">It appears from the opinion of the court below that Stewart Wilson Page, a minor child of Jacob S. Page, became a charge upon Fermanagh township. The pauper is the grandson of Jacob Page who owned a farm in Fayette township where he lived at the time of the birth of Jacob S. Page, who thus had a settlement in Fayette township by birth; he also gained a settlement for himself in said township.. It was claimed, however, that Jacob S. had obtained a settlement in Milford township before his minor son became a charge upon Fermanagh township. That said settlement was gained by a series of leasings. As to the leasing of one house covering a period of five months the controversy arose over the alleged leasing of the second house known as the McCullough house, the use of which was accorded to Jacob S. as part payment of his services as a farm laborer. He subsequently moved into another house known as the Dixon house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-9\">In regard to these facts the court below, Lyons, P. J., found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>as follows: \u201c Under this state of facts was there a leasing of the McCullough house as contemplated by the act of assembly? The contract between Stewart McCullough and Jacob S. Page, was very similar to that in Beaver v. Hartley, 11 Pa. 254. Page was to have, according to his own testimony, $12.00 per month, and house rent and fire wood free; and according to the testimony of <em>W. </em>H. Souder, $10.00 per month, and house and fire wood, the use of a cow and some potatoes that were in the ground. The monthly wages were therefore not the only consideration for his labor, but the occupancy of the house was a part of it. And Page testifies that if he had not had the use of the house he would have wanted at least $2.00 per month more wages. He further testifies that, this arrangement was to last until spring. He also testified that after the death of Stewart McCullough he made a new contract with his daughter \u201c Nelle,\u201d by which he was to get $12.00 per month, house rent and fire wood until after the sale of the personal property of Stewart McCullough, deceased. The testimony shows that Stewart McCullough died November 30, 1890, and 'that the personal property was sold December 23, 1890. That from that time on nothing was said about rent, but he was to live in the house and take care of the property. This was a farm house which the former tenant had on account of a disagreement between him and his landlord, vacated and left empty, and it was important to have the house occupied by someone who would take care of the barn and the other outbuildings thereon. This according to the evidence was worth the rent of the house, and the rent of the house was worth more than $10.00 per annum, and the rent was paid by the services of Jacob S. Page.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-4\">Occupancy of a tenement as a reward for services will gain a settlement: Burns\u2019 Justice, 519; Beaver v. Hartley, 11 Pa. 254; Laporte Borough v. Hillsgrove township, 95 Pa. 269. The amount of the rent is not material if the tenement be of the yearly value of $10.00: Burns\u2019 Justice, Pa. 522. The testimony does not show how long Page lived in the Dixon house, but it was at least six months. ' As J. W. Stimmel testified that he paid $9.50 and \u201c did not pay rent for the whole time he was in there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-5\">The following are therefore found as facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">1.
