Before Stewart, P. J. The case stated was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">And now January 27, 1896, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties to the above suit, that the following case be stated for the opinion of the court in the nature of a special verdict. Roller and Shoemaker the plaintiffs above named on December 28, 1888, recovered a judgment against E. Goss, before M. J. Slick, Esq., a justice of the peace within and for the county and state aforesaid in the sum of $67.55 with costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-9\">On the same day to wit: December 28,1888, W. N. Meredith became bail for stay of execution upon the above cited judgment. No execution was ever issued against Goss, and nothing more was done by the plaintiffs until December 27, 1895, when they issued a scire facias against the said W. N. Meredith, to show cause why they should not have execution against him in satisfaction of the above judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-10\">The sci. fa. was returnable to January 3, 1896, when the plaintiffs appeared before the magistrate by counsel and the said W. N. Meredith appeared in his own person, and pleaded the bar of the statute of limitations to the action against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-11\">By agreement of both parties the case was continued to January 10, when the case was argued by counsel and the justice deferred his judgment to January 17.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-12\">January 17,1896, the justice gave judgment against the plaintiffs for costs, upon the ground that the statute of limitations was a bar to the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-13\">January 24, 1896, plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the justice, and filed their appeal in the common pleas the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>If the court be of opinion that the statute of limitations is not a bar to the action, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $94.40 and costs; but if the court is of opinion that the statute of limitation is a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, then judgment to be entered for the defendant for costs. The costs to follow the judgment and either party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-3\">Following is a copy of the recognizance :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-4\">\u201cDec. 28,1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\"><em>\u201c </em>I agree to become'bail absolute in the sum.of One Hundred and Thirty Dollars for stay of execution in the above case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">\u201c (Signed,) W. N. Meredith.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">The opinion and decree of the court, by Stewart, P. J., is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">\u201c In determining whether the statute of limitations is a bar in any particular case, regard must be had to the cause and not to the form of the action. \u2018 It may be stated as a general rule, that whenever the cause of action is such as would be subject to the bar, if prosecuted under any of these forms, then the\u2019 statute is applicable; otherwise not: \u2019 Hannum v. Borough of West Chester, 68 Pa. 475.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">\u201c Here the question is raised in an action on a recognizance of bail for stay of execution, begun by a writ of scire facias. Considering the cause of action, the remedy might as well have been by action of debt. As such it is to be regarded for present purposes. Can the bar of the statute be pleaded against it?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-10\">\u201c The statute makes subject to the bar, \u2018 All actions of debt, grounded upon any lending or contract, without specialty.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\">\u201c The cause of action here is without specialty, and the one question presented is, whether it be grounded upon any lending or contract. If so the bar of the statute will prevail; otherwise not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-12\">\u201c While I have no case at hand, directly in point, in which the applicability of the statute to recognizances for bail is ruled, yet an entirely safe conclusion can be reached in the light of the construction given to the words of the statute in Richards -v. Bickley, 13 S. &amp; R. 395. In that case the action was in debt on a foreign judgment, but the reasoning of the court is as applicable as though it had been founded on a recognizance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201c It is said,\u201d says Duncan, J., \u201c that all actions as well of debt as of assumpsit, are debts on simple contracts and therefore within the words of the statute. The words are, \u2018 All actions of debt, grounded on any lending or contract without specialty.\u2019 If it had been all actions of debt, without specialty, this action would have been included; but all actions of debt without specialty are not limited, but those only grounded on a lending or contract, and this action is not founded on any lending, and therefore not limited, though it be without specialty. All actions of debt are founded on contracts in deed or in law; and if it had been intended to limit all actions of debt generally, the words, \u2018 grounded on any lending' or contract,\u2019 would have been superfluous. But the statute was only intended to limit those actions which are grounded upon any lending or contract in fact, and the word lending explains the word contract to be of the same nature; and as early as 20 Car. 2, this construction was put on these words in Hoddsen v. Iiarridge, 2 Saund. 65, and the principle has ever since prevailed. It was the construction of the English Statute when our act was passed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-4\">\u201c A recognizance of bail for stay of execution is no more a lending or contract than a foreign judgment. Any action upon it is of course founded upon a contract, but not on such contract in fact as is contemplated by the Statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">\u201c It follows that the case is with the plaintiff, and now March, 1896, judgment is ordered on the case stated in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, for the sum of ninety-four dollars and forty cents ($94.40) with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">The record disclosed no judgment entered and no assignments of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-7\"><em>Linn </em>Harlaugh, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0bN\">\u2014 Chief Justice Gibson repeatedly terms a recognizance of this kind a contract \u2014 an original undertaking: Wolfe v.
