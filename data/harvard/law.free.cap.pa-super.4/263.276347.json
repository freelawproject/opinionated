The loan was made, said Adler delivering the money and obtaining note therefor. The following is a copy of note which was given said Alder for the plaintiff:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">Gettysburg, Pa., Sept. 17, 1894.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">On demand after date we promise to pay to the order of Mr. Jos.

Action of assumpsit was brought upon this note by the plaintiff on May 24,1895, against Adam Braunreuter and Elise Braunreuter. Elise Braunreuter filed an affidavit of defense and pleas of nonassumpsit and coverture to said action. Adam Braunreuter died August 2, 1895, and his estate was not made in any way whatever, a party defendant to the action. The plaintiff proceeded to trial on the issue between himself and Elise Braunreuter, and the jury were sworn to try the issue between Joseph Strause, manager, plaintiff and Elise Braunreuter, defendant, both being living parties to the issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-11\">Upon the trial the defendant offered to go on witness stand to prove facts occurring at the giving of the note in the presence of Elias Adler, the representative of the plaintiff, to establish the fact that the note concerned the business of her husband and no business of hers; that there was no consideration moving to her. That she signed the note as bail for her husband, and she so signed the note at the request or command of her husband in the presence of said Adler, the representative of the plaintiff. The court refused to allow the defendant to so testify as incompetent under section 5, clause E, of act of 1887. To this ruling exception was taken by the defendant.

This witness is alleged to have made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>many conflicting and contradictory statements. After this witness retired defendant offered to testify to what occurred between her and Adler, confining her testimony to matters testified to by Adler. The court refused to allow defendant to testify. To this ruling exception was taken by the defendant. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">Defendant asked that the facts be passed upon by the jury, upon the testimony of Adler, whether defendant was security or not upon the note in suit, by reason of the conflicting and contradictory statements of the witness. This was refused by the court and the jury instructed by the court to find for the plaintiff.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">No interest or policy of law now makes any person an incompetent witness in any civil case or proceeding unless he is shown to come within one of the specified exceptions, and the only exceptions we are here called upon to consider are those contained in clauses <em>(a) </em>and <em>(e) </em>of section 5 of the Act of May 23, 1887, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>P. L. 158. By clause (e) the disqualification is made to depend not only on the fact of the witness being a surviving or remaining party, to the thing or contract in action but also on the fact of his having an interest adverse to the right of the deceased party which right has passed by his own act or the act of the law to a party on the record who represents his interest in the subject in controversy. The deceased party to the contract in action was Adam Braunreuter but his right had not passed to a party on the record who represented his interest. The issue was between Joseph H. Strause and Elise Braunreuter. The legal representative of Adam Braunreuter was not a party to the record, and the testimony which the defendant proposed to give related to matters occurring between her and the agent of the living plaintiff, and concerning which he had testified fully at the instance of the plaintiff. The estate of Adam Braunreuter may have been interested in the question being tried, but not in the immediate result of the suit. There is wanting, therefore, one of the essentials necessary to bring the case within the exception. The language of the clause is plain and unambiguous, and there is no justification for construction whereby it shall be extended to cases not expressly excepted from the general rule of competency. But even if there were room for construction we think the decision in Bank v. Henning, 171 Pa. 899 would be conclusive of.the question for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">Nor was she an incompetent witness under clause (c). What she proposed to testify to was in no sense a confidential communication, and the common law rule which prevents the husband or wife from divulging in testimony such communications after the death of the other does not apply. The wife after the death of the husband is competent to prove facts coming to her knowledge from other sources, and not by means of her situation as a wife, notwithstanding they related to the transactions of her husband: 1 Gr. Ev. sec. 338, (15th ed.); Cornell v. Vanartsdalen, 4 Pa. 364; Peiffer v. Lytle, 58 Pa. 386; Robb\u2019s Appeal, 98 Pa. 501. The defendant was a competent witness, and her testimony going to show that she was a mere surety on the note should have been received. The first assignment of error being sustained it is unnecessary to discuss the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The judgment-is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
