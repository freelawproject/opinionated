The first exception is to that part of the charge in which the court says: \u201c Among all the cases cited there is not a single case like the present, not one, in this: that the money deposited in the bank is alleged by the depositor to have been received by him as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>agent of companies which lie named and deposited in this bank; that on the same day, whether before or after the attachment was served is not clear, the same agent telegraphed to the man who had given him one of these checks to stop its payment in bank; it was not paid to the bank, and the bank so says, payment was stopped, protest was entered and suit was afterwards brought by the bank in which it had been deposited and from which it had been removed, which was done before the service of the attachment against the party, who paid it again the second time to the agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">(2) The second exception is to that part of the charge in which the court says : \u201c Now, gentlemen of the jury, you will have to find, in the first place, from the evidence, remembering it, whether this notice given Kingsley &amp; Son by wire was given them before the service of this attachment on the 3d of September. If it was, then you need not consider anything more in reference to that notice ; because if he ordered the party who gave him the check not to pay it to the bank, then he could not compel the bank to pay it, nor could those who issued the attachment compel the bank to pay it unless it ivas there and unmoved or the order not given to protest it before this attachment was issued. If you find the notice was prior to the service of this attachment upon the bank, then I say you need not consider that any further, because it could not be recovered by him nor the attaching creditor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">(3) The third exception is to that part of the charge in which the court says : \u201c Then there would be $49.00 and some cents, you will remember the amount, which you would still further have to consider; and it will be for you to say then whether that belongs to him or the party for whom he was acting as agent, whether paid him as his own money or paid him as their agent. He says it was paid him as agent, none of it was his, it belonged to these companies, and he shows you the amount, the bank book shows you who the check was from. He tells you that was for insurance; and if you find that belonged to them and not to him, the attachment should not hold it, because they can follow it wherever they find it, there are earmarks sufficient for them to claim it. In that case your verdict would have to be for defendant, the Tanners\u2019 Fire Insurance Company, which has a claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>(4) In answer to the first point submitted by the plaintiff: \u201c 1. If the jury believe that the check of Kingsley &amp; Son for $361 was accepted by the bank, not only for transmission or collection, but as cash, or treated it as such, then they would be warranted in finding that there was in the hands of the bank the sum of $410.58 at the time of the attachment belonging to Samuel Kurtz or to the insurance companies. <em>Answer: </em>That would be true with everything except the $361. If the jury should find that payment of that had been stopped before the service of the attachment, then the attachment would not bind it. The defendant could not recover it, nor could the attaching creditors if he ordered it stopped before the attachment was served.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\">(5) Answer to the second point submitted by the plaintiff: \u201c 2. If the jury believe that the bank has credited the defendant with the Kingsley check, has never charged it back and has brought suit as a bona fide holder of the said check against Kingsley, then the bank is estopped from denying or refusing the credit it gave for this check. <em>Answer: </em>That would be subject to the same conditions that I have stated with reference to the first point. Why it was not charged back we cannot tell. They acknowledge receiving notice of protest of nonpayment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">(6) Answer to the third point submitted by plaintiff: \u201c 3. If the jury believe that the bank on this trial disclaims any right to withhold, or does not withhold, the credit given for this check, then the jury would be warranted in finding the amount of $410.58 in the hands of the bank belonging to the defendant, or to him as agent. <em>Answer: </em>We say it would not, under the evidence of the officers of the bank on the stand. This money has not been paid, the note was protested and has not yet been collected. The jury would not be permitted to find a verdict nor the court to enter a judgment against the garnishee in such case. It is not shown the money is in the bank; it is shown it is not. It is in dispute even if correct and not denied for the attachment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">(7) Answer to the fourth point submitted by plaintiff: \u201c4. If the jury finds this amount to be in the hands of the bank and believe that the insurance companies, claimants, have since the attachment, been paid, then all of the said amount would belong to Samuel Kurtz, and the verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Answer: </em>There is no evidence, as I remember, of the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ment of the Tanners Insurance Co. claim; there is evidence of the payment of the Lebanon claim and the Phoenix claim; the Phoenix claim is admitted by the other side to be paid, and a statement was produced, you remember, by, a witness showing he owed Lebanon nothing. It was said there was some commissions of his unsettled, for that might leave him, if paid to him, indebted to them, but that was not stated here; and the evidence so far as shown on the stand in his claim was settled, paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\">(8) In allowing the following offer of the defendant: \u201cDefendant offers in evidence defendant\u2019s claim for the benefit of the $300 law in this attachment, filed on September 11, 1891, and marked \u2018 J.

Defendant excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">(9) In not charging the jury that \u201c the defendant could not disclaim title in the property, and at the same time file his claim for the exemption; and that if the effect of the disclaimer of title to the whole of a fund and a claim of title to a part of the same fund was to hinder, delay, or put the plaintiff to any additional expense, the defendant would not be entitled to the benefit of the exemption.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-6\"><em>John A.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">This was an attachment execution in which the Union National Mt. Joy Bank was summoned as garnishee of Samuel Kurtz, who was secretary of the. Tanners\u2019 Mutual Fire Ins. Co., and agent for two other companies. These companies were permitted to become parties to the record and to plead and make defence to the extent of their several interests in the money attached. The plea was nulla bona, and on the trial of the issue evidence was given tending to prove the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Kurtz received a salary from the Tanners\u2019 Insurance Company and commissions on collections made for the two other companies. He collected premiums and assessments for these com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>pa\u00f1\u00edes and deposited them in his own name in the garnishee\u2019s bank, in which he opened an account for the purpose. He testified that when he opened the account he informed the teller, Mr. Longenecker, who afterwards became the cashier, that the deposits he would make would belong to the insurance- companies, \u201c barring, possibly, some commissions and salary.\u201d This was denied by Mr. Longenecker, or, to be more exact, he testified that he had no recollection that such notice was given. The deposits were marked by the teller in Kurtz\u2019s bank book and on the bank\u2019s \u201cscrateher\u201d with the names of the parties who paid the money. At the close of business on August 81, 1891, he had on deposit the sum of $128.39. On the following day he deposited checks amounting to $820.50 which the bank placed to his credit, and on the same day the bank honored his checks to the amount,of $706.39. At the close of business for the day, the balance standing to his credit was $242.50. On the following day (September 2) he deposited $16.8.08, so that on September 3, when the attachment was issued and served, there was an apparent balance to his credit of $410.58. One of the checks deposited on September 2 was drawn by Kingsley &amp; Son on another bank, and given in payment of a premium of $275.50 on a policy issued by the Tanners\u2019 Ins. Co. and of assessments, amounting respectively to $40.50 and $45, on policies in the two other companies. This check Avas marked \u201c Kingsley \u201d in Kurtz\u2019s bank book and in the bank\u2019s \u201c scrateher.\u201d Immediately after Kurtz received notice that the attachment had been served on the bank, he requested Kingsley &amp; Son to stop payment of the check and to pay him the amount. They complied with his request, and he accounted for the amount to the companies. The check spoken of was duly protested and the garnishee bank has brought a suit upon it against Kingsley &amp; Son, which is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The plaintiff requested instructions to the effect that as the bank credited the defendant with the Kingsley check, never charged it back, and brought suit on it in its own name against the drawers it was estopped from denying or refusing the credit it gave therefor; in other words, it is to be treated as having the money, although as matter of fact the money never came into its hands. If the defendant had been the absolute owner of the check there might be some plausibility in this contention. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>For, as we read his testimony, he did not notify the drawers of the check to stop payment until after the attachment had been served on the bank; and, obviously, nothing that he said or did after that, with regard to the payment of the check, could affect the attaching creditor\u2019s rights as against his interest in the deposit attached. But we are of opinion that the case does not turn on the question whether payment of the check was stopped before or after the service of the attachment, and that undue prominence was given to that feature of the case. The real issue was as to the beneficial ownership of the check and the credit given upon it. If, as the evidence strongly tended to show, it was in the insurance companies, then it was not subject to attachment for Kurtz\u2019s debt, and the bank was not estopped from proving that collection was prevented by the action of the companies\u2019 agent. For this reason, if for-no other, it would have been error to affirm the points without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The general doctrine regarding the right to follow trust funds, is thus stated in Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., secs. 1258, 1259 (13th ed.): \u201c The general proposition which is maintained both at law and in equity upon this subject is, that if any property in its original state and form is covered with a trust in favor of the principal, no change of that state and form can divest it of such trust or give the agent or trustee converting it or those who represent him in right (not being purchasers for value without notice) any more valid claim in respect to it than they respectively had before such change. ... It matters not in the slightest degree into whatever other form different from the original the change may have been made, whether it be that of promissory notes, or of goods or of stock; for the product of the substitute for the original thing still follows the nature of the thing itself, so long as it can be ascertained to be such. The right ceases only when the means of ascertainment fails.\u201d See also Bisph. Eq., sec. 86 (2d ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Upon this familiar principle it is held that the true ownership of a fund deposited in bank may be proved to be in another than the person in whose name the deposit is made. Whether the bank is chargeable to the true owner must depend upon the circumstances of the case: Stair v. York Nat\u2019l Bank, 55 Pa. 364; Erisman\u2019s Appeal, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 144. But as a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>rule, where the depositor could recover in an action at law if he were the true owner, the latter can recover in his own name in an action for money had and received: Frazier v. Erie Bank, 8 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 18; Stair v. Bank, supra; Bank v. Bache, 71 Pa. 213; Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 National Bank v. King, 57 Pa. 202. In the last cited case Mr. Justice Strong said: \u201cA de posit in bank, then, does not change the property in trust funds deposited by a trustee. The depositor may become a creditor of the bank, but he holds the contract in trust as he held the money before. It is not applicable to the payment of his debts to a general creditor. And a creditor who attaches the debt due from the bank to him can be in no better condition than the depositor. At most he becomes a statutory assignee of a naked legal right, with the beneficial ownership in another.\u201d Applying these principles to the present case the first question is as to the true ownership of the Kingsley check. Was it in Kurtz or in the insurance companies? If the evidence on the part of the defence is to be credited \u2014 and that was a question for the jury \u2014 it belonged to the insurance companies. Being the true owners of the check they had a right as between themselves and Kurtz, and as between themselves and the attaching creditor, who stands in Kurtz\u2019s shoes, to make any arrangement they saw fit with Kingsley &amp; Son with regard to the payment of the debts for which it was given. The only person who could object would be the bank; but as the bank was only conditionally liable to the depositor or to the true owner of the cheek, it could in no way be prejudiced by the arrangement made. The effect was to discharge Kingsley &amp; Son from liability on the check and the bank from the conditional credit it had given to the depositor. It would be monstrous to hold that the bank must pay money to the attaching creditor which it never received and which, if it had been received, would not have belonged to tire defendant in the attachment, and that it may make itself whole by compelling Kingsley &amp; Son to pay it the money which they have already paid to the parties rightfully entitled to it. Fortunately no legal principle or legal fiction requires this to be done. Much is said in the argument of collusion between Kurtz and Kingsley &amp; Son, but the fact that the arrangement was made by Kurtz can make no difference. He was the agent of the companies and must be regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>acting in their behalf. Assuming, of course, that they were the true owners of the check, fidelity to his principals dictated that he should omit no legitimate effort to prevent their money being taken to. pay his debt. It follows from what we have said that the-question as to the beneficial ownership of that portion of Kurtz\u2019s deposit represented by the Kingsley check was for the jury; and, the fact being found in favor of the theory of the defence, the legal status of the case is the same as if Kingsley &amp; Son had stopped payment at the request of some other officer or agent of- the companies, and then had paid the money directly to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">As to the residue of the fund, a different question is presented. Conceding that, at the time of the service of the attachment, although deposited in Kurtz\u2019s name, it really belonged to the insurance companies, yet, if since the attachment he has paid their claims represented by that particular fund, then, to that extent, the fund was freed from the trust, and belonged to him. It is to be treated the same as money coming into the hands of the garnishee after the service of the attachment, and hence was bound by it: Sheetz v. Hobensack, 20 Pa. 412; Mahon v. Kunkle, 50 Pa. 216; Hays v. Lycoming Ins. Co., 99 Pa. 621. Kurtz testified, and as to this there was no dispute, that he had settled with and paid two of the companies after the attachment, and that nothing was coming to them out of the fund, and according to the testimony of the officers of the other company nothing is coming to them. Kurtz, it is true, seemed to think differently, but his assertion goes for naught as against the company\u2019s disclaimer. Where a deposit standing in the name of the defendant is attached, neither he nor the bank can defeat the attachment by setting up title in a third person who disclaims ownership. The fact being practically undisputed that <em>any </em>claim which the insurance companies may have had to the fund, after deducting the Kingsley check, had been extinguished by Kurtz, the plaintiff was entitled to positive instructions that it was bound by the attachment. The third and seventh assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The admission in evidence of the defendant\u2019s exemption claim for the purpose merely of showing that he kept up his claim did the plaintiff no harm, and is not ground for reversal. But as the case must go back for retrial it will be well for the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>below to consider, in the final disposition of the case, whether, in view of the defendant\u2019s disclaimer of ownership of any part of the fund, persisted in even up to the trial, he can have it set apart to him under the exemption law. In Strouse v. Becker, 38 Pa. 190, it was said that if the debtor \u201c equivocates and dissembles, denies the ownership of that which he cannot hide, and embarrasses the officer of the law in the execution of his legal duties, he forfeits, not only his self respect, but his hold on the exemption provided for honest debtors.\u201d This doctrine has been recognized in many later decisions: See Kreider\u2019s Estate, 135 Pa. 578, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias denovo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
