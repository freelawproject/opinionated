The commission denied the credit, reasoning that Code \u00a7 65.2-520 authorizes credits only against compensation payments, not medical benefits. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Michael Lewis Wilson, a Michigan resident, worked for George Kountoupes Painting Co. His employer, also based in Michigan, hired Wilson to paint a water tower in Portsmouth, Virginia. Wilson sustained injuries to his head, neck, and back while working on the tower. He filed a claim for benefits with the commission seeking a temporary-total disability award and lifetime medical benefits. Over the employer\u2019s objection, the commission awarded Wilson the requested benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Meanwhile, Wilson and his employer entered into a settlement in Michigan that called for a payment of $75,000, plus payment of all outstanding medical expenses, and payment of the \u201cVirginia award,\u201d which included a temporary-total disability award and a 20% penalty. Wilson and his employer appeared before the Michigan Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation at a redemption proceeding to jointly request approval of their settlement. A Michigan magistrate examined Wilson under oath, reviewed the settlement terms, and then approved the settlement. At no point during this examination did Wilson, his employer, or the magistrate question whether the settlement should likewise be submitted to the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">About a year later, Wilson filed a claim in Virginia seeking reimbursement for prescription medications purchased after the settlement. When the employer\u2019s insurance carrier denied coverage, the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund (UEF) joined the employer in defending against Wilson\u2019s claim. Both took the position that the commission should approve the Michigan settlement after the fact, and if it chooses not to do so, the commission should still give the employer a $75,000 credit against this or any future medical claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The commission rejected both arguments. On appeal to us, UEF has abandoned the first argument seeking retroactive approval of the settlement. UEF continues to assert, however, that it (as assignee of the employer\u2019s rights) should receive a credit for settlement payments against any liability for medical benefits under Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">An employer has every right to settle a compensation claim with an employee. But if it does so without the approval of the commission, the release and discharge aspects of the settlement have no legal effect on the employer\u2019s liability under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See Ratliff v. Carter Mach. Co., </em>39 Va.App. 586, 591-92, 575 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2003) (citing <em>Damewood v. Lanford Bros. Co., </em>29 Va.App. 43, 45, 509 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1999)). That is true even if the settlement has been approved by another state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation commission. <em>See United Airlines, Inc. v. Kozel, </em>33 Va.App. 695, 702, 536 S.E.2d 473, 476 (2000). To prevent a double recovery, however, Code \u00a7 65.2-520 allows unapproved settlement payments to \u201cbe deducted from the amount to be paid as <em>compensation </em>\u201d to the employee under Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">As UEF concedes, the \u201cconventional meaning\u201d of compensation includes only \u201cwage loss compensation, also commonly known as \u2018indemnity payments.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9. That definition would necessarily exclude medical benefits, which usually involve payments to third-party medical providers. We agree with this concession, finding it consistent with the historic use of the term and the usual meaning assigned to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">When first enacted in 1918, the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act mandated that employers provide \u201cmedical and surgical care for injured employees\u201d and that \u201crates of compensation\u201d be awarded based upon work-related wage loss. <em>See </em>Parke P. Deans, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation in Virginia </em>28 (1938) (quoting introduction to 1918 Va. Acts, ch. 400 (S.B. No. 35)). \u201cAll compensation payments are based upon the average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>weekly earnings of the employee with certain minimum and maximum amounts provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12 (quoting S. Doc. No. 3 (1918)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This conceptual distinction also appears in specific provisions of the Act, like Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D), which provides that no \u201ccompensation or medical benefit\u201d may be awarded if the employee does not file a timely claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Both the commission and Virginia appellate courts have likewise treated these concepts as related, but different. The conventional view of \u201ccompensation\u201d has been relied upon to exclude medical payments from the statutory provision governing the 12-month limitation period for review of an award. <em>Meade v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>215 Va. 18, 19, 205 S.E.2d 410, 411 (1974); <em>see also Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. McDaniel, </em>22 Va.App. 307, 311 n. 2, 469 S.E.2d 85, 88 n. 2 (1996). <em>Cf. Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Highways &amp; Transp. v. Williams, </em>1 Va.App. 349, 357, 338 S.E.2d 660, 665 (1986) (excluding cost-of-living supplements from \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of Va. Wrk. Comp. Rule 13(B)). Along these same lines, the commission has held that medical benefits do not constitute \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of recouping overpayments under Code \u00a7 65.2-712. <em>Mabe v. Happy Stores </em># <em>494, </em>VWC File No. 139-34-48, 1994 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 148 (June 20, 1994); <em>see also Bullington v. Marshall Boys Logging, </em>VWC File No. 180-34-06, 2002 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 1819 at *3 (Oct. 7, 2002) (noting that the \u201coperative statute\u201d in <em>Mabe </em>was Code \u00a7 65.2-712).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We believe the General Assembly likewise intended Code \u00a7 65.2-520 to employ the conventional meaning of \u201ccompensation\u201d and thus exclude medical benefits from the statutory credit. The surrounding context of Code \u00a7 65.2-520, a prominent feature of Chapter 5 of the Act, confirms this view. Chapter 5 includes a series of \u201ccompensation\u201d payments made directly to the injured claimant, including disability benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>for total incapacity, \u00a7 65.2-500; partial incapacity, \u00a7 65.2-502; permanent loss, \u00a7 65.2-503; disability caused by pneumoconiosis, \u00a7 65.2-504; and death benefits, \u00a7 65.2-512. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-518 (limiting total compensation to, <em>inter alia, </em>500 weeks of wage loss benefits with no provision for consideration of medical benefits paid). The employer\u2019s liability for medical benefits\u2014which usually involves payments not to the claimant, but to medical providers\u2014does not appear in this series. Instead, the duty to provide medical benefits comes from Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1), a provision in Chapter 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">In response, UEF contends that other provisions of the Act employ an unconventional meaning of \u201ccompensation\u201d\u2014one that includes medical payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That may well be true. But in such situations, the statutory context may arguably require this interpretation because no plausible reason for excluding medical benefits can be discerned from the text alone. We accept \u201cthat the conventional use of a term may be misleading when placed in an unconventional statutory context.\u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 277, 610 S.E.2d 321, 325 (2005). To decide the narrow issue before us, however, we see no need to go further than Code \u00a7 65.2-520\u2014which, when viewed within its surrounding statutory context, employs the \u201ccompensation\u201d concept in its conventional sense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Finally, UEF argues that this interpretation is \u201can affront to the public good\u201d because it frustrates the \u201cpublic policy against allowing a claimant a \u2018double recovery.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. The only public policy that concerns us, however, is the policy advanced by the legislature in the statute. The legislature is the \u201cauthor of public policy.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 174, 184 n. 8, 431 S.E.2d 648, 654 n. 8 (1993). \u201cWe can only administer the law as it is written.\u201d <em>Coalter v. Bargamin, </em>99 Va. 65, 71, 37 S.E. 779, 781 (1901). For us, then, the \u201cbest indications of public policy are to be found in the enactments of the Legislature.\u201d <em>City of Charlottesville v. DeHaan, </em>228 Va. 578, 583, 323 S.E.2d 131, 133 (1984) (quoting <em>Danville v. Hatcher, </em>101 Va. 523, 532, 44 S.E. 723, 726 (1903)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Both the text and the context of Code \u00a7 65.2-520 suggest the General Assembly intended to permit voluntary payments to serve as a credit against compensation payments, but not medical benefits. By doing so, the statute reduces the risk that an injured employee would ever find himself in a position where he needed medical care but could not pay for it because he dissipated prior voluntary payments (like the lump-sum unapproved settlement funds paid to Wilson) on other things. Whether it \u201cmay or may not be better public policy\u201d to do otherwise, \u201csuch judgments are not ours to make.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 276, 283, 616 S.E.2d 774, 778 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc). When a correct reading of the workers\u2019 compensation statute nonetheless results in the potential for \u201cundeserved benefits,\u201d the decision to rebalance the ledger lies solely \u201cwithin the province of the legislature, not the judiciary.\u201d <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Holmes, </em>37 Va.App. 188, 193, 555 S.E.2d 419, 422 (2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Voluntary payments made to a claimant pursuant to an unapproved out-of-state settlement may not be credited under Code \u00a7 65.2-520 against an employer\u2019s liability to provide medical benefits. For this reason, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">. 1918 Senate Document No. 3 was the result of a House of Delegates Joint Resolution on February 5, 1916, authorizing the Governor to create a commission to research workmen\u2019s compensation laws in the United States and to make recommendations for the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-5\">. In support, UEF cites Code \u00a7 65.2-701(A) (authorizing agreements \"in compromise of a claim for compensation\"). <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A) (listing acts disqualifying claimant from \"compensation\u201d); Code \u00a7 65.2-508(A) (addressing foreign injuries for which the claimant would be \"entitled to compensation\u201d); Code \u00a7 65.2-601 (barring \"compensation under this title\u201d for claims not filed within two years).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">. UEF also argues that our decision should be controlled by <em>Va. Int\u2019l Terminals, Inc. v. Moore, </em>22 Va.App. 396, 405, 470 S.E.2d 574, 578 (1996), which in <em>dicta </em>stated that voluntary payments should be deducted against the \"employer\u2019s liability\u201d under the Act, which would presumably include not only disability compensation benefits, but also medical benefits. As <em>dicta, </em>however, this aspect of <em>Va. Int'l Terminals, Inc. </em>has no binding <em>stare decisis </em>effect. <em>See Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 566, 593 S.E.2d 533, 538 (2004) <em>(en banc) (\u2018\u2018Dicta </em>cannot \u2018serve as a source of binding authority in American jurisprudence.\u2019 (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-5\">. On appeal, UEF also argues that Code \u00a7 65.2-1206 provides an independent basis for reversing the commission\u2019s decision. <em>Cf. Bullington v. Marshall Boys Logging, </em>VWC File No. 180-34-06, 2002 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 1819 (Oct. 7, 2002) (\"Non-Fund employers are limited by \u00a7 65.2-712 to recovering overpayments from \u2018compensation.\u2019 \u00a7 65.2-1206 contains no such limitation.\u201d). The record, however, reveals that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>UEF never made this argument to the full commission. As a result, the commission did not analyze or decide whether Code \u00a7 65.2-1206 grants UEF a credit under the facts of this case. \"Thus, Rule 5A:18 prevents [the appellant] from raising it for the first time in this Court.\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Va.
