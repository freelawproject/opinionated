Gray appeals from the interlocutory order of adoption of the trial court granting the petition of Charles W. Bourne, III and Tamara Bourne to adopt Gray\u2019s birth son, R.I.B. On appeal, Gray contends the trial court erred in ruling that his withholding of consent to the adoption was contrary to the best interests of his son.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Bournes, the parties who prevailed below. <em>See Winfield v. Urquhart, </em>25 Va.App. 688, 690, 492 S.E.2d 464, 465 (1997). As relevant to the issue on appeal, the facts are not in dispute. Samantha Teabout, a cousin of Mr. Bourne, gave birth to R.I.B. on January 30, 2000. Teabout and Gray, the child\u2019s natural father, were never married. Prior to the child\u2019s birth, Gray was arrested for numerous drug offenses. He was subsequently convicted in federal district court on those charges and is not eligible for parole until 2011. Teabout was arrested at the hospital the day after R.I.B.\u2019s birth and was subsequently incarcerated for violation of probation for her continued drug use and the commission of other criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Following her release from jail in November 2000, Teabout again violated her probation and fled to Atlanta, Georgia, taking R.I.B. with her. After Teabout was arrested, Mrs. Bourne flew to Atlanta and took physical custody of R.I.B. on December 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The Bournes, who were married on November 21, 2001, obtained legal custody of R.I.B. on February 1, 2002. On August 18, 2003, they petitioned the trial court to adopt R.I.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The trial court conducted a hearing on the Bournes\u2019 petition for adoption on June 18, 2004. Gray and Teabout, who were both incarcerated at the time, refused to consent to the adoption in part because Mr. Bourne was convicted in 1997 of having committed sexual battery of a minor in October 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">At the hearing, Mr. Bourne testified on direct examination regarding his conviction. He explained that the incident leading to his arrest and conviction occurred when he was spending the night at his girlfriend\u2019s house. After he and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>girlfriend had gone to bed for the night, the girlfriend\u2019s eleven-year-old daughter came into their bedroom and got in bed with them. His girlfriend took the daughter back to her room, but the daughter later returned. The girlfriend again took her back to her bed. The third time the child returned to their bedroom, Mr. Bourne took the child back to her bed. He lay down with her, and they talked awhile. The child said she was not feeling well. They both then fell asleep. Sometime later Mr. Bourne awoke with an erection and realized that, while asleep, he had taken the child\u2019s hand and pushed it against his penis. He got up and left the child\u2019s room. After his girlfriend awoke the next morning, he told her about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In July 1997, Mr. Bourne was charged with aggravated sexual battery of a minor, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pled guilty and was convicted of the lesser misdemeanor charge of sexual battery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4. He complied with all of the terms of his suspended sentence and successfully completed court-ordered counseling with Dr. Jeffrey C. Fracher, a licensed clinical psychologist and certified sex-offender-treatment provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In 1998, following Mr. Bourne\u2019s sentencing, Dr. Fracher administered the Abel Assessment of Sexual Interest Test to Mr. Bourne. That test, Dr. Fracher explained, was designed specifically to identify sexual disorders and to measure deviant sexual interest. Based on the results of that testing, Dr. Fracher concluded that Mr. Bourne\u2019s sexual interests were \u201cwithin normal limits\u201d and that he showed no measurable sexual interest in children, male or female. Consequently, Dr. Fracher did not recommend any treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Dr. Fracher saw Mr. Bourne again in May 2000 when Mrs. Bourne\u2019s former husband raised concerns in a custody proceeding about Mr. Bourne\u2019s sexual battery conviction. Dr. Fracher concluded that Mr. Bourne, who was dating Mrs. Bourne at the time, posed no risk to Mrs. Bourne\u2019s five children.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>In May 2004, Dr. Fracher reevaluated Mr. Bourne in connection with the instant case. Once again, Dr. Fracher concluded that Mr. Bourne \u201cshowed no measurable deviant sexual interest\u201d and \u201cwould pose no threat to\u201d R.I.B. Based on the results of a test designed to \u201cpredict the likelihood of reoffending in those convicted of a prior sexual offense,\u201d Dr. Fracher concluded that Mr. Bourne</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">fell within the group of offenders who have the lowest possible likelihood of reoffending, given the fact he has a prior offense. He could only be lower if he had never offended at all. And, in fact, he gets some bonus points on that for having a clean record since 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Mr. Bourne further testified at the adoption hearing that, as a result of the adoption proceedings, he learned from the Virginia State Police that he needed to register with the local sheriff as a convicted sex offender. Although he had contacted the sheriff, the registration had not yet occurred at the time of the hearing, approximately six weeks after the police notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">After taking the Bournes\u2019 petition for adoption under advisement, the trial court gave a lengthy and detailed ruling on June 24, 2004. Initially, the court summarized the applicable law and the testimony of all of the witnesses and noted the portions of the testimony it found to be most probative. The court then reviewed the evidence as it related to each of the specific factors identified in Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 for determining whether a birth parent\u2019s consent was being withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. In considering the issue of Mr. Bourne\u2019s conviction for sexual battery and his need to register as a sex offender, the trial court first noted that, after being informed by the Virginia State Police that he had to register as a sex offender, Mr. Bourne had \u201ccontacted the Sheriff\u2019s Office to complete that registration.\u201d The court then stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">The Court also finds that the Petitioner Charles Bourne\u2019s criminal conviction for sexual battery on a minor child in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>199[7] does not render this household unsuitable for the adoptive placement of [R.I.B.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">Nor does it render him unsuitable or unfit to be the adoptive parent for [R.I.B.], The Court will say that it is always concerned when a person has been charged and convicted of sexual battery, and as much or more so when the sexual battery was committed on a minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">And the Court has read very closely the exhibits ... from Dr. Jeffrey Fracher as to the result of his testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">And it\u2019s his testimony and report that Mr. Bourne showed no indication of any deviant sexual behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">And also, in his latest report, that the results of the current evaluation indicate that there are no contraindications with regard to his sexual behavior to Mr. Bourne adopting [R.I.B.],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">There has been no evidence at all to refute the evidence or to contradict the evidence of Dr. Fracher that Mr. Bourne would present no future threat to [R.I.B.], and also to Dr. Fracher\u2019s testimony that there was no need for any treatment of Mr. Bourne.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">And so the Court is relying on the evidence of this expert and on all the evidence as a whole that it has heard in this entire case, and on the exhibits, in deciding that Mr. Bourne does not pose a current threat to any child with regard to his sexual behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Agreeing with the position taken by the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the trial court concluded that clear and convincing evidence established that the withholding of consent by R.LB.\u2019s birth parents to the adoption was contrary to the best interests of R.I.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">On appeal, Gray contends that Mr. Bourne\u2019s conviction for committing a sexual offense against a minor, requiring his registration as a sex offender for ten years pursuant to Code \u00a7 9.1-908, and his failure to timely register as a sex offender legally preclude the trial court from finding that adoption by the Bournes is in R.I.B.\u2019s best interests. Thus, Gray concludes, the trial court erred in ruling that his withholding of consent to the adoption by the Bournes was contrary to R.I.B.\u2019s best interests. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The adoption of a child may be ordered without the consent of the child\u2019s birth parent if that parent\u2019s consent to the adoption is being withheld \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the child as set forth in Code \u00a7 63.2-1205.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1203. In determining whether a birth parent\u2019s consent is being withheld contrary to the best interests of the child, the trial court \u201cshall consider whether the failure to grant the petition pending before it would be detrimental to the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1205. In deciding whether granting the adoption would be detrimental to the child, the trial court \u201cmust consider all relevant factors,\u201d including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACz\">the birth parent(s)\u2019 efforts to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child; whether the birth parent(s)\u2019 efforts to assert parental rights were thwarted by other people; the birth parent(s)\u2019 ability to care for the child; the age of the child; the quality of any previous relationship between the birth parent(s) and the child and between the birth parent(s) and any other minor children; the duration and suitability of the child\u2019s present custodial environment; and the effect of a change of physical custody on the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Here, in determining that adoption by the Bournes was in R.I.B.\u2019s best interests and that Gray\u2019s \"withholding of consent to the adoption was contrary to R.I.B.\u2019s best interests, the trial court considered all relevant factors, including Mr. Bourne\u2019s conviction for sexual battery of a minor in 1997 and his alleged delay in registering as a sex offender, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>each of the specifically identified factors of Code \u00a7 68.2-1205. The trial court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that, although not yet registered as a sex offender, Mr. Bourne had \u201ccontacted the Sheriffs Office to complete that registration.\u201d Relying on Dr. Fracher\u2019s undisputed testimony that Mr. Bourne \u201cshowed no measurable deviant sexual interest\u201d and \u201cwould pose no threat to\u201d R.I.B., the trial court further found that Mr. Bourne did \u201cnot pose a current threat to any child with regard to his sexual behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Gray does not challenge these factual findings on appeal. Indeed, he effectively concedes that there was no specific evidence presented in this case showing that Mr. Bourne\u2019s prior unlawful conduct placed R.I.B. in danger. Likewise, Gray makes no claim that the trial court failed to consider all relevant factors in determining that his withholding of consent was contrary to R.LB.\u2019s best interests or that the trial court\u2019s determination was without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Instead, Gray contends exclusively that Mr. Bourne\u2019s conviction for sexual battery and failure to timely register as a sex offender render Mr. Bourne ineligible, as a matter of law, to adopt a child. Although effectively acknowledging that \u201cpast brushes with the law\u201d do not automatically preclude adoption by the offender generally, Gray asserts that the provision in Code \u00a7 9.1-908 requiring convicted sex offenders to register annually for ten years manifests the legislature\u2019s intention to prohibit such persons from adopting a child. Where the legislature considers an offense to be \u201cso serious in its nature as to require the offender to be on a regulated, mandated registry,\u201d the trial court, he argues, should not be allowed to \u201csubstitute its judgment\u201d and \u201cundercut the legislature\u2019s actions by finding that a child\u2019s best interests can be promoted by being adopted by\u201d such an offender, particularly when, as here, the offender has failed to timely register. To rule otherwise, Gray argues, would undermine Code \u00a7 9.1-908\u2019s purpose of \u201cprotecting the unsuspecting\u201d citizens of the Commonwealth from convicted sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Gray misconstrues the effect and scope of Code \u00a7 9.1-908.Code \u00a7 9.1-908 provides, in pertinent part, solely that \u201c[a]ny person required to register [pursuant to Code \u00a7 9.1-903] or reregister [pursuant to Code \u00a7 9.1-904] shall be required to register for a period of 10 years from the date of initial registration.\u201d Plainly, the statute does not purport to address or apply to the issue of adoption. In contrast, Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 expressly mandates that the trial court consider \u201call relevant factors,\u201d including several specifically identified factors, in determining whether a birth parent\u2019s withholding of consent to an adoption is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. Nothing in Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 indicates that a prospective adoptive parent\u2019s prior conviction requiring registration as a sex offender or the prospective parent\u2019s failure to timely register as a sex offender trumps all other relevant factors and automatically precludes adoption, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The legislature could have included in either of those statutes such a provision had it intended that a convicted sex offender be precluded from adopting a child, as a matter of law, but it did not. Consequently, we may not read into the relevant statutes, as Gray urges, a restriction that the legislature did not include therein, particularly where, as here, the claim at issue concerns a matter of public policy. <em>See McManama v. Plunk, </em>250 Va. 27, 32, 458 S.E.2d 759, 762 (1995) (holding that provisions not found in the applicable statutes should not be added \u201cby judicial fiat\u201d); <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Props., Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (\u201c \u2018Courts are not permitted to rewrite statutes. This is a legislative function. The manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied. There can be no departure from the words used where the intention is clear.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944))); <em>Infants v. Virginia Hous. Dev. Auth., </em>221 Va. 659, 671, 272 S.E.2d 649, 656 (1980) (holding that public policy considerations \u201cbelong exclusively in the legislative domain\u201d). Hence, we will not extend by implication or construction Code \u00a7 9.1-908\u2019s application to a case beyond the contemplation of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>We hold, therefore, that, contrary to Gray\u2019s claim, Code \u00a7 9.1-908 does not operate to preclude, as a matter of law, a convicted sex offender who is required under the statute\u2019s terms to register annually for ten years and who has not yet registered from adopting a child, and we decline Gray\u2019s invitation to impose such a prohibition by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment that Gray\u2019s withholding of consent to the adoption was contrary to his son\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-14\">. Gray also contends on appeal that denying the petition for adoption was not proven to be detrimental to R.I.B. because no change in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>child\u2019s physical custody would have occurred had the adoption petition not been granted. We will not address this argument, as it was not presented to the trial court. <em>See </em>Rule 5A: 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\">.

Spotte, </em>4 Va.App. 530, 537, 359 S.E.2d 315, 319-20 (1987); <em>see also Schweider v. Schweider, </em>243 Va. 245, 415 S.E.2d 135 (1992). The trial court is plainly wrong because its findings address the wrong question. The question does not involve whether there is any \u201ccurrent threat\u201d or \u201cfuture threat\u201d to a child, whether the sex offender needs counseling, whether the \u201chousehold [is] unsuitable for the adoptive placement,\u201d or whether Mr. Bourne is appropriate as an adoptive parent. The question is, under a clear and convincing standard, and properly animated by the policies of the General Assembly, whether a rational jurist could conclude that these findings are sufficient to determine that a birth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>parent\u2019s withholding consent is not in the best interests of this child. A rational jurist could not so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On the question of law, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-908 and 63.2-1205 do not specifically operate to preclude a convicted sex offender from adopting a child. But, the notion that the legislature could have included in either of those statutes a provision that a prospective parent\u2019s prior conviction requiring registration as a sex offender or the prospective parent\u2019s failure to register as a sex offender renders that prospective parent ineligible to adopt children ascribes an inappropriate purpose to those statutes. Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 applies only to the relationship between the birth parent and the child. It does not contemplate nor address the fitness of the prospective parent. Code \u00a7 9.1-908 governs only the duration of the registration requirement. The absence of express prohibitions against registered sex offenders adopting children in Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 and Code \u00a7 9.1-908, two statutes that are irrelevant to prospective parents, does not lead to the conclusion that the General Assembly intended that registered sex offenders are permitted to adopt children.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In fact, the intent of the General Assembly cannot be discerned by construing Code \u00a7 9.1-908 without considering the purpose of the statute. \u201cA statute must be construed with reference to its subject matter, the object sought to be attained, <em>and the legislative purpose in enacting it; </em>the provisions should receive a construction that will render it harmonious with that purpose rather than one which will defeat it.\u201d <em>Esteban v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 605, 609, 587 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2003) (citing <em>Stanley v. Tomlin, </em>143 Va. 187, 195, 129 S.E. 379, 382 (1925)) (emphasis added). In this case, the trial court failed to consider the very purpose for which the \u201cSex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry\u201d exists. Code \u00a7 9.1-900 plainly states the registry exists \u201cto protect ... communities and families from repeat sex offenders and <em>to protect children from becoming victims of criminal offenders by helping to prevent such individuals from being allowed to work directly with </em>children.\u201d (Emphasis added). If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>General Assembly\u2019s goal is to protect communities and families and to prevent sex offenders from working directly with children, how can it be in the best interests of this child to have a non-compliant sex offender adopt the child into his own home\u2014a sex offender who pleads guilty and is convicted of sexual battery of a minor, after admitting to taking a child\u2019s hand and pushing it against his penis to obtain an erection?</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The absence of a <em>per se </em>bar in Code \u00a7 9.1-908 does not mean that the General Assembly intended that a registered sex offender be permitted to adopt a child. Such an interpretation does not impose a prohibition by judicial fiat in a statute that does not contemplate the fitness of an adoptive parent\u2014it is a matter of judicial discretion applied to the statute that requires consideration of the best interests of a child in light of the General Assembly\u2019s policies. \u201cThe strong public policy of this Commonwealth posits that the paramount concern where children are concerned [is] their best interests.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>7 Va.App. 614, 623, 376 S.E.2d 787, 792 (1989). I fail to see how a birth parent\u2019s withholding consent for such an adoption can be contrary to the best interests of the child. Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1203, 63.2-1205. I, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">. The majority states in its opinion: \"Here, in determining that adoption by the Bournes was in R.I.B.\u2019s best interests and that Gray\u2019s withholding of consent to the adoption was contrary to R.I.B\u2019s best interests, the trial court considered all relevant factors, including Mr. Bourne\u2019s conviction for sexual batteiy of a minor in 1997 and his alleged delay in registering as a sex offender, as well as each of the specifically identified factors of Code \u00a7 63.2-1205.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">The appellant states in his brief: \"[Bourne\u2019s] reluctance to comply with the lawful requirement of registration coupled with the fact that the offense had been committed against an ll[-]year[-]old child should raise red flags in any trial court\u2019s considerations of [Bourne] as an adoptive father.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 5; \u201cThe trial court was obviously made well aware of these discrepancies in Mr. Bourne\u2019s recounting of the facts of the offense, why he chose to agree to a guilty plea, and his unexplained delay in completing the registration requirements once he was fully aware of those requirements.

The guardian <em>ad litem </em>and the Bournes state: \"when the trial court\u2019s decision is based ... on an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, it \u2018is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Spotte, </em>4 Va.App. 530, 537, 359 S.E.2d 315, 319-20 (1987)). The guardian <em>ad litem </em>and the Bournes further state: \u201d[I]t is well settled that the trier of fact ascertains a witness\u2019 credibility, determines the weight to be given their testimony, and has the discretion to accept or reject any of the witness' testimony.\u201d (citing <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>29 Va.App. 673, 686, 514 S.E.2d 369, 376 (1999)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">The appropriate standard of review for a question of law is <em>de novo. </em>\"In determining whether the trial court made an error of law, 'we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)); <em>see also Davis v.
