On appeal, he contends his conviction should be reversed because the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a certificate of blood alcohol analysis based on the result obtained from a breath test. Specifically, he argues that admission of the document violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">In accord with our usual standard of review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing from the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the party prevailing in the trial court. <em>Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 184, 189, 578 S.E.2d 97, 99 (2003). So viewed, the evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> establishes that, on November 23, 2003, Luginbyhl drove his car out of a parking lot and for a few moments remained perpendicular to the lanes of travel, blocking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>oncoming traffic. Several cars had to brake abruptly in order to avoid hitting Luginbyhl before he slowly turned his vehicle to the right. He began \u201cweaving\u201d as he continued driving down the road, missing the curb \u201cby approximately two inches.\u201d Approaching vehicles had to brake to avoid a collision when Luginbyhl slowly turned left into a shopping center.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Fairfax County Police Officer Darren Day witnessed Luginbyhl\u2019s erratic driving and effected a traffic stop. Day detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Luginbyhl and noticed that his eyes were glassy and bloodshot, that his face was red, and that he exhibited sluggish motor skills. As Luginbyhl exited his vehicle, he began to fall forward, requiring Day to provide support. Asked how much alcohol he had had to drink, Luginbyhl responded, \u201cI had a lot.\u201d He further admitted consuming \u201c6, 7 or 8 vodka drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Luginbyhl was unable to successfully perform two field sobriety tests: the \u201cfinger-to-nose test\u201d and the \u201cone-legged stand test.\u201d In the course of trying to complete the latter, Luginbyhl began to cry and stated, \u201cI\u2019m drunk; I\u2019m an alcoholic.\u201d Day thus placed Luginbyhl under arrest and took him to a police substation where a breath test was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Although Day was present and observed Luginbyhl take the breath test, he did not administer it. Day explained that his license to operate the breath test machine expired a year earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The trial judge admitted the breath test certificate over Luginbyhl\u2019s Sixth Amendment objections. The breath test certificate indicates that Officer Edward A. Caine administered the test and that Luginbyhl\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.24 grams per 210 liters of breath. The certificate also contains the following preprinted attestation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE IS AN ACCURATE RECORD OF THE TEST CONDUCTED; THAT THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE METHODS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, DIVISION OF FO<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>RENSIC SCIENCE; THAT THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIVISION\u2019S SPECIFICATIONS; THAT THE EQUIPMENT ON WHICH THE BREATH TEST WAS CONDUCTED HAS BEEN TESTED WITHIN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND FOUND TO BE ACCURATE; THAT PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION OF THE TEST THE ACCUSED WAS ADVISED OF HIS RIGHT TO OBSERVE THE PROCESS AND SEE THE BLOOD ALCOHOL READING ON THE EQUIPMENT USED TO PERFORM THE BREATH TEST, AND THAT I POSSESS A VALID LICENSE TO CONDUCT SUCH TEST, GIVEN UNDER MY HAND THIS <em>25TH </em>DAY OF <em>NOVEMBER, 2003.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">Officer Caine signed in the space below the attestation under the words \u201cBREATH TEST OPERATOR.\u201d Officer Caine did not testify at Luginbyhl\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Based on the breath test evidence and the testimony of Officer Day, the trial judge found Luginbyhl guilty of DWI and sentenced him to 180 days in jail, 170 of which were suspended on condition of good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Citing <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), Luginbyhl argues on appeal that the contents of the breath test certificate constitute \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d and that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him by admitting the certificate without the testimony of Officer Caine. We interpret his appeal to encompass both components of the breath test certificate: (1) the result of the breath test showing his BAC to be 0.24 and (2) the attestation certifying that the equipment was in good working order and that Officer Caine was licensed to perform the breath test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His appeal raises an issue of first impression in Virginia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>We do not agree that the trial court erred in admitting either component of the breath test certificate. We hold that the result of the breath test does not constitute hearsay and therefore does not implicate Luginbyhl\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. We further hold that the statements contained in the certificate attesting to the equipment\u2019s good working order and Officer Caine\u2019s valid license to operate the machine do not constitute \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay and are therefore not subject to the rule in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II. The Result of the Breath Test Does Not Constitute Hearsay and its Admission into Evidence Does Not Implicate Luginbyhl\u2019s Sixth Amendment Right to Confrontation</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the <em>witnesses </em>against him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI (emphasis added). By its very terms, the constitutional guarantee applies only to <em>witnesses </em>against the accused. The guarantee operates by preventing the admission of witness testimony through hearsay evidence at trial unless the prosecution shows that the hearsay declarant (witness) is unavailable and that the accused had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the hearsay declarant. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 59, 124 S.Ct. at 1365-66. The guarantee does not apply to evidence that is not hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Virginia has described hearsay evidence as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201cevidence which derives its value, not solely from the credit to be given the witness on the stand, but in part from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>veracity and competency of some other person. It is primarily testimony which consists in a narration by one person of matters told him by another. A clear example of hearsay evidence is where a witness testifies to the declaration of another for the purpose of proving the facts asserted by the declarant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><em>Wright v. Kaye, </em>267 Va. 510, 530, 593 S.E.2d 307, 318 (2004) (quoting <em>Williams v. Morris, </em>200 Va. 413, 416-17, 105 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1958)). <em>See Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 1068, 1070, 421 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1992) (defining hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the <em>declarant </em>while testifying at trial, which is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d (emphasis added) (citing <em>Arnold v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 275, 279-80, 356 S.E.2d 847, 850 (1987))); <em>see also Bowman v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 204, 209, 503 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1998) (\u201cHearsay is \u2018testimony given by a <em>witness </em>who relates not what he knows personally, but what others have told him or what he has heard said by others.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Cross v. Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 62, 74, 77 S.E.2d 447, 453 (1953))). <em>See generally Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 197, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987) (explaining that the \u201cstrongest justification for the exclusion of hearsay evidence is that the trier of fact has no opportunity to view the witness on cross-examination and to observe the demeanor of the out-of-court declarant to determine reliability\u201d (citing Charles A. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 224 (2d ed. 1983))).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Evidence that is not a statement from a human witness or declarant is not hearsay. <em>See Tatum v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 585, 588, 440 S.E.2d 133, 135 (1994) (holding that evidence of numbers displayed on a caller ID system is not hearsay because \u201cthere is no \u2018out-of-court asserter\u2019\u201d and \u201cbecause the caller ID display is based on computer generated information and not simply the repetition of prior recorded human input or observation\u201d); <em>Penny v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 494, 498, 370 S.E.2d 314, 317 (1988) (holding that evidence obtained from a \u201ccall trap\u201d device is not hearsay because \u201cthe call trap\u2019s reliability does not depend on an out-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>of-court declarant\u2019s veracity or perceptive abilities, and no cross-examination could occur which would enhance the truth-finding process\u201d); <em>see also Oregon v. Weber, </em>172 Or.App. 704, 19 P.3d 378, 381 (2001) (notation of speed on radar photograph \u201cwas generated by a machine, and not made by a person,\u201d therefore, it \u201cis an assertion not made by a person\u201d and is not hearsay).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The breath test result at issue in this case is not derived from a human declarant or asserter. Rather, the breath test result is generated by a machine and does not depend on the administering police officer\u2019s \u201cveracity or perceptive abilities.\u201d <em>See Tatum, </em>17 Va.App. at 588, 440 S.E.2d at 135; <em>Penny, </em>6 Va.App. at 498, 370 S.E.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Therefore, the breath test result does not constitute hearsay. That determination is supported by case law from other jurisdictions. In <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>920 S.W.2d 342 (Tex.App. 1996) <em>(en banc), </em>the Texas Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">The intoxilyzer instrument, in itself, cannot be a declarant. Because the intoxilyzer is not a declarant, the data it generates is not a statement and cannot be hearsay. The fact that the same data is ultimately printed in hard copy does not convert it into hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 343-44 (citations omitted); <em>Caldwell v. State, </em>230 Ga. App. 46, 495 S.E.2d 308, 310 (1997) (stating that breath test machine \u201cprintouts are not hearsay but rather the mechanically-generated reports automatically created by the machine[, and, t]hey do not constitute out-of-court statements by any person or \u2018the conclusion of a third party not before the court.\u2019 \u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>State v. Van Sickle, </em>120 Idaho 99, 813 P.2d 910, 913 (Ct.App.1991) (holding that \u201cprintout from the Intoximeter is not a \u2018statement\u2019 for hearsay purposes,\u201d because the printout, \u201calthough a writing offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, is not extrajudicial testimony prohibited by the hearsay rule; the printout is a test result produced by a machine\u201d); <em>State v. Smith, </em>312 N.C. 361, 323 S.E.2d 316, 318, 323 (1984) (holding that statutory procedures allowing admission of affidavit by chemical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>analyst was \u201cconstitutionally permissible procedure attuned to scientific and technological advancements which have insured reliability in chemical testing for blood alcohol concentration,\u201d and such \u201cprocedure does not violate the accused\u2019s right to confrontation\u201d; observing that \u201cbreathalyzer procedure now available for objectively determining blood alcohol concentration lends itself to the somewhat startling conclusion that \u2018in reality the witness against the defendant, the source of the crucial and incriminating evidence, is not the analyst, but the machine itself \u201d); <em>see also </em>Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-5 (6th ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Because the breath test result is not hearsay, Luginbyhl\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is not implicated. <em>See generally Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-53, 124 S.Ct. at 1364-65 (explaining that the test of the Sixth Amendment and the history underlying common-law right of confrontation reflects an \u201cacute concern with a specific type of out-of-court statement,\u201d listing examples of the \u201ccore class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d and specifying \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Restrepo, </em>994 F.2d 173, 183 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Herndon, </em>536 F.2d 1027, 1029 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>289 Ark. 589, 715 S.W.2d 441, 443 (1986); <em>Van Sickle, </em>813 P.2d at 913; <em>Evans v. State, </em>499 So.2d 781, 783 (Miss.1986); <em>State v. Williams, </em>913 S.W.2d 462, 465 (Tenn.1996). Therefore, Luginbyhl\u2019s Sixth Amendment challenge to the trial court\u2019s admission of the breath test result into evidence fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">III. The Statements in the Breath Test Certificate Attesting to the Machine\u2019s Good Working Order and the Officer\u2019s Valid License to Operate the Machine Do Not Constitute \u201cTestimonial\u201d Hearsay under <em>Crawford</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Unlike the breath test result, Officer Caine\u2019s statements on the breath test certificate constitute hearsay because they are assertions made by an out-of-court human declarant and were offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted, namely, that the breath test device worked properly and that Officer Caine was licensed to operate it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>268.9 (providing, in pertinent part, that a certificate of breath analysis \u201cshall be admissible as evidence of the facts therein stated and of the results of such analysis\u201d provided the \u201cindividual\u201d conducting the breath test attests, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat the test was conducted in accordance with the Division\u2019s specifications, the equipment on which the breath test was conducted has been tested within the past six months and has been found to be accurate\u201d); <em>Clark, </em>14 Va.App. at 1070, 421 S.E.2d at 30 (defining hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial, which is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d); <em>see also Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 26, 33, 486 S.E.2d 115, 118 (1997) (Benton, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (referring to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 \u201cas an exception to the rule against hearsay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Because Officer Caine\u2019s statements constitute hearsay and because he did not testify at trial, Luginbyhl did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him to test the veracity of his statements. Luginbyhl\u2019s inability to \u201cconfront\u201d a hearsay declarant raises a valid Sixth Amendment concern that we must address. <em>See generally Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-60, 69, 124 S.Ct. at 1364-69,1374 (recognizing and analyzing testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay). We conclude, however, that the admission of the statements into evidence did not violate Luginbyhl\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation because the statements are not \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature. A review of the law prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford </em>and of the historical analysis undertaken by the Court in <em>Crawford </em>is necessary to understand the significance and reasoning of our determination that the statements are not testimonial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In 1980, the Supreme Court held in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), that the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation limits the state\u2019s ability to use hearsay testimony against a criminal defendant. The Court announced the following rule in <em>Roberts:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>[W]hen a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause normally requires a showing that he is unavailable. Even then, his statement is admissible only if it bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax1\"><em>Id. </em>at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. Courts have employed the rule in <em>Roberts </em>for almost twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Recently, however, the Supreme Court overruled <em>Roberts. </em>After conducting an extensive historical analysis of the Confrontation Clause in <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the rule in <em>Roberts </em>is overly broad and flawed. The Court stated that, although the <em>Roberts </em>reliability test advances the goal of the Confrontation Clause to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of out-of-court statements, the clause secures a procedural, rather than a substantive, right. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. Thus, the Court held that the Confrontation Clause demands \u201cnot that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In determining what sort of evidence the Sixth Amendment subjects to the \u201ccrucible of cross-examination,\u201d the Supreme Court stated that the text of the amendment makes clear that it \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (quoting 1 N. Webster, <em>An American Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1828)). The critical question in the instant case, therefore, is whether the statements in the breath test certificate qualify as testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Crawford </em>of the historical underpinnings of the Confrontation Clause and the abuses it was designed to prevent shed light on whether the statements in the breath test certificate are testimonial evidence. The Supreme Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>[t]he founding generation\u2019s immediate source of the concept [of confrontation] ... was the common law. English common law has long differed from continental civil law in regard to the manner in which witnesses give testimony in criminal trials. The common-law tradition is one of live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing, while the civil law condones examination in private by judicial officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 43, 124 S.Ct. at 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Despite the common-law tradition of requiring live testimony at criminal trials, \u201cEngland at times adopted elements of the civil-law practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to employ these civil law practices and digress from the common law, the crown passed the Marian bail and committal statutes, which \u201crequired justices of the peace to examine suspects and witnesses in felony cases and to certify the results to the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360. That practice was employed in the political trials of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, resulting in \u201c[t]he most notorious instances of civil-law examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One of the most notable trials was the treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, in which incriminating testimony given by Lord Cobham during an examination before the Privy Council was allowed to be read into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45, 124 S.Ct. at 1360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Over time, England\u2019s lapses into the civil-law practice of allowing testimony derived from out-of-court examinations in criminal trials came to be seen as abuses. <em>See id. </em>at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360 (noting that \u201c[o]ne of Raleigh\u2019s trial judges later lamented that \u2018the justice of England has never been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019\u201d (citing 1 D. Jardine, <em>Criminal Trials </em>520 (1832))). Thus, \u201c[t]hrough a series of statutory and judicial reforms\u201d enacted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, \u201cEnglish law developed a right of confrontation that limited these abuses,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360, such that \u201cby 1791 (the year the Sixth Amendment was ratified) courts were applying the cross-examination rule even to examinations by justices of the peace in felony cases,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 46, 124 S.Ct. at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Notwithstanding the common law\u2019s adoption of the right to confrontation, the failure of the United States Constitution as ratified in 1789 to guarantee a right to confrontation troubled anti-federalists who feared that, without such a guarantee, the civil-law practice of allowing accusatory out-of-court testimony could become the norm in criminal prosecutions. <em>See id. </em>at 49, 124 S.Ct. at 1362-63. \u201cThe First Congress responded [to these fears] by including the Confrontation Clause in the proposal that became the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Against this historical backdrop, the true meaning of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause comes into focus.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARp\">[T]he principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused. It was these practices that the Crown deployed in notorious treason cases like Raleigh\u2019s; that the Marian statutes invited; that English law\u2019s assertion of a right to confrontation was meant to prohibit; and that the founding-era rhetoric decried.

However, applying the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford, </em>we conclude that the Commonwealth did not have to show unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination because the statements contained in the breath test certificate are not \u201ctestimonial.\u201d Two rationales support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">First, Officer Caine\u2019s statements in the affidavit do not resemble the types of statements identified by the Supreme Court as testimonial. They are not \u201cprior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial\u201d and are not statements obtained from a witness during a \u201cpolice interrogation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Second, the statements bear little or no resemblance to the evils at which the Confrontation Clause was directed. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (noting that \u201cnot all hearsay implicates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s core concerns\u201d).

Rather, the statements are neutral in character, relating only to the operation of the machine and the qualifications of the officer administering the test. The contrast between these statements and the statements of Lord Cobham admitted at Raleigh\u2019s trial could not be more patent. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360. Thus, we conclude that the statements contained in the breath test certificate relating to the machine\u2019s good working order and the qualifications of the administering officer do not \u201cbear testimony\u201d against the accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford </em>and the historical context in which it was rooted, as well as the reasoning of appellate courts in other states, we hold that the statements in the breath test certificate relating to the machine\u2019s good working order and the administering officer\u2019s qualifications are not testimonial statements. Because the statements are not testimonial, the Commonwealth did not have to make the foundational showing that Officer Caine was unavailable and that Luginbyhl had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">V. The Statements in the Breath Test Certificate Were Properly Admitted Pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Although the statements in the breath test certificate are not testimonial, we still must answer whether, as nontestimonial hearsay, their admission violated Luginbyhl\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We believe that the Court in <em>Crawford </em>provided a definitive answer to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The Supreme Court concluded its opinion in <em>Crawford </em>by stating the following: \u201cWhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law\u2014as does <em>Roberts, </em>and as would an approach <em>that exempted such [nontestimonial] statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.\u201d Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(emphasis added). The Court\u2019s conclusion that the Constitution affords states flexibility in their treatment of nontestimonial hearsay is consistent with its earlier determination that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s primary concern is testimonial hearsay. <em>See id. </em>at 50-52,124 S.Ct. at 1363-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In Virginia, the legislature has determined that breath test certificates, and the information they contain, are admissible in court against the accused. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Any individual conducting a breath test under the provisions of \u00a7 18.2-268.2 shall issue a certificate which will indicate that the test was conducted in accordance with the Division\u2019s specifications, the equipment on which the breath test was conducted has been tested within the past six months and has been found to be accurate, the name of the accused, that prior to administration of the test the accused was advised of his right to observe the process and see the blood alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test, the date and time the sample was taken from the accused, the sample\u2019s alcohol content, and the name of the person who examined the sample.

We further hold that statements contained in the breath test certificate relating to the machine\u2019s good working order and the administering officer\u2019s qualifications do not constitute testimonial hearsay and do not require the Commonwealth to prove, pursuant to <em>Crawford, </em>that Officer Caine was unavailable and that Luginbyhl had a prior opportunity to examine him.

[, raising] a valid Sixth Amendment concern.\u201d Yet, the majority conducts its own historical analysis and concludes the statement is not testimonial. I disagree because <em>Crawford </em>answers that relevant question.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Examining the historical background of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford </em>held that \u201chistory supports two inferences about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d 541 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1363.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">First, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.... The Sixth Amendment must be interpreted with this focus in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">The historical record also supports a second proposition: that the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. The text of the Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developed by the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 50, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1363, 1365. In view of this historical analysis, the Supreme Court overruled the reliability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>test set forth in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), because of \u201cits demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63, 124 S.Ct. at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In plain terms, <em>Crawford </em>describes a \u201ccore class of \u2018testimonial statements\u2019\u201d as including \u201caffidavits,\u201d any \u201csimilar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u201d and \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52,124 S.Ct. at 1364. Simply put, the certificate of blood analysis that was admitted in evidence in this case is testimonial under the narrowest of the <em>Crawford </em>definitions and, thus, falls squarely within the <em>Crawford </em>bar. As Alan Luginbyhl contends, the \u201ccertificate ... was a formalized, <em>ex parte </em>statement made by a government agent for the sole purpose of being used prosecutorially in court in lieu of his live testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">It cannot be fairly disputed that the breath analysis and attestation of the operator were conducted solely to provide evidence in court to prove the facts necessary to convict Luginbyhl. Indeed, the attestation statement asserts the existence of seven facts or circumstances said to be true by the \u201cbreath test operator.\u201d Despite those assertions of facts, the employee of the police department who signed the attestation as the operator was not subject to cross-examination as to any of those circumstances. As the <em>Crawford </em>Court noted, the \u201c[ijnvolvement of government officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse\u2014a fact borne out time and again throughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar.\u201d 541 U.S. at 56 n. 7, 124 S.Ct. at 1367 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The majority concludes too summarily, I believe, that the attestation \u201cstatements bear little or no resemblance to the evils at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.\u201d It seems to me that the use of this type of statement was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>paradigmatic violation the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Crawford. </em>As the Court indicated in its historical analysis, an affidavit or letter from an alleged co-conspirator, Cobham, was read at a treason trial against Sir Walter Raleigh in \u201c[t]he most notorious instance of civil-law examination\u201d in a criminal trial. 541 U.S. at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">The Raleigh trial itself involved the very sorts of reliability determinations that <em>Roberts </em>authorizes. In the face of Raleigh\u2019s repeated demands for confrontation, the prosecution responded with many of the arguments a court applying <em>Roberts </em>might invoke today: that Cobham\u2019s statements were self-inculpatory, that they were not made in the heat of passion, and that they were not \u201cextracted from [him] upon any hopes or promise of Pardon.\u201d It is not plausible that the Framers\u2019 only objection to the trial was that Raleigh\u2019s judges did not properly weigh these factors before sentencing him to death. Rather, the problem was that the judges refused to allow Raleigh to confront Cobham in court, where he would cross-examine him and try to expose his accusation as a lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370-71 (citations omitted). Noting that Raleigh was free to confront in court those who read Cob-ham\u2019s letter, the Supreme Court observed, however, that this was an insufficient protection of a right to confrontation because \u201cHeaving the regulation of out-of-court statements to the law of evidence would render the Confrontation Clause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. In other words, to protect the right of confrontation, Cobham\u2019s letter would be inadmissible under the Sixth Amendment because the Confrontation Clause \u201creflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Crawford </em>limits the definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements to \u201c(1) \u2018prior testimony at preliminary hearings, before a grand jury, or at a former trial,\u2019 and (2) statements garnered from wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>nesses during \u2018police interrogations.\u2019 \u201d The majority ignores other formulations of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements that <em>Crawford </em>expressly includes, such as \u201cextrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions, ... [and] statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d 541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. To say that testimonial evidence must meet the narrow definition the majority ascribes to it is to focus on the \u201cform\u201d of the evil, and not the substance, the lack of meaningful confrontation to counter the state\u2019s evidence. The majority\u2019s conclusion ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s premise: \u201cThese formulations all share a common nucleus,\u201d\u2014they are statements reasonably expected to be used at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. As such, the Confrontation Clause gives a criminal defendant an absolute right of confrontation to meet this testimonial hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Even a cursory review of the seven facts the operator certifies demonstrates they are not mere statements generated by a machine, as the majority suggests. For example, the operator attests \u201cthat prior to administration of the test the accused was advised of his right to observe the process and see the blood alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test.\u201d The majority\u2019s assertion that this evidence is \u201cneutral\u201d does not withstand analysis. It presupposes there was no way to cross-examine the blood test operator, when in fact, there were a number of effective means to cross-examine the operator concerning each of the attestations in the certificate. The certificate proclaimed that the equipment, the record it generated, the breath test, and the operator of the equipment all yielded a result that conformed to statutory requirements and that incriminated Luginbyhl. Without cross-examination, the certificate had the effect of reinforcing the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of prosecution. The \u201ccrucible of cross-examination\u201d could have exposed any weaknesses in the subjective state of the operator, his perception, the state of the equipment, or the test protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The majority characterizes the operator\u2019s statements as \u201cneutral\u201d and \u201cnon-accusatory,\u201d suggesting a type of safeguard that is intended to render the statements more reliable or trustworthy as evidence. Nothing in <em>Crawford </em>declares that the hearsay statement must \u201caccuse [the defendant] of <em>any </em>wrongdoing\u201d to be testimonial or that \u201cstatements ... neutral in character\u201d are nontestimonial. Indeed, nothing within the meaning of \u201ctestimonial\u201d equates with \u201caccusatory.\u201d Furthermore, it is a dubious conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s evidence could ever be \u201cneutral\u201d in the context of the adversarial system in a criminal proceeding. \u201cThe Framers would be astounded to learn that <em>ex parte </em>testimony could be admitted against a criminal defendant because it was elicited by \u2018neutral\u2019 government officers.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 66, 124 S.Ct at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Giving a trial judge the discretion to determine whether a statement is \u201caccusatory\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d smacks of the \u201copen ended balancing\u201d reliability analysis the Court rejected in <em>Crawford: </em>\u201cThe <em>Roberts </em>test allows a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability ... [and] replaces the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. The Supreme Court warned that these were the very kinds of \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cmanipulable\u201d standards the Framers \u201cwere loath to leave ... in judicial hands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 124 S.Ct. at 1373. Thus, the Court rejected the general concept of \u201creplacing categorical constitutional guarantees with open-ended balancing tests\u201d and held that those tests \u201cdo violence to [the Framers\u2019] design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 124 S.Ct. at 1373. According to the Supreme Court, the Confrontation Clause \u201ccommands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. Thus, the Supreme Court explicitly and \u201conce again rejected] the view that the Confrontation Clause applies of its own force only to in-court testimony, and that its application to out-of-court statements introduced at trial depends upon \u2018the law of Evidence for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>time being.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. These rulings perforce reject injecting a manipulable evidentiary standard to avoid the constitutional command of <em>Crawford, </em>which the majority opinion does under the guise of characterizing the evidence as \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cnot accusatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The relevant factor under <em>Crawford </em>is that this evidence was generated to discover and report evidence against Luginbyhl, the accused. It then was used at trial for that purpose without the opportunity of cross-examination. Furthermore, whether the evidence is accusatory or neutral, it does \u201cbear testimony,\u201d 541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364; it was prepared for use at trial by a government agent; it was a substitute for an actual witness; and it was admitted in evidence without the opportunity of cross-examination. Simply put, \u201c[ajdmitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The majority opinion cites several appellate courts that have ruled affidavits to be nontestimonial. Other appellate courts, however, addressing this precise issue, have ruled that similar affidavits are testimonial and barred by <em>Crawford. See, e.g., Shiver v. State, </em>900 So.2d 615, 618 (Fla.App.2005) (holding that a breath test affidavit \u201ccontained statements one would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially, ... was made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness to reasonably believe the statements would be available for trial,\u201d and was testimonial); <em>City of Las Vegas v. Walsh, </em>120 Nev. 392, 91 P.3d 591, 595 (2004) (holding that an affidavit \u201coffered to prove certain facts concerning use of certain devices ... related to determining presence of alcohol\u201d is one prepared for use at trial and is testimonial); <em>People v. Rogers, </em>8 A.D.3d 888, 780 N.Y.S.2d 393 (N.Y.App.Div.2004) (holding that a blood test report \u201cgenerated by the desire to discover evidence against defendant\u201d was testimonial). In any event, to decide this case, we need not go beyond the text of Crawford.. Plainly understood, the language in <em>Crawford </em>leads to the conclusion that this certificate of analysis is testimonial just as \u201caffidavits ... the defendant was unable to cross-examine.\u201d 541 U.S. at 51, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>124 S.Ct. at 1364. As the Supreme Court noted, \u201c[wjhere testimonial statements are involved, we do not ... leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. In other words, \u201c[dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that the admission of the document violated Luginbyhl\u2019s rights as protected by the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
