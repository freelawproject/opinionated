HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Appellant Joel Dulay Singson (\u201cSingson\u201d) appeals his conviction, following a conditional guilty plea, for solicitation to commit oral sodomy, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-29 (criminal solicitation) and 18.2-361 (crimes against nature). Based on the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), Singson contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional because it prohibits private acts of consensual sodomy, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, Singson argues that he cannot be convicted for attempting, through solicitation, to violate that statute. In the alternative, Singson contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is unconstitutionally overbroad because it, in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-29, chills constitutionally protected speech, also arguing that the sentence imposed by the trial court constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Singson lacks standing to facially challenge the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We also hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is not unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment and that Singson is procedurally barred from arguing that the sentence imposed by the trial court constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction for solicitation to commit oral sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. At approximately 4:00 p.m. on March 20, 2003, Singson walked into a men\u2019s restroom located in a department store. The restroom is freely accessible to members of the public, including children. Once in the restroom, Singson entered the handicapped bathroom stall and remained in that stall for approximately thirty minutes. Singson then left the handicap bathroom stall and approached a stall occupied by an undercover police officer. Singson \u201cstopped in front of the stall, leaned forward,\u201d and \u201cpeered into [the] stall through the crack in the stall door.\u201d The undercover police officer, who was in \u201ca state of undress,\u201d asked Singson \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d and \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Singson replied, \u201cCock.\u201d The officer then asked \u201cWhat do you want to do,\u201d and Singson replied, \u201cI want to suck cock.\u201d The undercover officer asked if Singson wanted to suck his penis, and Singson responded, \u201cYes.\u201d When the officer asked, \u201cDo you want to do it in here,\u201d Singson nodded towards the handicap stall. The officer then asked if Singson wanted to suck his penis in the handicap stall, and Singson responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">A grand jury indicted Singson for \u201ccommand[ing], entreating] or otherwise attempting] to persuade another to commit a felony other than murder,\u201d specifically, \u201cCrimes Against Nature,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-29 and 18.2-361. Singson moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 \u201cis overbroad and vague, [and] violates the defendant\u2019s rights to Due Process under the United States Constitution as outlined in the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number><em>[Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss, reasoning that <em>Lawrence </em>did not apply because \u201cthe restrooms within [s]tores open to the public are not within the zone of privacy as contemplated by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d The court further noted that it could not \u201cimagine too much more [of a] public place than a restroom in a shopping mall.\u201d Singson entered a conditional guilty plea, and the trial court, noting Singson\u2019s extensive criminal history of prior, similar behavior, imposed a sentence of three years in prison. The court suspended two and one-half years of Singson\u2019s sentence, resulting in a total active sentence of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">On appeal, Singson raises three assignments of error. First, he contends that his conviction should be reversed because, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lawrence, </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional. Second, Singson argues, in the alternative, that his conviction should be reversed because Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is unconstitutionally over-broad. Third, Singson contends that the sentence imposed by the trial court constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we find no merit in any of these contentions. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">A. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is Facially Unconstitutional Because it Encompasses Conduct Protected Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Citing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), Singson initially contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional because it encompasses private acts of consensual sodomy, thus offending the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, because Singson\u2019s conduct occurred in a public place\u2014not a private location\u2014we hold that he lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-361 on this ground. Accordingly, we do not reach the issue of whether, applying <em>Lawrence, </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment because it encompasses private\u2014as well as public\u2014acts of consensual sodomy. And, because application of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 under the circumstances of this case neither implicates nor violates Singson\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law, we conclude that this assignment of error has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">1. <em>Whether Public Sexual Conduct is Encompassed by Code \u00a7 18.2-361</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-361 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">If any person carnally knows in any manner ... any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth, or voluntarily submits to such carnal knowledge, he or she shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-361(A). As we have noted, \u201c[t]he term \u2018carnal knowledge\u2019 has been construed to include \u2018any sexual bodily connection, not simply sexual intercourse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Santillo v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 470, 483, 517 S.E.2d 733, 740 (1999) (quoting <em>Shull v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 667, 669, 431 S.E.2d 924, 925 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>247 Va. 161, 440 S.E.2d 133 (1994)). Because \u201c[c]arnal knowedge \u201cwith the mouth\u2019 is another term for cunnilingus, and carnal knowledge \u2018by the mouth\u2019 includes fellatio,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), Code \u00a7 18.2-361 prohibits any sexual act \u201cinvolv[ing] contact between the mouth and genitals, including ... oral sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 517 S.E.2d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Here, Singson solicited fellatio from an undercover officer in a public restroom. In other words, Singson sought to engage in conduct \u201cinvolv[ing] contact between the mouth and genitals,\u201d specifically, \u201coral sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Singson\u2019s attempted conduct falls squarely within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-361(A). <em>See id.; see also Lankford v. Foster, </em>546 F.Supp. 241, 249 n. 11 (W.D.Va.1982) (defining fellatio as \u201csodomy by the mouth\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>716 F.2d 896 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>2. <em>Appellant\u2019s Standing to Mount a Facial Challenge on Due Process Grounds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Singson argues, however, that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional because, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lawrence, </em>the statute\u2014as applied to private, consensual acts of sodomy\u2014-violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the statute is facially unconstitutional, Singson reasons that, even though his public conduct falls within the ambit of Code \u00a7 18.2-361, the statute cannot be enforced against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">However, a litigant \u201chas standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute only insofar as it has an adverse impact on his own rights.\u201d <em>County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 154-55, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979). Thus, \u201c[a]s a general rule, if there is no constitutional defect in the application of the statute to the litigant, he does not have standing to argue that it would be unconstitutional if applied to third parties in hypothetical situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, 99 S.Ct. at 2223.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">For example, in <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 754, 537 S.E.2d 1 (2000), the appellants challenged their convictions for solicitation to commit oral sodomy, in violation of the exact statutes at issue in this appeal. The appellants contended\u2014as does Singson\u2014that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 was \u201cunconstitutional on its face,\u201d reasoning that the statute, <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>alia, </em>\u201cdenies the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by the Constitution of Virginia.\u201d 33 Va.App. at 758, 537 S.E.2d at 3. We held, however, that appellants lacked standing to mount a facial challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-361, reasoning that the appellants fell \u201cwithin the general rule that a party attacking the constitutionality of a statute must demonstrate that his own, rather than a third party\u2019s, rights are constitutionally infringed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762, 537 S.E.2d at 5. Thus, we addressed the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 \u201conly as it applie[d] to the appellants in [that] case and to the[ ] conduct that underlay their convictions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Similarly, in <em>Santillo, </em>the appellant challenged the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 on substantially similar grounds, contending that the statute \u201cabridge[d] his constitutional right to privacy\u201d because it prohibited \u201cconsensual heterosexual sex.\u201d 30 Va.App. at 477, 517 S.E.2d at 736-37. Before conducting a constitutional analysis, we noted that, \u201cgenerally, a litigant may challenge the constitutionality of a law only as it applies to him or her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 517 S.E.2d at 737. We further explained that whether \u201c \u2018the statute may apply unconstitutionally to another is irrelevant; one cannot raise third party rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Coleman v. City of Richmond, </em>5 Va.App. 459, 463, 364 S.E.2d 239, 242 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Accordingly, as in <em>DePriest </em>and <em>Santillo, </em>we hold that Singson lacks standing to mount a facial challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-361.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, this Court is constrained to deciding whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is constitutional as applied to the circumstances of this case. And, for the reasons that follow, we hold that application of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 to Singson\u2019s proposed conduct does not offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>3. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is Constitutional as Applied to the Circumstances of this Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from state governmental interference with specific liberty interests. In <em>Lawrence, </em>for example, the United States Supreme Court examined the constitutionality of a Texas statute forbidding same-sex couples from engaging in conduct similar to that prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-361. <em>See </em>539 U.S. at 563, 123 S.Ct. at 2476. The issue presented in <em>Laurrence </em>was \u201cwhether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 123 S.Ct. at 2476. The <em>Lawrence </em>Court overruled its earlier decision in <em>Bowers v. Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1986), and invalidated the Texas statute, concluding that the government cannot make \u201cprivate sexual conduct a crime\u201d because the \u201cright to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives [individuals] the full right to engage in [that] conduct without intervention of the government.\u201d 539 U.S. at 578, 123 S.Ct. at 2484.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">However, in <em>Lawrence, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly noted that the case being decided on appeal did not \u201cinvolve public conduct or prostitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court, therefore, only addressed the constitutionality of criminalizing \u201cadult consensual sexual intimacy in the home,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 564, 123 S.Ct. at 2476, leaving undisturbed the states\u2019 authority to prohibit sexual conduct that occurs in a public\u2014rather than private\u2014arena. <em>See, e.g., State v. Thomas, </em>891 So.2d 1233, 1236, 1238 (La.2005) (declining to use <em>Lawrence </em>to strike down a law criminalizing solicitation of a crime against nature, noting that \u201cthe majority opinion in <em>Laurrence </em>specifically states the court\u2019s decision does not disturb state statutes prohibiting public sexual conduct or prostitution\u201d); <em>State v. Pope, </em>168 N.C.App. 592, 608 S.E.2d 114, 116 (reversing dismissal of indictment based upon the defendant\u2019s \u201cencounter with undercover police officers in which she indicated she would perform oral sex in exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>for money,\u201d reasoning that, \u201c[a]s the <em>Lawrence </em>Court expressly excluded prostitution and public conduct from its holding, the State of North Carolina may properly criminalize the solicitation of a sexual act it deems a crime against nature\u201d), <em>review denied, </em>612 S.E.2d 636 (N.C.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Singson argues, however, that, in <em>Lawrence, </em>the Supreme Court effectively declared all sodomy statutes facially unconstitutional. Singson points to the Court\u2019s statement that <em>\u201cBowers </em>was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today,\u201d 539 U.S. at 578, 123 S.Ct. at 2484, as evidencing the Supreme Court\u2019s belief that no statute encompassing private acts of sodomy can survive scrutiny under the Due Process Clause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">In <em>Bowers, </em>the appellant was prosecuted for engaging in homosexual acts of sodomy in the privacy of his own home. <em>See </em>478 U.S. at 187-88, 106 S.Ct. at 2842. After the indictment was dismissed, the appellant brought a suit in federal district court seeking, in essence, a declaratory judgment that the Georgia statute was unconstitutional \u201cas applied to consensual homosexual sodomy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188 n. 2, 106 S.Ct. at 2843 n. 2. The <em>Bowers </em>majority carefully stated that its decision \u201cexpress[ed] no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute as applied to other acts of sodomy,\u201d <em>id., </em>later noting that the issue being resolved in the appeal involved the continuing imposition of \u201ccriminal penalties for sodomy performed in private and between consenting adults,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 194, 106 S.Ct. at 2846. Similarly, the principal dissent in <em>Bowers </em>noted that the issue being decided concerned \u201cthe right of an individual to conduct intimate relationships in the intimacy of his or her own home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 106 S.Ct. at 2853 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, despite Singson\u2019s argument to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>contrary, <em>Bowers </em>did not involve a facial challenge to the Georgia sodomy statute. At best, then, the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Lawrence </em>indicates that the as-applied challenge in <em>Bowers </em>should have been upheld, and the statement does not\u2014as Singson contends\u2014announce a <em>per se </em>rule that all sodomy statutes are facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Singson also argues, however, that the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Martin v. Ziherl, </em>269 Va. 35, 607 S.E.2d 367 (2005), effectively declared Code \u00a7 18.2-361 facially unconstitutional. In <em>Martin, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court held that Code \u00a7 18.2-344, which prohibits unmarried individuals from \u201cvoluntarily [ ] hav[ing] sexual intercourse with any other person,\u201d was unconstitutional in light of the decision in <em>Lawrence. </em>However, the Virginia Supreme Court carefully noted that its decision \u201cdoes not involve minors, non-consensual activity, prostitution, <em>or public activity.\u201d Id. </em>at 43, 607 S.E.2d at 371 (emphasis added). Rather, the Court explicitly restricted its holding to \u201cprivate, consensual conduct between adults and the respective statutes\u2019 impact on such conduct,\u201d further noting that its decision \u201cdoes not affect the Commonwealth\u2019s police power regarding regulation of public fornication, prostitution, or other such crimes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Thus, to the extent that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 prohibits individuals from engaging in <em>public </em>acts of sodomy, the statute survives constitutional scrutiny under the Due Process Clause. <em>See State v. Whiteley, </em>616 S.E.2d 576, 580 (N.C.Ct.App.2005) (\u201c[O]ur state\u2019s regulation of sexual conduct falling outside the narrow liberty interest recognized in <em>Lawrence </em>remains constitutional.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, because Singson\u2019s proposed conduct oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>curred in a public location, application of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 under the circumstances of this case does not implicate Sing-son\u2019s constitutionally-protected right to engage in private, consensual acts of sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Our decision in <em>DePriest, </em>33 Va.App. 754, 537 S.E.2d 1, is instructive on this point. In <em>DePriest, </em>we affirmed the appellants\u2019 convictions for solicitation to commit oral sodomy, holding that application of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 under the circumstances of that case did not \u201cinfringe[ ] [the appellants\u2019] right to privacy\u201d because \u201cthe appellants\u2019 conduct was not private.\u201d 33 Va.App. at 762-63, 537 S.E.2d at 5. The appellants in <em>DePriest </em>approached \u201cstrangers in public parks\u201d and \u201cproposed to commit sodomy in the public parks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763, 537 S.E.2d at 5. We held that \u201c[t]he appellants\u2019 acts and their proposed conduct were clothed with no circumstance giving rise to a supportable claim of privacy,\u201d reasoning that, \u201c[w]hatever may be the constitutional privacy rights of one who engages in sodomy in private, those rights do not attach to one who does the same thing in public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Similarly, here, Singson\u2019s proposed conduct was \u201cclothed with no circumstances giving rise to a supportable claim of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, Singson approached a stranger in a public restroom in a public department store during business hours, and he proposed to commit sodomy in that restroom. Because Singson\u2019s proposed conduct involved a public rather than private location, application of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 under the circumstances of this ease does not implicate the narrow liberty interest recognized in <em>Lawrence. See United States v. Marcum, </em>60 M.J. 198, 208 (U.S.Armed Forces2004) (holding that Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which forbids \u201cunnatural carnal copulation with another person,\u201d was \u201cconstitutional as applied to Appellant\u201d because the appellant\u2019s conduct, specifically, coercing a subordinate into engaging in acts of sodomy, \u201cwas outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>liberty interest recognized in <em>Lawrence\u201d); cf.

Similarly, laws that do not directly regulate speech but, instead, tend to chill constitutionally-protected forms of expression may also run afoul of the First Amendment. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe Constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First Amendment\u2019s vast and privileged sphere.\u201d). Accordingly, if a statute chills \u201ca substantial amount of protected expression,\u201d the statute is \u201cunconstitutional on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 252-53, 122 S.Ct. at 1399 (invalidating a federal statute that went \u201cwell beyond\u201d the government interest in \u201cprohibit[ing] illegal conduct\u201d by also \u201crestricting the speech available to law-abiding adults\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>1. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is Overbroad Because it Criminalizes Constitutionally Protected Speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Singson argues primarily that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is constitutionally overbroad because it imposes criminal penalties on individuals who engage in constitutionally protected speech. Specifically, Singson reasons that Code \u00a7 18.2-361, in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-29, directly prohibits speech proposing a private act of sodomy. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Initially, Code \u00a7 18.2-361 itself does not criminalize speech or <em>expressive </em>conduct. Rather, it only prohibits <em>sexual </em>conduct. <em>See United States v. Dhingra, </em>371 F.3d 557, 561 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Code \u00a7 18.2-361 does not, in and of itself, prohibit conduct potentially protected by the First Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Mayfield, </em>574 Pa. 460, 832 A.2d 418, 424 (2003) (holding that a statute prohibiting certain forms of sexual activity was not constitutionally overbroad, reasoning that, \u201c[o]n its face, the statute proscribes pure conduct,\u201d not \u201cexpressive activity protected by the First Amendment,\u201d further noting that the court \u201ccan conceive of no set of circumstances in which [the statute] would infringe on constitutionally protected expression\u201d); <em>see also Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., </em>478 U.S. 697, 705, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 3176, 92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986) (noting that public sexual activity \u201cmanifests absolutely no element of protected expression\u201d and emphasizing \u201cthe fallacy of seeking to use the First Amendment as a cloak for obviously unlawful public sexual conduct\u201d); <em>Doe v. City of Lafayette, </em>377 F.3d 757, 763-64 (7th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(holding that the First Amendment \u201cprotection of the right of self-expression\u201d did not extend to the defendant\u2019s \u201cnon-expressive\u201d act of going to a public place and \u201clooking for children to satisfy his sexual urges,\u201d reasoning that the defendant\u2019s conduct reflected \u201cabsolutely no element of protected expression\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Similarly, solicitation of a sexual act is not communicative speech, but rather, non-expressive conduct. As noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, \u201c[flaws prohibiting solicitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>are not directed against words but against acts.\u201d <em>Pedersen v. Richmond, </em>219 Va. 1061, 1066, 254 S.E.2d 95, 98-99 (1979) (upholding ordinance prohibiting solicitation of sodomy). That is, \u201c[sojlicitation ... is the <em>act </em>of enticing or importuning on a personal basis for personal benefit or gain,\u201d and, as such, contains no element of expressive conduct. <em>District of Columbia v. Garcia, </em>335 A.2d 217, 224 (D.C.1975) (emphasis added) (distinguishing solicitation of sodomy from \u201cadvocacy of sodomy as socially beneficial,\u201d reasoning that only the latter constitutes \u201can act of public expression\u201d implicating the First Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">To the extent that an individual may be held criminally liable for soliciting a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-361, it is not the individual\u2019s speech that is being prohibited\u2014rather, \u201c \u2018speech is merely the vehicle\u2019 \u201d through which the solicitation occurs. <em>Dhingra, </em>371 F.3d at 561 (quoting <em>United States v. Meek, </em>366 F.3d 705, 721 (9th Cir.2004)). Because the prohibition against solicitation of sodomy criminalizes conduct, not expression, Code \u00a7 18.2-361\u2014even in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-29\u2014 does not directly prohibit speech or other forms of communicative conduct. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>376 F.3d 689, 696 (7th Cir.2004) (upholding a statute forbidding the solicitation of minors \u201cto perform sexually explicit acts,\u201d noting that the statute \u201cprohibited conduct, not protected speech\u201d). Thus, we find no merit in Singson\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is constitutionally overbroad because it criminalizes constitutionally protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">2. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is Overbroad Because it \u201cChills\u201d Constitutionally Protected Speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Singson, however, also contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is unconstitutional on its face because it chills protected speech, specifically, by deterring individuals from \u201cexercis[ing] their right to discuss private sodomy....\u201d Because Code \u00a7 18.2-361, in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-29, does not chill \u201ca substantial amount\u201d of protected expression, <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. at 255, 122 S.Ct. at 1404, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\n<em>a. Whether Speech Soliciting an Act of Sodomy is Protected by the First Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Initially, we must consider whether the speech allegedly being chilled is, in fact, constitutionally protected. As noted by the United States Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he freedom of speech has its limits; it does not embrace certain categories of speech, including defamation, incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real children.\u201d <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. at 245-46, 122 S.Ct. at 1399. Two of these categories of unprotected speech are potentially relevant here: obscenity and communications inciting another to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">First, although speech inciting an individual to commit a crime is unprotected by the First Amendment, <em>see Pedersen, </em>219 Va. at 1066, 254 S.E.2d at 98-99, it is clear, in the wake of <em>Lawrence, </em>that private acts of sodomy between consenting adults cannot, pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, be criminally punished. And, because private acts of consensual sodomy are constitutionally protected, speech proposing a private act of sodomy no longer qualifies as an \u201cincitement\u201d to commit a \u201ccrime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Second, although discussions of the conduct prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-361 may border on obscenity, it is not clear that those communications would be \u201cpatently offensive in light of community standards.\u201d <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct 2607, 2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (holding that the government, to prove obscenity, must establish that the communication \u201cappeals to the prurient interest\u201d and is \u201cpatently offensive in light of community standards\u201d). Accordingly, we cannot assume that speech proposing a private act of sodomy necessarily qualifies as \u201cobscene.\u201d <em>See Garcia, </em>335 A.2d at 223 (\u201c[T]he words used in [] sexual proposal cases may or may not be obscene in themselves.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">As noted by the United States Supreme Court, \u201cspeech may not be prohibited [or chilled] because it concerns subjects offending our sensibilities.\u201d <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. at 245, 122 S.Ct. at 1399; <em>see also Reno v. ACLU, </em>521 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>844, 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 2346, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) (\u201cIn evaluating the free speech right of adults, we have made it perfectly clear that sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)); <em>FCC v. Pacifica Found., </em>438 U.S. 726, 745, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3038, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (\u201cThe fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it.\u201d). Thus, we cannot conclude that speech proposing a private act of sodomy entirely lacks First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><em>b. Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 Impermissibly </em>\u201cChills\u201d <em>Constitutionally Protected Speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The overbreadth doctrine \u201cprohibits the Government from banning unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is prohibited or chilled in the process.\u201d <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. at 255, 122 S.Ct. at 1404. To establish that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional, Singson must therefore demonstrate, \u201c \u2018from the text of [the law] and from actual fact,\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia v. Hicks, </em>539 U.S. 113, 122, 123 S.Ct. 2191, 2198, 156 L.Ed.2d 148 (2003) (quoting <em>N.Y. State Club Ass\u2019n v. City of New York, </em>487 U.S. 1, 14, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2234, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988)), that the criminal penalties for soliciting a violation of that statute chill \u201ca substantial amount of protected speech,\u201d <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. at 255, 122 S.Ct. at 1404. Although Singson contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is substantially overbroad because it could potentially deter consenting adults from proposing private acts of sodomy, we find his arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\u201c[F]acial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice,\u201d and the rationale behind application of the overbreadth doctrine \u201cattenuates as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from \u2018pure speech\u2019 toward conduct.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2917, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). Moreover, courts are especially reluctant to invalidate a statute on facial overbreadth grounds when the prohibited conduct \u201cfalls within the scope of otherwise valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Parker v.

Thus, although criminal laws,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">if too broadly worded, may deter protected speech to some unknown extent, there comes a point where that effect\u2014at best a prediction\u2014cannot, with confidence, justify invalidating a statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\"><em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2917-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Moreover, \u201c \u2018the existence of a \u201cchilling effect,\u201d even in the area of First Amendment rights, has never been considered a sufficient basis, in and of itself, for prohibiting state action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 301, 310, 288 S.E.2d 461, 465 (1982) (quoting <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 51, 91 S.Ct. 746, 754, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971)). As a result,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">\u201c[w]here a statute does not directly abridge free speech, but ... tends to have the incidental effect of inhibiting First Amendment rights, it is well settled that the statute can be upheld if the effect on speech is minor in relating to the need for control of the conduct and the lack of alternative means for doing so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 51, 91 S.Ct. at 754).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Accordingly, where a statute regulates non-expressive conduct rather than speech, \u201cthe overbreadth of [the] statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2918. Also, when deciding whether a statute is overbroad because it chills a substantial amount of protected speech, this Court must be cognizant of the principle that \u201coverbreadth scrutiny [is] somewhat less rigid in the context of statutes regulating conduct in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>shadow of the First Amendment, but doing so in a neutral, noncensorial manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 93 S.Ct. at 2917.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">As discussed above, Code \u00a7 18.2-361 does not criminalize speech or other expressive conduct. And, as noted by the United States Supreme Court, \u201crarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or to conduct necessarily associated with speech (such as picketing or demonstrating).\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>539 U.S. at 124, 123 S.Ct. at 2199; <em>see also Dhingra, </em>371 F.3d at 563 (noting that, where a \u201cstatute regulates conduct, not speech, it is inappropriate to bootstrap our First Amendment jurisprudence into the context of criminal sexual contact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Moreover, to the extent that the statute, in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-29, might \u201cchill\u201d an individual from requesting an act of private sodomy, speech arguably residing \u201cin the shadow of the First Amendment,\u201d it does so \u201cin a neutral, noncensorial manner.\u201d <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 614, 93 S.Ct. at 2917. Also, the statute\u2019s \u201clegitimate sweep\u201d encompasses not only public sodomy, but also other forms of conduct that lack constitutional protection, specifically, non-consensual sodomy, incestual sodomy, sodomy with a minor, committing sodomy in exchange for money, and engaging in acts of bestiality.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In our view, the incidental, hypothetical effect of the statute on speech requesting an act of private, consensual sodomy \u201ccannot, with confidence, justify invalidating [the] statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2918; <em>see also Hicks, </em>539 U.S. at 119-20, 123 S.Ct. at 2197 (\u201c[T]here comes a point at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the chilling effect of an overbroad law, significant though it may be, cannot justify prohibiting all enforcement of that law,\u201d particularly when striking the statute down on its face would \u201cblock application of [the] law ... to constitutionally unprotected conduct.\u201d); <em>Parker v.

Specifically, Singson argues that his \u201cconviction of a felony, with its prison sentence and permanent disenfranchisement, is a drastic sanction for his verbal solicitation of intimacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Singson, however, never made this argument to the trial court. Although, in a footnote located in a pretrial brief, Singson noted that \u201cthe prosecution of this matter ... raises grave concerns under the proscription of cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d this footnote is insufficient to qualify as a contemporaneous objection for purposes of Rule 5A:18. That is, raising a \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the potential range of punishment in a pretrial, pre-conviction brief is not equivalent to lodging a contemporaneous objection to the sentence actually imposed. As we have noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">As a precondition to appellate review, Rule 5A:18 requires a contemporaneous objection in the trial court to preserve the issue on appeal. Not just any objection will do. It must be both <em>specific </em>and timely\u2014so that the trial judge would know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the particular point being made in time to do something about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><em>Thomas v.

The principal dissent in <em>Bowers </em>says as much. <em>See </em>478 U.S. at 212-13, 106 S.Ct. at 2855 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (noting that \u201cintimate behavior may be punished when it takes place in public,\u201d and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>observing that \"[s]tatutes banning public sexual activity are entirely consistent with ... the [constitutionally-protected] liberty interest in decisions concerning sexual relations\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\">. As noted by one federal court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">there are many activities that the law recognizes a person may constitutionally engage in in his home that could be made criminal if done in public. For instance, a person is free to drink alcohol to the point of inebriation in his home, but could be cited for public intoxication if he left the house. A person can possess a firearm without a license in his home, but could be cited for carrying that same item in public. A person can walk around naked in his home, but could be cited for public indecency if he left his house in that condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-9\"><em>United States v. Extreme Assocs., Inc., </em>352 F.Supp.2d 578, 594 (W.D.Pa. 2005) (citations omitted). Similarly, although individuals may engage in private, consensual acts of sodomy free from government intrusion, the Commonwealth remains free to criminalize that conduct if\u2014as here\u2014it occurs in a public location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b784-10\">. We note at the outset that Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-361 and 18.2-29 do not operate, even at their fullest extent, to prohibit \"all\u201d discussions regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>ing sodomy and oral sex. Rather, with respect to consenting adults, only those conversations during which a party actively requests participation in public commission of an act prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-361 would arguably fall within the scope of the statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">. Although the statute, as applied to Singson, is constitutional, <em>see </em>Part 11(A)(3), <em>supra, </em>\u201c[ljitigants ... are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute\u2019s very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\u201d <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 612, 93 S.Ct. at 2916. Accordingly, Singson has standing, in the narrow context of his First Amendment arguments, to challenge the facial constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-361. <em>See Stanley v. City of Norfolk, </em>218 Va. 504, 507, 237 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1977) (\"Even when a defendant\u2019s conduct [is] not constitutionally protected and could have been proscribed by a properly drawn statute, he may have standing to assert a facial challenge based upon overbreadth which 'chills\u2019 the exercise of First Amendment rights by others.\u201d (citing <em>Thornhill v.
