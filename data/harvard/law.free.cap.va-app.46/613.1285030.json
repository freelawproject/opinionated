ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">A jury found Larry Alonzo Oliver guilty of third-offense petit larceny. During the penalty phase of his bifurcated trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the trial court admitted evidence of prior criminal convictions Oliver received from special military courts-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Oliver objected to this evidence, arguing that the criminal convictions were not convictions \u201cunder the laws of ... the United States\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. The trial court rejected the argument, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Enacted by Congress and codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-946, the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) constitute laws of the United States\u2014a conclusion many courts, expressly or implicitly, have accepted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To be sure, we took it for granted in <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 851, 856-57, 568 S.E.2d 468, 470-71 (2002), when we held that convictions under the UCMJ involve criminal offenses \u201cunder the laws of ... the United States\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 17.1-805(C). We concede, as Oliver insists we must, that <em>Turner </em>did not extensively analyze the point and appears to have assumed its validity. Even so, it seemed then a fair and uncontroversial assumption. Upon further reflection, it does still.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">This cannot and should not be so, Oliver responds, because some types of UCMJ military tribunals allegedly violate due process by affording inadequate procedural safeguards and by imposing unconstitutional criminal sanctions. Such hypotheti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>cal applications of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, however, do not change the plain meaning of its text or vary its intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In principle, we accept that certain \u201cwholly unconstitutional\u201d convictions can be collaterally attacked and disqualified for consideration during sentencing. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But, when available, the collateral attack remedy would not be offered on the ground that the invalid UCMJ conviction rested on something other than the \u201claws of ... the United States\u201d as that phrase appears in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Instead, the invalid UCMJ conviction would be excluded from trial, if at all, because it violated a higher law of the United States: the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In any event, we need not address Oliver\u2019s hypothesis further. He does not raise on appeal any constitutional objections in contest of his UCMJ convictions. Nor did Oliver assert at trial any collateral attack of any kind against the presumed validity of the special courts-martial conviction orders introduced in his case. There being no such challenge, we presume military courts understand that they, \u201clike the state courts, have the same responsibilities as do the federal courts to protect a person from a violation of his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Burns v. Wilson, </em>346 U.S. 137, 142, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 1048, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The trial court did not violate Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 by admitting, during the sentencing phase of Oliver\u2019s bifurcated jury trial, criminal convictions he received from special courts-martial under the UCMJ. For this reason, we affirm Oliver\u2019s conviction for third-offense petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. <em>See, e.g., State v.
