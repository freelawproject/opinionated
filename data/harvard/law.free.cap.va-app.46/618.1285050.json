Evelyn (appellant) appeals a circuit court decision holding that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) had the authority to order the removal of a portion of his private pier, located along the Pamunkey River. We hold the governing statutes limit the riparian owner\u2019s rights such that he may build, without a permit, only those structures \u201cnecessary\u201d or essential to the placement of a private pier for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters. The riparian landowner may not build, without a permit, incidental appendages designed merely to enhance the primary purpose of the pier. Thus, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision affirming the VMRC\u2019s order to appellant to remove the roof and second-story deck structure he added to his pier without VMRC approval.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">On March 24, 2000, appellant submitted an application to the VMRC for permission to construct a pier and boat ramp on his property along the Pamunkey River. The application sought permission to construct on appellant\u2019s property \u201ca six (6) foot wide[, 80-foot long] private pier extending 45 feet beyond the mean high water shoreline with an 18-foot long Tend and a 15-foot wide boat ramp extending 15 feet channel-ward of the mean low water line.\u201d The VMRC responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The proposed boat ramp will require a permit from our agency. However, based upon your application and drawings, which assert that you are a riparian property owner, please be advised that no authorization is required from the [VMRC] or your local wetlands board for your pier with Tend, <em>provided </em>it will be used exclusively for your private, noncommercial use, is located within your riparian area, and will not extend beyond the established navigation line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On August 7, 2000, the VMRC issued a permit for construction of the boat ramp that granted appellant \u201cpermission to ... [e]ncroach in, on, or over State-owned subaqueous bottoms pursuant to Chapter 12, Subtitle III, of Title 28.2 of the Code of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">On May 8, 2002, VMRC staff conducted a \u201croutine compliance check\u201d of the boat ramp. The ramp constructed was longer than authorized by the permit, but \u201cthe additional length over the original request was landward of mean low water[,] and the subaqueous encroachment was consistent with the permit.\u201d Appellant applied for and received an after-the-fact approval for the boat ramp extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Also at the May 8, 2002 compliance check, VMRC staff determined that the pier constructed was longer than proposed, that the T-head was larger than proposed, and that a \u201crooftdeck with stair access,\u201d not mentioned in the request for authorization, \u201chad been constructed over a portion of the pier T-head.\u201d At a follow-up visit on May 16, 2002, appellant\u2019s agent indicated that the changes in the design of the pier were made after receipt of the VMRC\u2019s letter of April 18, 2000, indicating that no authorization was required for the pier. The agent indicated his belief, based on the VMRC\u2019s letter, that no additional authorization was required for the changes to the pier to include the roof/deck structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">On May 21, 2002, the VMRC issued a notice of violation based on the unauthorized roof structure and ordered that the structure be removed. However, it also acknowledged appellant\u2019s desire to submit \u201can after-the-fact request to modify [the] existing permit to retain the existing roof structure\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>agreed to hold \u201cfurther enforcement in abeyance\u201d pending the VMRC\u2019s ruling on the request. Appellant submitted that request, which included \u201cadjoining property forms\u201d indicating no opposition to the structure and a letter from the applicant\u2019s sister indicating that several family members were elderly and handicapped and required the shade provided by the structure\u2019s second story in order to enjoy family gatherings on the pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On September 24, 2002, the VMRC held a hearing on appellant\u2019s request. The \u201c[rjecommendation from [VMRC] staff\u2019 was to deny the after-the-fact request, based in part on the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">The applicant and/or agent were well aware that permits for encroachment over State-owned subaqueous lands are required since a permit was issued for the boat ramp. Additionally, the structures, as built, do not conform to the original drawings and contain larger and additional structures than ... originally requested. In this case, the covered roof/deck structure represents an unauthorized encroachment over State-owned submerged lands and is not necessary for use of the pier or access to the river.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The VMRC voted seven to one to deny the request for after-the-fact authorization for the roof'deck structure and to require its removal within 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Appellant noted his appeal to the New Kent County Circuit Court. Appellant\u2019s primary argument was that the roof/deck structure was allowed as part of the pier that Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5) authorized him to construct without a permit. Appellant argued in the alternative that the VMRC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting his after-the-fact request for a permit. The court affirmed the VMRC\u2019s ruling. On appeal to this Court, appellant contends only that the pier and roof/deck structure are exempt from the VMRC\u2019s control based on the language of existing statutes and the absence of any applicable regulations. He does not contend that, if the VMRC had such permitting authority, it acted arbitrarily and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>capriciously in rejecting his application for approval after-the-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On appeal of an agency\u2019s determination on issues of law, \u201c \u2018[i]f the issue falls outside the area generally entrusted to the agency, and is one in which the courts have special competence, i.e., the common law or constitutional law,\u2019 \u201d the court need not defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v.

Bd. of Adjustment, </em>9 N.J. 405, 88 A.2d 607, 615-16 (1952)). Although the outcome of this appeal turns to some extent on an interpretation of the common law, that law has been codified by the General Assembly in statutes it has entrusted the VMRC to apply.

Glick, </em>240 Va. 283, 287, 397 S.E.2d 105, 108 (1990) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1510 (1986)) (analyzing meaning of insurance contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The Virginia Supreme Court has recognized that a \u201cpier\u201d is one type of \u201cartificial mooring out to or along navigable waters,\u201d but it has not further defined the term. <em>Irby v. Roberts, </em>256 Va. 324, 330 n. 4, 504 S.E.2d 841, 844 n. 4 (1998) (in context of interpreting deed purporting to grant easement to construct pier, holding that \u201c \u2018pier\u2019 and \u201cwharf are not congruent terms\u201d but that \u201cthe construction of an artificial mooring out to or along navigable waters requires the same riparian right regardless of the intended use of the structure\u201d). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines a \u201cpier\u201d as a \u201cstructure extending from solid land out into the water of a river, lake, harbor, etc. to afford convenient passage for persons and property to and from vessels along the sides of the pier.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1305 (4th ed.1968); <em>see Mayor of Seabright v. Allgor, </em>69 N.J.L. 641, 56 A. 287, 288 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Thus, under the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5), appellant was entitled, without obtaining a permit from the VMRC, to build \u201can artificial mooring out to navigable waters\u201d to the extent that mooring was \u201cessential\u201d for the \u201cconvenient passage [of] persons and property to and from vessels along the sides\u201d of the structure. The roof, stairs, and second floor structure appellant added to his pier were not \u201cessential\u201d to his ability to reach the navigable portion of the river. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>appellant admitted on brief, these structures were \u201cincidental appendages\u201d designed to \u201cenhance[ ] the primary purpose of the pier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5) did not authorize appellant\u2019s construction, <em>without a permit, </em>of the portion of the mooring that was not \u201cessential\u201d to accessing navigable waters. Although appellant\u2019s pier involved only a second-story deck with an open design, appellant\u2019s reasoning, carried to the extreme, would allow the construction of a multi-story, enclosed dwelling not subject to VMRC oversight. Allowing unfettered noncommercial building atop piers that do not intrude into navigable waters is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute and the common law and would produce an absurd result. Although appellant concedes \u201cthe architecture of a private pier can be the subject of regulation\u201d <em>by a local government, </em>this position ignores the fact that <em>the VMRC </em>is the body to which the General Assembly has assigned the task of protecting the public\u2019s interests in \u201cstate-owned bottom-lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Further, even if we were to hold the statute is ambiguous, requiring resort to the rales of statutory construction, these rules further support the determination we have already made regarding the plain meaning of the term \u201cpier.\u201d \u201cStatutes addressing the same subject are to be read <em>in pari materia </em>[, that is, they should be] \u2018read, construed and applied together so that the legislature\u2019s intention can be gathered from the whole of the enactments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 256, 450 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1994) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>791 (6th ed.1990)). Under \u201c[t]he maxim of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>... [,] where a statute speaks in specific terms, an implication arises that omitted terms were not intended to be included within the scope of the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 704-05, 529 S.E.2d 96, 100 (2000) (holding only circuit courts had authority to issue prisoner transportation orders in civil eases where statute granted such authority to circuit courts without mention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>district courts). \u201cWhen a legislative enactment limits the manner in which something may be done, the enactment also evinces the intent that it shall not be done another way.\u201d <em>Grigg v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 356, 364, 297 S.E.2d 799, 803 (1982). Finally, \u201c[i]t is well settled that where the construction of a statute has been uniform for many years in administrative practice, and has been acquiesced in by the General Assembly, such construction is entitled to great weight with the courts,\u201d <em>Dan River Mills, Inc. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm\u2019n, </em>195 Va. 997, 1002, 81 S.E.2d 620, 623 (1954), and \u201cin doubtful cases will be regarded as decisive,\u201d <em>S. Spring Bed Co. v. State Corp. Comm\u2019n, </em>205 Va. 272, 275, 136 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Thus, the right to erect a \u201cpier\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 62.1-164 must be construed in harmony with the provisions of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5). Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5) requires that a person wishing to build, for noncommercial purposes, a private pier traversing Commonwealth bottom-lands located between the mean low water mark and the line of navigability of a river must either (1) obtain a permit for such construction from the VMRC or (2) establish that traversing the Commonwealth\u2019s property is \u201cnecessary\u201d for the placement of a pier that complies with the provisions contained in that code section. Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5) provides that \u201csuch piers <em>may include </em>an attached boat lift and an open-sided roof designed to shelter a single boat slip or boat lift.\u201d (Emphasis added). It also provides that \u201c[i]n cases in which such roofs will exceed 700 square feet in coverage, and in cases in which an adjoining property owner objects to a proposed roof structure, permits shall be required as provided in \u00a7 28.2-1204.\u201d The General Assembly, by specifying the nature and size of a particular structure that may be included on a pier, has demonstrated its intention that a riparian pier authorized by Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5) may not include appurtenant structures not specifically authorized therein. Although the statute authorizes the erection of a roof of limited size over a single boat slip or lift, it makes no mention of a roof over the pier itself. It would be inconsistent to require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>riparian owner to obtain a permit to construct a roof exceeding 700 square feet over a boat lift or boat slip while simultaneously permitting, subject to no height or other size restrictions whatever, the construction of a roof or deck structure over the pier itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Further, although the erection of a roof or second floor over a pier may enhance a riparian owner\u2019s enjoyment of his pier, such a structure is not \u201cnecessary\u201d to the \u201cplacement\u201d of a \u201cpier\u201d as authorized by Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5). <em>Cf. </em>78 Op. Md. Atty. Gen. 26, 1993 WL 343619, *1 (Aug. 6, 1993) (holding \u201c[a] pier <em>covering </em>is \u2018non-water dependent\u2019 whenever it has a purpose that could be served if the structure were located on land\u201d and that the fact \u201c[t]hat a structure would afford greater enjoyment to the owner were it located on a pier does not take the structure out of the class of \u2018non-water dependent\u2019 structures\u201d (emphasis added)). Such an interpretation is consistent with the rights of riparian owners at common law to construct a pier for the purpose of accessing the navigable portion of an adjacent river, <em>see Langley, </em>237 Va. at 62, 376 S.E.2d at 523, for purposes such as fishing, bathing, and boating, <em>see Becker v. Litty, </em>318 Md. 76, 566 A.2d 1101, 1104 (1989). \u201c[OJnce the right of access is gratified, this particular [private] right of a riparian owner goes no further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(holding that right of riparian owner \u201cdoes not encompass a right of free navigation\u201d and that \u201c[t]he right to navigate on navigable waters is a public right, not one that attaches only to the owner of riparian property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Such an interpretation also is consistent with the amendments the General Assembly made to the statute in 2003. Those amendments, made after the VMRC\u2019s decision in this case, place further restrictions on the dimensions of a pier constructed without a permit, requiring that such a pier \u201cnot exceed six feet in width\u201d and that \u201cany L or T head construction platforms or protrusions ... not exceed 250 total square feet.\u201d 2003 Va. Acts, ch. 973. The amendments contain no language indicating error in the VMRC\u2019s conclusion that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A), the covered roof and deck structure on appellant\u2019s pier \u201crepresented] an unauthorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>encroachment over State-owned submerged lands and [was] not necessary for use of the pier or access to the river.\u201d Thus, the amendments represent acquiescence in the VMRC\u2019s interpretation of the statutes to require a permit for the inclusion on a pier of any non-water dependent structures not specifically authorized by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Appellant complains that even if the VMRC does have the authority to regulate the architecture of private piers, it may not do so in this case because it has not \u201cpromulgated [any] regulations that clearly prohibit the type of pier\u201d he has constructed. Again, we disagree. As we held above, Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5) does not authorize appellant to construct a roof and deck on his pier. Thus, Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A) required appellant to obtain a permit from the VMRC for the roof and deck. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-1204, the VMRC \u201cis authorized to ... [i]ssue permits for all reasonable uses of state-owned bottomlands not authorized under [Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A) ]....\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) sets out a non-exhaustive list of criteria the VMRC \u201cshall consider\u201d \u201c[w]hen determining whether to grant or deny any permit for the use of state-owned bottomlands.\u201d The VMRC need not promulgate official regulations pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) before it may issue or deny permits pursuant to the criteria in that code section. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 28.2-103 (\u201cThe Commission shall exercise all of the powers herein conferred and <em>may </em>promulgate regulations and guidelines necessary to carry out the provisions of this title.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995, 2002 (1947) (\u201c[T]he choice between proceeding by general rule or by individual, <em>ad hoc </em>litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d), <em>quoted with approval in NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 292-93 &amp; n. 23, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1770-71 &amp; n. 23, 40 L.Ed.2d 134, 152-53 <em>&amp; </em>n. 23 (1974). It is the governing statutes, not the guidelines, that determine the scope of appellant\u2019s pier-building rights. Any failure of the VMRC to comply with the statutory requirements, if any, for the promulgation of its Subaqueous Guidelines does not defeat its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>duty to apply Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A) to safeguard the Commonwealth\u2019s resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a permit was required in order for appellant to construct the roof/deck structure on his pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">For these reasons, we hold Code \u00a7 28.2-1203 limits the riparian owner\u2019s rights such that he may build, without a permit, only those structures \u201cnecessary\u201d or essential to the placement of a private pier for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters. The riparian landowner may not build, without a permit, \u201cincidental appendages\u201d designed merely to \u201cenhance[] the primary purpose of the pier.\u201d Thus, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision affirming the VMRC\u2019s order to appellant to remove the offending structure. Because appellant has challenged only the conclusion that Code \u00a7\u00a7 28.2-1203 and 62.1-164 did not authorize Mm to build the roof and deck structure without a permit, we do not consider whether the VMRC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting appellant\u2019s request for approval of the structure after-the-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\">.

Unless otherwise noted, this opinion references the versions of the various statutes in effect in 2000 when appellant notified the VMRC of his desire to build a pier and boat ramp and the VMRC issued a permit for the ramp because these same statutes govern whether appellant was required to obtain a permit for the pier he constructed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b675-5\">. Consideration of a form of the public trust doctrine is entirely appropriate in determining legislative intent. The Virginia Supreme Court held in <em>Commonwealth v. City of Newport News, </em>158 Va. 521, 549, 164 S.E. 689, 697 (1932), that \"except as is otherwise expressly or impliedly provided by the Constitution, what is for the benefit of the people is committed to [the legislature\u2019s] discretion free from the control or dictation of the executive or judicial department of the government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Since the Virginia Supreme Court issued that decision in 1932, Virginia's Constitution has been amended to require, <em>inter alia, </em>protection of the Commonwealth's \"waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction, for the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth.\u201d Va. Const. art. XI, \u00a7 1. \"In furtherance of such policy, the General Assembly may undertake ... the protection of its ... waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction, by agencies of the Commonwealth....\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Thus, the Constitution makes clear it is entirely appropriate for the VMRC and judiciary to consider the legislature\u2019s express duty to \"safeguard the public right to the use and enjoyment of the subaqueous lands of the Commonwealth held in trust by it for the benefit of the public as conferred by the public trust doctrine and the Constitution of Virginia,\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A), when interpreting and applying <em>all </em>legislative enactments, including Code \u00a7\u00a7 28.2-1203 and 62.1-164. <em>See </em>Sharon M.

L.Rev. 895, 900-16 (1989) (discussing evolution of public trust doctrine in Virginia and extent to which judiciary may evaluate legislative enactments for consistency with doctrine). We need not decide whether the General Assembly has the power to allow riparian owners to build recreational structures atop the portions of their piers in public waters without violating the public trust doctrine as it exists in Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>because we hold Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A) does not grant riparian owners such authority.
