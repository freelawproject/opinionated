McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Jacob Thomas Mattox, a juvenile, was convicted of felony hit and run, reckless driving, and assault and battery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals his commitment and sentence as a \u201cserious offender\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Lieutenant Ronald B. Henry, a game warden with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, dressed in his boat duty uniform, was at a marina to conduct boat patrols. Henry noticed an ATV, operated by Mattox, moving at a rapid speed. Henry shouted to Mattox, requesting him to stop. Henry was concerned that Mattox would hurt someone because he was driving the ATV at a rapid speed near a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>crowd. After Henry requested Mattox to stop, Mattox raised his left hand and extended his middle finger as he drove away. After this encounter, Mattox told an acquaintance that he \u201cflipped ... off\u2019 a game warden and that he was going to \u201cpiss ... off\u2019 the game wardens. Mattox told another witness that he was \u201cnot worried about them mother f\u2014ers\u201d looking for him, referring to the game wardens.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Later that afternoon, Henry heard Mattox\u2019s ATV and attempted to stop Mattox. Mattox initially slowed down, and Henry began to approach Mattox. When Henry was within five or six feet, Mattox accelerated and attempted to elude Henry. Henry ran along the road near a circular path to cut off Mattox. Henry stopped in the path of the ATV, gestured for Mattox to stop by extending both hands \"with his palms outward, and shouted \u201cstop.\u201d Mattox did not stop, but instead accelerated and drove directly toward Henry. Mattox\u2019s ATV struck Henry, causing him to suffer a concussion, lacerations to the back of his head, a broken leg, a punctured hand, an injury to his other hand that required eight stitches, and many cuts and bruises to his legs and arms. After the collision, Mattox drove away without rendering any aid to Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Mattox returned to the scene of the incident later that afternoon. He told the investigating trooper that the brakes on the ATV did not work. The trooper confirmed that the foot brake was inoperable; however, the hand brake worked properly when he tested it.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">At sentencing, Mattox produced numerous witnesses who testified about his law-abiding character, peacefulness, remorsefulness, good reputation in the community, positive behavior while in juvenile detention pending sentencing, the availability of juvenile treatment programs, and his amenability for treatment. The presentence report reflected that Mattox had no prior criminal history. It also noted that his last reported grades were one C and five Fs. When in the detention facility, Mattox had one B and four As, and won five awards for most studious, team player, citizenship, best all around, and best attitude. A clinical psychologist conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>an evaluation of Mattox and found no mental deficiencies. He concluded that Mattox was \u201ccapable of making good social judgments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">When the trial court sentenced Mattox, it acknowledged that \u201cthere is a side of him that is very considerate, very respectful.\u201d However, the court noted that Mattox\u2019s act against Henry was \u201cwillfiil\u201d and \u201cnot an accident.\u201d The court stated that he did not \u201ctry to swerve, didn\u2019t try to hit his brakes, did nothing, and then after he hit the officer, looked back and saw the officer lying in the road.\u201d The court found Mattox had no respect for authority. The court considered that Mattox severely injured Henry and that his actions were \u201cso horrendous\u201d and \u201catrocious\u201d that he should be declared a \u201cserious offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On appeal, Mattox contends that he was a person of good character, had no prior criminal record, had not committed a felony punishable by a 20-year confinement, had responded well to local juvenile detention, and according to his witnesses, would have benefited from local juvenile programs. Mattox argues that the evidence was not sufficient for the trial court to conclude that \u201cthe needs of the juvenile would clearly best be served by commitment as a serious offender\u201d and, therefore, the trial court erred in sentencing him as such under Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe are required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Suleiman v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 506, 512, 495 S.E.2d 532, 535-36 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(A) was amended in 2001, and language was added providing an alternative qualification for a juvenile to be committed as a \u201cserious offender.\u201d Prior to this amendment, our decision in <em>Suleiman </em>was the seminal case addressing Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1, the commitment of serious offenders. However, the <em>Suleiman </em>holding was based on the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(A) and Code \u00a7 16.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>285.1(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We consider for the first time since the 2001 amendment, the second paragraph of Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(A). This paragraph allows a circuit court to commit a juvenile as a serious offender if the court finds \u201cthe needs of the juvenile and the interests of the community would clearly best be served by commitment.\u201d In making this determination, the court is to consider \u201cthe commitment criteria set forth in subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 of subsection B as well as other components of the juvenile\u2019s life history.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(B) provides, in pertinent part,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeV\">[p]rior to committing any juvenile pursuant to this section, the court shall consider ... [t]he juvenile\u2019s age[,] ... [and] ... [t]he seriousness and number of the present offenses, including (i) whether the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner; (ii) whether the offense was against persons or property, with greater weight being given to offenses against persons, especially if death or injury resulted; ... and (iv) the nature of the juvenile\u2019s participation in the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azj\">In addition, the \u201ccommitment order must be supported by a determination that the interests of the juvenile and community require that the juvenile be placed under legal restraint or discipline and that the juvenile is not a proper person to receive treatment or rehabilitation through other juvenile programs or facilities.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In this case, the court\u2019s factual findings satisfy the requirements of both the second paragraph of Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(A) and Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(B), and \u201cconstitute evidence that the court made the required determination[s]\u201d pursuant to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>statutes. <em>Suleiman, </em>26 Va.App. at 511, 495 S.E.2d at 535. The court received evidence that when Lieutenant Henry told Mattox to \u201cstop,\u201d he extended his middle finger at Henry, and then made certain Henry saw it as Mattox drove away. Soon thereafter, Mattox stated that he was going to \u201cpiss ... off\u2019 the game wardens and referred to the game wardens as \u201cmother f\u2014ers.\u201d Mattox later went back to the area where Henry was located, and after being told to \u201cstop,\u201d he accelerated and drove away from Henry as Henry approached the ATV. Mattox then deliberately drove the vehicle directly toward Henry, accelerating speed as he approached on the ATV. Mattox struck Henry with the ATV, left the scene immediately, and never offered Henry assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In sentencing appellant, the court emphasized the seriousness of the offense. The court found Mattox\u2019s action of driving the ATV into a game warden and causing serious injury was a \u201chorrendous act any way you characterize it.\u201d Mattox \u201cwas totally disrespectful\u201d and \u201ctotally disregarded authority.\u201d The court noted it was \u201ca willful offense against the officer,\u201d and \u201cnot an accident.\u201d The court stated that Mattox \u201cdid nothing to avoid the officer,\u201d he \u201cdidn\u2019t try to swerve,\u201d he \u201cdidn\u2019t try to hit his brakes,\u201d he \u201cdid nothing.\u201d The court observed that \u201cafter he hit the officer, [he] looked back and saw the officer lying in the road.\u201d Mattox fled the scene, leaving the injured officer unaided and unattended. Only hours later did he return to the scene of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">It is clear from the record that the court considered Mattox\u2019s age, the aggressive, violent and willful manner in which Mattox struck Henry, that the offense was committed against a person, the extensive injuries suffered by Henry, and that Mattox was the sole participant in the crime. The court also noted that the \u201cquestion is what sort of rehabilitation\u201d and \u201cwhat sort of punishment\u201d Mattox needs. The court concluded that it had considered the serious offender statute and stated \u201cthe only thing appropriate [for Mattox] would be the serious offender program.\u201d The court then sentenced Mattox under that statute. We find these considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u201creflect[] the court\u2019s implicit determination that [Mattox] is not a proper person for non-incarceration juvenile treatment.\u201d <em>Suleiman, </em>26 Va.App. at 512, 495 S.E.2d at 535; Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(B). \u201c[Wjhether appellant was a proper person to receive treatment or rehabilitation through non-incarceration programs is a question of fact, and we may not reverse a court\u2019s finding of fact unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Suleiman, </em>26 Va.App. at 512, 495 S.E.2d at 536 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Accordingly, we find that the court considered the factors in Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(B) as well as other components of Mattox\u2019s life history and determined that \u201cthe needs of the juvenile and the interests of the community would clearly best be served by commitment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Finding no abuse of discretion by the trial court in sentencing Mattox as a \u201cserious offender\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-285.1, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-14\">.
