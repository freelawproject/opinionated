BENTON, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarded benefits and expenses under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Compensation Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5009 through 38.2-5021, to Michele Bakke and Jonathan Bakke, parents and next friends of Jenna Marie Bakke. The Commonwealth of Virginia, Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program, and the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program Board (collectively designated \u201cthe Program\u201d) contend the commission erred (1) in applying the Act\u2019s rebuttable presumption that the infant\u2019s injury is a birth-related neurological injury, (2) in finding that some of the physicians were the most qualified to evaluate the timing of the infant\u2019s injury, (3) in concluding that evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption, and (4) in finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Program failed to prove a specific non-birth-related cause of the injury. We affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">During her pregnancy, Michele Bakke received a diagnosis of HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels and low platelet count) and preeclampsia. Because of the life-threatening dangers to Bakke and her child associated with these conditions and because of Bakke\u2019s low platelet count, physicians delivered her child by cesarian section without labor. At her birth on September 2, 1999, the infant\u2019s gestational age was estimated to be twenty-nine weeks. She weighed .885 kilograms and was 33 centimeters long. The medical records indicate the infant had \u201cNO RESPIRATION\u201d at delivery and was intubated immediately. A handwritten note included -within the delivery records shows that she \u201cdid make some resp effort.\u201d At that time, the infant\u2019s Apgar score was five. Five minutes after birth, her Apgar score was seven. When the infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, a note indicated her condition as \u201cresponsive in severe respiratory distress.\u201d The infant\u2019s chest x-ray report indicated \u201cWHITE OUT LUNGS,\u201d and the infant was put on a ventilator, where she remained for a month. The discharge summary noted diagnoses for twelve diseases or conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The medical records from the period of the infant\u2019s birth to her discharge from the hospital on December 7, 1999 are extensive. Likewise, the commission\u2019s record contains extensive testimony, reports, and other documents from physicians regarding the infant\u2019s condition at birth and later. In two succinct sentences, the commission addressed the nub of the issue in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">The medical professionals who have evaluated [the infant\u2019s] medical history disagree regarding when and how [she] actually sustained the injury causing her cerebral palsy. While Dr. [James T.] Christmas and the members of the [medical panel] who reviewed [the infant\u2019s] case have opined that [she] did not sustain an injury during the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of her labor, delivery, resuscitation or immediately after her birth, Dr. [J. Peter] VanDorsten, Dr. [Daniel] Lefton, Dr. [M. Elizabeth] Latimer and Dr. [Marcus C.] Hermansen have all opined that [she] was injured around the time of her birth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In a lengthy opinion, the commission reviewed in detail the medical evidence and found that the more persuasive opinions were rendered by those physicians who opined that the damage to the infant\u2019s brain was caused at birth. The Program contends that the commission\u2019s reasoning is flawed and that the award should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act provides compensation to families whose infants suffer \u201cbirth-related neurological injuries\u201d caused by a participating physician or a participating hospital. Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5000 to 38.2-5021. A \u201cbirth-related neurological injury\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">[I]njury to the brain or spinal cord of an infant caused by the deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury occurring in the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation in the immediate post-delivery period in a hospital which renders the infant permanently motorically disabled and (i) developmentally disabled or (ii) for infants sufficiently developed to be cognitively evaluated, cognitively disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Code \u00a7 38.2-5001. Thus, to satisfy this statutory definition the following four factors necessarily must be established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">(1) The infant sustained \u201can injury to the brain or spinal cord\u201d that was \u201ccaused by deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">(2) The injury occurred \u201cin the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation necessitated by a deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury that occurred in the course of labor or delivery, in a hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">(3) The injury rendered the infant \u201cpermanently motorically disabled and (i) developmentally disabled or (ii) for infants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>sufficiently developed to be cognitively evaluated, cognitively disabled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">(4) Such disability caused \u201cthe infant to be permanently in need of assistance in all activities of daily living.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><em>Central Virginia Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assoc., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 273, 590 S.E.2d 631, 635-36 (2004) (quoting Code \u00a7 38.2-5001) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Initially, we address the Program\u2019s contention that the commission \u201cerr[ed] in applying the presumption set forth in ... Code \u00a7 38.2-5008.\u201d We conclude that this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u201cThe legislature, recognizing the difficulty in proving when, but not whether, such an injury was sustained, enacted a presumption to assist potential claimants in obtaining benefits.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Virginia Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Pgm., </em>40 Va.App. 565, 578, 580 S.E.2d 467, 473 (2003). This presumption is described by the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">A rebuttable presumption shall arise that the injury alleged is a birth-related neurological injury where it has been demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, that the infant has sustained a brain or spinal cord injury caused by oxygen deprivation or mechanical injury, and that the infant was thereby rendered permanently motorieally disabled and (i) developmentally disabled or (ii) for infants sufficiently developed to be cognitively evaluated, cognitively disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1). \u201cOnce the presumption applies, the burden of proof shifts to the party opposing the presumption to disprove elements two and four[, as listed in Part II above], and thereby establish \u2018that the injuries alleged are not birth-related neurological injuries within the meaning of the chapter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. at 273, 590 S.E.2d at 636 (quoting <em>Wolfe, </em>40 Va.App. at 578, 580 S.E.2d at 474 and Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>On its review, the commission ruled that the deputy commissioner \u201cconcluded that the medical evidence predominated in establishing that the presumption provided in Code \u00a7 38.2-5008 applies to [the infant\u2019s] case and the program has not requested review of that finding.\u201d Credible evidence in the record supports this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The deputy commissioner found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">after considering the three volumes of medical records plus all of the expert medical opinions ..., that the infant is entitled to the rebuttable presumption that her injury as alleged is a birth-related neurological injury caused by oxygen deprivation ...[,] that the infant is both developmentally and cognitively disabled ... [, and that the] physicians and hospital also participated in the Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The deputy commissioner expressly relied upon the opinions of Drs. VanDorsten, Latimer, Lefton, and Hermansen to support these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">On the commission\u2019s review, the Program asserted in its written statement that the deputy commissioner\u2019s \u201cruling is consistent with and founded upon a correct application of the law and ... credible evidence.\u201d The Program\u2019s written statement concluded \u201cthat the rulings of [the deputy commissioner] ... should be sustained and affirmed in full.\u201d This unambiguous, express language in the Program\u2019s written statement supports the commission\u2019s finding that the issue of the infant\u2019s entitlement to the rebuttable presumption was not raised by the Program at the commission\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Rule 5A:18 bars our review of issues that were not put \u201cbefore the commission on review in [the party\u2019s] written statement or its reply to the [other party\u2019s] written statement ... [and that were] not considered by the full commission.\u201d <em>Berner v. Mills, </em>38 Va.App. 11, 18, 560 S.E.2d 925, 928 (2002). <em>See also Williams v. Gloucester Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>266 Va. 409, 411, 587 S.E.2d 546, 548 (2003) (noting that parties may raise issues before the commission by motions to reconsider); <em>Overhead Door Co. of Norfolk v. Lewis, </em>29 Va.App. 52, 62, 509 S.E.2d 535, 539-40 (1999) (same); <em>Steadman v. Liberty Fab</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>rics, Inc., </em>41 Va.App. 796, 806 n. 3, 589 S.E.2d 465, 467 n. 3 (2003) (noting failure of the party to appeal an issue decided adversely by the deputy commissioner and declining to consider that issue on appeal because it was not addressed by the commission on review). We hold that credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s finding that the Program did not present for review the deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling that the evidence was sufficient to entitle the infant to the Code \u00a7 38.2-5008 presumption. Accordingly, this issue is not properly preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The Program also contends the commission erred in concluding the evidence was \u201cinsufficient to defeat the presumption set forth in ... Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1).\u201d The Program argues that (1) the physicians the commission relied upon were not the most qualified to evaluate the timing of the injury, (2) the opinions expressed by the medical panel and Dr. Christmas were sufficient to prove the injury did not occur during delivery or resuscitation in the immediate post-delivery period, and (3) the evidence was sufficient to prove a specific non-birth-related cause of the infant\u2019s injury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The Act provides that \u201c[t]he determination of the Commission pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 38.2-5008[(A)(1) through (A)(3)] ..., or a determination or award of the Commission upon ... review [of the evidence], as provided in [Code] \u00a7 38.2-5010, shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5011. On appeal from the commission\u2019s review of the evidence and from its decision under the Act, we apply our usual standard of review and consider the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. at 269, 590 S.E.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The Program contends the commission\u2019s decision is flawed because the commission \u201cerred in concluding that certain medical experts are the most qualified to evaluate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>timing of the injury ... based solely on their stated occupations or specialities.\u201d Essentially, the Program contends we should overturn the commission\u2019s finding that the injury occurred at the time of the birth because the Program\u2019s expert was more qualified to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Resolving the conflicting testimony of the physicians, the commission made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Of the physicians who have offered expert opinions in this case, we conclude that Drs. Hermansen and Latimer are the most qualified to evaluate the timing of the injury causing [the infant\u2019s] cerebral palsy. Dr. Hermansen is a pediatrician who specializes in neonatology and Dr. Latimer is a neurologist specializing in treating children. In contrast, Drs. Christmas, VanDorsten and the members of the [medical panel] are obstetricians, gynecologists and specialists in maternal-fetal medicine who, although involved in high-risk pregnancies involving mothers and fetuses, do not regularly treat infants after their birth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">On appeal, we are guided by the statutory mandate of Code \u00a7 38.2-5011 and well-settled principles. The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he Commission\u2019s factual findings are \u2018conclusive and binding\u2019 and a question raised by \u2018conflicting expert medical opinions\u2019 is \u2018one of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eccon Const. Co. v. Lucas, </em>221 Va. 786, 790, 273 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1981) (citations omitted). In other words, the commission is to decide the \u201cprobative weight\u201d to be given to conflicting medical evidence. <em>C.D.S. Const. Services v. Petrock, </em>218 Va. 1064, 1071, 243 S.E.2d 236, 241 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">We have applied these same principles in appeals concerning the commission\u2019s consideration of conflicting medical opinions when resolving issues arising under the Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">\u201cQuestions raised by conflicting medical opinions must be decided by the commission.\u201d This appellate deference is not a mere legal custom, subject to a flexible application, but a statutory command making clear that the commission\u2019s decision \u201cshall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Medical evidence, therefore, remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201csubject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d And the appearance of \u201ccontrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. at 279, 590 S.E.2d at 639 (citations omitted). <em>See also Kidder v. Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Pgm., </em>37 Va.App. 764, 778, 560 S.E.2d 907, 913 (2002); <em>Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Pgm. v. Young, </em>34 Va.App. 306, 318, 541 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The commission reviewed the evidence, the qualifications of the physicians, and the areas of conflict among the physicians. The commission did not conclude that the Program\u2019s experts were incredible but, rather, found the opinions of the other physicians to be more persuasive. We cannot say that the commission erred by giving more weight to the opinions of those physicians who specialize in neonatology and pediatric neurology. As we and the Supreme Court have often explained, \u201c[t]he deference that we give to the commission\u2019s fact finding on medical questions is based upon the \u2018unwisdom of an attempt by ... [courts] uninitiated into the mysteries [of the medical science debate] to choose between conflicting expert medical opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stancill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>15 Va.App. 54, 58, 421 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1992) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Capitol Hotel, Inc., </em>189 Va. 585, 590, 54 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1949)). <em>See also Amelia Sand Co. v. Ellyson, </em>43 Va.App. 406, 409, 598 S.E.2d 750, 751 (2004). We, therefore, decline the Program\u2019s invitation to consider the institutions from which the physicians graduated and received their training as a basis for concluding the commission should have given the testimony of other, physicians greater weight. We hold that the commission thoroughly examined the evidence and made a factual determination that is supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The Program contends the commission \u201cerred in concluding that the opinions ... by the [medical panel] and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Christmas regarding the timing of the injury ... were insufficient to defeat the presumption.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u201c[T]o defeat the Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1) presumption, the Program must prove, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty both (1) that the [infant\u2019s] ... injury did not occur \u2018in the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation in the immediate post-delivery period in a hospital\u2019 and (2) that there was a specific, non-birth-related cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Coffey v. Va. Birth-Related Neur. Injury Comp. Pgm., </em>37 Va.App. 390, 402, 558 S.E.2d 563, 569 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cThe determination whether the employer has [rebutted the presumption and carried its burden of proof] is made by the Commission after exercising its role as finder of fact. In this role, the Commission resolves all conflicts in the evidence and determines the weight to be accorded the various evidentiary submissions. \u2018The award of the Commission ... shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\"><em>Young, </em>34 Va.App. at 317, 541 S.E.2d at 304 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The commission made extensive findings supporting its conclusion that the Program failed to rebut the presumption contained in Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1). We relate in detail a portion of those findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">Of the physicians who have offered expert opinions in this case, we conclude that Drs. Hermansen and Latimer are the most qualified to evaluate the timing of the injury causing [the infant\u2019s] cerebral palsy----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">Both Dr. Hermansen and Dr. Latimer have opined that the damage to [the infant\u2019s] brain was caused near the time of her birth, and we find their opinions to be persuasive. We also disagree with the [deputy commissioner\u2019s] conclusion that there is no objective evidence supporting the opinions of Drs. Hermansen and Latimer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">[The infant\u2019s] medical records immediately after her birth show that she displayed no respirations prompting those who were treating her to intubate immediately. A chest x~ ray was taken showing \u201cwhiteout lungs\u201d and [the infant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>was diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome and hylan membrane disease, causing her to be placed on mechanical ventilation for a significant period of time while she was in NICU. It is also undisputed that hylan membrane disease interferes with the delivery of oxygen to the body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">Although [the infant\u2019s] initial blood gas levels were read as normal, these levels were taken <em>after </em>[she] had been given oxygen. The medical records also reflect that [the infant] was treated for metabolic acidosis within the first day of her life, despite her base excess level of -9.5 falling within the \u201cnormal\u201d range for a full term infant, thereby supporting Dr. Hermansen\u2019s conclusion that [the infant] had at least some level of metabolic acidosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">In addition, [the infant\u2019s] medical records show that she suffered from hypotension at birth and for several days thereafter. Dr. Latimer explained that such hypotension is \u201ccommonly known\u201d to cause PVL and PVL is known to cause cerebral palsy. Dr. Christmas agreed while testifying that hypotension can injure the brain and cause PVL in preterm infants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">Furthermore, as noted by Dr. Hermansen, [the infant\u2019s] head ultrasound performed on September 4, 1999, and reviewed by Dr. Lefton, a neuroradiologist, showed evidence of a cerebral edema soon after [the infant\u2019s] birth, thereby supporting the conclusion that [the infant] had sustained a recent brain injury. The lack of PVL on [the infant\u2019s] first ultrasound constitutes additional evidence that her brain injury did not occur long before her birth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">Upon our Review of the medical records in their entirety and our Review of the various opinions expressed by experts in this case, we conclude that the evidence with respect to the timing of the oxygen deprivation causing the injury to [the infant\u2019s] brain is, at most, equipoise. Therefore, while we do not ignore the opinions expressed by the [medical panel] and Dr. Christmas, we conclude that their opinions are insufficient, in light of the contrary opinions expressed by Drs. Hermansen and Latimer, as buttressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>by Drs. Lefton and VanDorsten, to defeat the presumption of Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The Program challenges these findings and contends there was \u201cno evidence of metabolic acidosis or [edema] in the medical records and no specific reference to an hypoxic event during the statutory period.\u201d We disagree. Simply put, the Program asks us to reweigh the evidence, contrary to our standard of review, and find in its favor. As we have consistently held in reviewing decisions under the Act, \u201cthe appearance of \u2018contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. at 279, 590 S.E.2d at 639 (quoting <em>Young, </em>34 Va.App. at 318, 541 S.E.2d at 304, and <em>Kidder, </em>37 Va.App. at 778, 560 S.E.2d at 913). A review of the record demonstrates substantial credible evidence supporting the commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Significantly, the commission gave thorough and reasoned consideration to the contrary opinions of the Program\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Christmas, when it made its decision. To take one example, Dr. Christmas recognized the possibility of edema, testifying that \u201cthere is allegedly edema noted on the first scan and two weeks later there\u2019s not any edema so ... it must have been very mild edema noted on the first exam if, in fact, there was any edema.\u201d Reviewing his testimony, the commission found that Dr. Christmas merely \u201cspeculated that the cerebral edema shown on the first ultrasound must have been fairly small\u201d and noted that \u201cDr. Christmas did not actually review the ultrasounds.\u201d The commission further noted that Dr. Christmas \u201calso deferred to a radiologist regarding what [the ultrasounds] actually showed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The commission gave greater weight to the opinion of Dr. Daniel Lefton, a board certified radiologist who also has a qualification in neuroradiology. Unlike Dr. Christmas, Dr. Lefton actually examined the ultrasounds. He reported \u201c[t]o a reasonable degree of medical certainty [the infant\u2019s] brain injury (PVL) resulted from a hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>during the immediate delivery and resuscitation period.\u201d In support of his conclusion, he noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">Both of the MRI studies show clear evidence of periventricular leukomalacia (FVL): an hypoxic ischemic injury to the white matter of the brain surrounding the ventricles. This neuroradiologic finding is typically found in premature infants requiring resuscitation and mechanical ventilation at the time of delivery----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">The September 4, 1999, head ultrasound performed on day two of life is strongly consistent with the opinions expressed above, and further confirms that [the infant\u2019s] injury occurred at or about the time of delivery. The films from this study show increased echogenicity, or \u201ccerebral edema.\u201d The finding of cerebral edema on ultrasound is an early radiologic manifestation of an hypoxic ischemic injury that is later manifested as FVL. PVL is not usually seen radiographically until about two weeks after the hypoxic/isehemic event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">In conclusion, these three studies demonstrate that [the infant] suffered a brain injury to the periventricular white matter from lack of oxygen or blood supply at or around the time of birth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In contrast to Dr. Christmas\u2019s conclusion that the edema must have been mild, Dr. M. Elizabeth Latimer, a board certified child neurologist who examined the infant and reviewed the medical records, reported the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">[The infant] did have an ultrasound done on day 2 of life which showed no hemorrhage but did show cerebral edema. This was not reported at the time of exam, most likely because the primary focus of the initial exam was to rule out intraventricular hemorrhage. On the subsequent exams in the NICU, [the infant] had resolution of the cerebral edema which clearly times the cerebral insult to the immediate perinatal period. Additionally, there is no evidence of periventricular leukomalacia on the initial exam. The absence of the appearance of periventricular leukomalacia makes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>highly unlikely that the injury occurred significantly prior to delivery----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">With regard to imaging studies, she had an MRI done ... at age one which although read as normal, clearly was not. This MRI definitely demonstrates Periventricular Leukomalacia. This finding is highly significant because it is seen primarily in premature infants who also have either hypoxemia or hypotension during the immediate perinatal period. This area of the brain in premature infants is extremely vulnerable to low flow states, such as low blood pressures, which [the infant] sustained during the immediate resuscitation period following delivery. The reason for this is because premature babies delivered prior to 32 weeks gestation lack autoregulation.... In the premature infant, there is no autoregulation so when the blood pressure drops, the blood flow to the brain drops accordingly. The vulnerable portion of the brain, the periventricular region is the most vulnerable and in this case the most damaged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\"># ^ * sH tfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">In summary, [the infant] has a Permanent Neurologic Injury caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, which is severe and is temporally related to the immediate period following her premature birth. She had profound hypotension at birth which was documented and treated in the records. It is commonly known that such hypotension at this stage of prematurity causes Periventricular Leukomalacia. She is permanently disabled with no hope of meaningful recovery. She is likely to never walk independently. She is most likely, at best, to have an IQ of 25-50, and will never be employable. She will require assistance with all activities of daily living for her entire life and is expected to have a normal life span.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Dr. Marcus Hermansen, a board certified pediatrician and neonatologist also reviewed the medical records and Dr. Lefton\u2019s report. He opined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">PVL is a form of ischemic (inadequate blood flow) brain injury seen most commonly in premature infants. [The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>infant\u2019s] PVL occurred around the time of her birth. This timing is based upon her critical condition at birth and in the immediate post-birth period and the cerebral edema on the head ultrasound study at two days of age. Immediately after her birth she had no respiratory effort followed by severe respiratory distress. She also had a metabolic acidemia and severe hypotension. All of these clinical observations demonstrate evidence of brain ischemia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">Cerebral edema is seen on neuro-imaging studies for a few days following significant brain injury. The typical changes of PVL are seen weeks or months later. The presence of cerebral edema on September 4, 1999 is strong evidence of recent brain injury. In addition, the lack of PVL on the initial ultrasound is strong evidence that the brain injury did not occur long before the birth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The record likewise contains evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding, which is contested by the Program, that at birth the infant \u201cdisplayed no respiration prompting those who were treating her to intubate immediately.\u201d Dr. James VanDorsten, who is board certified in maternal fetal medicine and is chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at a medical university, testified that the infant had hypotension in the immediate post-delivery period, that the infant \u201cwas not breathing at all\u201d at birth, and that this \u201crequired an intervention, an intubation.\u201d He opined that \u201c[i]ntubation at less than a minute by experienced neonatologists ... would be unusual.\u201d That is, the physicians would not have intubated so quickly had the infant not been in serious respiratory distress. He also testified that the infant \u201chad acidosis in the first day of life that required treatment with bicarbonate,\u201d which was another indication that the infant did not receive adequate oxygen, resulting in her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">This is the evidence the commission found to be persuasive. These reports refute the Program\u2019s suggestion that the commission\u2019s findings lacked credible evidentiary support. As the Supreme Court has consistently held, a \u201cfinding of the Commission upon conflicting medical testimony that a condition ... was due to [one cause] rather than to [another cause] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>... a finding of fact\u201d and is conclusive and binding on appeal. <em>Johnson, </em>189 Va. at 588, 54 S.E.2d at 107-08 (citing <em>Estep v. Blackwood Fuel Co., </em>185 Va. 695, 699, 40 S.E.2d 181, 183 (1946), and <em>Mulkey v. Firth Bros. Iron Works, </em>188 Va. 451, 455, 50 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The Program argues that the commission \u201cerred as a matter of law in finding the evidence to be in equipoise\u201d when its expert and the medical panel gave opinions \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d This argument about \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d was not posed as a question presented for review but, rather, is raised merely in the context of suggesting that the commission gave the opinions of various physicians undue weight. Significantly, the Program does not contend that the medical evidence the commission considered was not credible. As we explained in <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Robinson, </em>32 Va.App. 1, 526 S.E.2d 267 (2000), the commission determines which medical evidence is credible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">Applying equally well-settled principles, the Supreme Court has held that the \u201cquestion [of causation] raised by \u2018conflicting expert medical opinions\u2019 is one of fact.\u201d <em>Eccon Constr. Co. v. Lucas, </em>221 Va. 786, 790, 273 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1981). Thus, the commission\u2019s \u201cfinding upon conflicting medical evidence that a certain condition does or does not exist is ... a conclusive finding of fact.\u201d <em>McPeek v. P.W. &amp; </em>W. <em>Coal Co., </em>210 Va. 185, 188, 169 S.E.2d 443, 445 (1969). \u201cThe deference that we give to the commission\u2019s fact finding on medical questions is based upon the \u2018unwisdom of an attempt by ... [courts] uninitiated into the mysteries [of the medical science debate] to choose between conflicting expert medical opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stancill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>15 Va.App. 54, 58, 421 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1992) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6T\"><em>Robinson, </em>32 Va.App. at 5, 526 S.E.2d at 268-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Furthermore, the suggestion that the other evidence was \u201cnot equal\u201d to the Program\u2019s evidence lacks merit. When asked whether he rendered his opinions \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d Dr. VanDorsten expressly testified, \u201cI do.\u201d The record also indicates Dr. Lefton asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>that he \u201ch[e]ld the opinions [he has] stated ... to a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d Dr. Hermansen likewise stated that his \u201copinions are expressed to a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d Although Dr. Latimer did not couch her opinion in those express terms, her report contains no expressions of uncertainty or speculation. Her report, which we have quoted in detail earlier in this opinion, is prefaced with the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">I am a Board Certified Child Neurologist. It is within the scope of my training and practice to evaluate and treat neonates in the intensive care nursery who have sustained neurologic injury. It is also within my scope of practice to determine timing and causation of injury and routine to read radiologic studies on these patients. I have reviewed prenatal and delivery records of Michele Bakke, neonatal intensive care unit ... records on [the infant], films of ultrasound studies performed on [the infant] ..., MRI studies ..., and subsequent records of her treating physicians and healthcare providers. In addition, I examined [the infant] in my office on July 16, 2003. In this light these are my findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Dr. Latimer\u2019s report was competent medical evidence that the commission weighed with other medical evidence and accepted as persuasive. When a physician\u2019s opinion is certain and accepted by the commission, this Court \u201cwill not substitute form over substance by requiring a physician to use the magic words \u2018to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 11-12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988). Indeed, in <em>Lindenfeld v. City of Richmond Sheriff's Office, </em>25 Va.App. 775, 492 S.E.2d 506 (1997), we affirmed the commission\u2019s decision to deny benefits to a claimant who suffered from tuberculosis, which he alleged he contracted while working at the jail. The record contained the opinions of three physicians regarding the causation of the disease, only one of which was an opinion \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty that [the] claimant contracted tuberculosis while working in the jail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781, 492 S.E.2d at 509. Noting that the commission found more persuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the opinion of the two physicians who did not use these words, we held that \u201cthe commission, as the trier of fact,\u201d was permitted \u201cto assign ... little weight\u201d to the opinion of the other physician in resolving the claim under Code \u00a7 65.2-401. <em>Id. </em>at 786, 492 S.E.2d at 512. Since our decision in <em>Bindenfeld, </em>the legislature has amended Code \u00a7 65.2-401 to delete the requirement to prove the evidence \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Simply put, the Program presents a view of the evidence consistent solely with the testimony and reports of those physicians the commission found to be less persuasive. The fallacy in the Program\u2019s analysis is demonstrated by its argument that \u201c[b]ecause the Full Commission made no assertion that [the deputy commissioner\u2019s] determinations of fact were plainly wrong, the Full Commission\u2019s reversal of those factual findings was arbitrary and capricious and erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d It is well settled that the commission is the finder of fact. When the commission \u201carticulate[s] a basis for its conclusion ... that ... is supported by credible evidence in the record,\u201d we are bound by its finding, not a contrary one made by the deputy commissioner. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>9 Va.App. 120, 127, 384 S.E.2d 333, 337 (1989). <em>See also Grayson County School Bd. v. Cornett, </em>39 Va.App. 279, 286 n. 2, 572 S.E.2d 505, 508 n. 2 (2002); <em>Lanning v. Va.

Auto Brokers, </em>6 Va.App. 570, 573-74, 370 S.E.2d 321, 323-24 (1988). Even in cases, unlike this one, where the deputy commissioner makes credibility findings based on a witness\u2019 demeanor, that finding is not unreviewable by the commission. <em>Lane, </em>14 Va.App. at 729, 418 S.E.2d at 907. By statute, a request for review empowers the commission to consider the case <em>de novo. </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-705.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We hold, therefore, that credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that the Program failed to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Although unnecessary in light of our holding, we address for completeness the Program\u2019s contention that the evidence \u201cestablished by a preponderance that uteroplacental insufficiency was the specific non-birth related cause of this infant\u2019s cerebral palsy.\u201d It argues that Dr. Christmas\u2019s testimony and the other medical evidence support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The commission specifically addressed this aspect of Dr. Christmas\u2019s testimony. It found that \u201c[a]lthough Dr. Christmas opined that [the infant] suffered a hypoxemic event resulting from uteroplacental insufficient and resulting in PVL, he acknowledged that there was no evidence based on fetal monitor tracings showing that [she] suffered a neurologic injury before her birth.\u201d The commission also noted that Dr. Christmas \u201cagreed that there was no evidence of any acute trauma or infection in the uterus during ... Bakke\u2019s pregnancy and could not identify precisely when [the infant\u2019s] injury occurred before her delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">A review of Dr. Christmas\u2019s testimony and the reports supports these findings. In addition, the commission considered and weighed Dr. VanDorsten\u2019s assessment of this specific testimony of Dr. Christmas and his conclusion that Dr. Christmas\u2019s testimony was \u201cway off base.\u201d As we have repeated throughout, \u201c[i]t was peculiarly within the province of the Commission to decide what evidence, if credible, was entitled to greater weight.\u201d <em>McPeek, </em>210 Va. at 188, 169 S.E.2d at 445, and, if a portion of the medical evidence \u201cis in conflict with other medical evidence, the Commission is free to adopt that view \u2018which is most consistent with reason and justice,\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson, </em>32 Va.App. at 5, 526 S.E.2d at 269 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"A70\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>HALEY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aul\">concurring, in part and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\n<em>CONCURRENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">I concur in the majority\u2019s view \u201cthat credible evidence ... supports the commission\u2019s finding that the Program did not present for review the deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling that the evidence was sufficient to entitle the infant to the Code \u00a7 38.2-5008 presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">I respectfully dissent, however, to the majority\u2019s view that the Program failed to rebut the Code \u00a7 38.2-5008 presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">\n<em>THE STATUTE AND THE PRESUMPTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">Succinctly stated, and as here applicable, under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), if an infant suffers \u201c \u2018an injury to the brain\u2019 ... that was \u2018caused by deprivation of oxygen\u2019 \u201d proximately causing permanent damage requiring assistance in daily living, a rebuttable presumption arises that \u201c[t]he injury occurred \u2018in the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation____\u2019\u201d <em>Central Va.

These facts include the following: (1) The infant was born by cesarian section, and accordingly there was no \u201clabor,\u201d as applicable under the statute; (2) a sonogram done at 17 weeks showed the infant to be of normal fetal development and size; (3) after a gestation period of 29 weeks, at birth the infant weighed 1 pound, 14 ounces, which is the 10th percentile of expected weight for the gestational period; (4) \u201cThe infant was noted to cry at the surgical field upon delivery;\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (5) at \u201cone minute of age baby did make some resp[iratory] effort;\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (6) the infant was intubated within one minute of birth; (7) the pathology of the placenta, performed the day following the infant\u2019s birth, showed \u201cinfarction ... increased syncytial knotting ... consistent with chronic utero<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>placental insufficiency;\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (8) the infant had Apgar scores of 5 at one minute and 7 at fifteen minutes;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (9) blood gas analysis within fifteen minutes of birth showed no evidence of hypoxemia<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or metabolic acidosis,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the same analysis two hours following birth had the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\n<em>THE TIMING OF THE DEPRIVATION OF OXYGEN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">As has been noted, the commission found, and this Court has affirmed, that the infant suffered a deprivation of oxygen which resulted in permanent injury. For the Program to rebut the presumption thus arising, it need not establish precisely when that deprivation occurred; rather, it must only establish that it <em>did not occur, </em>in this case, during birth or resuscitation. The timing of this deprivation is accordingly of signal importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">As quoted above by the majority, with respect to timing, the commission rejected the opinion of the Program\u2019s experts and accepted that of the claimants: \u201c[0]f the physicians who have offered expert opinions in this case, we conclude that Drs. Hermansen and Latimer are the most qualified to evaluate the <em>timing </em>of the injury causing the infant\u2019s cerebral palsy____\u201d (Emphasis added). None of claimants\u2019 experts were attending physicians. Their opinions, and those of another claimants\u2019 expert, will be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Dr. Marcus Hermansen\u2019s evidence consisted of a two-page letter dated July 13, 2003. He had reviewed Dr. Daniel Lefton\u2019s letter. He states, in contradiction to the medical records, the infant \u201cimmediately after ... birth had no respiratory effort____\u201d He likewise states, again in contradiction to the medical record: \u201c[The infant] ... had a metabolic acidemia____\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He concurs in Dr. Lefton\u2019s diagnosis of periventricular leukomalicia (PVL).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Dr. M. Elizabeth Latimer\u2019s evidence consisted of a three-page undated letter. She writes that the infant \u201chad no respirations at birth____\u201d She states: \u201cthere is no evidence of periventricular leukomalacia [PVL] on the initial [following birth] exam. The absence of the appearance of ... [PVL] ... makes it <em>highly unlikely </em>that the injury occurred significantly prior to delivery.\u201d (Emphasis added). She makes no mention of the fact that blood gas analysis showed no metabolic acidosis following birth. At no point does she ever state that it is her opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that PVL was the cause of the infant\u2019s ultimate disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Dr. Daniel Lefton\u2019s evidence consisted of a two-page letter dated July 7, 2003 to counsel for claimant. He recites he reviewed only the head ultrasound and MRI studies. He states: <em>\u201cYou </em>have advised me that ... according to the delivery records, at the time of birth [infant] had no respirations.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, he relies upon counsel\u2019s representation, not the medical records, that the infant was not breathing at birth. He neither reviewed, nor was apparently made aware of, the medical records of the blood gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>analysis which showed no hypoxemia or respiratory acidosis. Nevertheless, he finds, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the infant suffered from PVL, resulting from a hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> during birth or resuscitation, justifying compensation under the Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The expert evidence with respect to the timing of the deprivation of oxygen, that is, the opinions of Drs. Hermansen and Latimer, on which the commission specifically relied is, it is respectfully submitted, neither credible nor competent, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Dr. Hermansen bases his opinion on the facts that the infant \u201chad no respiratory effort ...\u201d and \u201chad metabolic acidemia. ...\u201d It is uncontradicted that the attending physician, Dr. Choudhary, heard the infant \u201ccry ... upon delivery____\u201d The immediacy of that medical evidence, by the attending physician, augments its weight. And it is physical evidence. This Court can take judicial notice that sound may not be produced without an airstream.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The uncontradicted medical records show the infant cried, did make respiratory efforts, and did <em>not </em>have metabolic acidosis. Dr. Hermansen concurs in Dr. Lefton\u2019s diagnosis of PVL, but, as noted above, Dr. Lefton did not review the medical records, makes no reference to the lack of metabolic acidosis, and bases his opinion of the representation of claimant\u2019s <em>counsel </em>that the infant \u201cat the time of birth had no respirations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>With respect to the report of Dr. Latimer, her opinion is likewise based upon the purported fact that the infant \u201chad no respirations at birth....\u201d She states that the lack of evidence of PVL on the initial exam \u201cmakes it <em>highly unlikely </em>that the injury occurred <em>significantly </em>prior to birth.... \u201d (Emphasis added). She makes no mention of the absence of metabolic acidosis. She never states her opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cHighly unlikely\u201d is not medical certainty, and the timing question is based upon a deprivation of oxygen during (or subsequent to) birth, not one that may have occurred in a period of time, significant or not, prior to birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Because Dr. Latimer does not state her opinion \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d her opinion is not competent, and fails \u201cas a matter of law\u201d to support the commission\u2019s conclusion as to the timing of the deprivation of oxygen. <em>See Coffey, </em>37 Va.App. at 402, 558 S.E.2d at 569. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The Virginia Supreme Court has previously stated that expert opinions which are \u201cnot stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability\u201d are \u201cspeculative in nature and inadmissible.\u201d <em>Pettus, </em>269 Va. at 78, 606 S.E.2d at 825. Evidence of such a speculative nature, when contradicted by other factual evidence or expert opinions which are stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability, is not, it is submitted, credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Though not specifically relied upon by the commission in its determination of the timing of the deprivation of oxygen, Dr. James Peter VanDorsten, likewise not an attending physician, testified before the deputy commissioner on behalf of the claimant. Excerpts from his testimony include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZh\">I construed the record to present a baby that was apniac, that was not breathing at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">Q. A large part of your opinions are based upon the belief that this child had no signs of any respiratory effort. Correct? That is your belief?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">A. That is what the record reflects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">Q. During the prenatal period was there any evidence of any significant growth restriction prior to delivery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">A. There was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">Q. ... You\u2019ve seen the blood gas results, and you know this baby had oxygen through intubation within a minute of birth. So it\u2019s not your opinion that this baby was not well oxygenated, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">A. Oh, it\u2019s my opinion the baby <em>probably </em>was not well oxygenated in the early going. I mean it wasn\u2019t breathing at all____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">Finally, in his testimony, Dr. VanDorsten re-affirms an opinion stated in his April 10, 2003 letter: \u201c[I]t is my opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that prematurity is the cause of [the infant\u2019s] cerebral palsy----This child\u2019s cerebral palsy is the direct result of her unavoidable prematurity, i.e., delivery at 29 weeks gestation.\u201d In this letter Dr. VanDorsten makes no reference whatsoever to a deprivation of oxygen.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Dr. VanDorsten\u2019s testimony is not credible because it is based upon a fact <em>not </em>supported by the medical records, including that of the attending physician, that is, the infant made no respiratory effort and was not breathing at all. With respect to the signal issue of the timing of the oxygen deprivation, Dr. VanDorsten, as quoted above, says the infant was probably not well oxygenated. For this doctor to conclude that an infant with normal size and development at 17 weeks, and bom at 29 weeks weighing less than 10% of normal weight, showed no signs of prenatal growth restriction, is incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">With the above summary of the claimant\u2019s evidence as to timing, we turn to that relied upon by the Program. As noted above in Part II of this dissent, to rebut the Code \u00a7 38.2-5008 presumption, the Program must first establish that the infant\u2019s deprivation of oxygen did not occur, as here relevant, during birth or immediate attempts to resuscitate.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-5008, the infant\u2019s claim was \u201creviewed by a panel of three qualified and impartial physicians.\u201d With respect to the timing of the deprivation of oxygen, in a letter dated June 9, 2003, the independent panel concluded: \u201cNo evidence of such deprivation of oxygen during the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>quired perinatal period is contained in these records.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Testifying on behalf of the Program was Dr. James Christmas.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> His testimony, succinctly stated, establishes that deprivation of oxygen necessarily causes measurable metabolic acidosis, and, of critical import, evidence of that acidosis will not be dissipated for <em>hours </em>following the deprivation. As Dr. Christmas explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Well, when we breathe, when our cells breathe, when we at the cellular level do the things that we need to do to survive, cells burn glucose, and they burn glucose really efficiently. They burn it to carbon dioxide, which we then exhale and breathe off. When we are forced because of a lack of oxygen, we ourselves still need to make energy, and if they don\u2019t have oxygen available to them, they burn acids to make energy, and those\u2014the production of energy from acids is incredibly inefficient and it results in the byproduct or the end product of that process is very large fixed acids that are 8, 6, and 12 carbon acid molecules, and those molecules don\u2019t cross the pulmonary capillaries, and so they build up in the blood stream, and ultimately they have to be metabolized by the liver and the kidneys before they can be cleared. So whether you\u2019re a newborn or an infant or a fetus or an adult, if you develop a large metabolic acidosis from decreased\u2014from insufficient oxygen, then that metabolic acidosis will take several to many hours to completely clear because those acids have to be metabolized back down created ultimately to carbon dioxide and then cleared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In accordance with the finding of the medical panel, Dr. Christmas testified that the infant \u201chad blood gas that demonstrated normal oxygenation ... and no evidence of a recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>metabolic acidosis, and when I say recent, I would say within several hours.\u201d Likewise, he concluded: \u201cIn looking at the medical record there\u2019s no evidence of any sustained oxygen deprivation____There is zero evidence of oxygen deprivation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Also introduced into evidence before the deputy commissioner was a Report of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics entitled <em>Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy </em>(\u201cthe Report\u201d). With respect to neonatal encephalopathy, the Report states: \u201cThe criteria to define an acute intrapartum<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> event sufficient to cause cerebral palsy ... [includes the following] ... Essential criteria (must meet all four). 1. Evidence of a metabolic acidosis in fetal umbilical cord blood obtained at delivery____\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Footnotes added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Finally, a finding of metabolic acidosis has been a pinion fact upon which this Court has relied in determining the timing of deprivation of oxygen. \u201cAt two minutes of life [infant\u2019s] arterial chord blood gases were critically low. They remained low for almost two hours after his birth.\u201d <em>Coffey, </em>37 Va.App. at 394, 558 S.E.2d at 565. \u201c[Infant\u2019s] arterial blood gases were not satisfactory.\u201d <em>Va.

It was the Program\u2019s position, and one with which the deputy commissioner agreed, that the <em>cause </em>of that deprivation was uteroplacental insufficiency. As Dr. Christmas explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">Q. So then have you formed an opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the actual cause of [infant\u2019s] condition today would have been \u00fatero ... A. Uteroplacental insuffiency.... I actually suspect that there was a specific ischemic event at some point or a hypoprofusion or a hypoxemic event.... That would be very common in a growth retarded fetus because a growth retarded fetus doesn\u2019t have any other reserves that a term fetus has. So if a baby\u2019s oxygen requirements\u2014a baby\u2019s oxygen requirements are here and a normal baby has oxygen levels, a normal fetus has oxygen levels up here, that\u2019s no big deal. Little things happen in \u00fatero all the time and it never gets down to a threshold level where it\u2019s going to cause any damage. Well, the growth-retarded fetus by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>very definition is operating right at its threshold. So the little things that happen to a baby in \u00fatero all of a sudden become really important events. The periods of time when a fetus rolls over and compresses its umbilical cord for three minutes. For the normal term baby, I mean the normal appropriately grown baby that\u2019s got a huge placental reserve, that\u2019s no big deal. To the fetus that\u2019s operating right on the edge, that\u2019s a huge deal. So if you were to say, well, you think ischemia could be part of the picture, well, yeah. I mean because that\u2019s all part of the whole sort of process of uteroplacental insufficiency. But there\u2019s every evidence that that ended at delivery. It didn\u2019t start at delivery. There\u2019s every evidence that it probably ended many hours before delivery as far as the acute event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Dr. Christmas continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">I think that prematurity is the single leading risk factor for periventricular leukomalacia [(PVL)] in the general population as well as in any specific fetus. A preterm delivery complicated by a small for gestational age fetus is at a significantly higher risk of periventricular leukomalacia than is an appropriately grown preterm fetus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">As noted above, claimant\u2019s expert, Dr. VanDorsten, in his opinion letter of April 10, 2003, does not mention a deprivation of oxygen, but writes, in accordance with Dr. Christmas\u2019s view: \u201c[I]t is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that prematurity is the cause of [the infant\u2019s] cerebral palsy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">It is uncontradicted that the infant had normal development at 17 weeks gestation and at birth weighed in the 10th percentile of an infant born at 29 weeks. It is clear that an event or condition adverse to the fetus occurred in that time period. It is uncontradicted that the pathology of the placenta showed \u201cinfarction ... increased syncytial knotting ... consistent with chronic uteroplacental insufficiency.\u201d This Court has specifically noted the significance of evidence of uteroplacental insufficiency in birth-related cases. \u201cThe records also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>revealed no evidence of utero-placental insufficiency or cord compression.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>40 Va.App. at 571, 580 S.E.2d at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Assuming the infant did have PVL, the rational conclusion, based upon the credible and competent evidence, is that the condition was caused by uteroplacental insufficiency, not by a deprivation of oxygen during birth or immediate attempts to resuscitate. Accordingly, it is submitted, the Program has established a non-birth-related cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">For the above reasons, I believe the Program has met the burden of meeting both prongs necessary to rebut the presumption arising from Code \u00a7 38.2-5008. I would reverse the commission and uphold the opinion of the deputy commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">In <em>Meador v. Va. Neuro. Birth-Related Injury and Comp. Program, 44 </em>Va.App. 149, 604 S.E.2d 88 (2004), this Court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision that the Act did not apply to a birth at home.

Such speculation has no bearing on a case when actual evidence, taken only minutes later, contradicts it. This Court has previously declined to presume the results of a test for metabolic acidosis that was not performed, absent negligent or intentional failure by the medical professionals present to perform such a test. <em>Wolfe, </em>40 Va.App. at 585, 580 S.E.2d at 477.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">.

It should also be noted that this Court has consistently relied upon Apgar scores for timing determinations in birth-related cases.
