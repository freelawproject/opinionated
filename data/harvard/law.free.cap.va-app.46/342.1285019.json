Lynch (\u201cLynch\u201d) appeals his convictions, following a jury trial, for first-degree murder, statutory burglary, robbery, and three counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony. On appeal, Lynch contends that the trial court erroneously admitted an out-of-court statement under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule. For the reasons that follow, we disagree, and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Gonzales v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 375, 378, 611 S.E.2d 616, 617 (2005) (en banc). So viewed, the evidence in this case establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">On June 9, 2001, Belinda Scott was shot and killed inside her home by Lynch, \u201cTyreke\u201d Williams, and a third, unidentified man. After the shooting, Lynch and Tyreke \u201cburst\u201d into a bedroom occupied by Belinda\u2019s son, Ronald, and his friend, Tamika Reid. The third man remained outside the bedroom door. Tyreke told Ronald to \u201cget on his knees,\u201d pointed a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>at him, and told Tamika \u201cnot to move.\u201d Tyreke then repeatedly hit Ronald on the head with the gun and took some money out of Ronald\u2019s pockets, while Lynch removed heroin and money from a table in the room. The third man eventually told Tyreke and Lynch, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d The three men then \u201cran out of the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Earlier that afternoon, Kenneth Parker was \u201changing out\u201d at Tyreke\u2019s house with Christopher, Tyreke\u2019s brother. Kenneth saw Lynch drive up to the house in a black Acura. Tyreke was in the passenger seat. Lynch got out of the car to talk to Christopher, and Tyreke went across the street to get a gun. After he returned, Tyreke agreed to give Kenneth a ride home. Kenneth then got into the Acura with Lynch, Tyreke, and the unidentified third man. However, when Kenneth said that he needed to cross the Campostella Bridge, Lynch told him that they were going on a \u201csting,\u201d and they needed to \u201ctake care of [that] first.\u201d Thus, Kenneth got out of the car, and Lynch told him that they would return in about thirty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">When the three men returned to Tyreke\u2019s house, Kenneth noticed that Tyreke was wearing a different shirt and had small bloodstains on his clothing. Tyreke carried something into his house wrapped up in the shirt he had been wearing before the murder. Kenneth followed. After entering the house, Tyreke went directly to an upstairs bathroom, and Kenneth sat in the upstairs den. Lynch did not enter the house immediately, but remained in the driveway speaking to the third man, who was \u201clooking down at the ground like something was really bothering him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">When Tyreke left the bathroom, he knocked on Christopher\u2019s door and told him that \u201cthey had just shot a woman.\u201d Kenneth joined the conversation and asked Tyreke, \u201cman, what you done got yourself into? You-all done shot a woman?\u201d Tyreke responded, \u201cyeah.\u201d Kenneth asked, \u201cwhere was you-all at?\u201d Tyreke responded, \u201cwe went to Little Ronald\u2019s house ... to go get him.\u201d Kenneth then asked, \u201cwhy would you-all go in and try to do something and rob him or whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>when he cool with everybody?\u201d Tyreke then said that he \u201cdon\u2019t care who I get\u201d because \u201c[m]y light\u2019s due, my rent due, my girl getting ready to leave,\u201d and he was \u201cgoing to get put out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As Kenneth, Christopher, and Tyreke were discussing whether the \u201cskinny lady\u201d who had been shot was Ronald\u2019s mother or sister, Kenneth heard someone climbing the stairs. As Lynch reached the top of the stairs, he asked Tyreke \u201cwhy he was telling [Kenneth and Christopher] what they had just done.\u201d Although Tyreke told Lynch that Kenneth was \u201ccool\u201d and would not tell anyone, Kenneth said he would have \u201cnothing to do with it,\u201d and left the house. Kenneth called Ronald\u2019s cellular phone and spoke with Tamika, who was still hysterical over the events she had just witnessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">On September 5, 2001, a grand jury indicted Lynch for \u201cfeloniously [ ] killing] and murder[ing] Belinda Scott,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-32 and 18.2-10, \u201cus[ing], attempting] to use, or displaying] a firearm while committing ... [m]urder,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, \u201cbreaking] and entering] in the nighttime while armed with a deadly weapon, the dwelling house of Belinda Scott, with intent to commit robbery,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-90, \u201cus[ing], attempting] to use, or displaying] a firearm while committing ... [a]rmed [bjurglary,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, \u201crob[bing] Ronald Scott of U.S. currency, having some value,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, and, \u201cus[ing], attempting] to use, or displaying] a firearm while committing ... [r]obbery,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Before Kenneth testified at trial, the Commonwealth informed the court that it intended to introduce the statement, \u201cWhy you telling them what we just did?\u201d under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule. The parties \u201cargued the matter in chambers,\u201d and, based on the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer, the court ruled that the statement was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The jury found Lynch guilty of all six counts as charged in the indictments, and the court sentenced Lynch, in accordance with the jury\u2019s recommendation, to thirty years for first-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>degree murder, twenty years for statutory burglary, five years for robbery, five years for use of a firearm while committing murder, five years for use of a firearm while committing robbery, and three years for use of a firearm while committing burglary. The court set the sentences to run consecutively, resulting in a total active sentence of sixty-eight years in prison. Lynch appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">On appeal, Lynch contends that the trial court erroneously admitted the statement, \u201cWhy you telling them what we just did?\u201d coupled with the substance of the preceding conversation between Kenneth, Tyreke, and Christopher, under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule, reasoning that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that Lynch had overheard enough of the conversation to understand what was being discussed. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u201c \u2018The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>45 Va.App. at 380, 611 S.E.2d at 618 (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)). \u201cHowever, \u2018by definition, when the trial court makes an error of law, an abuse of discretion occurs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 373, 382, 523 S.E.2d 534, 539 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Hearsay evidence is inadmissible unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 96, 104, 531 S.E.2d 623, 626-27 (2000) (en banc); <em>see also West v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 906, 909, 407 S.E.2d 22, 23 (1991). And, if the admissibility of a hearsay statement is conditioned upon a finding of certain predicate facts, the party seeking to admit the hearsay evidence must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, each of those qualifying factors. <em>See Rabeiro v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 61, 64-65, 389 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1990) (\u201cOn factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>issues relating to the admissibility of evidence, the burden of persuasion is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d); <em>see also Doe v. Thomas, </em>227 Va. 466, 472, 318 S.E.2d 382, 386 (1984) (noting that the party seeking to have a hearsay declaration admitted \u201cmust clearly show\u201d that the evidence falls within an exception to the hearsay rule); <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 416, 420-21, 425 S.E.2d 521, 524 (1992) (\u201c[T]he party seeking to rely upon an exception to the hearsay rule has the burden of establishing admissibility.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These \u201cantecedent facts\u201d must be \u201cdetermined by the court, and not by the jury.\u201d Mullins <em>v. Commonwealth, </em>113 Va. 787, 791, 75 S.E. 193, 195-96 (1912) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Rabeiro, </em>10 Va.App. at 64, 389 S.E.2d at 732 (\u201cThe factual determinations which are necessary predicates to rulings on the admissibility of evidence and the purposes for which it is admitted are for the trial judge and not the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">When deciding whether the proponent of the hearsay statement has sustained his burden of proving the necessary predicate facts, \u201cthe trial court, acting as a fact finder, must evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, resolve the conflicts in their testimony and weigh the evidence as a whole.\u201d <em>Albert v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 734, 738, 347 S.E.2d 534, 536 (1986). Thus, the trial court\u2019s determination that these factual prerequisites have been met \u201c \u2018is to be given the same weight by the appellate court as is accorded the finding of fact by a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Witt v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 670, 674, 212 S.E.2d 293, 296-97 (1975)); <em>see also Rabeiro, </em>10 Va.App. at 64, 389 S.E.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Accordingly, when reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to admit a statement under an exception to the hearsay rule, this Court must first decide whether the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the proponent of the statement established each of the factual prerequisites for application of the designated hearsay exception. If those factual findings are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them, we will reverse the trial court because it abused its discretion, as a matter of law, in determining that the hearsay exception applied. <em>See Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. v. Puryear, </em>250 Va. 559, 563, 463 S.E.2d 442, 444 (1995) (\u201cA trial court has no discretion to admit clearly inadmissible evidence because admissibility of evidence depends not upon the discretion of the court but upon sound legal principles.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). If the trial court\u2019s factual findings are supported by the evidence, this Court must then determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the otherwise admissible hearsay statement. <em>See, e.g., Clay, </em>33 Va.App. at 107, 531 S.E.2d at 628 (after determining that the challenged statement fell within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, noting that \u201c[w]e must now determine whether ... the trial court abused its discretion in judging\u201d that \u201cthe prejudicial effect of such evidence outweighed its probative value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the trial court did not clearly err in holding that the Commonwealth carried its burden of proving the required antecedent facts for application of the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule. And, because Lynch has not advanced any other argument in support of his contention that the trial court erred, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">One of the established exceptions to the hearsay rule permits the introduction of an out-of-court statement that qualifies as an \u201cadoptive admission.\u201d An adoptive admission may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>occur either \u201cexpressly <em>(e.g., </em>by oral or written statements of the party) or impliedly <em>(e.g., </em>by conduct of the party).\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-49(c) (6th ed.2003); <em>see also United States v. Robinson, </em>275 F.3d 371, 383 (4th Cir.2001) (\u201cA party may manifest adoption of a statement in any number of ways, including [through] words, conduct, or silence.\u201d); 29A Am.Jur.2d Evid. \u00a7 797 (2004) (\u201c[A]doption or acquiescence may be manifested in any appropriate manner,\u201d including when the party \u201cexpressly agrees to or concurs in an oral statement made by another,\u201d \u201chears the statement and later on essentially repeats it,\u201d \u201cutters an acceptance or builds upon the assertions of another,\u201d \u201creplies by way of rebuttal to some specific points raised by another, but ignores further points which he or she has heard the other make,\u201d or \u201creads and signs a written statement prepared by another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The Commonwealth contends that the adoptive admission in this case is analogous to an adoptive admission by silence. In Virginia, it is well established that \u201can admission by silence is ... a form of adoptive admission.\u201d Friend, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 18-49(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the \u201cvery distinct requirements\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> needed to establish admissibility of an adoptive ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>mission by silence are not directly applicable in the context of other forms of adoptive admissions. <em>See id. </em>That is, the specific antecedent factors that must be proven to admit an adoptive admission by silence stem from the \u201cuncertainty which attends interpreting a person\u2019s silence as an implied admission of the statement made.\u201d 29A Am.Jur.2d Evid. \u00a7 799 (2004). When an individual is not silent but, instead, affirmatively responds to a statement, those same concerns are not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Thus, if the individual alleged to have adopted a statement manifests his assent to a statement by some form of conduct other than silence, the inquiry changes slightly. Under those circumstances, the trial court need only determine whether, in light of the resulting verbal or non-verbal response, \u201c \u2018there are sufficient foundational facts from which the jury could infer that the defendant heard, understood, and acquiesced in the statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson, </em>275 F.3d at 383 (quoting <em>United States v. Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d 239, 244 (6th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">On appeal, Lynch argues that the statement, \u201cWhy you telling them what we just did?,\u201d coupled with the other parties\u2019 statements discussing the murder, does not fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>within the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule because there is no evidence that Lynch overheard the entire conversation between Kenneth, Christopher, and Tyreke. At the outset, however, we must clarify that this case does not involve an adoptive admission by silence. The evidence does not show that, while Kenneth, Christopher, and Tyreke were discussing the murder, Lynch approached the conversation and remained silent. Rather, he joined the conversation and affirmatively stated, \u201cWhy you telling them what we just did?\u201d Thus, this is not a case where the individual alleged to have adopted a statement \u201cfailed to reply\u201d to a direct or indirect accusation of wrongdoing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather than requesting introduction of a statement and Lynch\u2019s resulting <em>silence, </em>the Commonwealth sought to introduce a statement and Lynch\u2019s resulting <em>verbal response. </em>As a result, the four factors set forth in <em>Owens </em>are not directly applicable under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We must determine, rather, whether the Commonwealth presented sufficient foundational evidence from which the trial court could infer that Lynch heard, understood, and agreed with the substance of the conversation between Kenneth, Christopher, and Tyreke. Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the trial court could reasonably have inferred that Lynch heard enough of the conversation to know that the other men were discussing the murder, understood that he had been implicated in that murder, and, by his verbal statement, manifested his agreement with the fact that he had been involved in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">First, the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence from which it could be inferred that Lynch overheard at least a portion of the conversation between Kenneth, Christopher, and Tyreke. Although Lynch was outside when the conversation began, Kenneth testified that, while they were discussing the \u201cskinny woman,\u201d he heard Lynch coming up the stairs. Lynch then entered the conversation and asked, \u201cWhy you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>telling them what we just did?\u201d This conversation occurred in Tyreke\u2019s home, immediately after he and Lynch returned from the crime scene. Considering the context, time, and location of the discussion, the trial court could reasonably have inferred that Lynch heard enough of the conversation to understand that the other men were talking about the murder in which he had just participated. <em>See Weinbender v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 323, 326, 398 S.E.2d 106, 108 (1990) (affirming admission of hearsay statement where \u201cthe trial judge could have inferred that the defendant heard the statement\u201d); <em>Stumpf v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 200, 206, 379 S.E.2d 480, 484 (1989) (\u201cThe record shows that [the declarant\u2019s] statements ... were made with the knowledge and consent of [the defendant], who, <em>by reasonable inference, </em>was with [the declarant] when she made them.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Tedder, </em>801 F.2d 1437, 1451 (4th Cir.1986) (where jury heard \u201cconflicting testimony about the conditions under which [an accomplice] made his incriminating statements,\u201d including testimony that the defendant \u201cwas within earshot\u201d but about \u201cten feet away,\u201d \u201cthe jury was entitled to conclude that [the defendant] heard and adopted [the accomplice\u2019s] account\u201d); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>332 N.C. 204, 420 S.E.2d 395, 402 (1992) (rejecting argument that the \u201cperson making the statement [must] be in the physical presence of the defendant,\u201d concluding instead that \u201cthe proper focus is on the defendant\u2019s ability to hear and understand the statement being made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Second, the trial court could reasonably have inferred that Lynch understood not only the nature of the conversation, but also the fact that he had been implicated in the shooting. Specifically, Lynch entered the conversation and immediately asked, \u201cWhy you telling them what <em>we </em>just did?\u201d Considering Lynch\u2019s use of the word \u201cwe,\u201d the trial court could reasonably have concluded that Lynch understood not only that the murder was being discussed, but that he, too, had been fingered as a participant in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Third, the trial court could reasonably have inferred that Lynch\u2019s statement, \u201cWhy you telling them what we just did?,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>was sufficient to indicate his agreement that he had been involved in the murder. Again, Lynch\u2019s use of the word \u201cwe\u201d is telling. Rather than stating, \u201cWhy you telling them what <em>you </em>just did,\u201d Lynch asked, \u2018Why you telling them what <em>we </em>just did?\u201d Ordinarily, an individual accused of murder would take reasonable steps to deny his participation in that murder. Here, however, Lynch did not merely fail to deny his participation in the shooting\u2014he, by his own words, affirmatively implicated himself. Thus, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that Lynch\u2019s statement was sufficient to indicate his agreement that he had been involved in the murder. <em>See, e.g., Robinson, </em>275 F.3d at 383 (affirming trial court\u2019s admission of a conversation between the defendants where the parties discussed a murder they had just committed, noting that, \u201chad either [party] disagreed with a statement by the other, he would have made his disagreement known\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Handy, </em>668 F.2d 407, 408 (8th Cir.1982) (holding that defendant\u2019s interjection, \u201cYes, we did,\u201d during co-conspirator\u2019s discussion of an attempted murder was an adoptive admission); <em>cf. Clemmer v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 661, 665, 159 S.E.2d 664, 667 (1968) (holding that, where an officer asked the defendant \u201cabout his drinking,\u201d and the defendant responded that it \u201cwasn\u2019t any of [the officer\u2019s] business what he had been drinking,\u201d this statement was \u201cnot such that one can infer from it a tacit admission by defendant that he had been drinking, or was under the influence of alcohol,\u201d reasoning that the defendant\u2019s \u201canswer that it was none of the trooper\u2019s business what he had been drinking can be interpreted as an insolent answer to an officer of the law, but it cannot be construed as a tacit admission that defendant had been drinking alcohol or was under the influence of alcohol\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Finally, we note that any residual doubt as to whether Lynch agreed that he had participated in the murder went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. <em>See Thompson, </em>420 S.E.2d at 403 (\u201cA response which is not the equivalent of a denial may indicate acquiescence and be considered by the jury for what it is worth.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Tocco, </em>135 F.3d 116, 128-29 (2d Cir.1998) (holding that defendant\u2019s nod when witness told him that defendant\u2019s accomplice was talking about their involvement in an arson constituted an adoptive admission, reasoning that the statement was \u201cexactly the type of statement that an innocent person, under these circumstances, would normally deny,\u201d but that the meaning of the nod was \u201cultimately a question for the jury to assess\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting Lynch\u2019s statement and the substance of the preceding conversation under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. Lynch, however, argues that the \"clearly show\u201d language from <em>Doe </em>implies that the proponent of a hearsay statement must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, each of the elements needed for application of an exception to the hearsay rule. Neither this Court nor the Virginia Supreme Court has ever applied a clear and convincing standard of proof where the proponent of a statement seeks to admit that evidence under an exception to the hearsay rule.

Parker testified that Gregory Williams, Lester B. Lynch, and a \u201cyounger fellow\u201d arrived at Williams\u2019s brother\u2019s residence in the evening. Williams exited the car and rang the doorbell. After Williams\u2019s brother came downstairs and opened the door, Williams and his brother went upstairs followed by Parker. Lynch was outside the building talking to the \u201cyounger fellow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Based on Parker\u2019s proffered testimony, the trial judge ruled that statements Williams made to his brother and Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>inside the residence the day the killing occurred were admissible. In pertinent part, Parker\u2019s testimony established the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">A. When I followed [Williams] upstairs, I went to the den. He went to his brother\u2019s room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Q. So you weren\u2019t in the hallway then; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">A. Not at that time. I didn\u2019t go into the hallway until [Williams\u2019s] brother ... came out of the room. And when he came out of the room, I went to the bathroom. When I went to the bathroom, I overheard [Williams] telling [his brother] what had happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">Q. So this conversation took place in the bedroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">A. No, it took place in the hallway. His brother came into the hallway because his girlfriend was in the room. She was going into labor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">Q. At this time [Williams] tells his brother what has happened; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">A. The little young boy downstairs is trigger happy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">Q. My question is he told his brother what had happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">Q. At that point you don\u2019t see Mr. Lynch, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">A. No, not at that time. He didn\u2019t come up the stairs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">right then. He didn\u2019t come up the stairs until----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">He didn\u2019t come up the stairs\u2014like when I got in the conversation like after I overheard [Williams], what he was telling his brother, that\u2019s when I got in the conversation, and that\u2019s when [Lynch] came up the stairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">Q. In fact, you\u2019ve testified before you don\u2019t know what he heard, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">A. What who heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-19\">Q. [Lynch].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-20\">A. I can\u2019t hear for him. You know what I am saying? Only thing I can do is tell you what [Lynch] said. As far as what he heard, them his ears. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what he heard. Only thing I know is [Lynch] asked [Williams] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>why was he telling [Williams\u2019s brother] what they had just done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">* <em>* </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">A. Yeah. I mean, I didn\u2019t put the exact point of time, whether he came when [Williams] was talking or whether he came when I was talking. I didn\u2019t say that in my testimony at [Williams\u2019s] trial. I\u2019m telling you [Lynch] came upstairs when we was talking and he asked [Williams] why was he telling us that. At what point what he heard or whether I was talking or whether [Williams] was talking, I don\u2019t know. You know what I am saying?

What what was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Q. You said, why are you telling him what we just done? Did he ever say what that was that they had just done? A. No, but [Williams] responded back to him and said, this my brother, and [Parker] is cool. He ain\u2019t going to say nothing. Eventually he was talking about what he was telling us about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Q. So you assume that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">A. Yeah. Well, I am assuming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">The trial judge ruled \u201cthat the matter will be an adoptive admission.\u201d Over Lynch\u2019s hearsay objection, Parker later testified at trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">Q. What starts to happen when you get upstairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">A. When I got in the den area, [Williams] had went to the bathroom. He came out and knocked on his brother\u2019s door, and he starts talking to his brother. He was telling him about what they had just done. So I was in the den area. I could hear basically what they were saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">Q. Did you have any problem hearing anything that was being said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-15\">A. No. And I heard [Williams] say that they had just shot a woman. So when I heard the part that they had just shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>a woman, that\u2019s what really, really, you know, gripped my attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">So I came out of the den, and I was like, man, what you done got yourself into? You-all done shot a woman? And [Williams] was like, yeah. So I was like, where was you-all at? He was like, we went to [Ronald Scott\u2019s] house---He said we went to go get [Scott]. And I was like, why would you-all go in and try to do something and rob him or whatever when he cool with everybody? You know, he hang out with us. And [Williams] was like, man, I\u2019m going to get put out. My light\u2019s due, my rent due, my girl getting ready to leave and I don\u2019t care who I get.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">So I said, well, who was the lady that you-all shot? So he was like, it was a skinny lady. I said, that man\u2019s mom is, you know, skinny. And he was like, no, it won\u2019t his mom. It probably was his sister. I said, what difference does it make if it was his sister or his mom, you know? And at that time [Lynch] was coming up the stairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">On cross-examination, Parker repeats that Lynch is outside of the residence when Parker, Williams, and Williams\u2019s brother entered it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">Q. And you get upstairs\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">Q.\u2014and there is a conversation that goes on. [Williams] goes into the bathroom. You go into the den. Then [Williams] and his brother engage in a conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-13\">Q. At that time [Williams] tells him that they\u2019ve just killed a woman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-14\">A. Yeah. He said\u2014these words is his exact words. He said, \u201cThat young kid downstairs leaning on the car is trigger happy.\u201d And [Williams\u2019s] brother was like, \u201cwhat you talking about?\u201d And [Williams] like, \u201cMan, he just shot a lady.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">Q.

No. He didn\u2019t come up until\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">Q.

Not the person. Him. The gentleman right there, Mr. Lester Lynch. He came up the stairs and asked him, he said, \u201cWhy are you telling them what we just done?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQG\">Q. Did he ever say why you telling them why we went to kill someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">A. No. He didn\u2019t say nothing about that. He asked him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYF\">Q. Did he ever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">A. [Williams] had already told us that someone had got killed. And [Lynch] walked up and asked him why was he telling us what they had just done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">Q. But you said [Williams] told his brother we had been on a sting, right? Isn\u2019t that what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">Q. And you said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">A. And [Williams] told them what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">Q. Didn\u2019t you just say a sting could be anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-14\">A. Like a sting is slang for robbing or you can go steal something to get away with it. I got away with that sting. You could rob somebody. You could plan to rob somebody and say I\u2019m going on a sting tonight, you know. You don\u2019t know. It could be stealing radios out cars, anything. A sting is going to do something wrong, period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-15\">Q. So he never said it was killing anyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-16\">A. [Williams] said they had shot someone. He said they just shot\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-17\">Q. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying that [Williams] said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-18\">A. Yeah. [Williams] said they had just killed somebody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-19\">The Commonwealth, which was the party \u201c \u2018seeking to have hearsay declarations of a witness admitted as an exception to the general rule[,] must clearly show that [the hearsay dec\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>rations] are within the exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). I would hold that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden and that the trial judge erroneously admitted Parker\u2019s recitation of Williams\u2019s statements as \u201can adoptive admission\u201d by Lynch. When a statement is offered as an adoptive admission, a primary inquiry the trial judge must make is \u201cwhether there are sufficient foundational facts from which the jury could infer that the defendant heard, understood, and acquiesced in the statement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d 239, 244 (6th Cir.1996). To satisfy this exception to the hearsay rule, the evidence must prove the \u201cstatement tending to incriminate one accused of committing a crime is made in his presence and hearing.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 713, 718, 66 S.E.2d 513, 516 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Simply put, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence did not prove the predicate facts necessary to invoke the hearsay exception. <em>See Sapp v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 415, 424, 559 S.E.2d 645, 650 (2002) (holding that the proponent of evidence, which is claimed to fall within an exception to the hearsay rule, has the burden \u201cto lay a proper predicate for its introduction\u201d); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>275 F.3d 371, 383 (4th Cir.2001) (noting that under the federal rules a primary determination is \u201cwhether there are sufficient foundational facts from which the jury could infer that the defendant heard, understood, and acquiesced in the statement\u201d). Both case law and commonsense dictate that for a defendant to have adopted an admission as his own \u201cfoundational facts\u201d must first establish that the defendant heard and understood the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">No evidence proved Williams made his statement in Lynch\u2019s \u201cpresence and hearing.\u201d <em>James, </em>192 Va. at 718, 66 S.E.2d at 516. Indeed, the evidence established just the opposite: that Lynch was not in the presence of the three men when Williams spoke about the killing. Parker testified he was in the bathroom when Williams first mentioned the killing to his brother. By Parker\u2019s own testimony, he joined the conversation only after he emerged from the bathroom in the den, and he was aware Lynch had not then entered the residence: \u201c[h]e [Lynch] didn\u2019t come up the stairs.\u201d Obviously, Lynch could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>not have adopted the statement as his own if he never heard it. It is simply speculation to say at what point, if at all, Lynch adopted any of Williams\u2019s comments. Yet, the jury was allowed to attribute to Lynch all of Williams\u2019s statements. In view of the evidence, it is just as likely that Lynch was motivated to speak merely because he detected a heated argument as he ascended the stairs. For these reasons, I would hold that the evidence failed to prove that Lynch heard Williams\u2019s conversation and that, therefore, the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence Williams\u2019s statements about the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I would further hold that the admission of the hearsay evidence was not harmless. This inadmissible evidence was so prejudicial to Lynch that we cannot reasonably conclude that it did not affect the verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201c[I]f one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected____If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\"><em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 260, 546 S.E.2d 728, 732 (2001) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1247-48, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). Applying this test, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe principle of <em>Kotteakos </em>[means] that when an error\u2019s natural effect is to prejudice substantial rights and the court is in grave doubt about the harmlessness of that error, the error must be treated as if it had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect\u2019 on the verdict.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 444, 115 S.Ct. 992, 998, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). \u201cThe inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 765, 66 S.Ct. at 1247-48. Consistent with these principles, the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the disputed [evidence] may well have affected the ... decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978). In short, our \u201charmless error analysis ... [is not] simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The inadmissible evidence had such a substantial influence that we cannot reasonably conclude that it did not affect the verdict. The jury was asked to make a critical credibility determination whether to believe Lynch\u2019s alibi witnesses, who placed him somewhere else during the killing, or to believe Scott, Reid, and Parker, whose testimony placed Lynch at the house where the woman was killed. The inadmissible hearsay evidence served to impermissibly buttress the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses because the evidence identifying Lynch as being present at the killings was problematic and was marred by a number of inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">For example, Reid, who was present in the house when the killing occurred, testified that the man who entered the room with Williams wore a mask. After the killing, she could not identify Lynch from photographs. She only later identified him when she saw him in court as the defendant. Scott, on the other hand, was in the same room as Reid but testified that the man did not wear a mask. He did not initially identify the man as Lynch but did so at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Significantly, the record indicates that shortly after the killing, Scott identified Parker, not Lynch as one of the persons who entered the residence when his mother was killed. He admitted at trial that he first told police that Williams, Williams\u2019s brother, and Parker may have been the ones who robbed him. This identification was significant because Scott and Parker knew each other quite well. Scott also knew Williams. The jury may not have believed this curious change in Scott\u2019s memory and identification had they not learned about Lynch\u2019s \u201cadopted\u201d confession that Parker related at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Scott also testified that Parker twice had visited him at his mother\u2019s house earlier that day. The first time, Parker purchased heroin. He later returned to the house and demanded a return of his money, accusing Scott of selling bad heroin. Scott testified that during both occasions Williams, whom he knew, and Lynch, whom he had not previously met, were in a car waiting for Parker. Conversely, in his testimony, Parker never acknowledged his earlier presence at Scott\u2019s mother\u2019s house or that he knew Scott had a large amount of money and heroin in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u2022Significantly too, Parker\u2019s testimony conflicted with Scott\u2019s testimony about Lynch\u2019s whereabouts during the day. Whereas Scott testified that Lynch was waiting for Parker in the car when Parker purchased heroin, Parker testified that he first saw Lynch with Williams in the early evening and that he accompanied them in the car for just one block because Lynch and Williams had someplace else to go. Parker testified that he next saw Williams and Lynch when they returned to Williams\u2019s brother\u2019s residence with a \u201cyounger fellow\u201d whom he did not identify. At that time, Williams went upstairs and made his statement about the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s use of Parker\u2019s testimony to tie Lynch to Williams\u2019s statement effectively shifted the focus from Scott\u2019s earlier statement to the police that Parker, whom he knew, was indeed the unmasked man in the house during the shooting. When Scott\u2019s trial testimony identified Lynch, Parker buttressed Scott\u2019s identification by relating Lynch\u2019s \u201cadopted\u201d confession. With this change, the jury likely saw Parker as an observer, not a participant. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that in weighing the evidence the jury gave substantial weight to Parker\u2019s testimony relating the confession of Williams and implicating Lynch as being present at the killing. A confession of a perpetrator implicating the presence of a codefendant at the scene of a crime is inherently prejudicial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">Clearly, where the principal direct evidence against the accused is the testimony of an accomplice, the credibility of that witness will be a significant factor in the jury\u2019s determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>nation of the accused\u2019s level of culpability. [The Supreme Court has] consistently held that this credibility determination rests with the jury and is not subject to challenge on appeal merely because the testimony is self-serving, results from a favorable plea arrangement, or because the witness is himself a felon. However, here the issue is not the credibility of the witness, but rather the potential for harm caused by the erroneous admission of evidence which tends to support the jury\u2019s credibility determination. In that context we must presume that such evidence had the potential to influence the jury into accepting the properly admitted evidence as more credible and, thus, to taint the jury\u2019s determination of the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 553, 523 S.E.2d 208, 210 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">I would hold that it does not plainly appear that the error did not substantially and injuriously affect the verdict. The evidence, if successful in achieving its purpose, clearly would have affected the verdict. <em>See Norfolk Ry. &amp; Light Co. v. Corletto, </em>100 Va. 355, 360, 41 S.E. 740, 742 (1902) (holding that \u201c[i]t is ... well settled that if a ... mistake of the court appear[s] in the record it must be presumed that it affected the verdict of the jury, and is therefore ground for which the judgment must be reversed, unless it plainly appears from the whole record that the error did not affect, and could not have affected, their verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">For these reasons, I would reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
