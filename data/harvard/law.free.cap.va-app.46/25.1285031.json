BENTON, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The trial judge convicted Stephanie Michelle Hunt of grand larceny for unlawfully taking, stealing, and carrying away a winning Virginia Lottery ticket redeemable for a $2,500 prize. Code \u00a7 18.2-95. A conviction for grand larceny requires proof of a value of $200 or more. <em>Id. </em>Hunt contends that, under the common law, the value of a lottery ticket as a \u201cchose in action\u201d could be no more than the face value of the ticket itself, fifty cents. Thus, she argues that she could be convicted only of petit larceny. Because the indictment charged only common law larceny, we agree with Hunt and reverse her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">The indictment charged that Stephanie Michelle Hunt \u201cdid unlawfully and feloniously take, steal, and carry away one ... Virginia Lottery Ticket ... with a total value of $2,500 ... in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-95.\u201d The evidence at trial proved that Thomas Motley purchased lottery tickets at the Quick-mart on Jefferson Street on the evening of July 28, 2003. Motley testified that he usually played the numbers 1119 and 1191, and did so that night when he pin-chased a total of eleven or twelve tickets from Hunt, the store\u2019s employee. An investigator for the Virginia Lottery testified that the winning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ticket number for the \u201cpick four\u201d lottery on July 28 was number 1191 and that the winning ticket had a prize value of $2,500. The ticket was purchased at this store for fifty cents. Four other winning tickets, worth $600 apiece, and seven non-winning tickets, were purchased at the same location within seconds of the $2,500 winning ticket. Both Hunt and Motley testified that Motley purchased these $600 winning tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The morning after the winning ticket numbers were announced Hunt arrived at Motley\u2019s residence and asked to see his lottery tickets, but would not explain why. After Motley retrieved his tickets, he went with Hunt to her car and handed her the tickets. Hunt spoke on her telephone and then told Motley that the winning number from the night before had been 1119. Motley testified that, while he and Hunt were in the car, he knew he had won something but he was not sure how much.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">After Hunt departed, Motley went to a nearby store to verify the winning ticket number. He learned that it was actually 1191. When he looked through his tickets, he discovered the winning ticket for the $2,500 prize was not among them. Motley returned to the Quickmart, where he had purchased the tickets, and talked to Hunt\u2019s sister, who worked there. As Hunt\u2019s sister spoke with Hunt on the telephone, Motley told her to tell Hunt to return his ticket. Motley testified that he never received the ticket from Hunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Lucille Daws, Hunt\u2019s neighbor, testified that Hunt told her that she had a winning lottery ticket and that she would give Davis $100 if she traveled to Farmville with Hunt and redeemed the ticket for her. Davis agreed and redeemed the winning ticket at a lottery office in Farmville. After cashing the check for $2,500, Hunt paid Davis $100 and kept the balance of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Three or four weeks after Motley contacted the police, Hunt paid Motley $500 in the presence of Detective Carter, who investigated Motley\u2019s report of the stolen lottery ticket. At the time of the payment, Hunt said \u201c[t]hat\u2019s $500 toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>$2,500.\u201d Hunt had not purchased anything from Motley and only owed him money for the ticket Motley said she stole.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">At the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Hunt made a motion to strike the grand larceny charge. Hunt argued that the evidence proved the ticket was worth only fifty cents. The trial judge overruled the motion, finding the evidence proved that the ticket was a winning lottery ticket when Hunt took it and that the ticket then was redeemable for $2,500. At the conclusion of all of the evidence, Hunt renewed the motion to strike. The judge ruled that Hunt\u2019s testimony established larceny and that the value of the ticket was proved to be $2,500. The trial judge convicted Hunt of grand larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Hunt contends the trial judge erred in convicting her of grand larceny because the indictment, which charged a violation only under Code \u00a7 18.2-95, required proof of \u201cvalue of $200 or more.\u201d She argues that at common law, a lottery ticket, like \u201ccredit cards, checks, and other papers,\u201d were \u201cdioses in action\u201d and had no value beyond the paper on which they were written. She argues, therefore, she properly could have been convicted only of petit larceny. The Commonwealth responds that Code \u00a7 18.2-98 \u201chas expanded the definition of larceny to include bank notes, checks, or other writings or paper with a value of $200 or more.\u201d Thus, the Commonwealth argues that the evidence proved a value in excess of $200 because Code \u00a7 18.2-98 is broad enough to include lottery tickets within its definition and provides that \u201cthe money due on or secured by the writing ... shall be deemed to be the value of the article stolen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u201cIn Virginia, larceny is a common law crime.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 179, 183, 445 S.E.2d 667, 670 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">Larceny, a common law crime, is the wrongful or fraudulent taking of another\u2019s property without his permission and with the intent to deprive the owner of that property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>permanently. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-95, grand larceny includes the taking, not from the person of another, of goods that have a value of $200 or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Tarpley v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 251, 256, 542 S.E.2d 761, 763-64 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">An indictment that charges grand larceny in violation of only Code \u00a7 18.2-95 alleges the common law crime. <em>Owolabi v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 78, 79 &amp; n. 1, 428 S.E.2d 14, 15 &amp; n. 1 (1993) (noting that common law larceny is \u201can offense punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-95\u201d and declining to \u201caddress the applicability of\u2019 certain statutes that punish acts as grand larceny because the indictment did not purport to charge under those statutes). By its express terms, Code \u00a7 18.2-95 prescribes the punishment for common law larceny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Thus, unless violation of a specific statute other than Code \u00a7 18.2-95 is charged, a larceny indictment charges the common law offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u201cThe value of the goods specified in [Code \u00a7 18.2-95] is an essential element of the crime, and the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Knight v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 85, 88, 300 S.E.2d 600, 601 (1983). \u201cProof that an article has some value is sufficient to warrant a conviction of petit larceny, but where the value of the thing stolen determines the grade of the offense, the value must be alleged and the Commonwealth must prove the value to be the statutory amount.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 132, 139, 82 S.E.2d 603, 607 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The following principle is well established: \u201cAt common law choses in action, including bonds, notes and checks, were not the subject of larceny, being considered mere rights without corporeal existence, although the taking of the paper on which they were written could be larceny.\u201d <em>Felkner v. State, </em>218 Md. 300, 146 A.2d 424, 430 (1958); <em>see also State v. West, </em>157 W.Va. 209, 200 S.E.2d 859, 862 (W.Va.1973) (holding that a statute is required for choses in action to be the subject of larceny). We relied upon this principle in <em>Owolabi, </em>where we held that the taking of a paper or credit card could be the subject of larceny under the common law but that the value was simply of the paper or the plastic itself, not the value it represented. 16 Va.App. at 80-81, 428 S.E.2d at 15-16. Furthermore, in defining the value and punishment for common law grand larceny, Code \u00a7 18.2-95 provides that \u201c[a]ny person who ... commits simple larceny not from the person of another of <em>goods and chattels </em>of the value of $200 or more ... shall be guilty of grand larceny.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, the common law in Virginia still exempts choses in action from its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201cthe General Assembly has extended the definition of larceny to cover bank notes, checks, and other papers of value under Code \u00a7 18.2-98.\u201d Although this is in fact the case, the Commonwealth fails to note in its argument that the indictment in this case charged only the common law offense. The indictment solely referenced Code \u00a7 18.2-95. Nothing contained in the indictment or raised at trial implicated Code \u00a7 18.2-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Virginia, similar to other states, long ago enacted a statutory form of larceny for writings and paper of value-Code \u00a7 18.2-98.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the West Virginia Supreme Court noted, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>commenting on a similar statute enacted in West Virginia, \u201c[i]t is only by force of this section that bank notes, checks and other writings and papers of value are made subject of larceny, as at common law they were not the subject of larceny.\u201d <em>West, </em>200 S.E.2d at 862.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, even if we assume that Hunt\u2019s actions were sufficient to prove larceny as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-98, the indictment against Hunt referenced only Code \u00a7 18.2-95 (the common law crime) and, thus, did not charge a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-98. The principle is well established that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth cannot prosecute a defendant for a specific larceny and prevail by proof of another act of larceny for which the defendant \u2018was not prosecuted, and on which the jury was not instructed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Owolabi, </em>16 Va.App. at 80, 428 S.E.2d at 15 (quoting <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 192, 195, 300 S.E.2d 788, 789 (1983)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">An accused is entitled to be clearly informed of the charge against him. Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. Where, as here, the Commonwealth elects to prosecute a defendant for a specific category of larceny, and no other, its case must either prevail or fail upon that election. The Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>cannot retrospectively argue that [the accused] should be convicted of a crime for which he was not prosecuted, and on which the jury was not instructed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><em>Baker, 225 </em>Va. at 194-95, 300 S.E.2d at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Bruhn, </em>264 Va. 597, 570 S.E.2d 866 (2002), supports this result. There, \u201cthe evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove grand larceny under the common law definition of that crime ... [but] the evidence ... was sufficient to prove ... embezzlement.\u201d 264 Va. at 601, 570 S.E.2d at 868. The Court reversed the conviction, however, holding that \u201cproof of embezzlement, as defined by [Code \u00a7 18.2-111], will not sustain a conviction under an indictment charging grand larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-95.\u201d 264 Va. at 599, 570 S.E.2d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The Court reasoned that a review of the statutory changes manifested the verity of this result. It first noted that prior to 1994, Code \u00a7 18.2-111 provided that one who committed embezzlement \u201cshall be deemed guilty of larceny\u201d and \u201cmay be indicted as for larceny\u201d and that \u201cproof of embezzlement under this section shall be sufficient to sustain the charge.\u201d <em>Bruhn, </em>264 Va. at 601, 570 S.E.2d at 868; <em>see also </em>1979 Va. Acts, ch. 349. That version of Code \u00a7 18.2-111 also provided that, \u201c[o]n the trial of every indictment for larceny, however, the defendant, if he demands it, shall be entitled to a statement in writing from the attorney for the Commonwealth designating the statute he intends to rely upon to ask for conviction.\u201d The Supreme Court held that this version of the statute demonstrated the General Assembly\u2019s \u201crecogni[tion of] the long-standing practice of permitting other unlawful takings, such as receiving stolen goods and theft by false pretenses, to be charged as larceny.\u201d <em>Bruhn, </em>264 Va. at 601, 570 S.E.2d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Continuing its review of the statutory history, the Court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">In 1994, however, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-111 and deleted the language that permitted a defendant who had committed embezzlement to be \u201cindicted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>for larceny.\u201d The amendment further eliminated the phrase that made proof of embezzlement \u201csufficient to sustain the charge\u201d of larceny and the requirement that the Commonwealth elect, upon motion of the defendant, the specific statutory theory of the crime of larceny it intended to rely upon for a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 602, 570 S.E.2d at 868-69. The Supreme Court held that these amendments \u201cconstituted a complete reformulation of the statute. Most particularly, the elimination of the permissive provision that embezzlement could be \u2018indicted as for larceny evinces a clear legislative intent to prohibit that former practice and require specificity in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 570 S.E.2d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bruhn, </em>the General Assembly again amended Code \u00a7 18.2-111, returning to its text the original language that one guilty of embezzlement \u201cshall be deemed guilty of larceny and may be indicted as for larceny\u201d and that \u201c[p]roof of embezzlement shall be sufficient to sustain the charge of larceny.\u201d 2003 Va. Acts, ch. 733. Significantly, however, the General Assembly did not amend Code \u00a7 18.2-98 or numerous other code sections providing, like Code \u00a7 18.2-111, that particular behavior \u201cshall be deemed ... larceny.\u201d Thus, in reviewing the \u201cshall be deemed ... larceny\u201d language in Code \u00a7 18.2-98, we give it the same interpretation the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bruhn </em>gave to almost identical language in Code \u00a7 18.2-111. By analogy to <em>Bruhn, </em>a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-98 \u201cshall be deemed ... larceny\u201d <em>for purposes of punishment, </em>but Code \u00a7 18.2-98 does <em>not </em>permit the accused to be \u201cindicted as for [common law] larceny\u201d or provide that proof of statutory larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-98 \u201cshall be sufficient to sustain a charge of [common law] larceny\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95. The language of Code \u00a7 18.2-98, in marked contrast to the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-111 as amended by the General Assembly in 2003, \u201cevinces a clear legislative intent to ... require specificity in the indictment.\u201d <em>Bruhn, </em>264 Va. at 602, 570 S.E.2d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>For reasons about which we may only speculate, the Commonwealth prosecuted Hunt for common law larceny and not for the statutory offense as provided in Code \u00a7 18.2-98. Under the common law, the value of the ticket is the value of the paper on which it is printed. Because the evidence failed to prove the value was $200 or more, it was insufficient to support a conviction for grand larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-95 and was sufficient, at most, to prove petit larceny. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-95 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">Any person who (i) commits larceny from the person of another of money or other thing of value of $5 or more, (ii) commits simple larceny not from the person of another of goods and chattels of the value of $200 or more, or (iii) commits simple larceny not from the person of another of any firearm, regardless of the firearm\u2019s value, shall be guilty of grand larceny, punishable by imprisonment in a state correctional facility for not less than one nor more than twenty years or, in the discretion of the jury or court trying the case without a jury, be confined in jail for a period not exceeding twelve months or fined not more than $2,500, either or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">.
