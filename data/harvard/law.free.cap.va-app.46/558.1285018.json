Young, Jr. (Tommy) and his mother, Ada F. Young, appeal a decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) denying Ms. Young\u2019s request on Tommy\u2019s behalf for certain housing benefits under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act (Act), Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5000 to 38.2-5021. Specifically, Ms. Young contends the commission erred in determining she was not entitled to housing benefits that were in effect when she filed her claim for compensation for Tommy\u2019s birth-related neurological injury and when that claim was first adjudicated by the commission. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute. Ms. Young gave birth to Tommy on March 30, 1989. On September 14, 1998, Ms. Young filed a claim with the commission, pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-5004, seeking admission into the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program (Program) in order to obtain compensation for Tommy\u2019s birth-related neurological injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">On January 8, 1999, the deputy commissioner denied the claim. On March 10, 2000, the full commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and awarded Tommy \u201call the benefits provided by Code \u00a7 38.2-5009.\u201d On February 13, 2001, this Court affirmed the full commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In early 2003, Ms. Young, who lived with Tommy in rental property, requested cash-grant housing benefits from the Program. Ms. Young had made no prior requests for housing benefits from the Program. By letters dated April 14, 2003, and June 3, 2003, the Program informed Ms. Young that Tommy was not eligible for the requested housing benefits because, in response to an actuarial study of the Program, the Program\u2019s Board of Directors (Board) had \u201cterminated all housing benefits for awards after January 1, 2000,\u201d and Tommy was not admitted into the Program until March 20, 2000, at the earliest. The Program also informed Ms. Young that, although the Board had passed a new housing-benefits policy on September 19, 2000, providing \u201cone-time funds for medically necessary modifications or construction of an accessible bedroom and bathroom,\u201d those benefits were available only to families that owned their own homes. The Program further noted that, although it anticipated being able to eventually offer \u201cappropriate housing benefits\u201d to families that rented their homes, such benefits were still under development and not yet available.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Ms. Young appealed the Program\u2019s denial of her request for housing benefits to the commission. The deputy commissioner conducted an evidentiary hearing on October 9, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>At that hearing, Ms. Young argued that Tommy was entitled to the housing benefits that were in effect when she first applied for Tommy\u2019s admission into the Program on September 14, 1998, or the housing benefits that were in effect when that claim was first adjudicated by the deputy commissioner on January 8,1999. Ms. Young testified that she and Tommy had lived in the same rental house since April 1999, and she needed housing benefits in order to provide Tommy with a suitable home that would accommodate his needs. Unlike their current home, she explained, a suitable home would have hallways and doorways that were wide enough to accommodate the new power wheelchair the Program was providing, an accessible kitchen that would allow Tommy to roll himself up to the kitchen table, a screen porch that would permit Tommy to enjoy fresh air without exposure to insects, and a bathroom that was large enough to accommodate an accessible toilet, a lift, and a roll-in shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">According to Ms. Young, it took two people to lift Tommy, who weighed 75 pounds and could not use his legs. She explained that, although the Program provided a \u201cskilled nursing assistant\u201d to help her with Tommy when he was not at school and a lift for Tommy\u2019s bedroom, Ms. Young still had to help lift Tommy in order for him to use the bathroom and would have to help carry him from the hallway to his bed if, as she suspected, his new, bigger power wheelchair would not fit through his bedroom door. Ms. Young stated that she had been \u201cdiagnosed with a disc disease\u201d and was \u201cnot supposed to be lifting.\u201d Ms. Young further stated that she had applied to the Program for payment for a male friend to help her and the nursing assistant with Tommy. Ms. Young also testified that she had not obtained a report from a doctor or therapist stating that the requested accommodations were medically necessary, and had not sought permission from the landlord to have any work done on her existing home because the Program told her it would not pay for renovating rental homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Program argued at the hearing that Ms. Young was not entitled to the housing benefits she sought because those benefits were \u201cno longer available at the time [Tommy] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>admitted into the Program\u201d and the Program\u2019s provision of housing benefits was a gratuity rather than mandated by the Act. The Program further informed the deputy commissioner that no housing benefits were currently available for families who did not own their own home, but added that the Board was revisiting its housing-benefits policy with respect to claimants who rented their homes. The Program introduced the Board\u2019s minutes pertaining to housing benefits and the \u201cGuidelines for the Operation of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program\u201d (Guidelines) adopted by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">As indicated by the Board\u2019s minutes and the periodically revised \u201cHousing\u201d section of the Guidelines, the Program\u2019s housing-benefits policy changed several times prior to Ms. Young\u2019s request for housing benefits in 2003. On April 15, 1997, the Board adopted its first housing-benefits policy, under which the Program offered to fund the construction of a new, accessible home \u201cdetermined to be medically appropriate for the needs of the child in the most cost effective manner\u201d or the \u201cfeasible and reasonably priced\u201d modification of an existing family-owned home to provide accessibility. The new home, which could not exceed 3,300 square feet, would be \u201ctitled in trust for the child, subject to use by the child\u2019s family\u201d until the child\u2019s death or permanent institutionalization. A renovated home would remain titled in the name of the child\u2019s parents. \u201cThe maximum benefit for any one house, including renovation costs, [was] not to exceed $500,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">That same date, the Board voted to purchase homes in trust for three families and approved the purchase of another trust home \u201cin principle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On November 17, 1998, the Board adopted a new housing-benefits policy effective January 1, 1999, under which, in lieu of building trust homes, the Program would provide families with a secured cash grant to acquire, build, or renovate their own homes. Under the new policy,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">[c]laims awarded in 1998 would be grandfathered in under the April 15, 1997 guidelines; however, 1998 awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>claims, which currently [did] not have homes under construction, would be offered a housing allowance in lieu of trust housing pending the drafting of Guideline language to support the change and a review of tax implications, if any, for the recipients and the Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In furtherance of the implementation of its new policy, the Board voted on May 18, 1999, to allocate a maximum \u201cbase sum of $175,000 for [medically necessary] housing for the period of time the child participates in the Program plus an additive computed from Property Estimation Information\u201d based on the location of the home being acquired, built, or renovated. The Board also reviewed a draft revision of the \u201cHousing\u201d section of the Guidelines and granted the request of five families for cash grants for the construction of new, accessible homes. In granting those requests, the Board advised the claimants that the cash grants would not be available until the documentation enabling the Program to award cash grants was finalized and \u201capproved by the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On September 24, 1999, the Board, wanting \u201cto finalize the housing allowance for medically necessary housing for claimants adopted in principle in November 1998,\u201d approved and adopted a revised \u201cGuidelines Housing Document\u201d and other documents allowing the Program to provide secured cash grants \u201cto claims awarded effective January 1, 1999[,] and for any claim awarded prior to January 1, 1999[,] approved for a trust home provided that construction has not yet begun.\u201d The Board ordered that the finalized documents be sent to those families whose requests for cash grants had already been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">On January 18, 2000, the Board voted to award cash grants to reimburse a family for the construction of a new home suitable for their injured daughter\u2019s needs and to reimburse another family for modifications made to their home to accommodate their injured son.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">That same date, representatives from the Bureau of Insurance of the State Corporation Commission (SCC) presented the Board with its statutorily mandated biennial funding re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>port. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5021(A). The SCO\u2019s report indicated that the Program was becoming actuarially unsound and that a substantial contributing factor to that unsoundness was the Program\u2019s housing benefits. The report showed that, at the then current level of funding, the Program would have a $2.4 million deficit as of June 30,2000, and a $12.9 million deficit by the end of the fiscal year in 2001. The report\u2019s author recommended that the actuarial soundness of the Program be restored by increasing the assessment fees paid by both participating and non-participating physicians and by participating hospitals to the full assessment level permitted under Code \u00a7 38.2-5020.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Following discussions with the SCC representatives, the Board voted to temporarily suspend all cash-grant benefits for housing \u201con claims awarded or adjudicated on or after January 1, 2000,\u201d pending answers to the Board\u2019s further questions for the report\u2019s author regarding the efficacy of maintaining the Program\u2019s solvency by eliminating housing benefits and gradually raising the assessment fees solely on participating physicians and hospitals. After being informed that its proposed plan would work only if participating physicians and hospitals were assessed \u201cat the maximum level,\u201d the Board voted on June 3, 2000, to permanently terminate the cash-grant housing benefits for claims awarded on or after January 1, 2000, and to increase the assessment fees paid by participating physicians and hospitals to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">On June 3, 2000, the Board voted to provide one-time funds for modification or construction of an accessible bedroom and bathroom in family-owned homes. On September 19, 2000, the Board revised the \u201cHousing\u201d section of the Guidelines to reflect its new housing-benefits policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Following the evidentiary hearing, the deputy commissioner ruled that Ms. Young was not entitled to the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits she sought because they were no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>longer in effect when she was admitted into the Program. Ms. Young appealed that decision to the full commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">On October 1, 2004, the full commission reached the same result as the deputy commissioner, but for different reasons. Assuming Ms. Young was otherwise qualified to receive the requested housing benefits from the Program, the commission ruled that \u201c[t]he right of a participant who otherwise qualifies for the [housing] benefit vests upon a condition precedent, i.e. application for the housing benefit.\u201d Therefore, the commission concluded, \u201cMs. Young is not entitled to the housing benefit that was in effect on any date before the date she applied for the housing benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">On appeal, Ms. Young, who seeks a new, accessible home for Tommy, contends she is entitled to either the trust-home housing benefits that were in effect when she filed her claim for compensation for Tommy\u2019s birth-related neurological injury or the cash-grant housing benefits that were in effect when that claim was adjudicated by the deputy commissioner. Her right to those benefits, she asserts, vested when Tommy was born with a birth-related neurological injury in a participating hospital. From that day forward, Ms. Young argues, she had a \u201cpresent, fixed right of future enjoyment\u201d to the housing benefits offered by the Program under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009 \u201cif otherwise qualified to receive such benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, Ms. Young\u2019s argument continues, the Board could not retroactively abrogate or otherwise impair her vested right to the housing benefits that were in effect on September 14,1998, the day she asserted her right to housing benefits by filing a claim for all the benefits to which she was entitled under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009, or on January 8, 1999, the day the deputy commissioner adjudicated her claim, albeit incorrectly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Moreover, Ms. Young argues, the Program\u2019s denial of her request for those housing benefits was arbitrary and capricious because the Program afforded the same benefits \u201cto similarly situated claimants admitted into the Program at the time [she] applied for admission or should have been admitted into the Program\u201d and the Board\u2019s decision to terminate the cash-grant housing benefits was unreasonable. Thus, Ms. Young concludes, the commission erred in ruling that her right to housing benefits under the Program vested only when she applied for those specific benefits and that she was consequently not entitled to the cash-grant or trust-home housing benefits previously in effect since the Board had terminated them before she made that application. We disagree with Ms. Young and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">While an award of the commission is \u201cconclusive and binding [on appeal] as to all questions of fact,\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5011(A), \u201c \u2018[conclusions of the [c]ommission upon questions of law, or mixed questions of law and fact, are not binding on [appeal],\u2019 \u201d <em>Sinclair v. Shelter Constr. Corp., </em>23 Va.App. 154, 156-57, 474 S.E.2d 856, 857-58 (1996) (third alteration in original) (quoting <em>City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985)). The issue whether Ms. Young is entitled to the requested housing benefits under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009 is a mixed question of law and fact. Accordingly, the commission\u2019s decision with respect to that issue \u201cis properly subject to <em>[de novo </em>] review by this Court.\u201d <em>Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Dep\u2019t v. Mottram, </em>263 Va. 365, 371-72, 559 S.E.2d 698, 701 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In arguing that she is entitled to the trust-home or cash-grant housing benefits because her right to those benefits vested at Tommy\u2019s birth, Ms. Young misconstrues the Act and the nature of the benefits she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Enacted in 1987, the Act \u201cprovides claimants with a no-fault remedy for compensation for qualified [birth-related neurological] injuries\u201d and \u201caffords potential tort defendants (at least those who contribute voluntary assessments to the [Program] under Code \u00a7 38.2-5015) with an absolute immunity to civil malpractice liability for these overall injuries.\u201d <em>Cooper v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Adler, </em>44 Va.App. 268, 275, 604 S.E.2d 747, 750 (2004) (citing Code \u00a7 38.2-5002). Thus, \u201c[b]y delivering an infant in a participating hospital and/or through a participating physician, the baby\u2019s family automatically waives the right to bring a medical malpractice lawsuit against the participating physician or hospital if the baby incurs a birth injury that meets the definition in the [Act].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 276, 604 S.E.2d at 751. In return, the baby\u2019s family automatically acquires the right to obtain statutorily mandated compensation from the Program if the baby incurs such an injury. <em>See id. </em>at 278, 604 S.E.2d at 752 (\u201cThe General Assembly expressly intended that [the common law] rights and remedies of [the injured infant\u2019s family] would be excluded in return for an award of benefits on behalf of the infant.\u201d); <em>see also Romine v. Fla. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Ass\u2019n, </em>842 So.2d 148, 154 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003) (holding, in considering a no-fault compensation plan for birth-related neurological injuries similar to Virginia\u2019s plan, that the \u201cdate of the child\u2019s birth and the injuries sustained at that birth, if any, establish the right of the infant to receive ... benefits and the scope of those benefits\u201d under the plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The compensation to be awarded qualified claimants is set forth in Code \u00a7 38.2-5009. That statute provides, in pertinent part, that a claimant who qualifies under the Act for an award of benefits on behalf of a child who has incurred a birth-related neurological injury shall be awarded \u201ccompensation for [certain] items relative to such injury,\u201d including \u201c[a]ctual medically necessary and reasonable expenses of medical and hospital, rehabilitative, residential and custodial care and service, special equipment or facilities, and related travel.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Ms. Young argues that her vested right to the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits emanates from the statute\u2019s requirement that compensation be awarded for the expenses of \u201cresidential and custodial care and service\u201d and \u201cspecial equipment or facilities.\u201d The Program argues that, based on the specific language of the statute, the General Assembly did not require the Program to provide the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits to participants. Thus, the Program submits, its awarding of trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits in the latter half of the 1990s was \u201cgratuitous in nature and involve[d] no contractual rights or vested interests.\u201d We agree with the Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">We are mindful, in considering the scope of the benefits contemplated by Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(1), that \u201c \u2018[c]ourts are not permitted to rewrite statutes. This is a legislative function. The manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied. There can be no departure from the words used where the intention is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944)). Thus, \u201c \u2018[w]here the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). \u2018We must ... assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the ... statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, if the statutory language at issue is plain and unambiguous, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8S\">\u201cgive that language a \u2018literal construction\u2019 unless doing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 276, 590 S.E.2d 631, 638 (2004) ] (quoting <em>Chase v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., </em>266 Va. 544, 547, 587 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2003)). And, by literal, we mean the statutory words \u201cshould be given their \u2018common, ordinary and accepted\u2019 \u201d understanding. <em>Mouberry v.

Program, </em>44 Va.App. 149, 154, 604 S.E.2d 88, 91 (2004). Furthermore, in giving an undefined term its common and accepted meaning, we must consider \u201cthe context in which the term is used.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Norfolk Cmty. Servs. Bd., </em>260 Va. 334, 339-40, 533 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">As relevant to the issue before us, the language used in Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(1) is plain and unambiguous and, construed literally, clearly manifests the legislature\u2019s intent to require the provision of compensation to an injured child\u2019s family for the specific \u201cmedically necessary and reasonable expenses\u201d listed in the statute. The statute makes no express reference to \u201chousing\u201d in its list of compensable expenses. Nor does the statute, in using the terms \u201cresidential and custodial care and service\u201d and \u201cspecial equipment or facilities,\u201d provoke the implicit inclusion therein of the housing expenses covered by the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits at issue here, as Ms. Young suggests. Indeed, in light of the context in which it is used in the statute, the plain and generally accepted meaning of the term \u201cresidential and custodial care and service\u201d connotes the type of in-home custodial assistance that Ms. Young testified she received from the \u201cskilled nursing assistant\u201d provided by the Program\u2014not the construction or purchase of a new handicapped-accessible home. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>338, 2075 (1993) (defining \u201ccare\u201d as \u201cresponsibility for or attention to safety and well-being\u201d and defining \u201cservice\u201d as \u201cconduct or performance that assists or benefits someone\u201d). Similarly, the plain and generally accepted meaning of the term \u201cspecial equipment or facilities\u201d connotes wheelchairs, vans, lifting equipment, and renovated bathrooms in family-owned homes, rather than new homes themselves. <em>See id. </em>at 768, 812 (defining \u201cequipment\u201d as \u201cthe implements (as machinery or tools) used in an operation or activity: apparatus\u201d and defining \u201cfacility\u201d as \u201csomething that promotes the ease of any action, operation, transaction, or course of conduct\u201d or \u201cthat is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>built, constructed, installed, or established to perform some particular function\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">Because the General Assembly, in fashioning the statutory scheme [of the Act], created a new right to compensation, unknown at common law, it could, and did, impose upon the new right such limitations as it deemed just.

Basic Construction Co., </em>238 Va. 321, 327, 384 S.E.2d 323, 325-26 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We conclude, therefore, that Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(1) cannot be reasonably read as requiring the Program to provide trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits to qualified claimants. Hence, in the context of the present claim, the Program\u2019s awarding of those benefits to qualified claimants when its funds were apparently plentiful\u2014from 1997 through the end of 1999-was gratuitous. That is to say, the benefits were over and above what was required by the statute and were, thus, offered \u201cwithout obligation to do so\u201d and \u201cwithout consideration in circumstances that [did] not otherwise impose a duty\u201d to do so. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>721 (8th ed.2004). Hence, they were not part of the quid-pro-quo requirement of the Act, and Ms. Young acquired no vested right to them upon Tommy\u2019s birth. <em>See Kennedy Coal Corp. v. Buckhorn Coal Corp., </em>140 Va. 37, 45, 124 S.E. 482, 484 (1924) (defining a vested right as \u201ca right, so fixed that it is not dependent on any future act, contingency or decision to make it more secure\u201d); <em>Dodge v. Bd. of Education, </em>302 U.S. 74, 79, 58 S.Ct. 98, 100, 82 L.Ed. 57 (1937) (\u201cIf, upon a construction of the statute, it is found that the payments are gratuities, involving no agreement of the parties, the grant of them creates no vested right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">At most, the Program\u2019s granting of the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits was in the nature of a unilateral contract. <em>See </em>Patrick S. Atiyah, <em>An Introduction to the Law of Contract, </em>126 (3d ed. 1981) (\u201c[M]any unilateral contracts are in reality gratuitous promises enforced for good reason with no element of bargain.\u201d). In a unilateral contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>one party makes an offer in the form of a promise to do an act \u201cupon the fulfillment of certain conditions\u201d by the other party. <em>Nicely v. Bank of Virginia Trust Co., </em>221 Va. 1084, 1089, 277 S.E.2d 209, 212 (1981). The second party\u2019s \u201cpreviously inchoate rights\u201d to the performance of the promised act by the first party \u201cvest and become legally enforceable\u201d only when the second party accepts the offer by satisfying the condition precedent. <em>Id. </em>Until the second party's rights vest, the first party \u201cis free to modify [the] provisions\u201d of its offer or even withdraw the offer completely. <em>Pitts v. City of Richmond, </em>235 Va. 16, 20, 366 S.E.2d 56, 58 (1988). If the first party\u2019s offer \u201cis no longer in effect at the time\u201d the condition precedent is satisfied, the second party has no claim to the performance of the promised act by the first party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Here, as evidenced by the record, the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits offered by the Program were subject to several conditions precedent, including the requirement that the claimant actually request those benefits. Ms. Young did not request such benefits until early 2003, by which time the Board had terminated its offer of both the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits. Thus, Ms. Young has no vested right to the trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits. Accordingly, she is not entitled to those benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">As to Ms. Young\u2019s contention that the Program\u2019s denial of her request for trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits was arbitrary and capricious because (1) the Program awarded such benefits \u201cto similarly situated claimants\u201d and (2) the Board\u2019s decision to terminate the cash-grant housing benefits was unreasonable, our review of the record convinces us that this contention is without merit because the two premises upon which it is based are fatally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">First, Ms. Young\u2019s assertion that claimants \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to her received trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits is factually unsupported by the record. Indeed, in every instance in the record where the Board awarded either trust-home or cash-grant housing benefits, it is clear that the claimant had requested the housing benefits awarded while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>those benefits were in effect. Conversely, Ms. Young requested such housing benefits only after the Board had terminated them. It is clear, therefore, that she and the claimants who received trust-home or cash-grant housing benefits were not \u201csimilarly situated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Likewise, Ms. Young\u2019s claim that the Board acted unreasonably in terminating the cash-grant housing benefits is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">It is well established that an administrative agency</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cshall apply expert discretion to matters coming within its cognizance, and judicial interference is permissible only for relief against the arbitrary or capricious action that constitutes a clear abuse of the delegated discretion. The reviewing judicial authority may not exercise anew the jurisdiction of the administrative agency and merely substitute its own independent judgment for that of the body entrusted by the Legislature with the administrative function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag\"><em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 243-44, 369 S.E.2d 1, 8 (1988) (quoting <em>Va. Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm\u2019n v. York Street Inn, Inc., </em>220 Va. 310, 315, 257 S.E.2d 851, 855 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">As set forth in the Act, the General Assembly has charged the Board with the job of administering the Program\u2019s fund. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5016(F). Implicit in that charge is the Board\u2019s responsibility of maintaining the solvency of the Program\u2019s fund. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(describing the Board\u2019s responsibilities with regard to investing the Program\u2019s monetary assets); Code \u00a7 38.2-5021(B) (requiring notification of the General Assembly\u2019s leadership if the Program\u2019s fund \u201ccannot be maintained on an actuarially sound basis\u201d). To that end, the Bureau of Insurance of the SCC is required to perform actuarial investigations of the fund \u201cno less frequently than biennially.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5021(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">In early 2000, the Board received an actuarial report from the SCC showing that the Program\u2019s fund was becoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>actuarially unsound and that a substantial contributing factor to that unsoundness was the Program\u2019s housing benefits. The report showed that, at the then current level of funding, the Program would have a $2.4 million deficit as of June 30, 2000, and a $12.9 million deficit by the end of the fiscal year in 2001. In response, the Board terminated the cash-grant housing benefits that had been in effect and increased the assessment fees paid by participating physicians and hospitals to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Given our previous determination that the cash-grant housing benefits terminated by the Board were not specifically required under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(1) and the evidence in the record demonstrating the need for action by the Board to maintain the actuarial soundness of the Program\u2019s fund, we cannot say that the Board\u2019s decision to terminate the cash-grant housing benefits then in effect constituted an abuse of the Board\u2019s delegated discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Accordingly, we reject Ms. Young\u2019s contention that the Program\u2019s denial of her request for trust-home and cash-grant housing benefits was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">For these reasons, we agree with the commission that Ms. Young is not entitled to the trust-home housing benefits that were in effect when she filed her claim for compensation for Tommy\u2019s birth-related neurological injury or the cash-grant housing benefits that were in effect when that claim was first adjudicated by the commission. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision denying Ms. Young\u2019s request for those housing benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">. The Program notes in its appellate brief that, \u2018\u2018[u]nder its most recent set of guidelines approved on April 13, 2004, the Board [also] offers ... reimbursement for renters to move to handicap accessible rental units.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">. For purposes of this appeal, we, like the commission, assume, without deciding, that Ms. Young otherwise qualified under the Act for the housing benefits at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-5\">.
