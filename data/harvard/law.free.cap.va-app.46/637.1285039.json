On appeal, Auer contends the trial court erred during the punishment phase of his trial by admitting into evidence his prior misdemeanor conviction under a city ordinance for DUI. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">On August 4, 2003, Auer was indicted by a grand jury for aggravated involuntary manslaughter and DUI, second offense. On the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, the latter indictment was amended prior to trial to DUI, first offense. After hearing the evidence presented at trial on those charges, a jury convicted Auer of DUI, first offense, under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 and 18.2-270, and aggravated involuntary manslaughter, under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">During the punishment phase of the trial, the Commonwealth sought to introduce into evidence a certified copy of a general district court order reciting Auer\u2019s prior criminal conviction for misdemeanor DUI, in violation of Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-336. Rejecting Auer\u2019s argument that evidence of a prior conviction based on a city ordinance was inadmissible under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, the trial court admitted the order into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">At the conclusion of the punishment phase of the trial, the jury fixed Auer\u2019s punishment at nine years and six months of incarceration on the manslaughter charge and twelve months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>of incarceration on the DUI charge. The trial court subsequently sentenced Auer pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Auer contends, on appeal, that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 prohibits the Commonwealth from presenting evidence at the punishment phase of a bifurcated jury trial of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions under local laws. Thus, he concludes, the trial court erred in admitting into evidence his prior conviction for misdemeanor DUI, which was based on Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-336, and the case must be remanded for resentencing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">\u201c \u2018[T]he admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and [its ruling thereon] will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 231, 236, 563 S.E.2d 364, 366 (2002) (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)). However, \u201ca trial court \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shooltz v. Shooltz, </em>27 Va.App. 264, 271, 498 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1998) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). \u201cIn determining whether the trial court made an error of law, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides in pertinent part that, at the punishment phase of a bifurcated jury trial,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHV\">the Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction, including adult convictions and juvenile convictions and adjudications of delinquency. Prior convictions shall include convictions and adjudications of delinquency under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>As framed by Auer, the sole issue in this appeal is whether the trial court violated the terms of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 when, during the punishment phase of trial, it allowed the Commonwealth to present evidence to the jury of Auer\u2019s DUI conviction for violating Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-336. Auer contends Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 prohibits the admission into evidence of convictions based on local laws; the Commonwealth insists the statute contains no such prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">At the center of this dispute is the question whether Auer\u2019s DUI conviction for violating Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-336 is a \u201cprior conviction,\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Auer argues that, because penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the Commonwealth, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1\u2019s provision that \u201c[pjrior convictions shall include convictions and adjudications of delinquency under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories\u201d should be read as providing an exhaustive list of the convictions that may be presented to the jury at sentencing. Thus, Auer\u2019s argument continues, the omission of convictions under local laws from that list reflects the legislature\u2019s intent that such convictions not be considered by the jury in fixing a convicted defendant\u2019s punishment. To hold otherwise, Auer maintains, would be to add terms to the statute and to conclude that the legislature did not mean what it actually expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The Commonwealth claims that Auer\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is too restrictive. Nothing in the language of the statute itself, the Commonwealth argues, indicates that the legislature intended to prohibit the presentation at sentencing of prior convictions under local laws. Moreover, the Commonwealth adds, reading such a prohibition into Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 would defeat the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">We recognize that \u201cit is our function to interpret the meaning of the words in controversy as intended by the legislature.\u201d <em>Tiller v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 418, 420, 69 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1952). However, \u201cunless there is ambiguity in a statute, there is no need for interpretation, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>province of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWords are ambiguous if they admit to \u2018being understood in more than one way[,]\u2019 ... refer to \u2018two or more things simultaneously!;,]\u2019 ... are \u2018difficult to comprehend,\u2019 \u2018of doubtful import,\u2019 or lack \u2018clearness and definiteness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 301-02, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988) [(en banc)] (quoting <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 522, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996) (first two alterations in original). \u201cOrdinarily, when a particular word in a statute is not defined therein, a court must give it its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Whether the legislature intended to exclude convictions under local laws from the meaning of \u201cprior convictions,\u201d and thus prohibit the presentation of such convictions to the jury at sentencing, is not apparent on the face of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. As noted above, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides that \u201c[p]ri- or convictions shall include convictions ... under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories.\u201d The determinative word is \u201cinclude,\u201d which means \u201cto ... list ... as a part or component of a whole or of a larger group, class, or aggregate.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Generally speaking, the word \u201cinclude\u201d implies that the provided list <em>of </em>parts or components is not exhaustive and, thus, not exclusive. <em>See Fed. Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., </em>314 U.S. 95, 100, 62 S.Ct. 1, 4, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941) (noting that \u201cthe term \u2018including\u2019 is not one of all-embracing definition, but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle\u201d); <em>Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Mass. Citizens for Life, </em>769 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1985), <em>aff'd, </em>479 U.S. 238, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986) (observing that the word \u201cincludes\u201d is \u201c \u2018usually a term of enlargement, and not of limitation\u201d and therefore \u201c \u2018conveys the conclusion that there are other items includable, though not specifically enumerated\u2019 \u201d (quoting 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>133 (4th ed.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted))); <em>Highway &amp; City Freight Drivers Local No. 600. v. Gordon Transports, Inc., 576 </em>F.2d 1285, 1289 (8th Cir.1978) (noting that, when the word \u201cinclude\u201d is used in a statute to define a term, \u201cthe fact that the statute does not specifically mention a particular entity ... does not imply that the entity falls outside of the definition\u201d); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 777 </em>(8th ed.2004) <em>(\u201c[I]ncluding </em>typically indicates a partial list____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">However, the word \u201cinclude\u201d is also commonly used in a restrictive, limiting sense. <em>Helvering v. Morgan\u2019s, Inc., </em>293 U.S. 121, 125, 55 S.Ct. 60, 61, 79 L.Ed. 232 (1934) (recognizing that \u201cthe term \u2018includes\u2019 may sometimes be taken as synonymous with \u2018means\u2019 \u201d); Bryan A. Garner, <em>A Dictionary of Modem American Usage </em>363 (1998) (remarking that the word \u201cinclude,\u201d \u201cwhich traditionally has introduced a nonexhaustive list, is now ... widely [ ]used for <em>consists of\u201d). </em>Used in this limiting sense; the term typically introduces an exhaustive list of all of the components or members that make up the whole. <em>See </em>Garner, <em>supra; Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>667-68 (2000) <em>(\u201cInclude </em>means to contain as a part or member of a larger whole; it may indicate one, several, <em>or all parts.\u201d </em>(second emphasis added)). Thus, when a statute uses the word \u201cinclude\u201d in this restrictive, limiting sense to define a term, it sets forth the entire definition, and no other elements or items are includable. Consequently, the fact that the statute does not expressly enumerate a particular item implies that the item \u201cfalls outside of the definition.\u201d <em>Highway &amp; City Freight Drivers, </em>576 F.2d at 1289; <em>see County of Amherst Bd. of Supervisors v. Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982) (holding that the courts \u201cmay not add to a statute language\u201d that the legislature intended not be included therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Because the word \u201cinclude\u201d is susceptible to more than one meaning and because it is not immediately clear from the word\u2019s context which meaning is meant to apply in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, we conclude that- the statute\u2019s provision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201c[p]rior convictions shall include convictions ... under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories\u201d is ambiguous. <em>See Brown v. Lukhard, 229 </em>Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985) (noting that words are ambiguous if they admit to \u201cbeing understood in more than one way\u201d or lack \u201cclearness and definiteness\u201d). <em>See generally Liverpool v. Baltimore Diamond Exch., Inc., </em>369 Md. 304, 799 A.2d 1264, 1274 (2002) (recognizing that \u201cthe term \u2018includes,\u2019 by itself, is not free from ambiguity\u201d because it \u201chas various shades of meaning,\u201d ranging from enlargement and expansion to limitation and restriction); <em>Frame v. Nehls, </em>452 Mich. 171, 550 N.W.2d 739, 742 (1996) (\u201cWhen used in the text of a statute, the word \u2018includes\u2019 can be used as a term of enlargement or of limitation, and the word in and of itself is not determinative of how it is intended to be used.\u201d). \u201cTherefore, we are called upon to construe this statutory language in a manner that will ascertain and give effect to the General Assembly\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Herndon v. St. Mary\u2019s Hosp., Inc., </em>266 Va. 472, 475, 587 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In seeking to resolve the ambiguity in the statutory language and discern the legislature\u2019s intent, we apply established principles of statutory interpretation. <em>See Va. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Industry v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 101-02, 353 S.E.2d 758, 762 (1987). Consistent with such principles, we interpret the statute so as \u201cto promote the end for which it was enacted, if such an interpretation can reasonably be made from the language used.\u201d <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995). Thus, the \u201cstatute must be construed with reference to its subject matter, the object sought to be attained, and the legislative purpose in enacting it; the provisions should receive a construction that will render it harmonious with that purpose rather than one which will defeat it.\u201d <em>Esteban v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 605, 609, 587 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2003). Furthermore, although \u201c[i]t is a cardinal principle of law that penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth]\u201d and \u201ccannot be extended by implication, or be made to include eases which are not within the letter and spirit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the statute,\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E .2d 99, 103 (1960), \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein,\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Applying these principles to the provision of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 at issue here, we conclude that the statutory interpretation urged by Auer, is contrary to the manifest purpose of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Plainly, the legislative intent underlying Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is to assure that sufficient information regarding the convicted defendant\u2019s criminal record is provided during the punishment proceeding to enable the jury \u201c\u2018to impose the sentence as seemed to them to be just.\u2019\u201d <em>Hartigan v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 243, 254, 522 S.E.2d 406, 411 (1999) (quoting <em>Coward v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 639, 646, 178 S.E. 797, 800 (1935)), <em>aff'd en banc, 32 </em>Va.App. 873, 531 S.E.2d 63 (2000). \u201c \u2018The sentencing decision ... is a quest for a sentence that best effectuates the criminal justice system\u2019s goals of deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 594 (quoting <em>United States v. Morris, </em>837 F.Supp. 726, 729 (E.D.Va.1993)). \u201cManifestly, the prior criminal convictions of a felon ... \u201c \u2018bear upon a tendency to commit offenses, the probabilities of rehabilitation, and similar factors\u2019 \u201d indispensable to the determination of an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 465 S.E.2d 592, 465 S.E.2d at 595 (quoting <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 656, 659, 446 S.E.2d 469, 472 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">As we explained in <em>Hartigan, </em>\u201c[i]n contrast to the unitary system [in effect prior to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1\u2019s enactment], in which juries [in non-capital cases] determined guilt and sentencing based only on the facts germane to the offense and the range of punishment available, the jury now is given a much broader range of information under the bifurcated procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 522 S.E.2d at 411. \u201cSuch information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ensures an individualized assessment of a defendant\u2019s previous criminal conduct in the context of the subject offense, thereby promoting a more informed determination of sentence.\u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 523, 465 S.E.2d at 594. To that end, \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-295.1 creates a category of evidentiary admissibility. It is not a rule of evidentiary exclusion.\u201d <em>Gilley v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 740, 744, 467 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">It follows, therefore, that, as we stated in consideration of a related issue in <em>Bunn v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 593, 598, 466 S.E.2d 744, 746 (1996) (emphasis added),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">[t]he obvious purpose of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is to allow the jury, which will be recommending sentence, to consider the defendant\u2019s ... current record of criminal convictions. Nothing in the language or logic of the statute suggests that the legislature intended to limit the jury\u2019s consideration to anything other than the defendant\u2019s <em>complete </em>criminal record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Indeed, had the legislature intended to specifically limit the prior convictions the jury could consider in a sentencing proceeding to only those convictions under the jurisdictions enumerated in the statute, it could have done so unequivocally. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-330.1 (\u201cQualifying convictions or adjudications <em>shall include only </em>those for offenses occurring after July 1, 1993.\u201d (emphasis added)); Code \u00a7 24.2-101 (\u201c[Rjegistered voter\u201d <em>shall include only </em>persons maintained on the Virginia voter registration system with active status.\u201d (emphasis added)); Code \u00a7 58.1-3506.1 (\u201cFor purposes of this article, the term motor vehicle <em>shall include only </em>automobiles and pickup trucks.\u201d (emphasis added)); Code \u00a7 54.1-1118 (\u201c \u2018Improper or dishonest conduct\u2019 <em>includes only </em>the wrongful taking or conversion of money, property or other things of value which involves fraud, material misrepresentation or conduct constituting gross negligence.... The term \u2018improper or dishonest conduct\u2019 <em>does not include </em>mere breach of contract.\u201d (emphasis omitted and emphases added)); Code \u00a7 38.2-1800 (\u201c \u2018Limited lines property and casualty agent\u2019 <em>means </em>an individual or business entity authorized by the Commission whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>license authority to sell, solicit, or negotiate is <em>limited to </em>the following ...: automobile club authority; home protection insurance authority; legal services insurance authority.... Limited lines property and casualty insurance <em>shall not include </em>life insurance, health insurance, property insurance, casualty insurance, and title insurance.\u201d (emphases added)). But, it did not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">It is beyond dispute that, were we to read Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 as prohibiting the presentation at sentencing of convictions under local laws, as Auer urges, the jury, in cases such as this, would not have the convicted defendant\u2019s complete criminal record before them in determining the appropriate punishment to recommend. Such a reading of the statute would clearly undermine the legislative intent expressed therein of allowing the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s complete criminal record at sentencing. We conclude, therefore, that, consistent with the manifest purpose of the statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 does not provide an exclusive definition of the term \u201cprior convictions\u201d and, thus, does not prohibit the presentation at sentencing of convictions under local laws. Rather, the statute\u2019s provision that \u201c[p]rior convictions shall include convictions ... under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories\u201d indicates that the prior convictions the Commonwealth may present at sentencing are not limited to convictions under the statutes contained in the Code of Virginia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>hold that the trial court did not err in allowing the Commonwealth to present evidence of Auer\u2019s misdemeanor DUI conviction for violating Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-836.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">This resolution of the issue is buttressed by the fact that Auer\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 would yield the inconsistent result of permitting the Commonwealth to present evidence at sentencing of a prior conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 but not under Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 21-336, even though both statutes refer to the same driving under the influence offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Cook v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\">. At the same time, the trial court also admitted a copy of a prior conviction order for disorderly conduct. Although that conviction was also based on a violation of a city ordinance, Auer raises no challenge on appeal to the admission of that order. Accordingly, we need not address that matter further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">. Auer points to Code \u00a7 18.2-270(E) as an example of a statute that explicitly refers to local ordinances, and argues based thereon that the omission of the same term from Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 was intentional and meaningful. However, Code \u00a7 18.2-270 differs from Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 both in purpose and in legal context. Because the legislature expressed a concern in Code \u00a7 18.2-270 for laws \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those listed in Code \u00a7 18.2-270, the inclusion of \u201cordinances of any county, city or town of this Commonwealth\u201d served to precisely define the nature of the second offense that could be used for enhanced punishment. A term-by-term comparison with Code \u00a7 18.2-270 is of little value to us here in determining the legislative intent behind Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">.
