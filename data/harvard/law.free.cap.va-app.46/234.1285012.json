Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 122, 603 S.E.2d 642 (2004). We stayed the mandate of that decision and granted a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>44 Va.App. 414, 605 S.E.2d 329 (2004). Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>it is ordered that the stay of the mandate is lifted, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">David Alan Stevens appeals-his conviction for aggravated involuntary manslaughter in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1. He contends that the trial court erred by: (1) failing to foreclose prosecution of the aggravated involuntary manslaughter charge on the ground that the Commonwealth did not comply with the procedural requirements of a driving under the influence (DUI) charge; (2) failing to exclude a hospital toxicology report based on insufficient proof of reliability; (3) failing to instruct the jury on criminal negligence; and (4) finding the evidence sufficient to prove he was guilty of aggravated involuntary manslaughter. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 254, 584 S.E.2d 444, 446 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>So viewed, on June 29, 2002, appellant struck an automobile driven by Barry Childers while Childers was turning left at an intersection. As a result, Heather Watson, a passenger in Childers\u2019 vehicle, was killed. Volunteer rescue workers treated appellant at the scene, and appellant told one of them that he had come from a bar and had been drinking \u201clots and lots and lots.\u201d Appellant was transported to a local hospital emergency room. Appellant\u2019s hospital admission records show that appellant stated he had consumed \u201cbetween 12\u201424 beers\u201d and \u201c[more than] 18 beers\u201d prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">After the accident, the Loudoun County Sheriffs Office dispatched Deputy Chris Coderre to the hospital to arrest appellant. Appellant was waiting to undergo a Computed Axial Tomography scan when Coderre located him. Coderre said he could clearly smell alcohol in the room that appellant was in, the smell being especially obvious in the hospital\u2019s sterile environment. After the scan, Coderre spoke to appellant and informed him that he was under arrest for DUI. Coderre read the implied consent law to appellant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> explained the procedure, and asked him to submit to a blood test, to which appellant agreed. Coderre watched a hospital lab technician draw two vials of appellant\u2019s blood, then seal, package, tape, and initial them. Once the blood was drawn, Coderre informed appellant of his right to an independent analysis of the blood sample, asked him if he wished to have it done, and, if so, to sign the form authorizing the test. Coderre offered appellant the form and his pen, upon which appellant stated, \u201cI\u2019m too f\u2014ed up. I can\u2019t sign sh\u2014.\u201d Coderre kept the form with a vial of appellant\u2019s blood and took it with him when he left the hospital. The form and blood sample remained locked in the trunk of Coderre\u2019s police cruiser until the following Monday when Coderre submitted it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>to the Department of Forensic Sciences for testing. An analysis of this blood sample showed appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .21. The hospital\u2019s blood toxicology report indicated that appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .24 or .25. On July 1, 2002, the Commonwealth charged appellant with driving under the influence, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, and aggravated involuntary manslaughter, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">At a pretrial hearing, the trial court suppressed the implied consent law blood sample analysis and precluded the Commonwealth from using the presumption of intoxication pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-269. The trial court based its ruling on a finding that the Commonwealth had failed to arrest appellant within the statutorily mandated period after the incident as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court also ruled that appellant had not properly been provided the form requesting independent analysis of the blood sample. The court therefore dismissed prosecution of charges under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(DUI) but allowed the Commonwealth to proceed with prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 (aggravated involuntary manslaughter). After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of aggravated involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">A. <em>Implied Consent Law Procedural Violations Do Not Require Dismissal of an Aggravated Involuntary Manslaughter Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">An aggravated involuntary manslaughter conviction under Code \u00a7 18 .2-36.1 requires a finding that the defendant was driving under the influence of either alcohol or drugs or a combination of alcohol and drugs, as specified in clauses (ii), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>(iii) or (iv) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. The implied consent law governs procedural steps for conducting breath and blood tests for the prosecution of DUI charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Appellant argues that a prosecution for aggravated involuntary manslaughter is inherently a prosecution for DUI; thus, the implied consent law procedures apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, these procedures required the arresting officer to give the accused a form indicating how he could obtain an independent analysis of the blood sample drawn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant argues that because he did not receive the independent analysis form, the trial court should have dismissed the aggravated manslaughter charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We disagree. Even if failure to comply with the implied consent law procedural requirements does not forbid a prosecution for aggravated manslaughter, blood test results are not required for a conviction under either Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 or 18.2-36.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Neither Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6 nor any of the other implied consent law statutes refer to Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2, -268.3, -268.4, -268.5, -268.8, -268.9 and -268.10 include specific language that they apply to violations of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 or -266.1 or a similar ordinance,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but none of those code sections mention Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Only Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3 applies its provisions to an additional statute, specifically, Code \u00a7 18.2-51.4, maiming as a result of driving while intoxicated. Additionally, Code \u00a7 18.2-51.4 specifically provides that the implied consent law provisions apply upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>arrest for a violation of that code section.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Had the General Assembly intended to require the implied consent law procedures and its related statutory provisions for a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, it would have specifically provided so; however, it did not. <em>See Jordan v. South Boston, </em>138 Va. 838, 844-45, 122 S.E. 265, 267 (1924) (\u201cCourts cannot read into a statute something that is not within the manifest intention of the legislature as gathered from the statute itself. To depart from the meaning expressed by the words is to alter the statute, to legislate and not to interpret.\u201d (internal quotations and citation omitted)). The omission, in this context, makes it apparent that the legislature did not require those procedural hurdles.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Furthermore, blood test results are not required to prove intoxication for prosecution under clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, and, by extension, therefore, are not required for prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1. <em>See Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 20, 24, 577 S.E.2d 514, 516 (2003) (\u201cTest results from a breath or blood test are not necessary or required to prove driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\u201d). Only clause (i) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, the per se statute predicating guilt on blood alcohol content alone, requires blood test results. Code \u00a7 18 .2-36.1 does not require that the Commonwealth establish a violation of clause (i) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266; it only requires a violation of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv). If the General Assembly intended to require a blood test for prosecution for involuntary manslaughter, it would have tied the involuntary manslaughter statute to clause (i) and not just clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv). Thus, \u201c \u2018the result of a [blood] analysis is but auxiliary proof which may tend to corroborate evidence of the objective symptoms [of being under the influence of alcohol].\u2019 \u201d <em>Thurston v. Lynchburg, </em>15 Va.App. 475, 483, 424 S.E.2d 701, 705-06 (1992) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Brooks v. City of Newport News, </em>224 Va. 311, 315-16, 295 S.E.2d 801, 804 (1982)). In this case, there was sufficient evidence of objective symptoms that would allow a fact finder to conclude that appellant was under the influence of alcohol: (1) appellant admitted to consuming twelve to twenty-four beers; (2) Coderre and two other witnesses smelled a \u201cstrong odor\u201d of alcohol when in the appellant\u2019s presence; (3) when asked if he had been drinking, appellant answered yes, \u201clots and lots and lots\u201d; and, (4) at the hospital, appellant stated that he was \u201ctoo f\u2014ed up\u201d and couldn\u2019t sign anything. Such evidence is enough to support a finding of intoxication, and, therefore, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014266(ii), (iii) or (iv), without the blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">B. <em>The Court Did Not Err in Admitting the Hospital Toxicology Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Appellant argues that, because the Commonwealth failed to affirmatively show a reliable foundation for the hospital toxicology report, it was error for the court to admit it into evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Appellant concedes that Code \u00a7 19.2-187.02<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> addresses the hearsay nature of the hospital records, but contends that it does not overcome or eliminate the requirements that admission of scientific evidence must be based on a proper foundation. However, \u201c[wjhether the foundation is sufficient is a question within the sound discretion of the trial judge. If the judge finds the foundation sufficient, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence are matters within the province of the [fact finder].\u201d <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 285, 322 S.E.2d 216, 223 (1984). In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the hospital toxicology report.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Appellant also contends that in spite of the statute allowing admission of hospital blood tests, those tests must also meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.5, which relate to the handling of blood samples taken pursuant to the implied consent law. Blood tests performed by medical personnel in a hospital emergency room are not subject to the requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.5. That statute applies only to blood drawn under the implied consent law. The statute begins, \u201c[f]or purposes of this article ...which clearly and strictly limits its application only to DUI prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">C. <em>The Court Did Not Err in Denying Appellant\u2019s Proposed Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying three of his proposed jury instructions, \u201cW,\u201d \u201cY,\u201d and \u201cZ.\u201d He contends that the denial of these instructions prevented him from presenting his theory of the case to the jury. Instruction \u201cW\u201d describes three degrees of negligence: ordinary, willful, and criminal. Instructions \u201cY\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d raise the issue of whether Watson\u2019s death was directly caused by appellant\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (quoting <em>Swisher v. Swisher, </em>223 Va. 499, 503, 290 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1982)). When reviewing a trial judge\u2019s decision refusing a proffered jury instruction, \u201c \u2018[t]he appropriate standard of review requires that we view the evidence with respect to the refused instruction in the light most favorable to [the proponent of the instruction].\u2019 \u201d <em>Hartigan v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 243, 257, 522 S.E.2d 406, 412 (1999) (quoting <em>Boone v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 130, 131, 415 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The jury instructions approved by the trial court in this case are the same as those upheld by this Court in <em>Hall, </em>32 Va.App. 616, 529 S.E.2d 829. In <em>Hall, </em>we noted that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>instructions \u201csubstantially tracked the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 and the Virginia Model Jury Instructions\u201d and that they \u201cadequately stated the elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 529 S.E.2d at 839. As in <em>Hall, </em>the trial court was justified in approving an instruction that clearly and simply stated the elements of the crime and the findings that were necessary for a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit instruction \u201cW,\u201d as it would not have clarified any element of the law and could have confused the jury by introducing additional issues not present in the law under which appellant was prosecuted. Instructions \u201cY\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d were properly refused as another instruction already dealt with the issues of causation. These additional instructions would have been needlessly redundant. \u201c[I]t is not desirable to multiply instructions. Moreover, any instruction that is given should relate to the specific evidence in the case and should not incorrectly state the law or mislead the jury---[T]he trial judge may properly refuse any instructions that are misleading or redundant.\u201d <em>Diffendal v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 417, 423, 382 S.E.2d 24, 26-27 (1989) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to refuse the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">D. <em>The Evidence </em>Was <em>Sufficient </em>As a <em>Matter of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, \u201c \u201cwe presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u2019 and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002)); <em>see also McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193,197-98, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>This means the jury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned on appeal unless no \u201c \u2018rational trier of fact\u2019 \u201d could have come to the conclusion it did. <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); <em>see also Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 746, 595 S.E.2d 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>13 (2004); <em>Pease v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 355, 573 S.E.2d 272, 278 (2002) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cWe let the decision stand unless we conclude no rational juror could have reached that decision.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>266 Va. 397, 588 S.E.2d 149 (2003). A reviewing court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2789 (emphasis in original and citation omitted). We must instead ask whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789) (emphasis in original and internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Hoambrecker v. City of Lynchburg, </em>13 Va.App. 511, 514, 412 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1992). \u201c \u2018This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257-58, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Appellant argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove: (1) that he was intoxicated; (2) that he caused Watson\u2019s death; and (3) that his conduct was gross, wanton, and culpable. There is sufficient evidence in the record on each of these elements to support the jury\u2019s decision to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Appellant first argues that the Commonwealth did not prove he was intoxicated. On the contrary, the hospital toxicology report revealed that appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .24 or .25, approximately three times the legal limit in Virginia. The Commonwealth presented expert testimony on the mental and physical effects that normally accompany a blood alcohol content greater than .20. There was evidence that appellant asked after the accident, \u201cWhat did I hit?,\u201d admitted he did not remember the accident, that he consumed between twelve and twenty-four beers, and that after the accident he stated that he was \u201ctoo f\u2014ed up\u201d and couldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>sign anything. Witnesses also testified that appellant was mumbling, disoriented, and had a strong odor of alcohol about his person. Finally, the Commonwealth presented evidence that there was a lack of skid marks at the scene of the accident, from which the jury could conclude that appellant\u2019s driving behavior at the time of the accident was wanton and reckless and was affected by his intoxicated state. Thus, the record contains sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that appellant was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Appellant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he caused Watson\u2019s death. He contends that the Commonwealth only proved that he struck the vehicle Watson was riding in and that evidence was insufficient to prove that her death was caused by his intoxication. Appellant claims that Childers\u2019 testimony was inconsistent and that Childers was at fault because he should have seen and yielded to appellant\u2019s vehicle. The Commonwealth presented evidence that Childers\u2019 vehicle had the right-of-way and that appellant ran a red light. Childers testified that he had received a green arrow before he began turning his vehicle. The Commonwealth also presented an expert in traffic signals who testified that if Childers received a green arrow, appellant would have faced a red light at the time of the accident. Appellant presented no evidence that would prevent any reasonable juror from believing the testimony of Childers or the expert witness. The lack of skid marks\u2014indicating appellant\u2019s failure to stop or slow down before the impact\u2014could also lead the jury to conclude that appellant\u2019s failure to notice the other car before striking it caused the accident. Therefore, the record contains sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude that appellant\u2019s driving while intoxicated caused Watson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Appellant also argues with regard to causation that Childers\u2019 testimony is inconsistent with a finding that he had the right-of-way. Appellant contends that because Childers did not see appellant\u2019s car before entering the intersection, he could not have been attentive to the traffic signal. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>All of the authorities agree that contributory negligence has no place in a case of involuntary manslaughter [and] if the criminal negligence of the [accused] is found to be the cause of the death, [he] is criminally responsible, whether the decedent\u2019s failure to use due care contributed to the injury or not. <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>170 Va. 597, 616, 195 S.E. 675, 683 (1938).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Only if the conduct of the deceased amounts to an independent, intervening act alone causing the fatal injury can the accused be exonerated from liability for his or her criminal negligence. <em>Mayo v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 644, 647, 238 S.E.2d 831, 833 (1977). In such case, the conduct of the accused becomes a remote cause. <em>Delawder v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 55, 57, 196 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Hubbard v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 1, 14, 413 S.E.2d 875, 882 (1992). Therefore, the conduct of another party plays no part in the case, unless that conduct is proven to be an independent, intervening cause, rendering the defendant\u2019s negligence so remote it ceases to be a proximate cause of the accident. Appellant did not prove such in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Finally, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find him guilty of gross, wanton, and culpable conduct. Appellant relies on <em>Jetton v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 557, 561, 347 S.E.2d 141, 144 (1986), in which this Court held that in order to find gross, wanton, and culpable conduct, multiple factors are required other than intoxication to show such conduct. Appellant asserts that the only relevant conduct to be considered is that he ran a red light. He contends that single act is so common an occurrence that it fails to rise to the level of gross, wanton, and culpable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">While aggravated involuntary manslaughter convictions often involve multiple acts exhibiting gross, wanton, and culpable conduct, a single act is sufficient to establish such conduct. In <em>Hall, </em>this Court upheld an aggravated involuntary manslaughter conviction upon facts that are substantially similar to the instant case. <em>Hall, </em>32 Va.App. at 616, 529 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>829. In that case, the appellant was convicted after his truck collided with a motorcycle, killing the cyclist. <em>Id. </em>at 621, 529 S.E.2d at 832. In <em>Hall, </em>the only conduct attributed to the appellant was having a blood alcohol content greater than .20 and running a red light. This Court ruled that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was competent, was not inherently incredible and was sufficient to prove appellant drove his vehicle in a \u2018gross, wanton and culpable\u2019 manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632, 529 S.E.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Neither intoxication nor running a red light alone may be sufficient to establish gross, wanton, and culpable conduct. However, the combination of appellant\u2019s extreme intoxication, ignoring traffic signals and running a red light, striking a vehicle without slowing down or braking and asking, \u201cWhat did I hit?,\u201d is sufficient evidence for a jury to find gross, wanton, and culpable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Accordingly, the record clearly provides sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that appellant knowingly engaged in conduct \u201cso gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life,\u201d which proximately caused the accident and resulted in Watson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">We hold that the trial court did not err in permitting prosecution of the aggravated involuntary manslaughter charge under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, admitting the hospital toxicology report, or by refusing appellant\u2019s proffered jury instructions. We also conclude that the record includes sufficient evidence for a jury to convict appellant of aggravated involuntary manslaughter. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, the implied consent law, provides that any person operating a motor vehicle on a highway in the Commonwealth is deemed, as a condition of operating the vehicle, to have consented to have samples of his or her blood, breath, or both blood and breath, taken and tested for purposes of determining its alcohol and/or drug content.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\">. At the time of the incident, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, consent was implied if the arrest was made within two hours of the alleged offense. In 2002, the General Assembly amended that statute to allow implied consent if the arrest was made within three hours of the alleged offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">. Based on the holding in <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, 32 </em>Va.App. 616, 529 S.E.2d 829 (2000) <em>(en banc), </em>appellant contends that the trial court should have dismissed the aggravated manslaughter charge under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 on the ground that the Commonwealth did not comply with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6. While it is true that <em>Hall </em>stands for the proposition that a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 is necessarily a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-266, the application of the rule in <em>Hall </em>is much narrower than appellant argues. <em>Id. </em>at 627, 529 S.E.2d at 835. The holding in <em>Hall </em>is limited to cases where inadmissible evidence is used to prove a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 as a predicate to the involuntary manslaughter charge. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Hall, </em>the Court dismissed the involuntary manslaughter charge because the preliminary breath test analysis was admitted to prove a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, in direct contravention of Code \u00a7 18.2-267(E), which provides that such results \"shall not be admitted into evidence....\" <em>Id. </em>That is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">. In 2003, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6 to eliminate the provision requiring the arresting officer to give the accused a form setting forth the procedures for obtaining an independent analysis of the blood sample. <em>See </em>Va. Acts, chs. 933, 936. Stevens was charged before the amendment took effect, and, therefore, the amendment does not apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">. Appellant argues that <em>Artis v. City of Suffolk, </em>19 Va.App. 168, 450 S.E.2d 165 (1994), and <em>Shoemaker v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 61, 441 S.E.2d 354 (1994), support his contention that the officer\u2019s failure to ensure that appellant received the form is fatal to his conviction. <em>Artis </em>held that merely showing a form to the accused is insufficient to comply with the requirement that the form be given to the accused and, therefore, requires dismissal of the DUI charge. <em>Artis, </em>19 Va.App. at 170-71, 450 S.E.2d at 166-67. <em>Shoemaker </em>held that failure to substantially comply with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6 required dismissal of the DUI charge on the rationale that independent test results could have provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ed the accused with exculpatory evidence. <em>Shoemaker, </em>18 Va.App. at 64, 441 S.E.2d at 356. However, in both of those cases, the defendant was charged with DUI under Code \u00a7 18.2-266, not with aggravated involuntary manslaughter under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, the statute at issue in the instant case. While failure to substantially comply with the procedural requirements for testing blood and breath samples under the implied consent law may bar the Commonwealth from a prosecution under the DUI statute (Code \u00a7 18.2-266) and may bar the Commonwealth from using those test results, that failure does not bar prosecution for aggravated involuntary manslaughter under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. Given our holding, we need not address the Commonwealth's alternative arguments: that there was no violation of the implied consent law; that only substantive violations of the implied consent law are relevant for the purposes of applying that statute; or, even if the violations are substantive, the proper remedy is not to dismiss the charge, but to rebut or suppress the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">. We note that the legislature used the word \"ordinance\" and not \"statute,\u201d removing any argument that Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 is included under that language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">. It is not necessary for the other implied consent law statutes to recite the statutes to which they apply because they are either definitional (Code \u00a7 18.2-268.1), or they refer back to other provisions of the implied consent law (Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.6, 18.2-268.7 and 18.2-268.11). In 2004, the General Assembly added Code \u00a7 18.2-272 to most of the statutes cited above; <em>see </em>Va. Acts, ch. 1013.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b289-5\">. It is important to note that Code \u00a7 18.2-51.4 is the equivalent of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B), except that it applies in cases of \"serious bodily injury of another person resulting in permanent and significant physical impairment\u201d instead of death and provides for a different felony classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-187.02 states that \"the written results of blood alcohol tests conducted upon persons receiving medical treatment in a hospital emergency room are admissible in evidence as a business records exception to the hearsay rule in prosecutions\u201d for violations of several named code provisions, including Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, involuntary manslaughter resulting from driving while intoxicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b296-10\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aob\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">The Commonwealth indicted Stevens for driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>involuntary manslaughter. The latter offense is statutorily defined, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">A. Any person who, as a result of driving under the influence in violation of clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-266 or any local ordinance substantially similar thereto unintentionally causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">B. If, in addition, the conduct of the defendant was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life, he shall be guilty of aggravated involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of not less than one nor more than 20 years, one year of which shall be a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1. This prosecution and conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 implicated only Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014266(ii) because no allegation or evidence concerned any substance other than alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The trial judge found that the arresting officer failed to comply with the Virginia implied consent law because he did not arrest Stevens within the statutorily mandated period following the accident, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, and because he failed to give Stevens a form to request an independent analysis of his blood, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6. Based upon his findings that the officer violated Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6 of the implied consent law and that the conduct of the arresting officer did not constitute substantial compliance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6, the trial judge dismissed the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of Stevens for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-266. In so ruling, the trial judge relied upon our decisions in <em>Artis v. City of Suffolk, </em>19 Va.App. 168, 450 S.E.2d 165 (1994) (reversing the conviction for failure to provide the accused with a form to make election for independent blood analysis, which \u201cnegates the possibility of \u2018substantial compliance\u2019 \u201d), and <em>Shoemaker v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 61, 441 S.E.2d 354 (1994) (holding that the Commonwealth is foreclosed from prosecution upon failure to comply with statutory procedures of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>As we noted in <em>Shoemaker, </em>the Supreme Court has explained the necessity of \u201cdiligent adherence\u201d to the implied consent law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">\u201cThe provisions of [Code \u00a7 18.2-268 <em>et seq.\\ </em>serve a salutary purpose. A chemical analysis of one\u2019s blood provides a scientifically accurate method of determining whether a person is intoxicated, removes the question from the field of speculation and supplies the best evidence for that determination. It protects one who has the odor of alcohol on his breath but has not been drinking to excess, and one whose conduct may create the appearance of intoxication when he is suffering from some physical condition over which he has no control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">18 Va.App. at 64-65, 441 S.E.2d at 356 (quoting <em>Walton v. City of Roanoke, </em>204 Va. 678, 683, 133 S.E.2d 315, 319 (1963)). Thus, we held that dismissal of the prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 is the only adequate remedy for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6. <em>Shoemaker, </em>18 Va.App. at 64, 441 S.E.2d at 356. Suppression of the test results does not cure a violation of the implied consent law because \u201cthe accused [is deprived] of a significant method of establishing his innocence.\u201d <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 148, 150, 421 S.E.2d 674, 676 (1992). We explained that a mere refusal to admit in evidence the Commonwealth\u2019s test results would not compensate for the deprivation of the statutory right in cases where the Commonwealth is permitted to proceed at trial upon the arresting officer\u2019s testimony. This is so because \u201cthe independent test results could have been exculpatory.\u201d <em>Shoemaker, </em>18 Va.App. at 64, 441 S.E.2d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">I would hold that the reasoning underlying these cases, as well as the express language of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, mandate the conclusion that the trial judge erred in failing also to dismiss the prosecution of Stevens for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1. We have unequivocally drawn the dependent connection between a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 and a prosecution for aggravated manslaughter under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1. Our case law could not be clearer on this point. We held in <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 616, 627, 529 S.E.2d 829, 835 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(2000) <em>(en banc), </em>that \u201c[t]he manslaughter statute under which appellant was tried expressly references a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 as the predicate for the prosecution of aggravated manslaughter,\u201d and we further held that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth can prove a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 if and only if it proves a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d In other words, \u201ca prosecution for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 <em>is necessarily a prosecution under [Code] \u00a7 </em>18.2-266.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>32 Va.App. at 616, 529 S.E.2d at 835 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The express wording of the statute demonstrates that to convict an accused of involuntary vehicular manslaughter, the Commonwealth must prove a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 because the manslaughter statute expressly provides that \u201c[a]ny person who, as a result of driving under the influence in violation of clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-266 ... unintentionally causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(A). If there could be any doubt about the dependent connection between Code \u00a7 18.2-266 and Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, the legislature eliminated that doubt. The legislative intent is clear: by enacting \u201crebuttable presumptions\u201d that arise in any prosecution for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 when a blood analysis results from arrests under Code \u00a7 18.2-266, the General Assembly codified the dependent connection. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-269 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">A. In any prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 18.2-36.1 or \u00a7 18.2-266(ii), or any similar ordinance, the amount of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time of the alleged offense as indicated by a chemical analysis of a sample of the accused\u2019s blood or breath to determine the alcohol content of his blood in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.1 through 18.2-268.12 shall give rise to the following rebuttable presumptions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">(1) If there was at that time 0.05 percent or less by weight by volume of alcohol in the accused\u2019s blood or 0.05 grams or less per 210 liters of the accused\u2019s breath, it shall be presumed that the accused was not under the influence of alcohol intoxicants at the time of the alleged offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>(2) If there was at that time in excess of 0.05 percent but less than 0.08 percent by weight by volume of alcohol in the accused\u2019s blood or 0.05 grams but less than 0.08 grams per 210 liters of the accused\u2019s breath, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the accused was or was not under the influence of alcohol intoxicants at the time of the alleged offense, but such facts may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">(3) If there was at that time 0.08 percent or more by weight by volume of alcohol in the accused\u2019s blood or 0.08 grams or more per 210 liters of the accused\u2019s breath, it shall be presumed that the accused was under the influence of alcohol intoxicants at the time of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Indeed, the connection between the statutes is amply demonstrated in this case by the Commonwealth\u2019s use, in this prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, of the blood analysis evidence which was derived from blood drawn from Stevens under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2. The Commonwealth used the blood analysis evidence from blood drawn from Stevens under the implied consent law. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified that the analysis revealed Stevens\u2019s blood alcohol content was .12 by weight by volume, which would result in decreased steering accuracy, decreased vision, decreased decision-making ability, and a general loss of coordination. This evidence was critical in establishing that Stevens was intoxicated and that Stevens\u2019s conduct met the gross and wanton standard, elevating his crime to aggravated involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Stevens\u2019s consent for the taking and testing of his blood was statutorily implied and sanctioned because \u201che [was] arrested for violation of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2. Furthermore, by denying Stevens\u2019s motion to bar the prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, the trial judge has permitted the Commonwealth to benefit from its violation of the implied consent law. Because of the violation of the implied consent law following his arrest, Stevens had no opportunity to obtain an independent analysis of his blood and, therefore, was precluded from any opportunity that might have advantaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>him under the rebuttable presumption statute of Code \u00a7 18.2-269. <em>See Shoemaker, </em>18 Va.App. at 64, 441 S.E.2d at 356 (holding that dismissal was required because \u201cthe independent test results could have been exculpatory\u201d). As we held in <em>Breeden, </em>\u201c[o]nce the Commonwealth has elected to have a driver take a blood or breath test pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268, the driver has a right to receive the benefits of the test.\u201d 15 Va.App. at 150, 421 S.E.2d at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
