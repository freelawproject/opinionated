Denise (grandfather) appeals the trial court\u2019s decision awarding primary physical custody of his minor granddaughter (the child) to the child\u2019s biological father, Philip C. Tencer (father). Grandfather contends the trial court abused its discretion by: (1) finding a material change in circumstances had occurred; (2) finding it in the child\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>interests to award physical custody to father; and (3) making certain evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Father cross-appeals, presenting five questions that he addressed in four arguments. In his first three arguments, father contends the trial court violated his rights under the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions by continuing joint legal custody in him and grandfather and by failing to award him sole legal custody of his child. In these arguments, he takes issue with the trial court\u2019s procedures, interpretations, and application of the law relating to a South Carolina order and agreement and his constitutionally protected liberty interest and child-rearing autonomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In his fourth argument, father asserts the trial court\u2019s decision to continue joint legal custody lacks sufficient evidence to support it. He argues that his fitness as a parent and grandfather\u2019s lack of cooperation regarding the South Carolina order required a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">On August 29, 1997, Mary A. Denise (mother) gave birth to the child. She cared for and maintained physical custody of the child until her death on September 6, 2001 from terminal breast cancer, a diagnosis she received in July 1999. At these times, father was married to his present wife, Laura Tencer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Father has never been married to the child\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">In 2001, while residing in South Carolina, the child\u2019s mother filed a petition in the Richland County, South Carolina family court to terminate father\u2019s parental rights. Grandfather was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>present at the hearing held on February 23, 2001, and \u201cmoved to be included as a party to this action.\u201d As reflected in the order, \u201cBoth parties and the guardian <em>ad litem </em>consented to his inclusion as a party, and [grandfather] consented to the jurisdiction of the court. He is a full participant to the terms of this settlement agreement.\u201d In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the family court found that grandfather \u201cshould be and is hereby made a party to this action with the same rights, responsibilities, and obligations as any other party.\u201d The order further reflected that the parties had entered an agreement \u201cwhich resolved all matters arising from this action and addresses the impending custody matters which are expected to arise in the near future.\u201d It incorporated the terms of the agreement in its order, providing, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">[Mother] shall remain the custodial parent of [the child] until her death with liberal visitation accorded [father]; the schedule to be agreed upon by [mother] and [father]. Upon the death of [mother], the parties have agreed to a joint custody arrangement for the minor child with the minor child primarily residing with [grandfather] and the goal to unite the minor child and [father] as is set forth in the attached agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The family court judge also made and included in the order the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">[A]ll three parties have fully read the attached Agreement, believed the Agreement to be fair, and desired that the Agreement be approved by the Court. Furthermore, counsel for the parties represented that the Agreement had been negotiated over a period of several days with each party having an opportunity to review the Agreement with his or her counsel prior to ... signing it....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The family court judge dismissed with prejudice mother\u2019s action to terminate father\u2019s parental rights, finding that all parties freely and voluntarily entered into the agreement without duress or coercion and that \u201call of the parties have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>waived their right to a trial and desire that the Court approve the Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">On December 12, 2001, shortly after mother died, father filed a motion and petition in the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, the first of several motions and petitions seeking court intervention in the visitation and custody dispute between him and grandfather. At that time, the child was living with grandfather in Fairfax.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In his motion, father requested that the child be permitted to visit him in California in December 2001 and to vacation with his family in Utah in February 2002. In his petition, father alleged that the child \u201cis a child whose custody and visitation require determination pursuant to\u201d the February 23, 2001 South Carolina family court order. The juvenile court denied father\u2019s request that the child be allowed to visit with him and his family during December 2001; however, it granted his motion to allow the child to vacation with the family in February 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">On January 2, 2002, father filed another petition in the juvenile court, this time seeking physical custody of the child. Before a hearing could be held, grandfather filed a petition in the Fairfax juvenile court seeking primary physical and sole legal custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In response to the parties\u2019 petitions, the juvenile court entered a consent order on June 9, 2003,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> declaring that father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>and grandfather \u201crepresented that they have reached an agreement related to the custody and visitation of [the child].\u201d Finding that the order is in the child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court decreed that father and grandfather \u201cshall retain joint legal custody of the minor child, with physical custody and the primary physical residence of [the child] remaining with [grandfather].\u201d The order outlined the responsibilities and rights of the parties, and father\u2019s visitation schedule with the child during the summer, Christmas vacation, and spring break. The order also required the parties to cooperate and communicate frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Father subsequently appealed the juvenile court\u2019s June 9, 2003 order to the Fairfax County circuit court. After a seven-day <em>ore terms </em>hearing during which the trial court received and considered extensive testimonial and documentary evidence, including transcripts, reports, evaluations, and depositions, it entered an order on July 9, 2004 finding that a material change of circumstances had occurred since February 2001. It specifically noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHR\">Mother [had] died ... and [that] the relationship between [father] and [the child] is significantly more developed than it was in February 2001. [The child] is older. She\u2019s beginning the first grade in the fall and her situation has changed ... she\u2019s developed a relationship with [father\u2019s] family which she did not have in 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The trial court also concluded that the plan for uniting the child with her father and which had been incorporated into the South Carolina and Fairfax juvenile court orders,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had proved difficult, if not impossible, to implement as contemplated. Among the difficulties in implementation identified by the trial court was the failure of both the order and agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>clearly define the role of the various \u201cplayers,\u201d an omission that had led to inconsistent interpretations and implementation of the provisions by all involved, including the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>and her individual therapist. Notably, the trial judge commented that \u201cthe professionals became the decision-makers [acting in the stead of] the father and the grandfather,\u201d frustrating the intent of the agreement \u201cby not allowing the father and the grandfather to develop the relationship ... they needed [in order] to be able to form a working partnership in arriving at joint decisions for the best interests of [the child].\u201d The court found the result both untenable and unintended under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Notwithstanding the changes in circumstances found to have occurred, the trial court rejected father\u2019s contention that they warranted a change in the legal custodial arrangements. It identified the following factors as bearing significantly on its resolution of the question: the relationship that the child had developed with father, his wife, and family; the failures associated with the implementation of the South Carolina order and agreement as set forth, <em>supra; </em>the several frustrated attempts by father to have visitation with the child; and the child\u2019s continuing inability to \u201cchange [her] attachment from the grandfather to her father.\u201d The trial court found that the latter problem was caused, in part, by the \u201ccontinuing effect on the grandfather of [mother\u2019s] death\u201d and the circumstances in grandfather\u2019s household which \u201cin some ways ... prevented [the child] from moving on.\u201d The trial judge further found that grandfather \u201chas not actively supported the contact and relationship with [father] as [well as] he could have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">That said, the trial judge determined that, while father had an understanding of the child\u2019s needs, grandfather\u2019s understanding of those needs was better because he was with her on a daily basis. The court referred to grandfather as the \u201cperson who [the child] turns to, and ... [grandfather] fulfills those needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Based on these findings, the trial court determined that the material changes in circumstances found to have occurred did not warrant a modification of the joint legal custodial arrangement. It, therefore, denied father\u2019s motion for sole legal custody and continued joint legal custody between him and grandfather. The court\u2019s resolution of the issues was based on its application of the best interests of the child standard and its conclusion that father had waived the rights accorded him as a parent under the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">With respect to father\u2019s petition for sole physical custody, the trial court found that father\u2019s relationship with the child \u201cis at a plateau and it can\u2019t go any further unless the child lives with him\u201d and that it was in the child\u2019s best interests to award <em>primary </em>physical custody to him. Grandfather\u2019s appeal and father\u2019s cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Father argues on appeal that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to grant him sole legal custody.' His principal contention is that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in deciding the child\u2019s legal custody in this case. Father asserts the trial court improperly considered and relied on the South Carolina order and agreement in determining the standard of review. As a result, he contends the trial court erroneously deprived him of certain rights guaranteed to him as a parent under the United States Constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and disregarded the legal standard established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>in <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). Father also contends that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for sole legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In his appeal, grandfather challenges the award of primary physical custody to the father on the ground the evidence is insufficient to support the decision. He also challenges the propriety of certain evidentiary rulings, claiming they were erroneous and prejudicial to his case. We address each party\u2019s claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">FATHER\u2019S ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">I. <em>The Proper Legal Standard to Apply</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Citing <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998); and <em>Griffin v. Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. 77, 581 S.E.2d 899 (2003), as primary authorities, father argues that the trial court\u2019s decision awarding grandfather joint legal custody \u201cin a decree separate from the South Carolina Order contravenes the Father\u2019s constitutionally protected fundamental liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to raise his daughter without interference from a third party or the state, absent clear and convincing evidence that he is unfit.\u201d Father summarizes his argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">For the trial court to have completely denied the Father\u2019s request for sole custody of [the child], therefore, it must have found that by clear and convincing evidence that the Father is an unfit parent, that [the child] will suffer \u201cactual harm\u201d if she did not visit, let alone live with the Grandfather.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>To be sure, grandfather failed to either allege or prove father\u2019s unfitness. However, we find that father\u2019s reliance on <em>Troxel, Williams, </em>and <em>Griffin </em>is misplaced, and we find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of father\u2019s petition to place sole legal custody of the child in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">A. <em>Troxel v. Granville</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In <em>Troxel, </em>the Supreme Court examined and discussed a parent\u2019s constitutional right in the context of a dispute between the child\u2019s parents and a third party, namely, the child\u2019s grandparents. A Washington statute, which provided that \u201c \u2018[a]ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time,\u2019 \u201d was at issue. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 61, 120 S.Ct. at 2057-58. It authorized the court to \u201corder visitation rights for any person when visitation may serve the best interest of the child whether or not there has been any change of circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Although never married, Troxel\u2019s son and Gran-ville had two daughters together. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 120 S.Ct. at 2057. They separated in 1991 and, in 1993, Troxel\u2019s son committed suicide. <em>Id. </em>Five months after the suicide, Granville sought to limit visitation for the paternal grandparents, Jenifer and Gary Troxel. <em>Id. </em>at 60-61, 120 S.Ct. at 2057-58. The trial court granted the Troxels\u2019 petition for visitation pursuant to the Washington visitation statute. <em>Id. </em>at 61, 120 S.Ct. at 2057-58. On appeal, the Washington Supreme Court found the statute facially unconstitutional, effectively striking it down. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 120 S.Ct. at 2058-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Discussing the propriety of governmental intrusions into the parent-child relationship, Justice O\u2019Connor, writing for a plurality of four justices, underscored the historical roots of the fundamental principles at issue. <em>See id. </em>at 65-66,120 S.Ct. at 2059-60. The Court recognized that \u201cthe interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2059-60 (citing prior United States Supreme Court precedent recognizing the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children). It also allied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>fundamental liberty interest to the presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 120 S.Ct. at 2061 (citing <em>Parham v. J.R., </em>442 U.S. 584, 602, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2504, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Moving from principle to practice, Justice O\u2019Conner noted that the trial court\u2019s \u201c \u2018commonsensical\u2019\u201d conclusion that it \u201c \u2018is normally in the best interest of the children to spend quality time with the grandparent\u2019 \u201d unless there is proof that such contact would adversely affect the children incorrectly accorded the grandparents a presumption in their favor and \u201cdirectly contravened the traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 120 S.Ct. at 2061-62. A presumption favoring the grandparent\u2019s right to visitation failed to protect the parent\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning the rearing of her children. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 120 S.Ct. at 2061-62.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such was the fundamental infirmity of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">Once the visitation petition has been filed in court and the matter is placed before a judge, a parent\u2019s decision that visitation would not be in the child\u2019s best interest is accorded no deference. Section 26.10.160(3) contains no requirement that a court accord the parent\u2019s decision any presumption of validity or any weight whatsoever. Instead, the Washington statute places the best-interest determination solely in the hands of the judge. Should the judge disagree with the parent\u2019s estimation of the child\u2019s best interests, the judge\u2019s view necessarily prevails. Thus, in practical effect, in the State of Washington a court can disregard and overturn <em>any </em>decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 67,120 S.Ct. at 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Beyond the articulation of the fundamental constitutional principle at issue, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel </em>is limited to the specific due process infirmities of the Washington statute; it left to the state courts the task of developing the law to be applied in resolving child custody and visitation disputes between a parent and third party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That said, the overarching analytical principle that derives from <em>Troxel </em>and its progeny can be identified as focused on the need to determine and apply the correct burden of proof in light of the presumption that a fit parent acts in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">B. <em>Williams v. Williams</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">In <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998), the Virginia Supreme Court had earlier examined and reaffirmed a parent\u2019s fundamental right to care for and make decisions regarding his or her child. There, the paternal grandparents filed a petition pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B) seeking visitation with their granddaughter after the child\u2019s mother and father refused to allow them further visitation with the child. The child\u2019s parents lived together, and no allegations of parental unfitness were proffered or established. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 501 S.E.2d at 417. The trial court found \u201cthat the child\u2019s best interests would be served by having visitation with her grandparents\u201d and ordered visitation against the wishes of both parents. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 501 S.E.2d at 417. The parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>appealed, arguing \u201cthat Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B), as it pertains to nonparent visitation, interferes with their right to autonomy in child rearing and, hence, violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On appeal to this Court, we recognized that \u201cthe right of the parents in raising their children is a fundamental right recognized by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d and \u201c[sjtate interference with a fundamental right must be justified by a \u2018compelling state interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>24 Va.App. 778, 788, 485 S.E.2d 651, 654 (1997) (explaining that protecting a child\u2019s health or welfare is a recognized compelling state interest), <em>modified and affirmed on appeal, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998). Thus, we held that the burden of proof required to support a court\u2019s award of visitation with a grandparent over the parent\u2019s objection is one of \u201cactual harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784-85, 485 S.E.2d 651, 485 S.E.2d at 654.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">For the constitutional requirement to be satisfied, before visitation can be ordered over the objection of the child\u2019s parents, a court must find an actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare without such visitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">The \u201cbest interests\u201d standard is considered in determining visitation only <em>after </em>a finding of harm if visitation is not ordered. Without a finding of harm to the child, a court may not impose its subjective notions of \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d over the united objection of the child\u2019s parents without violating the constitutional rights of those parents. In this regard, the parents\u2019 constitutional rights take precedence over the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\"><em>Id. </em>We reversed and remanded for the trial court to give proper deference to the parental presumption.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>C. <em>Griffin v. Griffin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Two years ago, we decided <em>Griffin v. Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. 77, 581 S.E.2d 899 (2003). There, Andrea Griffin, wife of Elbert Griffin, conceived and gave birth to a child while they were separated. <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 581 S.E.2d at 900. Husband believed he was the child\u2019s father and treated the child as his own. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 581 S.E.2d at 900. Wife and the child lived with wife\u2019s mother but allowed husband weekly visitation with the child. <em>Id. A </em>short time later, a paternity test established that husband was not the child\u2019s father. <em>Id. </em>Upon learning the results of the paternity test, wife denied him further visitation. <em>Id. </em>The biological father paid child support, but he was not involved with the child, and he did not request that husband obtain visitation. <em>Id. </em>The trial court held for husband, \u201cstating that the \u2018best interests\u2019 of the child would be served by ordering visitation over the mother\u2019s objection and that not doing so would be \u2018detrimental\u2019 to the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81-82, 581 S.E.2d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Reciting the rule explained in <em>Williams, </em>\u201cwhen fit parents object to non-parental visitation, a trial court should apply \u2018the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard in determining visitation <em>only after </em>it finds harm if visitation is not ordered,\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. at 83, 581 S.E.2d at 902 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>24 Va.App. at 784-85, 485 S.E.2d at 654), we reversed the trial court, holding there was no clear and convincing evidence of \u201cactual harm\u201d as required by <em>Williams. Id. </em>at 85-86, 581 S.E.2d at 903 (explaining that \u201cthe trial court collapsed the two legal standards together,\u201d and \u201ctreated the actual-harm requirement as simply a restatement of the best-interests test\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">As these decisions make manifest, while parental rights have long been recognized under the common law, historically, grandparents have not enjoyed similar preferential treatment. <em>See Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 96-97, 120 S.Ct. at 2076-77 (Kennedy, J. dissenting) (generally, \u201ccontemporary state-court decisions acknowledge that \u2018[historically, grandparents had no legal right of visitation,\u2019 and it is safe to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>assume other third parties would have fared no better in court\u201d); <em>see also Linder v. Linder, </em>348 Ark. 322, 72 S.W.3d 841, 855 (2002) (\u201c[Gjrandparental visitation has no historic roots in the common law but rather is a legislated creature of the late twentieth century\u201d; listing other state cases stating the same fact.). Therefore, grandparents generally come before the court merely as a \u201c \u2018Person with a legitimate interest.\u2019 \u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.1 (defining and listing examples of persons other than fit natural parents who are considered persons with a legitimate interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">However, it surely does not follow that rights analogous to the constitutional rights enjoyed by a parent may not be established by other means, the most salient of which are court-adjudicated findings that a non-parental actor, such as a grandparent, is acting and will continue to act in accordance with the best interests of the child and that the non-parental party is a proper custodian. Were that not the case, adoptive parents, relatives, and other non-parental third parties, including the state, could not be found proper parties to whom an award of custody may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We conclude that the decisions in <em>Troxel, Williams, </em>and <em>Griffin </em>are inapposite and do not support father\u2019s argument because they involved situations in which a non-parent with no custodial rights requested visitation against the wishes of parents whose constitutional right to child-rearing autonomy had not been in the least altered. <em>Troxel </em>did not address the factual circumstance that confronted the trial court here. Moreover, to apply the <em>Troxel </em>parental presumption in this case, where grandfather shared joint legal custody with the father and had sole or primary physical custody, not only disregards the factual distinctions that exist, but also renders the principle of custody and the status of custodian meaningless.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Two Virginia Supreme Court cases, albeit decided prior to <em>Troxel, </em>support the conclusion that the trial court applied the correct legal principles in this case.

The juvenile court awarded custody to the father, as did the trial court on appeal by the grandmother. <em>Id. </em>at 314, 227 S.E.2d at 742.

The order further provided for temporary placement of the children with the grandmother. <em>Consequently, the father here, like the father in Dyer, when he instituted the present proceeding, was not clothed with the parental presumption generally accorded natural parents in a dispute with non-parents, because his parental custody rights were altered by the 1971 order. </em>We hold, therefore, that in this proceeding the welfare of these children is the paramount consideration, and that the burden was upon the father to prove the circumstances had so changed since the 1971 order that it would be in the children\u2019s best interests to transfer custody to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 315-16, 227 S.E.2d at 743 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Two months after its decision in <em>McEntire, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court decided <em>Watson v. Shepard, </em>217 Va. 538, 229 S.E.2d 897 (1976), a case involving a custody dispute between the natural mother and paternal relatives who were seeking to adopt the child. In <em>Watson, </em>the mother had executed a notarized statement which stated, \u201c T give my consent for [the Shepards, the child\u2019s paternal aunt and the aunt\u2019s husband] to have custody of [my] daughter____\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 229 S.E.2d at 898. The mother explained that she was unable to properly care for the child at the time and felt the child \u201c \u2018would be better off with [the Shepards] ... until I could get myself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>straightened out.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589-40, 229 S.E.2d at 898. After hearing evidence, including testimony from a juvenile court officer that the mother said \u201c \u2018she expected to try to regain the custody when she settled down,\u2019 \u201d the juvenile court entered an order awarding the Shepards custody and granting the parents reasonable visitation. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41, 229 S.E.2d at 899. Two years later, the mother petitioned to regain custody of her child. At the hearing on the petition, the Shepards expressed a desire to adopt the child. <em>Id. </em>at 542-43, 229 S.E.2d at 900. The trial court \u201cfound \u2018it is in the best interests of the said child that she remain in the custody of the said Shepards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 229 S.E.2d at 901. As to the Shepards\u2019 adoption petition, the trial court found that the mother \u201c \u2018is not a fit person to have the custody of the said infant child; and that it is in the best interests of the [child] that she be adopted by [the Shepards].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to apply a best interests test and its decision denying custody to the mother. <em>Id. </em>Regarding the adoption request, the Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, which granted the Shepards\u2019 request to adopt. <em>Id. </em>As to custody, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">[The] juvenile court order relieved the mother of [the child\u2019s] custody and awarded her custody to the Shepards. That order was not merely <em>pro forma, </em>as the mother now contends, but it was based upon her voluntary relinquishment of custody, as evidenced by a written statement executed by her, upon results of a thorough investigation, and upon a hearing by a court of competent jurisdiction at which the report of investigation was considered and the evidence heard. <em>Consequently, the mother\u2019s parental custody rights were altered and for her to be entitled to a later change in custody, the burden was upon her to show the circumstances had so changed since entry of the foregoing order that it would be in [the child\u2019s] best interests to transfer custody to her; the burden was not upon the Shepards, as the mother argues, to show parental unfitness.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 544-45, 229 S.E.2d at 901 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We perceive no principled basis for reaching a different result here. Father twice consented, by court order, to place primary physical custody and joint legal custody in grandfather: once in South Carolina and again in a consent order filed in the Fairfax juvenile court. Presumptively acting in the child\u2019s best interests, the father agreed that the child\u2019s best interests were served by placing custody in grandfather. He also implicitly and necessarily agreed that grandfather, as custodian, was acting and would continue to act in the child\u2019s best interests. The subsequent court order confirmed that factual conclusion. Thus, while grandfather is not accorded a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>constitutionally-derived legal presumption that he will act in the best interest of the child and is thus a proper custodian, he was vested with custodial status and all its attendant legal attributes by the father\u2019s agreement embodied in two court orders. <em>See Lindsay v. Lindsay, </em>218 Va. 599, 602-04, 288 S.E.2d 817, 819 (1977) (consent order was contractual modification and binding upon the parties (citing <em>Durrett v. Durrett, </em>204 Va. 59, 63, 129 S.E.2d 50, 53 (1963))).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">As a matter of legal definition and fact, according grandfather the status of custodian gave him precisely the same child-rearing autonomy as that enjoyed by a parent. As the child\u2019s legal custodian, grandfather was vested with the \u201cright to have physical custody of the child, to determine and redetermine where and with whom [the child] shall live, the right and duty to protect, train and discipline [the child] and to provide [the child] with food, shelter, education and ordinary medical care____\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-228. There is nothing in our jurisprudence that supports the conclusion that legal and/or physical custody placed in a non-parent is subject to diminished protection under the law, simply because the individual seeking modification of that status is the child\u2019s parent. <em>See McEntire, </em>217 Va. at 315-16, 227 S.E.2d at 743 (father was not clothed with parental presumption after court of competent jurisdiction made a judicial determination reflected in valid order); <em>Albert v. Ramirez, </em>45 Va.App. 799, 807-09, 613 S.E.2d 865, 868-70 (2005) (natural mother was not entitled to <em>Troxel </em>and <em>Williams </em>presumption in her motion to modify custody and visitation where juvenile court entered valid consent decree providing stepfather with joint custody).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly applied the best interests test to determine the child\u2019s custody in this case. Where father is no longer \u201cclothed with the parental presumption generally accorded natural parents in a dispute with non-parents, ... it follows that the best interests test is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>appropriately applied in resolving the custody dispute between father and grandparent.\u201d <em>McEntire, </em>217 Va. at 316, 227 S.E.2d at 743<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; <em>see also Watson, </em>217 Va. at 544, 229 S.E.2d at 901; <em>Dyer, </em>212 Va. at 456, 184 S.E.2d at 792. We, furthermore, perceive nothing in <em>Troxel </em>that compels a different result. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s clear and broad articulation of the constitutional rights at issue in such dispute, the opinion in <em>Troxel </em>is limited in nature. The plurality rested its \u201cdecision on the sweeping breadth of [the Washington statute] and the application of that broad, unlimited power in this case,\u201d and it declined to prescribe the degree of deference or define the standard of review required before a non-parent could obtain visitation or custody. 530 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064. Clearly, <em>Troxel </em>did not define the burden of proof to be applied or the factors to be established and considered when the court is faced with a custody dispute between a grandparent and a parent, both of whom have custodial rights. Thus, the results are the same, whether we denominate father\u2019s agreement, as embodied in the court orders, to be a relinquishment of at least some of the constitutional rights enunciated by Troxel<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as the trial court did, or whether we simply find that his agreement, as incorporated into two court orders, factually and, as a matter of law, established an equality of interests and rights as between father and grandfather, analogous to the equality posited when two fit parents who are both deemed to be acting in the child\u2019s best interests dispute custody.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Finally, we note that an initial custody determination was not at issue before the court. Rather, the parties requested a modification of a preexisting custody order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cA trial court, in determining whether a change of custody should be made, must apply a two-pronged test: (1) whether there has been a [material] change in circumstances since the most recent custody award; and (2) whether a change in custody would be in the best interests of the child. Whether a change of circumstances exists is a factual finding that will not be disturbed on appeal if the finding is supported by credible evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"><em>Ohlen v. Shively, </em>16 Va.App. 419, 423, 430 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1993) (quoting <em>Visikides v. Derr, </em>3 Va.App. 69, 70, 348 S.E.2d 40, 41 (1986)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">After a material change of circumstances has been established, a trial judge, in determining the best interests of a child, may properly consider the factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.2. Those factors are normally considered in a custody hearing and include any \u201cother factors as are necessary to consider the best interests of the child or children.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.2(7). In addition, the statute further instructs that the court \u201cshall give primary consideration to the welfare of the child or children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>these factors clearly satisfies the requirement that \u201ca change in custody ... be in the best interests of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXN\"><em>Id. </em>at 423-24, 430 S.E.2d at 561 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Father agreed to be bound by the South Carolina order, which reflected the mother\u2019s desire for the grandfather to act as the child\u2019s custodian until father established a more sound relationship with the child. The agreement was prepared in contemplation of her death. Thus, her passing was not a sudden, unplanned event, which they could not have anticipated. The South Carolina family court entered a seven-page custody order after hearing testimony from the parties, reviewing the record in the case, and evaluating the agreement. The parties requested the family court to approve the agreement and incorporate it into the final order along with other related matters. In its concluding paragraph, the family court judge \u201cordered that the Agreement attached hereto and the terms included herein are hereby approved and adopted as the Order of this Court, to be fully enforceable by the contempt powers of this Court.\u201d The fact that a valid order was entered in South Carolina, registered and filed in Fairfax, after which father agreed to the entry of a subsequent consent order reiterating grandfather\u2019s right to joint legal custody, convinces us that the situation here is readily distinguishable from a dispute between a parent and non-parent, like the situations in <em>Troxel </em>and <em>Williams. </em>\u201cA party must obey an existing custody order until a modification order supersedes it.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>26 Va.App. 135, 146, 493 S.E.2d 668, 673 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Because the matter on appeal from the circuit court was not an initial custody and visitation determination, father, as the party seeking to modify the prior custody and visitation consent order, bore the burden of proving that a material change of circumstances had occurred since the entry of the consent order and that a change in visitation would be in the best interests of the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>Albert, </em>45 Va.App. at 807, 613 S.E.2d at 868 (finding that, \u201c[ujnlike <em>Troxel, </em>this case involves not an initial\u201d custody or visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>petition filed by a non-parent, but \u201can attempt on the part of the natural parent to terminate custody granted to a [non-parent] pursuant to a final valid consent decree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We, therefore, find no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of father\u2019s motion to vest sole legal custody of the child in him at this time. The court neither applied the incorrect legal standard nor violated any constitutional right enjoyed by father in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">GRANDFATHER\u2019S ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Finally, we turn to grandfather\u2019s contentions on appeal. He argues that the court erred in finding that a material change of circumstances had occurred which warranted awarding physical custody of the child to father on the ground the evidence failed to support the result. We disagree and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">When a court hears evidence at an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, its decision is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Piatt v. Piatt, </em>27 Va.App. 426, 432, 499 S.E.2d 567, 570 (1998). On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting that party the benefit of any reasonable inferences. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Donnell v. Donnell, </em>20 Va.App. 37, 39, 455 S.E.2d 256, 257 (1995) (citing <em>McGuire v. McGuire, </em>10 Va.App. 248, 250, 391 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1990)). Consistent with the principle that an appellate court does not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court, we are bound by the credibility and weight determinations made by the trier of fact and its decision to accept or reject a witness\u2019 testimony. <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986); <em>see also Richardson v. Richardson, </em>242 Va. 242, 246, 409 S.E.2d 148, 152 (1991). Applying the best interests of the child standard and review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ing the evidence in the light most favorable to father, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We, likewise, find no error in the court\u2019s decisions on certain evidentiary matters in the case. Grandfather contends, first, that the trial court improperly admitted testimony of certain witnesses on the ground that he was prevented from taking their depositions, \u201cresulting in a trial by ambush\u201d precluding him from \u201cimpeaching or effectively cross-examining these witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Rule 4:12(a) allows \u201c[a] party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby, [to] apply for an order compelling discovery.\u201d Rule 4:12(b)(2) provides that the court in which an action is pending may sanction a party for \u201cfailure to comply with [such an] order.\u201d The record shows that grandfather filed a motion to compel on November 7, 2003, however, the motion did not include requests for information he claims was not disclosed. In his briefs, grandfather did not direct us to where in the record he filed such a motion. Absent a motion to compel and entry of an order, the trial court was not required to apply any sanctions pursuant to Rule 4:12(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Moreover, the record shows that father disclosed his witnesses, but that grandfather did not timely act to depose them. Thus, even if a motion to compel had been filed and granted, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to exclude the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Grandfather\u2019s contention that evidence of the father\u2019s marital stability and the counseling he and his wife received was improperly admitted at trial is likewise without merit. The basis of his contention is that the Tencers refused to answer deposition questions related to the issues they were later permitted to address at trial and that the Tencers had additionally moved to quash the depositions of certain counsel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ors who later at trial were permitted to testify on the same matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">As with grandfather\u2019s other discovery complaint, the record fails to show he filed a motion to compel pursuant to Rule 4:12(a). Absent such a motion and attendant order, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In addition, the trial court ruled, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1, that grandfather could not obtain privileged and confidential information from the Tencers\u2019 mental health care providers. Grandfather contends he had a right to obtain such information to rebut testimony from the Tencers\u2019 friends and from the Tencers about the stability of their marriage. The trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the mental health professionals is not before us, so we decline to address grandfather\u2019s argument on that issue. Moreover, the record shows that grandfather received a list of witnesses and had an opportunity to timely depose or move to compel discovery of them regarding the Tencers\u2019 marital stability, but did not do so. Finally, we note that grandfather had an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses at trial. Accordingly, we are unable to find that the trial court committed reversible error regarding discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\">.

The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed our decision and likewise reversed the trial court decision; however, it decided to dismiss the proceeding rather than remand it, after determining there was no evidence that the child would be harmed if visitation were not ordered. <em>Williams, </em>256 Va. at 22, 501 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\">. <em>\" </em>\u2018Joint custody\u2019 means joint legal custody where both parents retain joint responsibility for the care and control of the child and joint authority to make decisions concerning the child even though the child\u2019s primary residence may be with only one parent____\u201d Code \u00a7 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>124.1. \" \u2018Sole custody\u2019 means that one person retains responsibility for the care and control of a child and has primary authority to make decisions concerning the child.\u201d <em>Id.

Although <em>McEntire </em>was a <em>pre-Troxel </em>case, we find it still viable and its principles applicable because the facts and circumstances there and in this case are distinguishable from <em>Troxel </em>and, thus, do not require application of <em>Troxel </em>and our case law applying it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\">. Similarly, this Court has not uniformly applied the standard enunciated in <em>Troxel </em>in every custody dispute between a parent and grandparent. In cases that fall beyond the parameters of <em>Troxel </em>factually, we have reasoned that a different burden of proof may properly be applied. For example, in <em>Dotson v. Hylton, 29 </em>Va.App. 635, 513 S.E.2d 901 (1999), mother was awarded sole physical custody and joint legal custody of the child, which she shared with her divorced husband. <em>Id, </em>at 637, 513 S.E.2d at 902. The father was later incarcerated, at which time the mother petitioned for sole physical custody, however, the father requested \"reasonable visitation\" for him and the paternal grandmother. <em>Id. </em>\"[T]he trial court granted the mother sole custody of the child[, and] specifically found that denial of visitation with the father and grandmother would not be in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 513 S.E.2d at 903. On appeal, we upheld the visitation award, explaining that the <em>Williams </em>standard does not apply when one parent objects to visitation and the other parent requests it. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 513 S.E.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Subsequently, in <em>Yopp v. Hodges, </em>43 Va.App. 427, 598 S.E.2d 760 (2004), the mother of a child denied the maternal grandparents visitation with the grandchild. <em>Id, </em>at 431, 598 S.E.2d at 762. The grandparents petitioned the court for visitation. <em>Id. </em>The child's natural father who had no contact with the child \"expressly requested that the maternal grandparents be given visitation rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 598 S.E.2d at 762. The trial court found that visitation with the grandparents \" \u2018would be in the child\u2019s best interest,\u2019 \u201d and it granted the maternal grandparents\u2019 petition. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 598 S.E.2d at 763. We distinguished the holding in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Troxel </em>and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">The standard enunciated in <em>Dotson </em>applies here because father expressly supported the maternal grandparents\u2019 request for visitation with the child and the mother has never asserted, and does not now assert, that father is an unfit parent who should be deemed legally incapable of participating in parental decision making.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\"><em>Yopp, </em>43 Va.App. at 438, 598 S.E.2d at 765.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\">. Additionally, the trial court in Fairfax approved the agreement. <em>See Albert, </em>45 Va.App. at 807-08, 613 S.E.2d at 869 (discussing binding nature of valid consent decree).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b438-5\">. Although <em>McEntire </em>was a <em>pre-Troxel </em>case, we find it still viable and its principles applicable under the facts and circumstances here. <em>See, infra </em>n. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\">. In its opinion letter, the trial court carefully circumscribed the breadth of father\u2019s \"waiver,\u201d when it held that \"a change from joint legal custody to sole custody\u201d in grandfather \"would be an additional restriction of [father\u2019s] constitutional right,\u201d and something to which father did not agree, unlike his \"relinquishment of his protected constitutional right [which] occurred when he consented to joint legal custody.\u201d Thus, father only agreed to and, according to the trial court, waived joint legal custody and primary physical custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">. Father argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that any waiver he consented to was limited, citing to the agreement language which he alleges envisioned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>resumption of custody in father. Even assuming we accept his characterization of the nature of the waiver, the result remains unchanged. Once custody is posited in grandfather, together with the presumption that grandfather will act in the child's best interests, grandfather remains clothed with that custodial right and attendant presumption until he himself waives it by voluntarily relinquishing custody, or alternatively, a court of law divests grandfather of that right by finding that it no longer is in the best interests of the child to remain within his custody. Indeed, that latter resolution of the issue is precisely what occurred in this case when the court determined that physical custody in the grandfather, as established by the South Carolina order, should terminate and be awarded to father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\">. Ultimately, the court permitted grandfather to take the deposition of one of the ten witnesses after four witnesses had already testified at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
