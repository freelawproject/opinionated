On appeal, Washington contends that the trial judge erred in permitting the Commonwealth to prove his two prior robbery convictions during the guilt phase of the bifurcated trial. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">Prior to trial, Washington filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prohibit the prosecutor from introducing evidence of his two prior robbery convictions during the guilt phase of the trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Washington asserted the prior convictions were not \u201crelevant and probative\u201d and would be \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d during the guilt phase of the trial. The trial court disagreed, holding that Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1\u2014like all other Virginia recidivism statutes\u2014permitted the introduction of the prior convictions during the guilt phase. The jury found Washington guilty of malicious wounding \u201cafter having been twice convicted of a violent felony\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and \u00a7 19.2-297.1. The jury imposed a life sentence as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On appeal, Washington argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 forbids the introduction of his prior robbery convictions in the guilt phase of his jury trial. As Washington sees it, Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 serves only as a sentencing enhancement statute\u2014thus making his prior felony convictions relevant in the punishment phase of the trial, but not the guilt phase. A divided panel of our Court agreed with this reasoning. <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 157, 604 S.E.2d 92 (2004). Having considered the matter <em>en banc, </em>we hold the statute does not forbid the recidivism evidence from being presented in the guilt phase of a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">A. <em>Recidivism &amp; The Common Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKj\">Though the common law did not create recidivist crimes as such, it did develop a well-recognized order of proof in such cases. \u201cAt common law, evidence of prior convictions was received at the trial of the principal offense, and the jury decided guilt and recidivism simultaneously.\u201d <em>Recidivism &amp; Virginia\u2019s Come-Back Law, </em>48 Va. L.Rev. 597, 613 (1962). This \u201ccommon law procedure for applying recidivist statutes ... is, of course, the simplest and best known procedure.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554, 566, 87 S.Ct. 648, 655, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967) (holding common law recidivism procedure did not violate due process principles).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>As a result, \u201cin the absence of a statute in derogation of the common law, most jurisdictions have refused to deviate from the old practice.\u201d <em>Recidivism &amp; Virginia\u2019s Come-Back Law, supra, </em>at 613-14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cIt is not easy to see how, in the absence of some statutory provision permitting it,\u201d a defendant can insist that the prior convictions be excluded from the guilt phase of the principal charge. <em>People v. Sickles, </em>156 N.Y. 541, 51 N.E. 288, 289 (1898). The common law, moreover, rejected any \u201clegal presumption\u201d that ordering the proof in this manner would compromise the integrity of the trial. <em>Johnson v. People, </em>55 N.Y. 512, 514 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Consistent with the common law, the Virginia Penitentiary Act of 1796 allowed recidivism convictions to be admitted during the trial. <em>See </em>1796 Va. Acts, ch. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 42, modified by Revised Code of 1819; <em>see also Tyson v. Hening, </em>205 Va. 389, 392, 136 S.E.2d 832, 835 (1964). The Act also permitted a separate supplemental proceeding in the Richmond Circuit Court solely to determine a prisoner\u2019s recidivism status and to enhance the aggregate punishment accordingly. <em>Id. </em>Admitting the prior conviction at trial, however, met with disfavor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the courts. Some Virginia jurists considered it akin to \u201ctrying a man with a rope about his neck.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 847, 855, 65 S.E. 19, 22 (1909) (quoting <em>Rand v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 738, 753 (1852)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The General Assembly responded in 1918 by amending the Penitentiary Act\u2014then called the Virginia Habitual Criminal Act\u2014to employ the supplemental proceeding in the Richmond Circuit Court as the exclusive means of imposing the recidivism sentencing enhancement. Former Code \u00a7 5054 (1919). This \u201cnon-common law method\u201d of addressing the issue remained the law in Virginia for many years. <em>Recidivism &amp; Virginia\u2019s Come-Back Law, supra, </em>at 600-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In 1982, the General Assembly repealed the Virginia Habitual Criminal Act authorizing the supplemental recidivism proceeding. 1982 Va. Acts, ch. 636 (rescinding Code \u00a7 53-296). By that time, the legislature had enacted several crime-specific recidivism statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See generally Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 762, 250 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1979). And, to a one, each such statute has been interpreted by Virginia courts to allow recidivism evidence to be presented during the guilt phase of trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Va. 223, 228-29, 532 S.E.2d 28, 31-32 (2000) (interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-67.5:3(A)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">B. <em>The Interplay Between Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-297.1 &amp; 19.2-295.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In Virginia, the \u201cLegislature is presumed to have known and to have had the common law in mind in the enactment of a statute. The statute must therefore be read along with the provisions of the common law, and the latter will be read into the statute unless it clearly appears from express language or by necessary implication that the purpose of the statute was to change the common law.\u201d <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 357, 361 n. 2, 611 S.E.2d 607, 609 n. 2 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Wicks v. Charlottesville, </em>215 Va. 274, 276, 208 S.E.2d 752, 755 (1974)). Along similar lines, we \u201cassume legislative familiarity with Virginia case law when the legislature enacts a statute which might impact upon that law.\u201d <em>Dodson v. Potomac Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., </em>241 Va. 89, 94, 400 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1991); <em>see also Waterman v. Halverson, </em>261 Va. 203, 207, 540 S.E.2d 867, 869 (2001) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>General Assembly is presumed to be aware of the decisions of this Court when enacting legislation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Seeking a construction consistent with common law practice and our caselaw, we turn to Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. Enacted in 1994, subsection A of the statute addresses recidivism involving crimes of violence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">Any person convicted of two or more separate acts of violence when such offenses were not part of a common act, transaction or scheme, and who has been at liberty as defined in \u00a7 53.1-151 between each conviction, shall, upon conviction of a third or subsequent act of violence, be sentenced to life imprisonment and shall not have all or any portion of the sentence suspended, provided it is admitted, or found by the jury or judge before whom he is tried, that he has been previously convicted of two or more such acts of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The General Assembly coupled this recidivism statute with the jury bifurcation statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, enacting both in the same bill. <em>See </em>1994 Va. Acts, ch. 828 (S.B.117).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The jury bifurcation statute requires a \u201cseparate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment\u201d before the same jury deciding the defendant\u2019s guilt. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. It authorizes the prosecution to introduce into evidence only the defendant\u2019s \u201cprior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rule 3A:17.1(e)(1) repeats this limitation. If the defense does not put on evidence, the prosecution cannot go any further than introducing the conviction orders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Only when the defense puts on mitigation evidence may the prosecution then rebut it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>with any \u201crelevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Conspicuously absent from the jury bifurcation statute and Rule 3A:17.1 is any authority for the prosecution to present substantive evidence (through witnesses and exhibits) showing how the prior convictions were not part of a \u201ccommon act, transaction or scheme\u201d or whether the defendant was \u201cat liberty\u201d between each such conviction\u2014two matters on which the prosecution bears the burden of proof under Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(A). If the defendant does not concede these two points, neither can be invariably assumed from the conviction orders themselves. Final conviction and sentencing orders say nothing about the underlying crime\u2019s relationship to other crimes. Nor do such orders, particularly those entered before the abolition of parole, identify the actual period of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">While not saying as much, Washington appears to assume the evidentiary limitation in the jury bifurcation statute was a mere legislative oversight. The bifurcation statute, he reasons, should allow in the penalty phase any evidence required by any recidivism statute\u2014not just copies of the prior conviction orders. The only way to sustain that position, however, would be to \u201cjudicially graft\u201d an unwritten provision into the statute, <em>Cent Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 280, 590 S.E.2d 631, 640 (2004), under the subtle \u201cguise of judicial interpretation,\u201d <em>Holly Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, </em>241 Va. 425, 431, 404 S.E.2d 48, 51 (1991). It may or may not be better public policy to structure recidivism proof differently. When interpreting statutes, however, such judgments are not ours to make. <em>Cf. McBoyle v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (observing that judicial statutory construction cannot proceed \u201cupon the speculation that, if the legislature had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been used\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">That said, we accept some potential for prejudice likely accompanies the common law order of proof. It is for just this reason that we give cautionary instructions directing jurors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>consider the admissible, but not inadmissible, aspects of recidivism evidence. Washington finds this remedy both naive and illusory. If it is, though, the same can be said of Washington\u2019s proposed remedy. The violent recidivist statute requires the jury to determine three things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u2022 whether at least two prior violent felony convictions exist,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u2022 whether any were part of \u201ca common act, transaction or scheme,\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u2022 whether the defendant was \u201cat liberty\u201d between each such conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(A). If the jury finds against the defendant on all three, he receives a mandatory life sentence\u2014a punishment far in excess of the average term of years for the principal crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">If forced to decide the recidivism questions during the penalty phase of a bifurcated trial, the jurors would have to do so at the same time as receiving evidence of <em>every other </em>criminal conviction the defendant ever received. And if the defendant puts on mitigation evidence suggesting his good character and capacity at self-reformation, the jurors would also likely hear from the prosecution on rebuttal all about his bad character and the demonstrably poor odds of his rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">To ensure that jurors do not invoke the violent recidivist statute as an emotional response to the defendant\u2019s nonviolent criminal past or his propensity generally for crime, we would necessarily have to give them a cautionary instruction\u2014 the very thing Washington says we cannot rely upon. To be sure, the only way to completely avoid the possibility of prejudice would be to trifurcate the case between a guilt phase addressing the principal crime, followed by a guilt phase dealing with Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(A)\u2019s recidivism evidence, later followed by a general sentencing hearing for everything else properly admitted under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 on the general subject of punishment. While a trial judge may have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>discretion to segment a criminal trial in this manner, we know of no authority requiring him to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Consistent with common law practice and settled Virginia caselaw, we hold that the recidivism evidence necessary to implicate the terms of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 may be admitted during the guilt phase of a bifurcated jury trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, did not err in this case by structuring the order of proof in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">. <em>See generally </em>Harold Dubroff, <em>Recidivist Procedures, </em>40 N.Y.U.

We also reject Washington's argument that the particular placement of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 in Chapter 18 of Title 19.2 (entitled \"Sentence; Judgment; Execution of Sentence\u201d) implies that the recidivism statute should be considered purely a tool of sentencing. In <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 56, 307 S.E.2d 239 (1983), the Court addressed former Code \u00a7 19.2-297, a recidivism statute creating a compound larceny offense.

Unlike the majority, however, I believe that the common law provides minimal guidance in this area beyond a historical starting point. Thus, I write separately to clarify the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>principles of statutory construction that I believe control the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">I. <em>The Plain Language of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As an initial matter, we must consider the plain language of the statute, for \u201c \u2018[w]here the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Props., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). That is, \u201c[w]e must ... assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the ... statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, the so-called \u201cthree-strikes\u201d statute, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">Any person convicted of [1] two or more separate acts of violence [2] when such offenses were not part of a common act, transaction, or scheme, and [3] who has been at liberty as defined in \u00a7 53.1-151 between each conviction, shall, upon conviction of a third or subsequent act of violence, be sentenced to life imprisonment and shall not have all or any portion of his sentence suspended, <em>provided it is admitted, or found by the jury or the judge before whom he is tried, that he has been previously convicted of two or more such acts of violence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">(Emphasis added). By the express terms of the statute, the jury (or other finder of fact) must therefore make three specific findings before the statute is implicated. Specifically, the jury must find: (1) the defendant has at least two prior violent felony convictions, (2) the prior felonies were not part of a common act, transaction, or scheme, and (3) the defendant was at liberty between each of the felonies. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">However, the plain language of the statute is silent as to whether these three facts should be \u201cfound\u201d during the guilt phase or during the sentencing phase of the trial. Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>must consider other settled principles of statutory construction to determine whether Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 permits the introduction of evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions during the guilt phase of a bifurcated trial. <em>See Va. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus, v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>238 Va. 97, 101, 353 S.E.2d 758, 762 (1987) (noting that, where a statute \u201cis susceptible to more than one meaning,\u201d the court \u201cmust resort to extrinsic evidence and the rules of construction to determine legislative intent, \u2018the paramount object of statutory construction\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Vollin v. Arlington Co. Electoral Bd., </em>216 Va. 674, 678-79, 222 S.E.2d 793, 797 (1976))). In doing so, we must be cognizant that there is no hierarchy among rules of statutory construction. Rather, considering <em>all </em>relevant and applicable principles of statutory construction, we should select that interpretation which, overall, best comports with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">II. <em>The \u201cCommon Law\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\"><em>As </em>noted in the majority opinion, a statute codifying common law principles should generally be interpreted in a manner \u201c \u2018most near to the reason of the common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 357, 361 n. 2, 611 S.E.2d 607, 609 n. 2 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Chichester v. Vass, </em>5 Va. (1 Call) 83, 102 (1797)). <em>As </em>the majority further notes, a statute that codifies the common law \u201c \u2018must therefore be read along with the provisions of the common law, and the latter will be read into the statute unless it clearly appears from express language or by necessary implication that the purpose of the statute was to change the common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wicks v. Charlottesville, </em>215 Va. 274, 276, 208 S.E.2d 752, 755 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In my view, however, Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 does not \u201ceodify[ ] common law principles.\u201d As the majority opinion sets forth, recidivist statutes have long been in existence in Virginia and elsewhere. However, the common law\u2014as opposed to <em>statutory </em>law\u2014did not authorize the imposition of heightened sentences for recidivists. Nor did any of the recognized common law crimes <em>(e.g., </em>rape, robbery, arson, murder, burglary) require\u2014or even allow\u2014proof that the defendant was a recidi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>vist. Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 cannot be said to codify a common law rule that does not exist. <em>See De Gesualdo v. People, </em>147 Colo. 426, 364 P.2d 374, 378 (1961) (\u201cThe philosophical approach to the habitual criminal statute has always been that it is in derogation of the common law and must therefore be strictly construed.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Ringer v. Boles, </em>151 W.Va. 864, 157 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1967) (\u201cHabitual criminal proceedings providing for enhanced or additional punishment on proof of one or more prior convictions are wholly statutory____ Being in derogation of the common law, such statutes are generally held to require a strict construction in favor of the prisoner.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Because Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 does not seek to codify a recognized common law principle, the concept that a statute codifying the common law \u201c \u2018must [] be read along with the provisions of the common law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Moses, </em>45 Va.App. at 361 n. 2, 611 S.E.2d at 609 n. 2 (citation omitted), is inapplicable. Thus, to the extent that the majority relies solely on what it calls the \u201ccommon law,\u201d I believe the majority is oversimplifying the rather complex issue of statutory construction presented in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>III. <em>Judicial Interpretation of Other Recidivist Statutes </em>In <em>Berry v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 209, 468 S.E.2d 685 (1996), this Court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">[although ... evidence of other crimes is inadmissible if relevant only to show a probability of guilt or a propensity for criminal conduct, evidence of other crimes \u201cis properly received if it is relevant and probative of an element on trial, such as an element of the offense charged or the required predicate for enhanced punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 213, 468 S.E.2d at 687 (quoting <em>Pittman v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 33, 35, 434 S.E.2d 694, 695 (1993)). Accordingly, under <em>Berry, </em>proof of a prior conviction is admissible during the guilt phase of a bifurcated trial if it is either: (1) an element of the offense charged, or (2) a required predicate for enhanced punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It is well established that, if a defendant is charged with violating a recidivist statute, proof of the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions is admissible as a \u201crequired predicate for enhanced punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(holding that the trial court did not err in allowing evidence of a \u201cprior conviction for a like offense ... during the guilt phase of the trial,\u201d reasoning that the evidence was admissible because, <em>inter alia, </em>it was a \u201cnecessary predicate to an enhanced penalty\u201d); <em>see also Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 794, 803, 497 S.E.2d 165, 169 (1998) (\u201cA prior conviction is used for \u2018sentence enhancement\u2019 when it is admitted ... during trial to convict a defendant of violating a \u2018recidivist statute,\u2019 i.e., a statute that criminalizes the commission of a successive violation of a particular offense[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Moreover, this Court and the Virginia Supreme Court have consistently held that, for a defendant to be convicted under a recidivist statute, the prior convictions must be charged in the indictment and proved to the jury. <em>See, e.g., Farmer v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 175, 180, 390 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1990) (\u201cFor the heavier punishment to be imposed by the jury or the court trying the case without a jury, the prior offense must be charged and proven.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>see also Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 56, 58-59, 307 S.E.2d 239, 240 (1983) (\u201c[T]o make the accused subject, under a repeating-offender statute, to a heavier penalty ... the previous conviction must be alleged in the indictment____\u201d); <em>Calfee v.

Because the prior convictions necessary to sustain a conviction under a recidivist statute must be charged in the indictment, we have therefore held that proof of the prior conviction is admissible during the guilt phase of the trial because it is an element of the \u201caggravated\u201d recidivist offense. <em>See Berry, </em>22 Va.App. at 213, 468 S.E.2d at 687 (holding that evidence of prior convictions was admissible, reasoning that, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[cjonviction of a prior like offense is an element of the charge as it was set forth in the indictment ... \u201d); <em>see also Pittman, </em>17 Va.App. at 35-36, 434 S.E.2d at 695 (holding that the trial court did not err in admitting proof of six prior convictions, reasoning that, \u201c[t]o prove the charge set forth in the indictment, the Commonwealth was obligated to prove that [the defendant] was guilty of a third or subsequent offense\u201d); <em>Farmer, </em>10 Va.App. at 179, 390 S.E.2d at 776 (holding that proof of a prior conviction is \u201cnecessary to prove the substantive offense of driving under the influence as a third or subsequent offense and, therefore, is admissible during the guilt stage of a bifurcated trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Thus, according to earlier judicial interpretations of similar recidivist statutes, proof of a defendant\u2019s prior like convictions is admissible during the guilt phase of the trial becaus\u00e9 it is both a required predicate for enhanced punishment and an element of the offense charged. <em>See, e.g., Berry, </em>22 Va.App. at 213, 468 S.E.2d at 687. This rule was established well before the 1994 enactment of both Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 and the bifurcation statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. <em>See, e.g., Brown, </em>226 Va. at 58, 307 S.E.2d at 240 (decided in 1983); <em>Pittman, </em>17 Va.App. at 35-36, 434 S.E.2d at 695 (decided in 1993); <em>Farmer, </em>10 Va.App. at 179, 390 S.E.2d at 776 (decided in 1990). Because the General Assembly may be presumed to have knowledge of the judicial interpretation of other, similar statutes, it can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>inferred that, had the General Assembly wished to alter existing law, it would have so provided. <em>See Waterman v.

However, where a defendant is charged with violating a recidivist statute, this Court and the Virginia Supreme Court have consistently required those prior convictions to be charged in the indictment and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>permitted introduction of the prior convictions during the guilt phase of a bifurcated trial. Moreover, construing the statute so as to disallow introduction of prior convictions during the guilt phase of trial might lead to unintended constitutional results. Accordingly, I agree that the trial court did not err in admitting, with a cautionary instruction, Washington\u2019s prior convictions during the guilt phase of his trial, and I therefore concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">. Allowing the prosecution to present allegations and proof of past convictions during a single trial, as opposed to during a second and subsequent proceeding, is sometimes referred to as the \"common-law procedure\u201d for implementing a recidivist statute. <em>See Spencer v. Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554, 565, 87 S.Ct. 648, 654, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967). Even if we were to accept that this procedure has somehow been elevated to common law status, it is of little help in resolving the issue presented in this appeal. That is, the so-called \"common law\u201d procedure allows recidivism to be decided during the same trial as the present, underlying charge. The \"non-common-law\u201d procedure, once codified in Virginia, requires recidivism to be decided during a separate, subsequent trial. Neither procedure speaks to whether recidivism may be decided during a separate phase of a single, bifurcated trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">. Of course, this does not mean that the many cases construing Virginia\u2019s other recidivist statutes are entirely inapplicable. The General Assembly may certainly be said to have been aware of the construction and effect given to prior recidivist statutes when it enacted Code \u00a7 19.2-271.1.

Likewise, Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, the statute that defines the effect of prior, separate acts of violence, does not provide that these acts are elements of the offense proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-51. By its plain meaning, Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 unambiguously applies during punishment only after the defendant has been convicted of a substantive offense. It expressly applies only \u201cupon <em>conviction </em>of a third or subsequent act of violence,\u201d and it provides that the convicted person \u201cshall ... be <em>sentenced </em>to life imprisonment\u201d upon the terms of the statute.

Equally significant is the placement of this statute in the same title of the Code of Virginia as Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which provides for the bifurcation of trials in which evidence of prior criminal convictions is admitted during the punishment phase.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Looking to the common law, the majority concludes that recidivism evidence has traditionally been presented during the guilt phase of trial. Even if that be true, it bears repeating that the issue before us concerns a <em>statute </em>that expressly applies only \u201cupon <em>conviction </em>of a third offense or subsequent act of violence\u201d and provides that the convicted person \u201cshall ... be <em>sentenced </em>to life imprisonment\u201d upon the terms of the statute. Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. The very language of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 is explicit evidence that the legislature did not intend to codify the common law principles that the majority relies upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The common law is further rendered irrelevant to this issue because a <em>statute, </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, provides for the bifurcation of trials in Virginia and requires evidence of prior criminal convictions be admitted during the punishment or sentencing phase. Read together, Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 and Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 manifest the conclusion that the legislature intended that prior convictions be proved only during the punishment phase when the purpose is to establish a sentencing factor. Reading together statutes that relate to the same subject matter has not heretofore been deemed a \u201cjudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>graft,\u201d but rather application of well-settled principles of statutory construction. The Supreme Court discussed these principles in depth almost fifty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">The general rule is that statutes may be considered as <em>in pari materia </em>when they relate to the same person or thing, the same class of persons or things or to the same subject or to closely connected subjects or objects. Statutes which have the same general or common purpose or are parts of the same general plan are also ordinarily considered as <em>in pari materia. </em>50 Am.

Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 349, pp. 345, 346, 347, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATv\">\u201cUnder the rule of statutory construction of statutes in pari materia, statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great connected, homogeneous system, or a single and complete statutory arrangement. Such statutes are considered as if they constituted but one act, so that sections of one act may be considered as though they were parts of the other act, as far as this can reasonably be done. Indeed, as a general rule, where legislation dealing with a particular subject consists of a system of related general provisions indicative of a settled policy, new enactments of a fragmentary nature on that subject are to be taken as intended to fit into the existing system and to be carried into effect conformably to it, and they should be so construed as to harmonize the general tenor or purport of the system and make the scheme consistent in all its parts and uniform in its operation, unless a different purpose is shown plainly or with irresistible clearness. It will be assumed or presumed, in the absence of words specifically indicating the contrary, that the legislature did not intend to innovate on, unsettle, disregard, alter or violate a general statute or system of statutory provisions the entire subject matter of which is not directly or necessarily involved in the act.\u201d See also 17 M.J., Statutes, \u00a7 40, p. 293, 82 C.J.S., Statutes, \u00a7 365, p. 799.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">The author of Sutherland Statutory Construction, 3rd Ed., In Pari Materia and Adopted Statutes, Vol. 2, \u00a7 5201, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>p. 529 has this to say: \u201cProvisions in an act which are omitted in another act relating to the same subject matter will be applied in a proceeding under the other act, when not inconsistent with its purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In <em>Mitchell v.

We can presume, therefore, that the General Assembly intended that the statutes were to be understood as \u201cimbued with the same spirit and actuated by the same policy.\u201d <em>Lillard v. Fairfax Airport Authority, </em>208 Va. 8, 13, 155 S.E.2d 338, 342 (1967). Indeed, the principle is long standing \u201cthat where two statutes are passed by the same session of the legislature, as was the case here, that fact furnishes strong evidence that they were intended to stand together.\u201d <em>South Norfolk v. Norfolk, </em>190 Va. 591, 602, 58 S.E.2d 32, 37 (1950). This principle is to be followed even if the statutes \u201ccontain no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>reference to one another.\u201d <em>Prillaman, </em>199 Va. at 406, 100 S.E.2d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Simply put, both statutes are concerned with proof of prior convictions that are to be used as a sentencing factor. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 requires \u201ca separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment\u201d after a finding of guilt. Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 specifies punishment for a \u201cperson <em>convicted </em>of two or more separate acts of violence.\u201d The suggestion that the General Assembly did not intend these two statutes to stand together does not stand close analysis and certainly finds no foundation in the common law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, read together, the statutes plainly manifest a codification of procedures in derogation of any common law \u201corder of proof\u2019 that may have existed. The statutes contain no conflicting language; they can be and should be reconciled and construed together. Simply put, the principles relevant to this appeal are to be found in our current scheme of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Unlike the majority opinion, the Commonwealth does not rely upon the common law but, instead, contends that the phrase \u201cfound by the jury,\u201d which is contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, implies that the fact finder must make a finding that the defendant has twice before been convicted of violent offenses prescribed by the statute. I agree with this assertion, as far as it goes. The statutory language, however, does not require that the prior conviction evidence be admitted during the guilt phase of trial. Rather, it expressly provides that <em>\u201cupon conviction </em>of a third or subsequent act of violence\u201d that person shall be sentenced to life imprisonment, \u201cprovided it is admitted, or found by the jury or judge before whom [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>defendant] is tried, that he has been previously convicted of two or more ... acts of violence.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 (emphasis added). This statute merely requires the prosecutor to prove as an adjunct to the fact of the prior conviction the additional facts the General Assembly deemed to be necessary to obtain the enhanced penalty. By the express language of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, those facts are statutorily made relevant to the penalty to be imposed. They are appropriately the subject of a finding instruction, <em>see Joseph v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 78, 89-90, 452 S.E.2d 862, 869-70 (1995) (discussing finding instructions concerning punishment), and require no extraordinary procedure at the punishment phase. Consistent with Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 (and Rule 3A:17.1), this is evidence for enhancing punishment that is admissible and appropriate for the jury\u2019s determination at the punishment phase of trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial judge must instruct the jury at the punishment phase <em>(see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1\u2014where the Commonwealth \u201cpresent[s] the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions\u201d) that it must find these additional facts if it is to impose the enhanced punishment required by Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Commonwealth also relies on <em>Berry v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 209, 468 S.E.2d 685 (1996), to support its proposition that Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 must be read to provide that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>prior convictions are elements of the offense and, therefore, evidence of those convictions is properly submitted to the jury during the guilt phase of the trial. The short answer to this argument is that <em>Berry </em>does not require that we hold that Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 is an element of the offense of malicious wounding because <em>Berry </em>concerned an entirely different statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-248. The <em>Berry </em>decision dealt with the issue whether a defendant\u2019s prior narcotics convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-248 were properly admitted to the jury during the guilt phase of the bifurcated trial in a third narcotics prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-248. <em>Berry, </em>22 Va.App. at 213, 468 S.E.2d at 687. Unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, the statutes at issue in this case, Code \u00a7 18.2-248, which was the statute at issue in <em>Berry, </em>provides for the substantive offense as well as for the penalty enhancement for a subsequent offense within the same statute. In <em>Berry, </em>we relied upon this inclusion of the penalty enhancement in the same statute which creates the substantive crime in determining that the penalty enhancement was an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Recently, in <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000), the Supreme Court held that introducing evidence of prior convictions at the guilt phase of trial did not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 532 S.E.2d at 31 (citing <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 56, 59, 307 S.E.2d 239, 241 (1983)). Supporting its holding that no due process violation occurred, the Court noted that the trial judge in <em>Medici </em>instructed the jury to consider the prior convictions only as evidence of a prior conviction and not as evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 532 S.E.2d at 32. The Court, however, specifically declined to address \u201cwhether the better policy would be to introduce a prior conviction into evidence only during the sentencing phase ... [or] whether a prior conviction is an element of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court declined to do so because the issue raised by <em>Medici </em>dealt solely with whether his constitutional due process rights were violated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In simple terms, the Supreme Court declined to decide the state-law issue in <em>Medici </em>because Medici raised only a federal constitutional due process issue. The United States Supreme Court has recognized the proposition that, although it is usually the case that prejudice is necessary to establish a violation of due process, <em>see Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 542-43, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 1632-33, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965); <em>Hamilton v. Alabama, </em>368 U.S. 52, 55, 82 S.Ct. 157, 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961), a claim of prejudice is not virtually identical to a claim of a due process violation. As the Court has noted, \u201cproof of prejudice is generally a necessary but not sufficient element of a due process claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 790, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 2048-49, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Unlike the majority here, I believe the statute\u2019s notice requirement, our bifurcated trial procedure, and the use of recidivism as a classic sentencing factor (reflecting society\u2019s determination that a defendant deserves enhanced punishment <em>after </em>a third conviction) provide additional indications that the legislature intended Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 to function as part of Virginia\u2019s sentencing scheme. Quite simply, to conclude that the crime of malicious wounding includes the element of a sentencing aggravator, unrelated to the charged crime, is illogical. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Spencer v. Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554, 572, 87 S.Ct. 648, 658, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967), does not require that we read Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 in such a manner. Like <em>Medici, Spencer </em>dealt with the due process issue of allowing a defendant\u2019s prior convictions during the guilt phase, and not an issue of statutory construction. 385 U.S. at 559, 87 S.Ct. at 651. Significantly, the Court noted that prior conviction \u201cevidence is generally recognized to have potentiality for prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 87 S.Ct. at 652. The Court deferred, however, to the procedures adopted under each state\u2019s \u201ccomplex code of state criminal evidentiary law\u201d as the mechanism for ameliorating the prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 87 S.Ct. at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In a concurring and dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Warren noted that, as a logical proposition, \u201c[t]he admission [of prior convictions] in connection with enhancing punishment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>repeating offenders has nothing whatever to do with the question of guilt or innocence of the crime currently charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579, 87 S.Ct. at 661. He further observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">Because of the complete irrelevance of prior convictions to the question of guilt or innocence, the recidivist situation is not one where the trial courts are called upon to balance the probative value of prior convictions against their prejudicial impact. The purpose of admitting prior-convictions evidence should be served and prejudice completely avoided by the simple expedient of a procedure which reflects the exclusive relevance of recidivist statutes to the issue of proper punishment. Only after a defendant has been found guilty does the question of whether he fits the recidivist category become relevant to the sentence, and any issue of fact as to his prior convictions should then be decided by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">These observations are apt because we have in Virginia a statutorily mandated system of bifurcated trials. The Supreme Court of Virginia recognized this, and the irrelevance of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions during the guilt phase, in <em>Medici, </em>when it posed without answering the question \u201cwhether the better policy would be to introduce a prior conviction into evidence only during the sentencing phase ... [or] whether a prior conviction is an element of the offense charged.\u201d 260 Va. at 229, 532 S.E.2d at 32. Contrarily, the majority concludes that the recidivist statute mandates that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions must be proven during the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. This construction of the statute ignores the irrelevance of Washington\u2019s prior conviction to the question of guilt or innocence of the malicious wounding charge. Furthermore, it creates a procedure by which the Commonwealth will needlessly and unfairly benefit from the prejudicial effect of the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">A \u201cbedrock principle of Anglo-American jurisprudence,\u201d <em>see generally, </em>1 John H. Wigmore, <em>A Treatise On The Anglo-American System Of Evidence In Trials At Common Law, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 55-68a, at 449-91 (3d ed.1940), is the recognition of the prejudice of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">The State may not show defendant\u2019s prior trouble with the law, specific criminal acts, or ill name among his neighbors, even though such facts might logically be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable perpetrator of the crime. The inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defendant against a particular charge. The overriding policy of excluding such evidence, despite its admitted probative value, is the practical experience that its disallowance tends to prevent confusion of issues, unfair surprise and undue prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 475-76, 69 S.Ct. 213, 218-19, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring). Virginia has of course recognized this long standing prohibition against admitting prior crimes. Absent some exception to the general rule, \u201cevidence implicating an accused in other crimes unrelated to the charged offense is inadmissible because it may confuse the issues being tried and cause undue prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998); <em>Limbaugh v. Commonwealth, </em>149 Va. 383, 383, 140 S.E. 133, 135 (1927) (noting that \u201c[t]he accused comes to trial to meet the specific charge against him, not to vindicate or to explain every collateral charge that may be made in the course of the introduction of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">I cannot conclude, as does the majority, that the legislature intended to needlessly prejudice a defendant by enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. The principle is well established that evidence of other crimes, admitted in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, creates undue prejudice, reverses the presumption of innocence, and constitutes reversible error, notwithstanding the absence of a claim of a due process violation. <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 501-02, 303 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1983). <em>See also Donahue v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 156, 300 S.E.2d 768, 774 (1983). \u201cThe principle that there is a presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u201d <em>Coffin v.

Even evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior misconduct \u201cwill usually sink the defense without [a] trace,\u201d Edward Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 1:02 (2004) (citing Elliott, <em>The Young Person\u2019s Guide to Similar Fact Evidence, </em>1983 Crim. L.Rev. 284), while evidence of prior crimes is \u201cthe most prejudicial evidence imaginable against an accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>People v. Smallwood, </em>42 Cal.3d 415, 228 Cal.Rptr. 913, 722 P.2d 197, 205 (1986)) (superseded by Cal. Evid.Code \u00a7 1108).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">This basic foundation of our jurisprudence is inconsistent with allowing prior convictions as evidence during the guilt phase under the guise of concluding that it is warranted because the statute at issue is a recidivist statute. Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the Commonwealth suggests it is a kind of constitutional imperative to <em>require </em>the proof of prior convictions during the guilt phase. Yet, the Commonwealth\u2019s analysis conflates the rationale supporting those cases. The <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases upholds the sanctity of a defendant\u2019s right to a trial by jury and the defendant\u2019s due process right to require the Commonwealth to prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072-73, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). To claim that Washington\u2019s due process rights are protected, as in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>is simply not tenable. Here, introducing Washington\u2019s prior convictions during the guilt phase needlessly prejudiced Washington without advancing any legitimate interest of the State. Simply put, the Commonwealth, not Washington, will benefit from the introduction of the prior convictions. Pointlessly, in light of our system of bifurcated jury trials. That system was designed to eliminate the undue prejudice of putting before the jury at the guilt stage evidence of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>crimes, which has the effect of stigmatizing a defendant and predisposing a jury to a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Although the trial judge instructed the jury during the guilt phase that \u201c[ejvidence that the defendant was previously convicted of prior offenses should be considered by you only for proof of the element of a prior conviction and not as proof that he committed the offense to which he is charged,\u201d the trial judge also instructed the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">(1) That the defendant wounded or caused bodily injury by any means to Kathleen Monroe; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">(2) That such wounding or bodily injury was with intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill Kathleen Monroe; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">(3) That the act was done with malice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">(4) That the defendant has been previously convicted of two violent felonies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the offense as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty of maliciously wounding or causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The first instruction cannot be reconciled with the latter finding instruction because the finding instruction tells the jury that the previous convictions are \u201celements of the crime,\u201d i.e., if those previous convictions are proved they constitute proof that he committed the offense with which he is charged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">The normal presumption is that the jury will follow a curative instruction. <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 3109 n. 8, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987). However, this presumption cannot apply when the curative instruction fails by its own terms to address the error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-14\"><em>United States v. Hall, </em>989 F.2d 711, 717 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">Furthermore, the error in admitting the evidence at the guilt phase was so deliberate and so impressive that, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the attempt at a curative instruction, the error likely influenced the jury. As the Supreme Court has held, \u201cthere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). An appellate court cannot presume the jury followed a curative instruction when there \u201cexist[s] the overwhelming probability of their inability to do so,\u201d <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), or when there \u201care deliberately spread before the jury ... incriminations devastating to the defendant,\u201d <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 136, 88 S.Ct. at 1628. In view of our bifurcated trial procedure, we are not free to ignore that legislatively mandated protection and needlessly accept the inevitable potential for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">For all of these reasons, I would hold that the statute, by its express terms, applies after the conviction. The absence of a constitutional due process prohibition to allowing prior convictions does not, in my mind, equate to a license to do so. Nothing in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 requires us to construct the statute in such a way to prejudice Washington, and countless other defendants, for no purpose except to give the Commonwealth the unfair advantage of presenting prior convictions to the jury as it assesses a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">In cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony ... a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury. At such proceeding, the Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction, including adult convictions and juvenile convictions and adjudications of delinquency. Prior convictions shall include convictions and adjudications of delinquency under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">. As Judge Humphreys aptly notes in Part II of his concurring opinion, Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 is an habitual criminal punishment statute that is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed in favor of the accused. When we strictly construe penal statutes, we must give \"the accused ... the benefit of any reasonable doubt about the construction of [the] statute,\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 298, 300-01, 295 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1982), and we \"must ... presume[] that the [General Assembly] acted with full knowledge of the strict interpretation that must be placed upon a statute of this nature,\u201d <em>Hannabass v. Ryan, </em>164 Va. 519, 525, 180 S.E. 416, 418 (1935).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>. </em>Prior to the enactment of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, the Supreme Court held in <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 56, 59, 307 S.E.2d 239, 241 (1983), that an accused was not denied due process when, during a trial that consolidated the issues of guilt and punishment, the jury was informed of previous convictions required for an enhanced punishment. In so holding, the Court noted that the trial judge cautioned the jury not to consider the previous convictions in determining guilt and, significantly, the Court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">Brown sought a bifurcated trial, but there is no statutory authorization for such a procedure in this case. Bifurcated trials have been provided by statute only in capital murder cases, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3, and in certain traffic cases, Code \u00a7 46.1-347.2. There may be sound arguments for the extension of such trials to other offenses in Virginia, but these arguments should be addressed to the General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 59, 307 S.E.2d at 240-41 (footnote omitted). Eleven years later, in 1994, the General Assembly provided for bifurcated trials in felony prosecutions such as this.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
