Based on the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), Tjan contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially invalid because it violates his Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process of law. And, because the statute is facially unconstitutional, Tjan concludes that he cannot be convicted for attempting, through solicitation, to violate that statute. In the alternative, Tjan contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is unconstitutional because it is both over-broad and void for vagueness. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Tjan lacks standing to argue that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional because it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that he also lacks standing to contend that the statute is constitutionally over-broad. We further hold that the statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause and is not void for vagueness. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The relevant facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 19, 2003, Tjan walked into a public restroom located in a depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ment store. As Tjan was washing his hands, he looked into one of the restroom stalls and saw an undercover police officer. Tjan began tapping his foot against the bathroom stall \u201cin a covert effort to solicit sexual favors.\u201d The officer asked Tjan what he wanted, and Tjan responded, \u201cI want you\u201d and pretended to suck one of his fingers. Tjan \u201cthen acknowledged affirmatively to the officer that he wanted to suck the officer\u2019s penis and that he wanted to do this in one of the stalls of the restroom right there and then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">On April 21, 2003, a grand jury indicted Tjan for \u201ccommand[ing], entreat[ing] or otherwise attempting] to persuade another to commit a felony,\u201d specifically, \u201cCrimes Against Nature,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-361 and 18.2-29. At the arraignment hearing, conducted on November 24, 2003, Tjan moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional, \u201cis overbroad and [contains] within its prohibitions activities that are constitutionally protected,\u201d \u201cis void for vagueness under the due process clause,\u201d \u201cencourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law,\u201d and \u201cviolates the equal protection clause of the Unites States [Constitution\u201d because the Commonwealth \u201conly prosecutes that conduct which occurs in privacy between homosexuals.\u201d The trial court, relying on the reasons advanced in its earlier decision in a similar case, <em>see Singson v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 724, 621 S.E.2d 682, 2005 WL 2977779 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>(2005) (this day decided), denied the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tjan entered a conditional guilty plea, and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Tjan contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially invalid because it violates his Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process of law. In the alternative, Tjan contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">A. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 Is Facially Unconstitutional Because It Violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Citing <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), Tjan initially contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional because it criminalizes private acts of consensual sodomy, thus offending the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Tjan reasons that, because Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is facially unconstitutional, he cannot be prosecuted for violating the terms of the statute even though his attempted conduct falls within the scope of that statute. However, for the reasons advanced in <em>Singson, </em>46 Va.App. 724, 621 S.E.2d 682, we hold that Tjan lacks standing to assert this claim. And, because application of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 to <em>public </em>sexual conduct does not implicate the more narrow liberty interest upheld in <em>Lawrence, see Singson, </em>46 Va.App. at 735, 621 S.E.2d at 687, we further hold that application of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 under the circumstances of this case does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>B. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 Is Unconstitutionally Overbroad</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In the alternative, Tjan contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is unconstitutionally overbroad, reasoning that the statute \u201ccontains within its provisions prohibitions against activities that are constitutionally protected.\u201d That is, because Code \u00a7 18.2-361 encompasses \u201cconstitutionally protected conduct between consenting adults,\u201d Tjan reasons that the statute is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">However, outside the context of a First Amendment challenge,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when a statute is constitutional as applied to a litigant, the litigant has no standing to challenge the statute on the ground that it may be unconstitutional on its face\u2014that is, as applied to a third person in a hypothetical situation. <em>County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 154-55, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2223-24, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979). And, as noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, \u201c \u2018[w]hen overbreadth has only due process implications, [a defendant] has no standing to make a facial attack but only standing to challenge the statute as applied to his own conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans &amp; Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 292, 296, 308 S.E.2d 126, 129 (1983) (quoting <em>Stanley v. City of Norfolk, </em>218 Va. 504, 508, 237 S.E.2d 799, 802 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">As Tjan concedes, his attempted conduct falls within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-361. <em>See Santillo v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 470, 483, 517 S.E.2d 733, 740 (1999). And, because of its public nature, that conduct is not constitutionally protected. <em>See Singson, </em>46 Va.App. at 730, 621 S.E.2d at 684. Because the statute is constitutional as applied to Tjan, and because Code \u00a7 18.2-361 does not implicate the First Amendment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we hold that Tjan lacks standing to mount a facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>overbreadth challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-361. <em>See Stanley, </em>218 Va. at 508, 237 S.E.2d at 802 (holding that the appellant lacked standing to mount a facial overbreadth challenge to an ordinance where he did not \u201ccontend that his own conduct was constitutionally protected or that the ordinance [was] void for First Amendment overbreadth\u201d); <em>see also County Court of Ulster, </em>442 U.S. at 154-55, 99 S.Ct. at 2223-24; <em>Evans &amp; Smith, </em>226 Va. at 296, 308 S.E.2d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">C. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 Is Void for Vagueness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Tjan also contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is unconstitutional because it is void for vagueness. A criminal statute is deemed unconstitutionally vague if it \u201c \u2018fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bouie v. Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 351, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1701, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964) (quoting <em>United States v. Harriss, </em>347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954)); <em>see also Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 675, 681, 537 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2000) (\u201c[A] \u2018penal statute is void for vagueness if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute____\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Woodfin v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 92, 372 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1988)) (omission in original)). The void-for-vagueness rule is premised on the concept that \u201c \u2018no man [should] be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bouie, </em>378 U.S. at 351, 84 S.Ct. at 1701 (quoting <em>Harriss, </em>347 U.S. at 617, 74 S.Ct. at 812). Thus, the doctrine \u201c \u2018protects two due process interests,\u2019 \u201d first, requiring \u201c \u2018that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>may act accordingly,\u2019\u201d and second, \u201cprevent[ing] arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by requiring that laws ... provide explicit standards to those who apply them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 681, 687, 485 S.E.2d 150, 153 (1997) (quoting <em>Coleman v. City of Richmond, </em>5 Va.App. 459, 466, 364 S.E.2d 239, 243 (1988)) (internal quotations omitted) (omission in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">As we have held, Code \u00a7 18.2-361 satisfies the void-for-vagueness test because the statutory text clearly identifies the specific, prohibited conduct in a manner that no reasonable person could misunderstand. <em>See Santillo, </em>30 Va.App. at 483, 517 S.E.2d at 740 (\u201cWe hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is not unconstitutionally vague either on its face or as applied to appellant.\u201d). As we noted in <em>Santillo, </em>\u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-361 is sufficiently clear to inform both citizens and law enforcement officers of what acts constitute carnal knowledge \u2018by or with the mouth.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 517 S.E.2d at 740. And, because \u201c \u2018the terms of the statute, when measured by common understanding and practices, sufficiently warns a person as to what behavior is prohibited, [ ] the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991)); <em>see also Pedersen v. Richmond, </em>219 Va. 1061, 1066, 254 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1979) (upholding an ordinance prohibiting solicitation of \u201cany act which is lewd, lascivious, or indecent,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[a] person of even limited intelligence is on notice from the provisions of [the ordinance] that solicitation of sodomy is thereby forbidden\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Tjan argues, however, that upholding the statute in the context of \u201cpublic\u201d acts of sodomy renders the statute void for vagueness because \u201cthe precise definition of what constitutes \u2018public\u2019 conduct and what is \u2018private\u2019 conduct is not an easy task.\u201d Initially, we note that\u2014contrary to Tjan\u2019s assertion\u2014 this Court is not \u201crewriting\u201d the statute and adding \u201ca locational (i.e., \u2018public\u2019) element to the offense.\u201d Rather, we are merely conducting an as-applied analysis, considering whether application of the statute was constitutional under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>stances of this case. <em>See generally Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610-11, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) (noting that the principle that \u201cconstitutional rights are personal and may not be asserted vicariously\u201d \u201crefleet[s] the conviction that under our constitutional system courts are not roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of the Nation\u2019s laws\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Nevertheless, as we have noted, \u201c[t]he term \u2018in public\u2019 is an ordinary, everyday expression with a plain meaning.\u201d <em>Crislip v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 66, 71, 554 S.E.2d 96, 98 (2001). Specifically, a \u201cpublic\u201d location \u201cis a place in open view, visible to the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because a \u201cperson of ordinary intelligence,\u201d <em>Bouie, </em>378 U.S. at 351, 84 S.Ct. at 1701, would understand that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 prohibits individuals from engaging in the proscribed acts in \u201ca place in open view, visible to the community,\u201d <em>Crislip, </em>37 Va.App. at 71, 554 S.E.2d at 98, we hold that applying Code \u00a7 18.2-361 to public acts of sodomy does not render the statute void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Moreover, as noted by the Virginia Supreme Court \u201c[o]ne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hicks, </em>267 Va. 573, 581, 596 S.E.2d 74, 78 (2004). In this case, as discussed above, Tjan\u2019s conduct clearly falls within the scope of the statute. Accordingly, he \u201cmay not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Muhammad v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 451, 501, 611 S.E.2d 537, 565-66 (2005) (\u201cOne who engages in conduct that is clearly proscribed and not constitutionally protected may not successfully attack a statute as void for vagueness based upon the hypothetical conduct of others.\u201d); <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 519, 592 S.E.2d 768, 780 (2004) (en banc) (\u201c[0]ne who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Tjan also argues, however, that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 is void for vagueness because the statute \u201cis subjectively enforced only against homosexuals.\u201d In the context of a void-for-vagueness challenge, however, a statute will be declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>unconstitutional only if the statutory language \u201c \u2018authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd, </em>42 Va.App. at 520, 592 S.E.2d at 780-81 (quoting <em>Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 2498, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000)). Although <em>actual </em>selective enforcement of a statute might give rise to an equal protection challenge, <em>see id. </em>at 522, 592 S.E.2d at 781, the statute itself will not be struck down as unconstitutionally vague \u201cunless its clarity has been \u2018designedly avoided so as to allow the net to be cast at large.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 592 S.E.2d at 781 (quoting <em>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 166, 92 S.Ct. 839, 845, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Put simply, the void-for-vagueness test \u201cforbids [ ] a law that, by its expansive sweep of language, enacts an elastic definition of illegality\u2014one that authorizes an officer to define for himself what is and is not legal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, 592 S.E.2d at 781. Nothing in the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 \u201cgoes that far.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 does not \u201cauthorize[ ] an officer to define for himself what is and is not legal,\u201d <em>id., </em>we hold that the statute is not void for vagueness. <em>Cf. Coleman, </em>5 Va.App. at 466, 364 S.E.2d at 244 (invalidating statute prohibiting individuals from loitering \u201cin a manner or under circumstances manifesting the purpose of engaging in prostitution,\u201d reasoning that \u201cthe ordinance vests too much discretion in the officers who enforce the ordinance\u201d because \u201cpeople are permitted to wander or stand idly at the whim of whichever police officer is on the beat\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">D. <em>Whether Code \u00a7 18.2-361 Violates the Equal Protection Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Finally, Tjan argues that the sodomy statute is facially unconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The Equal Protection Clause proclaims that \u201c[n]o State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of laws.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. The central mandate of the equal protection guarantee is that \u201cthe sovereign may not draw distinctions between individuals based solely on differences that are irrelevant to a legitimate governmental objective.\u201d <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 265, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 2995, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-361 does not, on its face, draw distinctions between homosexual and heterosexual individuals. As the Commonwealth notes, the statute applies equally to all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. That is, a man and a woman who engage in public sodomy are subject to prosecution, as are two men who engage in public sodomy. <em>See Branche v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 480, 487, 489 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1997) (\u201cUnder the statutory scheme, all persons, male or female[,] whether heterosexual or homosexual, who solicit another to commit an act of sodomy are guilty of a Class 6 felony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Tjan argues, however, that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 violates the Equal Protection Clause because \u201cpublic sodomy is the only public sexual conduct that is punished as a felony,\u201d and \u201c[n]o law directly prohibits [public] heterosexual intercourse.\u201d Because \u201cpublic oral sex is a felony, while public heterosexual copulation is, at most, a misdemeanor,\u201d Tjan concludes that \u201c[t]he differences in punishment\u201d are \u201csomething the Equal Protection Clause does not permit.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">However, in Branehe\u2014a case not cited by either party\u2014we disposed of a virtually identical argument. In <em>Branehe, </em>the appellant argued that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 violates the Equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Protection Clause because \u201cfemales who solicit another to commit an act of oral sodomy for money can be convicted only of a misdemeanor, whereas men who solicit another to commit an act of oral sodomy, not for money, can be convicted of a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 489 S.E.2d at 695. We found no merit in this argument, noting that, \u201c[b]y enacting a statute that forbids prostitution and another which forbids solicitation to commit a felony, the General Assembly has not drawn a distinction or made a classification between individuals who are similarly situated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 489 S.E.2d at 695. Rather, \u201c[bjecause the two groups of individuals proscribed by the statute are not engaged in the same activity,\u201d we held that \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s decision to punish one group more severely than the other does not violate our constitutional principle of equality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 489 S.E.2d at 696; <em>see also State v. Limon, </em>32 Kan.App.2d 369, 83 P.3d 229, 233 (2004) (noting that \u201c[statutes by necessity are directed to less than universal situations,\u201d further observing that, \u201c[i]f this were not so, statutes would be ineffective because they would fail to take into account factual differences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Similarly, by enacting separate statutes, each forbidding a different type of sexual conduct, the General Assembly established classifications of behavior, not classifications of people. Specifically, individuals who participate in an obscene display or otherwise engage in public acts of indecent exposure, masturbation, or cohabitation are guilty of a misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-387 (prohibiting indecent exposure); 18.2-387.1 (prohibiting public acts of masturbation); 18.2-375 (prohibiting obscene exhibitions and performances); 18.2-345 (prohibiting lewd and lascivious cohabitation). Individuals who engage in public sodomy are guilty of a Class 6 felony. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-361. As in <em>Branche, </em>\u201c[b]oth heterosexual males and females and homosexual males and females may violate [any of these] statute[s] and, under [each] statute[ ], all persons, regardless of sexual orientation, are treated in the same fashion.\u201d <em>Branche, </em>25 Va.App. at 487, 489 S.E.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Accordingly, the General Assembly\u2019s decision to punish one type of behavior (public acts of sodomy) more severely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>than the other (public sexual acts other than sodomy) does not violate our constitutional principle of equality. <em>See id. </em>Thus, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 \u201cdoes not create an impermissible classification between groups of people similarly situated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThe fact that solicitation to commit prostitution is a misdemeanor and is, therefore, considered a less serious crime than ... solicitation to commit sodomy, does not create an impermissible classification between groups of people similarly situated.\u201d); <em>cf. Limon, </em>83 P.3d at 237 (holding that the establishment of a statutory scheme resulting in \u201cthe penalty for heterosexual sodomy with a child ... [being] less severe that the penalty for homosexual sodomy with a child\u201d did not constitute an equal protection violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">For these reasons, we hold that Tjan lacks standing to mount a facial challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-361 and also lacks standing to contend that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad. We also hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 does not violate the Equal Protection Clause and is not void for vagueness. Accordingly, we affirm Tjan\u2019s conviction for solicitation of oral sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-11\">. Rather than orally proffering the facts of the case during the arraignment hearing, the parties submitted a written \"Stipulation of Facts.\" This stipulation, which was not included in the appendix filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>appeal, is the only part of the record detailing the specific facts of this case. According to Rule 5A:25(c), the appendix \"shall include\u201d all \"incidents of the case germane to the questions presented.\u201d By neglecting to include the \"Stipulation of Facts\u201d in the appendix, Tjan failed to comply with Rule 5A:25 because he omitted vital \"incidents of the case\u201d that are \"germane to the questions presented.\u201d However, according to Rule 5A:25(h), this Court \"may\u201d consider parts of the record other than the appendix when ruling on the merits of an appeal. Because the relevant facts are undisputed, we will exercise our discretion to consider the \"Stipulation of Facts\u201d and, thus, to decide the merits of this appeal. <em>But see Patterson v. City of Richmond, </em>39 Va.App. 706, 717, 576 S.E.2d 759, 764-65 (2003) (declining to reach merits of an assignment of error where \"the appendix filed in [the] case [did] not contain parts of the record that [were] essential to the resolution of the issue before us\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">. In <em>Singson, </em>the trial court reasoned that <em>Lawrence </em>did not apply because \u201cthe restrooms within [s]tores open to the public are not within the zone of privacy as contemplated by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d The court further noted that it could not \"imagine too much more [of a] public place than a restroom in a shopping mall.\u201d <em>Singson, </em>46 Va.App. at 732, 621 S.E.2d at 685.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\">. Tjan does not challenge the constitutionally of Code \u00a7 18.2-361 on the ground that the statute prohibits or chills expression protected by the First Amendment. <em>Cf. Singson, </em>46 Va.App. at 730, 621 S.E.2d at 684.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\">. See <em>Singson, </em>46 Va.App. at 730, 621 S.E.2d at 684 (holding that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 neither directly prohibits nor chills a substantial amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>constitutionally-protected speech); <em>see also United States v. Dhingra, </em>371 F.3d 557, 561 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that a statute prohibiting individuals from inducing a minor \"to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity\u201d does not jeopardize speech because it \"only criminalizes conduct,\u201d noting that \"speech is merely the vehicle through which a pedophile ensnares the victim\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\">. Said differently, in an equal protection challenge, the overriding inquiry is whether the statute is, <em>in fact, </em>being selectively enforced. In a void-for-vagueness challenge, the overriding inquiry is whether the statutory language is so vague that, of necessity, police must use their discretion when determining whether the statute is being violated, thus creating an unacceptable <em>risk </em>of selective enforcement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">. Although Tjan raises the issue of selective enforcement in the context of his void-for-vagueness challenge, Tjan does not argue that Code \u00a7 18.2-361 violates the Equal Protection Clause because it constitutes a \"facially neutral law [that] is being applied in discriminatory manner.\u201d <em>Branche, </em>25 Va.App. at 488, 489 S.E.2d at 696.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
