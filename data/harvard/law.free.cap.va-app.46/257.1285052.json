The circuit court erred, Toms argues, for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">First, Toms contends the evidence is insufficient to justify termination of his parental rights. Second, even if the evidence were sufficient, Toms claims the circuit court erred as a matter of law by ordering termination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) without first confirming that he received adequate rehabilitative services while his children were in foster care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Third, Toms contends due process principles impose upon the state in all parental termination cases the duty to provide rehabilitative services to the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Finding none of these arguments persuasive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We view the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the prevailing party in the circuit court and grant to that party the benefit of \u201call reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Frazier and Laura Toms are the biological parents of eight children\u2014seven boys and one girl. On January 28, 2003, Laura Toms left the family home and walked to a neighbor\u2019s house. Her husband was holding her against her will, she told the neighbor, and had abused her. The children were home alone. When the sheriffs office responded to the Toms house, two deputies met one of the boys standing at the gate to the property. The boy told the deputies to leave and that his father was not at home. Concerned about the safety of the children, the deputies entered the property several minutes later. The boy ran into the woods. When the deputies walked into the house, they noticed a two-year-old boy standing on a bed. The rest of the children could not be found. They too had fled into the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">What appeared to be the Toms residence was a 16' by 16' unfinished structure. The structure had three stories, but no access between the floors. The family lived together on the first floor. The house had no electricity or indoor plumbing. There were no rooms, no indoor sinks or bathtubs, and no kitchen. The structure was \u201cfull of trash.\u201d The family used an outdoor tub for bathing and a primitive outdoor latrine. The yard around the structure was littered with alcohol bottles and cans.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">About thirty minutes after the deputies arrived, Fraizer Toms appeared at the house. He was visibly intoxicated and agitated. The deputies sought his assistance in finding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>children, but he refused to cooperate and was eventually arrested. A K-9 unit and multiple aircraft assisted in the search for the children. It was near freezing temperatures, and the children had no coats, hats, or gloves to protect them against the cold. About eight hours later, at around 3:30 a.m., the children emerged from the woods. The rescue unit took the children to the hospital for examination for potential hypothermia.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Laura Toms was hospitalized that same evening due to a psychiatric condition. The children were placed in a foster home by Hanover Department of Social Services (HDSS) the next day, and petitions were submitted seeking emergency removal orders for the children. The Hanover Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court approved the removal, holding that the children were abused or neglected by their parents. The JDR district court also approved foster care plans for the children presented by HDSS and allowed HDSS to perform additional evaluations and assessments to determine the appropriate goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In October 2003, the JDR district court approved HDSS\u2019s goal of adoption for the children and, in February 2004, ordered that Frazier and Laura Toms\u2019s residual parental rights be terminated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both appealed these decisions to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">At the circuit court hearing, the children\u2019s psychologists testified to the profound neglect evidenced by the children\u2019s underdeveloped speech, intelligence, motor skills, and social and emotional functioning. The children scored below the first percentile on standardized child developmental tests. The children had \u201creceived no health care, no education, no social skills, no speech skills.\u201d The Toms residence \u201cwas so pathetically substandard that it itself demonstrates abuse and neglect.\u201d The guardian ad <em>litem </em>for the children reported to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the circuit court that, during his first meeting with the children, their \u201cspeech was almost wholly unintelligible, consisting of \u2018grunts\u2019 and various forms of body language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Psychological testing revealed that Frazier Toms suffered from episodes of delusional thinking, social phobias, paranoia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, severe anxiety, and avoidant personality features. The extent of his mental illness led one psychologist to conclude that his prognosis for rehabilitation was poor. At one point in the evaluation process, Frazier\u2019s mother reported that her son had been diagnosed as a teenager with paranoid schizophrenia and was hospitalized for that condition. Commenting on this report, the psychologist who prepared a parenting assessment of Toms noted: \u201cSigns of his paranoia were clearly evident during this assessment process.\u201d The parenting assessment concluded that the \u201cchildren would be at serious risk if returned to Mr. Toms at this time or in the near future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The evidence also showed that Toms started drinking alcohol at age six. In 1995, Toms had his driving privileges suspended after a DUI conviction. By 1998, he was consuming up to six beers and a pint of alcohol on a daily basis. He typically passed out at least twice a week from intoxication. Toms\u2019s counsel admitted to the circuit court that Toms \u201cbegan to seriously abuse alcohol, which, of course, made everything worse.\u201d His counsel further acknowledged that \u201cthis family lived in nothing short of absolute crisis conditions for three years before Hanover police, and finally DSS, intervened in January 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">At the circuit court hearing, Toms\u2019s counsel conceded that HDSS proved\u2014as required by Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(B)(1)\u2014that Toms\u2019s neglect or abuse of his children \u201cpresented a serious and substantial threat\u201d to their lives, health, or development. Toms argued, however, that HDSS failed to prove\u2014as required by Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2)\u2014that it was \u201cnot reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>allow the child[ren\u2019s] safe return to [their] parent or parents within a reasonable period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Agreeing with the judgment of the JDR district court, the circuit court approved the goal of adoption and ordered that Toms\u2019s parental rights be terminated under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). \u201cGiven the abuse and neglect heaped upon [the Toms children] that has so profoundly affected them,\u201d the circuit court concluded, \u201cit is without a doubt that it is in their best interest.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In a related criminal proceeding, the circuit court convicted Toms of seven misdemeanors and two felonies for the abuse and neglect of his children. He remains incarcerated at this time on those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Toms appeals the circuit court\u2019s decision to terminate his parental rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, Toms claims the circuit court erred because (A) insufficient evidence supports the decision to terminate, (B) HDSS violated a statutory duty to provide him with rehabilitative services, and (C) constitutional due process principles independently require rehabilitative services prior to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">When reviewing a decision to terminate parental rights, we presume the circuit court \u201cthoroughly weighed all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Fields v. Dinwiddie County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>46 Va.App. 1, 7, 614 S.E.2d 656, 659 (2005) (quoting <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 329, 387 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1990)). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment, \u2018when based on evidence heard <em>ore tenus, </em>will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Logan, </em>13 Va.App. at 128, 409 S.E.2d at 463 (citation omitted)). In its capacity as factfinder, therefore, the circuit court retains \u201cbroad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>9 Va.App. at 328, 387 S.E.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The circuit court in this case terminated Toms\u2019s parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). Under that subsection, residual parental rights may be terminated if clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that it is in the children\u2019s best interests, that the neglect and abuse suffered by the children presents a serious and substantial threat to their life, health, or development (subsection B(l)), and that it is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the children\u2019s safe return to their parent within a reasonable period of time (subsection B(2)). <em>See generally City of Newport News Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Winslow, </em>40 Va.App. 556, 561-62, 580 S.E.2d 463, 465-66 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Because \u201cthe rights of parents may not be lightly severed,\u201d <em>M.G. v. Albemarle County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 170, 187, 583 S.E.2d 761, 769 (2003) (citation omitted), clear and convincing evidence must establish the statutory grounds for termination. <em>Fields, </em>46 Va.App. at 7, 614 S.E.2d at 659. In the end, the \u201cchild\u2019s best interests\u201d remain the \u201cparamount consideration\u201d of the court. <em>Akers v. Fauquier County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>44 Va.App. 247, 262, 604 S.E.2d 737, 744 (2004) (citation omitted). Even on this issue, however, we cannot \u201csubstitute our judgment\u201d for the circuit court\u2019s, <em>Ward v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 144, 148, 408 S.E.2d 921, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>923 (1991), but rather review the record only to determine if sufficient evidence supports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In this case, the factual record supports the circuit court\u2019s decision to terminate Toms\u2019s parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). After the lengthy hearing, the trial court found the evidence was \u201coverwhelming that the Toms children have experienced abuse or neglect that has demonstrably had a serious and substantial detrimental effect on their lives, health and development.\u201d Especially in regards to the older children, the court was \u201cutterly convinced\u201d that their \u201chealth and development has been harmed to such an extent that it may well be permanent.\u201d \u201cGiven the abuse and neglect heaped upon them that has so profoundly affected them, it is without a doubt that it is in their best interests.\u201d These conclusions are fully justified based upon the evidence before the circuit court and the concessions of Toms\u2019s counsel on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We also hold that the record supports the circuit court\u2019s finding that Toms could not, within a reasonable period of time, substantially remedy the conditions that resulted in the children going into foster care. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2). Toms\u2019s life has been badly scarred by destructive patterns of alcohol abuse and debilitating bouts of mental illness. These longstanding conditions go back to his childhood and cannot be explained away as recent, readily correctable, maladies. And they were severe enough to cause Toms to cloister his children in inhumane living conditions, to deprive them of routine medical care, and to do nothing to stop the steep regression in their developmental skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Toms complains that the circuit court did not give him a \u201cfair chance\u201d because it appeared to gauge the probability of his future reformation by examining the severity of his past actions. We fail to see, however, how the circuit court\u2019s reasoning can be characterized as unfair. To be sure, Virginia law recognizes the \u201cmaxim that, sometimes, the most rehable way to gauge a person\u2019s future actions is to examine those of his past.\u201d <em>Petry v. Petry, </em>41 Va.App. 782, 793, 589 S.E.2d 458, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>463 (2003). \u201cAs many courts have observed, one permissible \u2018measure of a parent\u2019s future potential is undoubtedly revealed in the parent\u2019s past behavior with the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cNo one can divine with any assurance the future course of human events. Nevertheless, past actions and relationships over a meaningful period serve as good indicators of what the future may be expected to hold.\u201d <em>Winfield v. Urquhart, </em>25 Va.App. 688, 696-97, 492 S.E.2d 464, 467 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Toms had the opportunity to explain his past actions and to offer promises of future self-reformation. The circuit court, however, rejected his testimony. \u201cSuffice it to say,\u201d the trial judge found, he \u201cwas not convinced of either Mr. Toms\u2019s sincerity or dedication to remedying what are obvious functional disabilities.\u201d \u201cHis testimony was vague and nonspecific,\u201d the judge added, \u201cand particularly revealed that he had taken virtually no steps since January 2003 to remedy anything (recognizing that he was in jail for some period of time).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Given the evidence in this case, the circuit court had sufficient factual grounds to support its decision that Toms could not, within a reasonable period of time, substantially remedy the conditions that resulted in the children going into foster care. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">B. <em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) &amp; Rehabilitative Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">- Whatever permissible inferences flow from his past actions, Toms argues, the circuit court still erred as a matter of law in granting the petition for termination because HDSS failed to provide him with rehabilitation services required by Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). Toms concedes the text of subsection B does not literally impose such a requirement. But the \u201clarger statutory scheme\u201d does, he contends. We disagree. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) requires only that the circuit court consider whether rehabilitation services, if any, have been provided to a parent. Nothing in Code \u00a7 16.1-283 or the larger statutory scheme requires that such services be provided in all cases as a prerequisite to termination under subsection B.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>(i) <em>The Difference Between Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) &amp; (C)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-283CB) and 16.1-283(0(2) both \u201cset forth individual bases upon which a petitioner may seek to terminate residual parental rights.\u201d <em>Winslow, </em>40 Va.App. at 563, 580 S.E.2d at 466. Though we have sometimes blurred the distinctions between the discrete subsections of Code \u00a7 16.1-283, <em>see, e.g., Norfolk Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Hardy, </em>42 Va.App. 546, 552-53, 593 S.E.2d 528, 531 (2004), on this one issue a significant dissimilarity exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Subsection C(2) specifically requires a showing that DSS has provided \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d services to a delinquent parent prior to terminating his rights. In this way, the statute establishes a time frame after the child has entered foster care for the parents \u201cto receive rehabilitative services to enable them to correct the conditions that led to foster care placement.\u201d <em>L.G. v. Amherst County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 51, 57, 581 S.E.2d 886, 889 (2003); <em>see also Harris v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs., </em>223 Va. 235, 243, 288 S.E.2d 410, 415 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Subsection B(2), on the other hand, merely requires the court to <em>\u201ctake into consideration </em>the efforts made to rehabilitate the parent or parents by any public or <em>private </em>social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies <em>prior to </em>the child\u2019s initial placement in foster care.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Added to the statute in 1998, <em>see </em>1998 Va. Acts, ch. 550, this provision swept aside earlier <em>dicta </em>in our caselaw implying that, under subsection B, only rehabilitation services provided by DSS after the child\u2019s removal could be considered. <em>See Banes v. Pulaski Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>1 Va.App. 463, 466, 339 S.E.2d 902, 904 (1986) (apparently recognizing only the rehabilitation efforts \u201ctaken by social agencies\u201d). Subsection B does not create specific time frames, \u201cnor does it mandate that a public or private agency provide any services to a parent after the child enters foster care.\u201d Kate D. O\u2019Leary, <em>Termination of Parental Rights in Virginia, </em>17 J. Civ. Litig. 17 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>That is not to say that a trial court considering a subsection B termination case should ignore a parent\u2019s inexcusable failure to respond to rehabilitative services offered by DSS or other assisting agencies after the child\u2019s removal. Subsection B(2)(c) specifically recognizes this circumstance as a <em>prima facie </em>ground justifying termination. <em>See, e.g., Logan, </em>13 Va.App. at 128-29, 409 S.E.2d at 463; <em>Banes, </em>1 Va.App. at 466, 339 S.E.2d at 904. But it is to say that the provision of such services, while a relevant circumstance, cannot be viewed as a prerequisite to a subsection B termination\u2014one, which if not met, would render termination legally invalid no matter the unique circumstances of the case. The <em>prima facie </em>examples listed in Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014288(B)(2)(a) to (B)(2)(c) do not purport to be the only conceivable methods of proof. The list is illustrative, not exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Put another way, even though subsection B identifies a parent\u2019s failure to respond to rehabilitative services (implying that some were in fact offered by \u201crehabilitative agencies\u201d) as <em>\u201cprima facie </em>evidence that it is not reasonably likely that the child can be returned to the parent in a reasonable period of time, the statute does not condition such a finding upon this evidence alone.\u201d <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 539, 394 S.E.2d 492, 494 (1990) (rejecting a parent\u2019s claim that DSS \u201cfailed to sustain its burden\u201d under subsection B because DSS \u201cprovided no proof that he was ever offered, or ever participated in, any rehabilitative services\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Viewed in context, subsection B \u201cspeaks prospectively\u201d and requires the circuit court to make a judgment call on the parent\u2019s ability, following a finding of neglect or abuse, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>substantially remedy the underlying problems. <em>Winslow, </em>40 Va.App. at 562-63, 580 S.E.2d at 466.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In contrast, subsection C termination decisions hinge not so much on the magnitude of the problem that created the original danger to the child, but on the demonstrated failure of the parent to make reasonable changes. Considerably more \u201cretrospective in nature,\u201d <em>id., </em>subsection C requires the court to determine whether the parent has been unwilling or unable to remedy the problems during the period in which he has been offered rehabilitation services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">This dissimilarity stems from the differing precipitating events leading to the need to remove the child from the home in the first place. The precipitating event of subsection B is a judicial finding of neglect or abuse. Subsection C termination cases, however, start off with no such finding of parental culpability. Subsection B, unlike C, often addresses situations farther along the continuum toward termination\u2014thus making the continued provision of rehabilitative services a relevant concern, but not an absolute prerequisite to termination. <em>See Kaywood, </em>10 Va.App. at 539, 394 S.E.2d at 494; <em>see also </em>David J. Herring, <em>Inclusion of the Reasonable Efforts Requirement in Termination of Parental Rights Statutes: Punishing the Child for the Failures of the State Child Welfare System, </em>54 U. Pitt. L.Rev. 139, 174-77 (1992) (surveying state statutes that treat rehabilitative services as a \u201crelevant\u201d factor, but not a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(ii) <em>The Larger Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Toms argues that any judicial construction of subsection B should be tested against the context of the larger statutory scheme. We certainly agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But doing so does not lead us to the conclusion Toms asks us to draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Toms points us to Code \u00a7 16.1-281, the statute requiring DSS to prepare a foster care plan and submit it to the court for approval. In 1998, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 16.1-281. Prior to that amendment, the statute required that the initial foster care plan \u201cshall be designed to lead to the return of the child to his parents or other prior custodian within the shortest practicable time which shall be specified in the plan.\u201d Former Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B). The 1998 amendment rewrote that sentence this way: <em>\u201cIf consistent with the child\u2019s health and safety, </em>the plan shall be designed to <em>support reasonable efforts which </em>lead to the return of the child to his parents.... \u201d 1998 Va. Acts, ch. 550 (italicized language added by the amendment) (codified at Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)). The amendment, therefore, gave DSS the initial discretion to abstain from reunification efforts if it deems them inconsistent with the \u201chealth and safety\u201d of the child. <em>Id. </em>DSS also acquired the latitude to determine what efforts, if any, would be \u201creasonable\u201d under the circumstances. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In addition, the 1998 amendment added a separate paragraph at the end of Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B). This provision precludes any court from overruling a DSS decision to forgo reunification efforts in certain egregious circumstances\u2014like when a parent has been through prior involuntary terminations, or has been convicted of certain violent felonies, or has been found guilty of felony sexual assault. <em>See </em>1998 Va. Acts, ch. 550 (amending Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)). Outside these specific circumstances, however, the court retains it discretionary power to order rehabilitative services in aid of reunification despite DSS\u2019s initial decision that such efforts would be inconsistent with the child\u2019s health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In short, Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B) now renders DSS\u2019s duty to provide rehabilitation services contingent upon its belief that the reunification goal would be \u201cconsistent with the child\u2019s health and safety.\u201d The new paragraph added to the end of Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B) goes no further. It addresses not DSS\u2019s discretion\u2014but the reviewing court\u2019s oversight power. The 1998 amendments to \u00a7 16.1-281(B) limit the authority of the court to reverse a DSS decision to withhold rehabilitative services in cases involving egregious circumstances. But nothing in the post-1998 version of Code \u00a7 16.1-281 requires that DSS in every case, as an indispensable precondition to later seeking termination, provide rehabilitative services in aid of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In this case, HDSS in fact included in the initial foster care plan a summary of anticipated rehabilitative services in aid of reunification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As various psychological reports and parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>assessments came in, however, HDSS concluded that reunification was inconsistent with the children\u2019s \u201chealth and safety\u201d\u2014a judgment call entrusted to HDSS by Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 281(B). By approving the foster care plan recommending adoption and by granting HDSS\u2019s petition to terminate Toms\u2019s parental rights, the circuit court concurred with HDSS\u2019s assessment. Because we hold the evidence supports the circuit court\u2019s decision, HDSS\u2019s failure to provide rehabilitation services in aid of reunification cannot be a viable ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">C. <em>Due Process &amp; Rehabilitative Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Finally, Toms claims that the circuit court violated his due process rights by terminating his parental rights without first ensuring that he had received rehabilitative services. We again disagree. Due process requires that \u201cfundamentally fair procedures\u201d be employed in parental termination cases. <em>Santosky v. </em>Kramer; 455 U.S. 745, 754, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1395, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). This requires the state to demonstrate the statutory grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 769, 102 S.Ct. at 1403 (agreeing with the majority of states that have concluded a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof \u201cstrikes a fair bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>anee between the rights of the natural parents and the State\u2019s legitimate concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">So, when the termination statute requires\u2014as Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C) does\u2014a showing \u201cthat \u2018reasonable and appropriate efforts\u2019 were made by social agencies to remedy the conditions leading to foster care,\u201d <em>Wright v. Alexandria Div. of Soc. Servs., </em>16 Va.App. 821, 829-30, 433 S.E.2d 500, 505 (1993), due process requires that this fact be proved by clear and convincing evidence, <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Weaver v. Roanoke Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>220 Va. 921, 928, 265 S.E.2d 692, 696 (1980) (reviewing a termination decision under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C))).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">No judicial precedent has imposed a <em>constitutional </em>duty to provide rehabilitative services prior to termination when the statutory grounds for termination do not otherwise require them. And we know of no principled basis for asserting there to be one. We thus agree that \u201cproof of past reasonable efforts\u201d cannot be elevated into a constitutional mandate. David J. Herring, <em>supra, </em>at 168. \u201cAll that the Constitution requires under the majority opinion in <em>Santosky </em>is for the state to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the parent is currently unfit to provide proper care and custody for the child as defined by state [parental termination] statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Because sufficient evidence supports the circuit court\u2019s factual findings and no error of law undermines its judgment, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision to terminate Toms\u2019s residual parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">. HDSS sought the termination of the Toms\u2019s parental rights with respect to six of their eight children\u2014the oldest son reached the age of majority, and both Frazier and Laura Toms voluntarily terminated their parental rights to their infant son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\">. The circuit court also terminated the residual parental rights of Laura Toms, a decision she did not appeal. Throughout this opinion, \"Toms\u201d will refer only to Granville Frazier Toms, III, unless the context suggests otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\">. Toms also challenges the circuit court\u2019s companion order approving the HDSS foster care plan\u2019s goal of adoption. Our decision to affirm the termination order necessarily subsumes this aspect of his appeal because a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard governs judicial modifications of foster care plans. <em>See Richmond Dep\u2019t of Soc. </em>Servs. <em>v. Carter, </em>28 Va.App. 494, 497, 507 S.E.2d 87, 88 (1998); <em>Padilla v. Norfolk Div. of Soc.

Subsection B, after all, also lists another example of <em>prima facie </em>evidence (severe \"mental or emotional illness\u201d) that makes no mention of a parent\u2019s failure to respond to any rehabilitative services. Because one of the examples of a <em>prima facie </em>case expressly outlined in \u00a7 16.1-283(B) includes no mention of rehabilitative services, it cannot be reasonably asserted that the subsection necessarily requires them in all cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b315-5\">. <em>Cf.

ASFA superseded the much criticized Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), which had the unintended effect of encouraging the use of state termination statutes to \"trap children in temporary foster care placements.\" David J.
