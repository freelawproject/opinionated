Bowling claims he is innocent of statutory burglary and grand larceny, of which he was convicted in the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County on August 31, 2000. This Court ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the Attorney General to respond to the petition, appointed counsel to represent Bowling, and permitted Bowling\u2019s counsel to reply to the Attorney General\u2019s response. Upon consideration of the petition, the Attorney General\u2019s response and motion to dismiss, the reply by court-appointed counsel, and the record, this Court denied the motion to dismiss and remanded the matter to the trial court to certify findings of fact regarding factual issues in dispute. The trial court conducted a hearing in this matter and supplied this Court with its certified findings of fact. Upon consideration thereof, we dismiss the petition for failing to establish previously unknown or unavailable evidence sufficient to justify the issuance of the writ. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">On February 22, 2000, a grand jury indicted Bowling for committing statutory burglary and grand larceny at the home of Michael Pickeral. On May 2, 2000, Jesse W. Meadows, III, Bowling\u2019s court-appointed attorney, filed a notice of an alibi defense. The notice of alibi stated that Bowling, together with \u201cNorman Isaac,\u201d had worked for Fred Clements on the day of the theft, but that Bowling had left the job site at around noon to permit Bowling\u2019s girlfriend to use their vehicle. Bowling claimed he went home and alone cared for a toddler until his girlfriend\u2019s return between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">At the outset of Bowling\u2019s bench trial on July 26, 2000, Bowling stated he had given his attorney the names of all witnesses, that his witnesses were present, and that he was ready to proceed with the trial. Meadows advised the trial court there was an alibi witness Bowling had wanted to subpoena, but Meadows could provide no reasonable assurance he would be able to locate the witness if granted additional time. Meadows acknowledged the defense had been granted a continuance on May 23, 2000, to locate the missing witness. Bowling said he understood Meadows\u2019 statement, but wanted to proceed with trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The evidence proved Bowling had performed construction work at Pickeral\u2019s home, ending on August 3, 1999. While at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Pickeral\u2019s home, Bowling had remarked upon a large glass jar in Pickeral\u2019s living room. The jar contained a quantity of coins with an estimated value between $3,500 and $5,500. Pickeral never saw Bowling touch the jar.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">When Pickeral returned home at about 2:00 p.m. on August 30, 1999, he found the glass jar missing from its usual location.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A \u201chandful\u201d of change and glass shards were in the driveway. Larger pieces of glass, including one that bore Bowling\u2019s fingerprint, were under some nearby shrubbery. Between August 3 and 30, 1999, the jar had been cleaned at least twice using window cleaner and paper towels.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">When interviewed by the police on November 11, 1999, Bowling first denied having seen the jar. He then said he had seen it, but did not mention having touched it. In a subsequent interview, the police confronted Bowling about the presence of his fingerprint on the glass shard. Bowling then said that he had touched the jar \u201caround the top, ... somewhere around the middle, and then maybe around the side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Testifying in his own behalf, Bowling said he had tried to pick up the glass jar while he was working at the Pickeral residence. Bowling testified that on the day of the theft he was working for Clements building a deck at Clements\u2019 mother\u2019s home. Bowling said he and \u201cNorman Isaac\u201d had worked on the deck from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., excluding a lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The Commonwealth and the defense stipulated that Bowling had worked for Clements from August 27 to September 9, 1999. Bowling worked Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. each day. According to the written stipulation, \u201cNorman Stewart\u201d was assigned to work with Bowling on the project. Clements did not know, however, whether Bowling was or was not at work on the date of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">At the conclusion of the bench trial, the trial court convicted Bowling of the charged offenses. Both this Court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Supreme Court of Virginia denied Bowling\u2019s petitions for appeal from his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In connection with a habeas corpus action filed by Bowling, Meadows filed an affidavit indicating that a few days before the originally-scheduled trial date of May 23, 2000, Bowling advised that his alibi had changed because he had been confused about the date of the offenses. Bowling then claimed he had worked with Isaac for Clements and had remained on the job site between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Bowling and Meadows were unable to locate Isaac. As a result, at Meadows\u2019 request the trial was continued until July 26, 2000 to give the defense additional time to locate Isaac. Neither Meadows nor Bowling found Isaac before Bowling\u2019s trial. Although before his sentencing hearing Bowling informed Meadows he had located Isaac, Bowling never provided Meadows with any further information regarding Isaac.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In support of his petition for a writ of actual innocence, Bowling provided the following documents: (1) an affidavit from Clements, dated July 25, 2000, stating Bowling had worked for him from August 27 to September 9 from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. each day with \u201cNorman Stewart\u201d; (2) an affidavit, dated January 14, 2002, from Norman Stewart that he witnessed Bowling working from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on the day of the theft; (3) a handwritten anonymous note from a person claiming to have committed the crime;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (4) Meadows\u2019 affidavit filed in the habeas corpus proceeding; and (5) an affidavit from Oscar J. Brooks stating Bowling was at Brooks\u2019 home from 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. on the date of the offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>With his response to the petition, the Attorney General produced an affidavit from Stewart dated October 22, 2004. In the affidavit, Stewart, who can neither read nor write, stated he signed a document at Bowling\u2019s request in January of 2002. The document was not read to Stewart before he signed it. Stewart was led to believe the document would help Bowling with a tax problem. Stewart remembered, in a general fashion, that he was working with Bowling around the time of August 30, 1999, but he could recall no exact dates or times they worked together. While he was working with Bowling in 1999, Stewart lived in Lynchburg in Fairview Heights. He later moved to Westgate Trailer Park, also in Lynchburg. In November of 2001 Stewart moved to another Lynchburg address.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Upon remand from this Court, the trial court held a hearing on April 7, 2005 regarding Bowling\u2019s allegation of actual innocence. At the hearing, Stewart testified he was hired by Clements in 1999 to build a deck at Clements\u2019 mother\u2019s home in Lynchburg. Stewart\u2019s job was to assist Bowling on the project. Stewart and Bowling worked together for at least four days, but Stewart could not remember the exact dates. Stewart stated that at that time he lived at Westgate Trailer Court in Lynchburg. He did not move from that address for three years, and he was listed in the telephone book. Stewart affirmed that he is unable to read or write except to sign his name. At some point, Bowling took Stewart to the office of a notary. Stewart signed a document Bowling said would help Bowling on his taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Brooks testified he accompanied Bowling and Stewart to the notary in 2000 and witnessed Stewart sign an affidavit. Brooks stated the affidavit was read aloud to Stewart twice before he signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Bowling testified he initially believed Stewart\u2019s last name was Isaac, and first learned otherwise two days before trial when he reviewed Clements\u2019 affidavit. Bowling said he tried to find Stewart, but he had moved and Clements was unaware of Stewart\u2019s whereabouts. Bowling did not see Stewart again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>until after the trial when Clements sent Bowling and Stewart to perform another job. At that time, Bowling learned Stewart was living at Westgate Trader Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The trial court concluded that Bowling could have obtained Stewart\u2019s testimony through diligent efforts prior to the time the convictions became final. Because Stewart was unable to state he was with Bowling at the specific date and time of the theft, the trial court found Stewart\u2019s testimony did not support Bowling\u2019s alibi. Nor was there affirmative evidence from Clements that Bowling was working on the date and time of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The Court of Appeals derives its power to issue a writ of actual innocence from Chapter 19.3 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-327.10 through 19.2-327.14. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A) requires a petitioner to allege, under oath,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(in) an exact description of the previously unknown or unavailable evidence supporting the allegation of innocence; (iv) that such evidence was previously unknown or unavailable to the petitioner or his trial attorney of record at the time the conviction became final in the circuit court; ... (vi) that the previously unknown or unavailable evidence is such as could not, by the exercise of diligence, have been discovered or obtained before the expiration of 21 days following entry of the final order of conviction by the court; (vii) the previously unknown or unavailable evidence is material and when considered with all the other evidence in the current record, will prove that no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; and (viii) the previously unknown or unavailable evidence is not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">To qualify for the issuance of a writ of actual innocence, a petitioner must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, \u201call of the allegations contained in clauses (iv) through (viii) of subsection A of \u00a7 19.2-327.11,\u201d and this Court must find \u201cthat no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ...\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13(ii). If the petitioner fails \u201cto establish previously unknown or unavailable evidence sufficient to justify issuance of the writ,\u201d the petition must be dismissed. Code \u00a7 19.2\u2014327.13(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim of actual innocence rests upon his ability to prove the alibi defense he advanced at trial, namely that he was working for Clements on a job with Stewart when the offenses occurred. However, neither Stewart nor Clements was able to provide clear evidence that Bowling was working on the date and time of the offenses. Despite his affidavit to the contrary, which Stewart was unable to read, Stewart testified he did not remember the exact dates and times he worked with Bowling. Although Bowling was employed by Clements during the time frame that included the date of the offenses, Clements could not state Bowling was working when the theft occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Furthermore, the record does not demonstrate that any trial testimony Stewart may have been able to provide constituted \u201cunknown or unavailable evidence\u201d undiscoverable through diligence before Bowling\u2019s convictions were finalized. Although initially Bowling may have been confused and believed Stewart\u2019s last name to be Isaac, Clements advised Bowling before trial of Stewart\u2019s true name. With this knowledge, Bowling should have been able to locate Stewart, who lived locally and was listed in the telephone book. In addition, Bowling could have obtained Clements\u2019 help to locate Stewart, as Clements had employed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Bowling thus has failed to establish previously unknown or unavailable evidence sufficient to justify the issuance of the writ. Accordingly, Bowling\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence is dismissed. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Because the issues addressed herein are of first impression and potential litigants and members of the bar may benefit from the directives herein, we direct the Clerk to publish this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The Court\u2019s records reflect that Melissa W. Friedman, Esquire, is counsel of record for petitioner in this matter. The Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County shall allow the said court-appointed counsel the fee set forth below and counsel\u2019s necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses.

Pickeral left the home for work that day at 7:15 a.m. Pickeral\u2019s wife was at home until 9:00 to 9:30 a.m., when she went to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. Both Bowling and the Attorney General agree the anonymous letter would not be admissible evidence. Because Bowling does not contend the letter somehow supports his petition even though it was inadmissible, we need not consider the letter further in determining whether Bowling is entitled to a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">. Brooks\u2019 affidavit has no tendency to support Bowling\u2019s alibi defense because Pickeral's wife was present in the home until 9:00 or 9:30 a.m. on the date of the offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
