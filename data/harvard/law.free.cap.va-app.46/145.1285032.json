On appeal, mother contends the court violated Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 by admitting testimony about her from the children\u2019s therapist without her consent. Mother also contends that, in light of the erroneous admission of this evidence, the trial court erred in requiring her to pay a portion of the attorney\u2019s fees father incurred for the contempt proceedings. We hold the admission of the challenged evidence was reversible error. Thus, we reverse the finding of contempt, vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees, and remand for a determination anew in light of the evidence properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The parties were married in 1988. Two children were born of the marriage, the first in 1992 and the second in 1995. On February 18, 2004, mother filed a bill of complaint for divorce, alleging the parties were living separate and apart in the marital residence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She also filed a motion for <em>pendente lite </em>relief. Father filed a cross-bill for divorce and his own motion for <em>pendente lite </em>relief. The court subsequently entered a consent <em>pendente lite </em>order and amended consent <em>pendente lite </em>order.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Thereafter, father filed a verified petition for issuance of a rule to show cause, and mother filed a similar petition. Father complained, <em>inter alia, </em>that mother violated the provision of the consent order that neither party was to denigrate or ridicule the other parent to the children. He also complained that mother failed to keep him apprised of the children\u2019s schedules as required by the order, failed to use a computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>program to facilitate that communication as required by the order, and \u201ccontinually encroached on [his] custodial time with [the] children.\u201d The trial court issued rules to show cause for both petitions and scheduled them for hearing on October 14, 2004. At the time of the hearing on the rule, father also complained that mother moved out of the marital residence with the children without giving him thirty days\u2019 notice of her new address as required by the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Father offered the testimony of licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Guy Van Syckle. Mother objected to his testimony under Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 because that statute \u201cstates, No mental health provider shall testify on behalf of or against a parent unless they have advanced written consent by that party.\u201d Father responded that Dr. Van Syckle was not the mental health care provider for either parent. The trial court overruled mother\u2019s objection, stating, \u201cHe\u2019s a mental health care provider for the children. The best interest of the children still prevails as a standard of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Dr. Van Syckle testified that the parties were referred to him \u201cby their attorneys ... at the beginning of April [2004].\u201d When asked, \u201cAnd did you then become the therapist for the children?\u201d, Dr. Van Syckle responded as follows: \u201cI became what was called a co-parenting coordinator, co-therapist for the parents with the understanding I would eventually meet and work with the children.\u201d He was \u201cnot retained to do a neutral custody evaluation\u201d and testified he was not at the show cause hearing to render \u201can opinion or recommendation regarding custody and visitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Dr. Van Syckle met with each parent individually for one session and met with them together for four or five sessions. He then met with the children for about eight sessions, during four of which they were accompanied by mother and four by father. He may also have had individual sessions with only the children. Dr. Van Syckle gave extensive testimony regarding the parties\u2019 interactions with each other and their children, as well as what the children said about their parents and what the parents said about each other. That testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>included Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s statement that he \u201cgot quite a bit of information from the children [that father] was being undermined as a parent in the home\u201d by mother. Dr. Van Syckle also observed that mother \u201cwould spend the entire session with the children devaluing their father outright\u201d and said he could \u201cnot recall a supportive statement [about father] that she did make during any of the sessions,\u201d either alone or in the presence of the girls, which he described as \u201cunusual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">Father also testified about mother\u2019s failure to comply with the consent <em>pendente lite </em>order. Mother gave testimony that conflicted with father\u2019s and Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In argument on the rule, father\u2019s counsel repeatedly relied on the testimony of Dr. Van Syckle as evidence from a \u201ctotally neutral\u201d person that mother \u201cha[d] done everything she [could] to make sure [the provisions of the consent <em>pendente lite </em>order] didn\u2019t work\u201d and that she had repeatedly denigrated and devalued father in the presence of the children. Father asked, <em>inter alia, </em>that mother be ordered \u201cto pay for the time that it has taken us [and Dr. Van Syckle] to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing on father\u2019s show cause rule, the court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">[Mother], you\u2019ve got to abide by the Court\u2019s order. I find as clear[ly] and unequivocally as I can find, in this case, you have not done that. You have violated this Court\u2019s order in the worst possible ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">First of all, you moved without 30 days\u2019 notice. And I\u2019ll be candid with you. That doesn\u2019t cause me great heartache____It\u2019s a technical violation of the order. That, in and of itself, is sufficient to find you in contempt. However, when I listen to the testimony, particularly Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s\u2014you know, your discussions with your children, you[r] denigrating [father]. All of that is unacceptable____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">One of the things you need to be aware of is that one of the criteria for custody is the ability of the custodial parent to foster the relationship of the children with the noncustodial parent. That\u2019s positive fostering. I find on this record you have zero positive fostering. Dr. Van Syckle even said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>it, you didn\u2019t have one single positive thing to say about the girls\u2019 father. I mean, there has got to be something that he does well, even if he\u2019s just a good soccer coach. Not one\u2014 not one positive thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">... I\u2019m going to postpone a determination as to what to do with the contempt of [mother] until the next hearing until I\u2019ve heard the ... rule to show cause [against father]. But I will tell you that there better be some cooperation between the two of you over the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The court then entered an order finding mother in contempt. That order did not articulate the precise basis on which the contempt finding was predicated, but it did indicate that until such time as the court determined the appropriate sanctions for the contempt, \u201cthe parties are expected to cooperate with each other with respect to the children and with respect to fostering the relationship between the children and each parent.\u201d Mother objected to the finding of contempt on the ground that \u201cthe only evidence of such was the testimony of the children\u2019s mental health provider, who provided testimony for the father and against the mother, over the mother\u2019s objection pursuant to Va.Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1\u201d and that \u201c[t]he admission of such testimony constituted error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">When the parties returned to court about six weeks later, on December 2, 2004, father offered testimony that mother continued to violate the order and again requested an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In argument, father\u2019s counsel again referred to the testimony of Dr. Van Syckle, arguing, \u201c[Mother] does not want [father] to be a participating parent; that is clear. Dr. Van [Syckle\u2019s] words are still ringing in my mind, she hates him.\u201d Mother\u2019s attorney and the court then engaged in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... I hate to keep coming back to this\u2014but I do need to point out that\u2014and particularly because [father\u2019s attorney] keeps wanting to, you know, quote or paraphrase from Dr. Van [Syckle\u2019s] testimony\u2014is that Dr. Van [Syckle\u2019s] testimony came in over my objection, contrary to the statute. And the whole reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>that she was found in contempt is because there was inadmissible evidence that was heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ve already ruled on that. And the reason that she was found in contempt was because of her conduct, her program of not permitting the father\u2014who she had joint custody with\u2014to have time with the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">Her comments like these kids only need one parent, denigrating the other parent in front of the children. And in fact, if you recall, Dr. Van [Syckle] said he even had that conduct in his office, and he had to call her down about it and say, don\u2019t do that when we\u2019re having a joint session here, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor wouldn\u2019t have heard any of that if that evidence hadn\u2019t come in contrary to the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">THE COURT: There was a host of other evidence in addition to that about her conduct, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a viable defensive position. But I hear your argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">On the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, the court noted it had conducted two hearings and had \u201cfound in very clear and unambiguous terms that [mother] was clearly in violation of the Court\u2019s order.\u201d As a result, it ordered mother to pay $8,000 toward father\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. It entered an order to that effect, and mother again noted her objection, claiming the court improperly allowed Dr. Van Syckle to testify over her objection and that \u201cthere was no admissible evidence to support the finding of contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Mother noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3 requires a court to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cmental condition of each parent\u201d in determining what custody or visitation arrangements are in the best interests of the child. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(4) (requiring consideration of \u201c[t]he age and physical and mental condition of the parties and any special circumstances of the family\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>determining spousal support); Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4) (requiring consideration of \u201c[t]he ages and physical and mental condition of the parties\u201d in equitably distributing marital property).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Prior to July 1, 2003, the only statutes governing the admissibility of the testimony of a licensed mental health care provider in a child custody or visitation proceeding were Code \u00a7 8.01-399, which applied to any \u201cduly licensed practitioner of any branch of the healing arts,\u201d and Code \u00a7 8.01-400.2, which applied to certain licensed professional counselors, clinical social workers and psychologists. Both provided a privilege for diagnosis and treatment the provider gave his or her \u201cpatient\u201d or \u201cclient\u201d and for any communications made by the \u201cpatient\u201d or \u201cclient\u201d in the course of the professional relationship. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-399(A), -400.2. However, both statutes provided the privilege was inapplicable if \u201cthe physical or mental condition of the [patient or client] is at issue in [a civil] action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-399(B), -400.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">As cited above, custody and visitation proceedings require courts to consider the mental health of the parties. <em>See </em>Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u00a7 20-124.3. Thus, \u201clawyers and judges have been accustomed to breaching this area of confidentiality [in the context of custody and visitation] because the patient has placed his or her mental condition at issue.\u201d Elizabeth P. Coughter &amp; Ronald R. Tweel, <em>Family Law, </em>37 U. of R. Law Rev. 155, 170 (2002). The provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-399 and -400.2 specifically support this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In 2002, however, the General Assembly passed new legislation specifically limiting the admissibility of mental health records in child custody and visitation proceedings. Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1, which took effect July 1, 2003, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case in which custody or visitation of a minor child is at issue pursuant to \u00a7 20-124.2, whether in a circuit or district court, the records concerning a parent, kept by any licensed mental health care provider and any information obtained during or from therapy shall be privileged and confidential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">B. In any case in which custody or visitation of a minor child is at issue pursuant to \u00a7 20-124.2, whether in a circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>or district court, a mental health care provider licensed in the Commonwealth may not be required to testify on behalf of or against a parent or any of the parent\u2019s adult relatives, and may do so only with the advance written consent of the parent. If the mental health care provider testifies, such testimony shall be limited to the custody or visitation case in question, and the provider\u2019s records and notes regarding that parent shall be admissible in the court proceeding. However, the court may order a licensed mental health care provider to testify on matters specifically related and limited to suspicion of an abused or neglected child as defined in \u00a7 63.2-100 of the Code of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">C. Nothing in this section shall supercede the provisions of \u00a7 63.2-1509 of the Code of Virginia related to the required reporting of suspicion of an abused or neglected child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">D. This section shall not apply to mental health care providers who have conducted or are conducting an independent mental health evaluation pursuant to a court order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Mother contends that Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 prevented husband from offering testimony about her from the mental health care provider appointed by the court to counsel the parties\u2019 children. Father contends, as the trial court ruled, that Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 applies only when the parent is the patient. We agree with mother and hold that, in this case \u201cin which custody or visitation of a minor child is at issue pursuant to \u00a7 20-124.2,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court erroneously admitted testimony \u201cconcerning a parent\u201d that constituted \u201cinformation obtained during ... therapy.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201c \u2018[T]he province of construction is wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnett v. D.L. Bromwell, Inc., </em>6 Va.App. 30, 34, 366 S.E.2d 271, 273 (1988) (quoting <em>Winston v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 407-08, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954)). \u201c \u2018Non-technical words in statutes are taken to have been used in their ordinary sense and acceptation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gomes v. City of Richmond, </em>220 Va. 449, 452, 258 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1979) (quoting <em>Bd. of Supers. v.

Kenbridge Constr., </em>248 Va. 393, 396, 448 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1994) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Crislip v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 66, 71-72, 554 S.E.2d 96, 98 (2001). Further, statutes on the same subject matter, i.e., those standing <em>in pari materia, </em>must be considered together and harmonized if possible. <em>Lambert v. Barrett, </em>115 Va. 136, 141, 78 S.E. 586, 587 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The language in Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 is plain. Subsection (A) refers in broad terms to \u201cthe records concerning <em>a parent, </em>kept by a licensed mental health care provider and any information obtained during or from therapy.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1(A) (emphasis added). Subsection (B) provides that the mental health care provider \u201cmay not be required to testify on behalf of or against <em>a parent </em>or any of the parent\u2019s adult relatives\u201d without \u201cthe advance written consent of <em>the parent.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1(B) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Nothing in the language of Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 as enacted requires that the parent must have been a patient in order to invoke the privilege. The language in the bill originally introduced in the House of Delegates, in contrast, referred to \u201ca patient\u201d rather than \u201ca parent\u201d and required consent of \u201cthe patient\u201d before a mental health care provider could be \u201crequired to testify on behalf of or against a patient or any of the patient\u2019s relatives.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>H.B. 1001 (Jan. 9, 2002). The House Committee for Courts of Justice then proposed a substitute bill that referred to \u201ca parent\u201d rather than \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>patient,\u201d and the bill proceeded with that language. H.B. 1001 (as substituted Feb. 8, 2002). Because the statute as enacted refers to \u201ca parent,\u201d coupled with legislative history implying a rejection of language limiting the privilege to \u201ca patient,\u201d we must give the term, \u201cparent,\u201d its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Interpretation of the statute by comparison to other, similar statutes supports this result. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-399 and -400.2, in contrast to Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1, refer to the \u201cpatient\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u201cclient\u201d of a health care provider, showing that the General Assembly clearly knew how to limit a privilege in this fashion when it so desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Finally, the General Assembly included only a limited number of exceptions to the parental privilege of Code \u00a7 20-124.8:1. The statute provides that \u201cthe court may order a licensed mental health care provider to testify on matters specifically related and limited to suspicion of an abused or neglected child as defined in [Code] \u00a7 63.2-100\u201d and that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall supercede the provisions of [Code] \u00a7 63.2-1509 ... related to the required reporting of suspicion of an abused or neglected child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1(B), (C). It also exempts from the privilege \u201cmental health care providers who have conducted or are conducting an independent mental health evaluation pursuant to a court order.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1(D). Noticeably absent from Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 is the provision contained in Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-399 and 8.01-400.2 that permits disclosure \u201cwhen a court, in the exercise of sound discretion, deems [such disclosure] necessary to the proper administration of justice.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-399(B), -400.2. In addition, Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1 provides no exception permitting the trial court to order disclosure for the broad purpose of determining the best interests of the child. Rather, Code \u00a7 20-124.2 embodies the General Assembly\u2019s chosen method for protecting the best interests of the child; it permits the court to \u201corder an independent mental health or psychological evaluation to assist the court in its determination of the best interests of the child.\u201d Absent such an independent evaluation (and absent any suspicion of abuse or neglect), information \u201cconcerning a parent ... obtained during or from therapy shall be privileged and confidential\u201d and may not be disclosed without the parent\u2019s consent. Code \u00a7 20-124.3:1(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s admission of Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony about mother, given without her written consent and over her express objection, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Although the court erred in admitting Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony, that error does not require reversal if we determine the error was harmless. <em>Clay v.

But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected____ If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the [judgment] cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\"><em>Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731-32 (quoting <em>Kotteakos v.

Father\u2019s counsel relied repeatedly on Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony in arguing that mother should be held in contempt for denigrating father to the children. Further, in finding mother in contempt due to her \u201cunacceptable\u201d behavior, the trial court said it \u201clisten[ed] to the testimony, particularly Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s\u2014... mother\u2019s discussions with [the] children, [mother\u2019s] denigrating [father].\u201d In later argument on the appropriate sanctions, the court again relied heavily on Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony about mother\u2019s denigrating father in front of the children. Although the trial court subsequently said there was \u201ca host of other evidence in addition to [Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony] about her conduct,\u201d father\u2019s testimony regarding mother\u2019s denigration of father was not nearly as specific as Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony and did not include evidence of the children\u2019s reaction to mother\u2019s behavior. Father testified merely that mother would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>not exchange pleasantries with him in front of the children and did not support his efforts to review their homework or enforce a particular bedtime. Dr. Van Syckle, by contrast, testified that mother called father names, criticized him in front of the children, and reduced one of the children to tears when the child questioned mother\u2019s negative comments about father. Although the trial court was free to find father\u2019s testimony more credible than mother\u2019s, we cannot conclude on this record that the erroneous admission of Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony \u201cdid not influence\u201d the trial court or \u201chad but slight effect\u201d on its decision to reject mother\u2019s testimony and hold her in contempt. <em>See Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731-32 (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764, 66 S.Ct. at 1248, 90 L.Ed. at 1566).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Thus, we hold the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of Dr. Van Syckle\u2019s testimony was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the finding of contempt, vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees, and remand for a determination anew in light of the evidence properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">.
