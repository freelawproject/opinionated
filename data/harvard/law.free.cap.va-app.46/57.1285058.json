HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">This matter comes before the Court on a rehearing <em>en banc </em>following the issuance of a divided panel opinion of this Court. Appellant Melvin G. <em>Perry </em>(\u201cPerry\u201d) appeals a ruling from the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission in which the commission held that appellee Tom Delisle (\u201cDelisle\u201d) sustained his burden of proving that his business has regularly in service less than three employees and, as a result, is not subject to the provisions of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Because credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s finding, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On April 4, 2001, Perry was installing vinyl siding on a house when he fell off of the scaffolding, injuring his back, head, and feet. Perry filed a claim with the commission, seeking compensation for wage loss, compensation for permanent disability, and payment of lifetime medical costs associated with his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Delisle defended the claim by arguing that he regularly employed less than three employees and, therefore, was not subject to the provisions of the Act. At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, Delisle testified that he had been operating R &amp; T Construction for \u201cnine or ten years.\u201d Delisle agreed that he employed three employees \u201cthroughout 1999 and for most of 2000\u201d and that he again employed three employees beginning in the fall of 2001. From December 2000 until August 2001, however, Delisle testified that he only had two employees. And, when asked about the employee who left the company in November 2000, Delisle testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Q: Do you recall when Mr. Mariner left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">A: He left the year before and we were working on Ed Popkins house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">Q: Okay. Do you recall when?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">A: Let me think back now. I would say October of 2000, maybe, November of 2000, something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">Q: Okay---- [D]id you replace him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">Q: And why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">A: Well, I mean, he really wasn\u2019t much of an asset and we didn\u2019t have that much work <em>for\u2014really didn\u2019t need another employee.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">The deputy commissioner held that Delisle was not subject to the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, reasoning that, at the time of the accident, Delisle had \u201cregularly in service less than three employees.\u201d Specifically, by decision issued July 1, 2003, the deputy commissioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">found that Tom Delisle t/a R &amp; T Construction employed two employees from December 2000 through August 2001. Gonzales and Delisle credibly testified that Tom Delisle t/a R &amp; T Construction employed only Gonzales and Perry from December 2000 through August 2001. Tom Delisle t/a R &amp; T Construction\u2019s records support this credible testimony as does Parks\u2019s credible testimony that he did not begin working for Tom Delisle t/a R <em>&amp; </em>T Construction until shortly before his birthday on October 2, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The deputy commissioner also noted that \u201cTom Delisle t/a R &amp; T Construction operated with only two employees for four months before Perry\u2019s fall and then continued to operate with two employees for another four months after this incident despite Perry\u2019s inability to return to the full duties of his preinjury employment.\u201d Accordingly, the deputy commissioner concluded that this was not a case where the employer should remain subject to the provisions of the Act because the number of employees \u201ctemporarily\u201d fell below three, reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>that \u201cDelisle\u2019s decision to increase the size of his work force after eight months of operating with only two employees is not found to present the kind of \u2018instability\u2019 contemplated by the Court of Appeals in <em>[Cotman v. Green, </em>4 Va.App. 256, 356 S.E.2d 447 (1987)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Perry petitioned for review by the full commission, which, by decision issued January 22, 2004, affirmed the deputy commissioner. The commission noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">The evidence predominates in establishing that Mr. Delisle did not employ three or more employees in the same business for three months before the claimant\u2019s accident and for four months following the claimant\u2019s accident. Furthermore, the record does not reflect that Mr. Delisle\u2019s established mode of performing the work of his business necessarily required him to employee [sic] three or more employees. To the contrary, Mr. Delisle explained that he chose not to replace a third employee who left his employ in 2000 because he did not need the additional worker to perform his business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Accordingly, the commission concluded that \u201cMr. Delisle sustained his burden of proving that he did not regularly employ three or more employees in the Commonwealth at the time of the claimant\u2019s accident and injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Perry appealed. On November 30, 2004, a three-judge panel of this Court, with one judge dissenting, reversed the commission, reasoning that Delisle failed \u201cto establish that [the] seven to eight month period in which R &amp; T Construction had two employees was the established mode of performing the work of R <em>&amp; </em>T Construction, and not just a temporary, transient circumstance.\u201d <em>Perry v. Delisle, </em>44 Va.App. 415, 422, 605 S.E.2d 330, 334 (2004). By order dated February 1, 2005, this Court granted the appellees\u2019 petitions for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">On appeal from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, \u201c\u2018[i]t is our duty to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>credible evidence supports the Commission\u2019s finding ... and, if such evidence exists, to sustain the finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 121, 826 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985) (quoting <em>Cook v. City of Waynesboro, </em>225 Va. 23, 31, 300 S.E.2d 746, 750 (1983)) (omission in original). Accordingly, \u201c[w]e do not judge the credibility of witnesses or weigh the evidence on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, if there is credible evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s factual findings, we are bound by those findings regardless of whether there is evidence that may support a contrary finding. <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986); <em>Russell Loungewear v. Gray, 2 </em>Va.App. 90, 95, 341 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that \u201c[e]very employer and employee, except as herein stated, shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of this title respectively to pay and accept compensation for personal injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment and shall be bound thereby.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-300(A). However, \u201c \u2018[ejmployee\u2019 shall not mean ... [employees of any person, firm or private corporation ... that has regularly in service less than three employees in the same business within this Commonwealth....\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Thus, an employer may defeat a workers\u2019 compensation claim if it can prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it is not subject to the provisions of the Act because it \u201chas regularly in service\u201d less than three employees in the Commonwealth of Virginia. <em>Craddock Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Settles, </em>16 Va.App. 1, 2, 427 S.E.2d 428, 429 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>247 Va. 165, 440 S.E.2d 613 (1994) <em>(per curiam); see also Mark Five Constr. Co. v. Gonzalez, </em>42 Va.App. 59, 62, 590 S.E.2d 81, 83 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">However, we have held that, \u201cif an employer regularly employs three or more persons to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business, he should remain subject to the provisions of the Act even if ... the number of his employees temporarily falls below three.\u201d <em>Cot-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>man v. Green, 4 </em>Va.App. 256, 259, 356 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1987). As we noted in <em>Osborne v. Forner, </em>36 Va.App. 91, 548 S.E.2d 270 (2001), because \u201c[t]he term \u2018regularly implies a \u2018practice\u2019 or a \u2018constant or periodic custom\u2019 of employment,\u201d the commission should \u201clook for \u2018regularly-recurring periods\u2019 of employing the requisite number of persons over some r\u00e9asonable period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 548 S.E.2d at 272 (citations omitted). That is, to avoid having \u201can employer\u2019s status ... fluctuate between being subject to the Act and being exempt from it,\u201d an employer will be deemed to have \u201cregularly in service\u201d three or more employees if \u201cthe recurring periods of employing the requisite number of employees\u201d is \u201cthe rule and not the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, to determine whether an employer is subject to the provisions of the Act, the commission must also look to \u201c[t]he number of persons used to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business.\u201d <em>Cotman, 4 </em>Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448. Overall, the commission\u2019s focus should be on \u201cthe character of the business\u201d rather than \u201cthe character of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Thus, when an employer defends a claim on the ground that it is not subject to the provisions of the Act, the commission must make two distinct inquiries. First, the commission must determine whether the employer carried its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that, at the time of the alleged incident, it had \u201cregularly in service\u201d fewer than three employees in Virginia. Second, if the employer sustains this burden of proof, the commission must then determine whether, at the time of the alleged incident, the employer\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of performing business\u201d regularly required three or more employees. If so, the employer will be deemed subject to the provisions of the Act even though it had fewer than three employees on the date of the alleged incident. As we noted in <em>Cotman, </em>this two-pronged test prevents an employer from avoiding liability on the basis of an \u201cunusual, temporary eondition[ ],\u201d whereby the employer has fewer employees than its business regularly requires. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The determination of whether an employer has met its burden of proving that it regularly employs fewer than three employees \u201cis made by the Commission after exercising its role as finder of fact.\u201d <em>Bass v. City of Richmond Police Dept., </em>258 Va. 103, 114, 515 S.E.2d 557, 563 (1999); <em>see Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 95, 548 S.E.2d at 272 (\u201c[WJhether the facts bring a person within the law\u2019s designation, is usually a question of fact.\u201d); <em>see also Lynch v. Lee, </em>19 Va.App. 230, 234, 450 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1994) (affirming the commission\u2019s determination that the employer did not \u201cregularly employ\u201d three or more employees, noting that \u201c[s]ufficient credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that the laborers ... were part-time and seasonal\u201d); <em>cf. Mark Five Constr. Co., </em>42 Va.App. at 64-65, 590 S.E.2d at 83 (affirming the commission\u2019s determination that the \u201cservice\u201d of appellant\u2019s employees in Virginia was \u201cregular\u201d rather than \u201csporadic or irregular,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[cjredible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s ruling\u201d). Similarly, the determination of whether an employer\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of business\u201d requires three or more employees is a finding of fact to which this Court gives deference on appeal. <em>See Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 97, 548 S.E.2d at 273 (affirming the commission\u2019s -conclusion that the employer did not require three or more employees to carry out its established mode of business, reasoning that this finding was supported by \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that the employer\u2019s \u201cemployment of three persons on the day [the worker] was injured was the exception and not the rule\u201d); <em>cf. Bois v. Huntington Blizzard, </em>39 Va.App. 216, 222 n. 1, 571 S.E.2d 924, 927 n. 1 (2002) (\u201cWe note that most of the cases analyzing Code \u00a7 65.2-101 have discussed the term \u201cregularly in service\u201d in relation to the number of employees necessary for coverage because that was the <em>factual basis </em>for disputing coverage.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Here, the commission found that \u201cMr. Delisle sustained his burden of proving that he did not regularly employ three or more employees in the Commonwealth at the time of the claimant\u2019s accident and injury....\u201d The commission reasoned that, at the time of Perry\u2019s accident, Delisle did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>require three or more employees to perform his \u201cestablished mode of business.\u201d In making this determination, the commission relied on Delisle\u2019s explanation that he \u201cchose not to replace a third employee who left his employ in 2000 because he did not need the additional worker to perform his business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Thus, the commission made two factual determinations: (1) at the time of Perry\u2019s accident, Delisle did not \u201cregularly employ\u201d three or more employees, and (2) at the time of Perry\u2019s accident, Delisle\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of business\u201d did not require three or more employees. On appeal, we are bound by these findings of fact as long as \u201cthere was credible evidence presented such that a reasonable mind <em>could </em>conclude that the fact in issue was proved.\u201d <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Campbell, </em>7 Va.App. 217, 222, 372 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1988) (emphasis in original); <em>see also United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (noting that, if the lower court\u2019s \u201c \u2018account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,\u2019 \u201d the appellate court \u201cwill not reverse the [lower] court\u2019s finding simply because we have become convinced that we would have decided the fact differently\u201d (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985))).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, there is credible evidence in the record that supports the commission\u2019s findings. Specifically, the commission\u2019s factual finding that, at the time of Perry\u2019s accident, Delisle did not \u201cregularly employ\u201d three or more employees is supported by Delisle\u2019s testimony that his business only had two employees during the continuous eight-month period from December of 2000 until August of 2001. The commission\u2019s factual finding that Delisle\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of performing business\u201d did not regularly require three or more employees is supported by Delisle\u2019s testimony that he chose not to replace the employee who left in November of 2000 \u201cbecause he did not need the additional worker to operate his business.\u201d Also, as noted by the deputy commissioner, the record indicates that Delisle \u201ccontinued to operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>with two employees for another four months after [Perry\u2019s] incident despite Perry\u2019s inability to return to the full duties of his pre-injury employment.\u201d The fact that Delisle operated his business for four months with, in effect, one and a half employees supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that, at the time of the accident, Delisle did not require three or more employees to carry out the \u201cestablished mode\u201d of performing his business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The commission clearly relied on Delisle\u2019s testimony, which it found to be credible, to conclude that, at the time of Perry\u2019s accident in April 2001, Delisle did not \u201cregularly employ\u201d three or more employees, nor did his \u201cestablished mode of business\u201d require three or more employees. And, because the record contains credible evidence supporting these factual determinations, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">. Clearly, Delisle\u2019s \"established mode of performing business\" changed between the date that Delisle hired Perry and the date of Perry's accident. Although an employer\u2019s status should not fluctuate, nor should his required coverage under the Act be frozen in time, the number of employees required to carry out an \"established mode of performing business\u201d may change over time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b112-7\">BENTON, J., with whom ELDER and CLEMENTS, JJ., join,</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">I dissent because the majority of the commission applied an erroneous legal standard when it ruled that Tom Delisle, a sole proprietor trading as R &amp; T Construction, met his burden of proving he was exempt from the Act. If the commission had applied the proper standard, the record supports Melvin G. Perry\u2019s claim for compensation for his injuries. I believe the dissenting commissioner properly concluded that Delisle, trading as R &amp; T Construction, was not exempt from the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The majority reviews this case to determine whether \u201ccredible evidence\u201d supported the commission\u2019s finding. The parties agree, however, that the essential facts are not in dispute. In a case involving the interpretation of the statutory term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201cregularly in service\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-101, we held that, \u201c[w]hile we generally give great weight and deference, on appeal, to the commission\u2019s construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u2018we are not bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bois v. Huntington Blizzard, </em>39 Va.App. 216, 222, 571 S.E.2d 924, 927 (2002). This standard of review is all the more pertinent when, as here, the commission plainly applied an erroneous legal standard in determining that Delisle and R &amp; T Construction were exempt from the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">When, as in this case, the facts are undisputed, the sole question is one of law-did the commission reach the correct legal conclusion. <em>City of Norfolk v. Bennett, </em>205 Va. 877, 880, 140 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1965). The governing principles applicable to this case are well established. Under the definitions in the Act, \u201c \u2018[e]mployee\u2019 shall not mean ... [ejmployees of any person, firm or private corporation ... that has regularly in service less than three employees in the same business within this Commonwealth____\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. \u201c[I]f an employer regularly employs three or more persons to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business, he should remain subject to the provisions of the Act even ... if the number of his employees temporarily falls below three.\u201d <em>Cotman v. Green, </em>4 Va.App. 256, 259, 356 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1987).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">The term \u201cregularly\u201d implies a \u201cpractice\u201d or a \u201cconstant or periodic custom\u201d of employment. Therefore, we look for \u201cregularly-recurring periods\u201d of employing the requisite number of persons over some reasonable period of time. In order for the employer to be subject to the Act, the recurring periods of employing the requisite number of employees should be the rule and not the exception. Stated differently, an employer\u2019s status under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should not fluctuate between being subject to the Act and being exempt from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\"><em>Osborne v. Forner, </em>36 Va.App. 91, 96, 548 S.E.2d 270, 272 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Applying the law to the facts of the case, the commission erroneously ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">The evidence predominates in establishing that ... Delisle did not employ three or more employees in the same business for three months before [Perry\u2019s] accident and for four months following the ... accident. Furthermore, the record does not reflect that <em>Mr. Delisle's established mode of performing the work of his business necessarily required him to [employ] three or more employees. </em>To the contrary, Mr. Delisle explained that he chose not to replace a third employee who left his employ in 2000 because he did not need the additional worker to perform his business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">We conclude, therefore, that Mr. Delisle sustained his burden of proving that he did not regularly employ three or more employees in the Commonwealth at the time of the claimant\u2019s accident and injury____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Clearly, the number of employees \u201cnecessarily required\u201d to perform the work is not the same as whether an \u201cemployer regularly employs three or more persons to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business.\u201d <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 449. What was \u201cnecessarily required\u201d was simply irrelevant to the issue. Obviously, the number of employees \u201cnecessarily required\u201d to perform the work during a temporary or transient period is immaterial to the issue of regularity of employment when the pattern of employment over a period of time shows a greater number of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">In determining this standard of \u201cregularly in service,\u201d we have often cited approvingly from Larson, the leading treatise. <em>See e.g., Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 449. As Larson\u2019s aptly notes, \u201c[s]ince the practical effect of the numerical boundary is normally to determine whether compensation insurance is compulsory, an employer cannot be allowed to oscillate between coverage and exemption as its labor force exceeds or falls below the minimum from day to day.\u201d <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 74.02 (2004) (footnotes omitted). It follows, therefore, that \u201cif an employer has once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>regularly employed enough men to come under the act, it remains there even when the number employed temporarily falls below the minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, as a general proposition, \u201cthe fact that the number working at the exact time of the injury was below the minimum is of course immaterial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have uniformly applied these principles. <em>See e.g., Bois, </em>39 Va.App. at 222, 571 S.E.2d at 927; <em>Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 96, 548 S.E.2d at 272; <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Indeed, to focus upon the number of employees \u201cnecessarily required\u201d at a finite period of time subverts the purpose of the Act. As we held in <em>Cotman, </em>the policy underlying the Act favors coverage when the number of employees oscillates between coverage and exemption.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">Viewing the language, \u201cregularly in service,\u201d in this manner avoids adverse effects from unusual, temporary conditions. If applicability of the Act was influenced by transient factors, an employer\u2019s status could fluctuate between being subject to the Act and exempt from the Act. Such instability would be unsettling for both employers and employees. If an employer regularly employs three or more persons to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business, he should remain subject to the provisions of the Act even if one or more of the employees works less than full-time, or if the number of his employees temporarily falls below three.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\"><em>Cotman, 4 </em>Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 449 (citing 1C A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 52.20 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">It is undisputed that Delisle\u2019s established mode of business in the years 1998,1999, and 2000 was to employ three or more persons to perform the work of R &amp; T Construction. Delisle testified that R &amp; T Construction performs building renovations at various sites including ongoing, recurrent projects at Hermitage Nursing Home, where R <em>&amp; </em>T Construction \u201calways [has] something ... to do.\u201d In addition to its own employees, R &amp; T Construction uses subcontractors and independent contractors for some of its projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The evidence does not establish that in the first half of 2001 R &amp; T Construction had fewer projects due to an economic downturn or other business circumstances. The record establishes instead that the number of employees fluctuated because of circumstances of a transitory and temporary nature. Indeed, the record undisputedly proved that the number of employees at R &amp; T Construction dipped to two because of the fortuitous occurrence of Vincent Mariner quitting his employment. He was not terminated for economic reasons but, rather, quit because he moved from the area. Thus, Delisle cannot rely upon an economic or business reason for the decrease in the number of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The record also proved this was the time when Delisle\u2019s personal residence was occupying some of his attention and resources. Dehsle began constructing his personal residence in 2000 and continued to do so into 2001. Although Delisle testified that his personal residence was not a R &amp; T Construction project, he also testified that all three of R &amp; T Construction\u2019s employees worked at his residence in 2000. The record does not disclose the reason Delisle\u2019s personal residence was not a R &amp; T Construction project; however, the evidence shows that R <em>&amp; </em>T Construction paid three of its employees for construction work at Delisle\u2019s personal residence. These objective facts are significant when \u201cthe focus shifts to the character of the business and away from the character of the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The transitory nature of these circumstances was further established by proof that when Mariner quit, Delisle, who operated R &amp; T Construction as a sole proprietor, was using paid employees of R &amp; T Construction to build his personal residence while, at the same time, he was paying other laborers from his \u201cpersonal\u201d funds to work on his personal residence. One of the persons Delisle personally hired to perform work constructing his residence was Mickey Parks, whose jobs included trim work and installation of sub-flooring. Later in 2001, two months after Perry\u2019s injury, Delisle hired Parks as an employee of R <em>&amp; </em>T Construction. Delisle then obtained workers\u2019 compensation insurance. In 2001, Delisle also hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Roy Shrieves to work for R <em>&amp; </em>T Construction, employing at that time a total of four persons. These hirings, which occurred after Delisle\u2019s residence had been substantially constructed, are consistent with R <em>&amp; </em>T Construction\u2019s pattern in 1998, 1999, and 2000 of regularly employing three or more persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Simply put, the evidence proved the number of employees working for R &amp; T Construction dropped to two precisely due to temporary circumstances and \u201ctransient factors,\u201d which we held in <em>Cotman </em>would not support an exemption from the Act. 4 Va.App. at 259, 856 S.E.2d at 449. These temporary, transient circumstances that existed at the time of Perry\u2019s injury should not have exempted Delisle from the obligation to insure his employees under the Act. The pattern of hirings over the period from 1998 to 2001 are consistent with R &amp; T Construction\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of performing the work of the business.\u201d For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
