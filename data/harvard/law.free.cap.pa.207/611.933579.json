Elizabeth Kraus, testator\u2019s daughter, October 20, 1897. All of the other sons and daughters of the testator are still living. The question raised by the petition and answer is whether the children of testator take an estate in fee. After the death of his wife he gave his estate to his sons and daughters during their natural lives, and after their death to their children, should they leave any. Had he stopped here, there could be no question that the word \u201c children \u201d was used in its ordinary sense as a word of purchas\u00e9, and that his sons and daughters only took a life estate ; but if any of them left no children, there would be intestacy as to this share. This, however, does not seem to have been his intention, as he next provided that if any of his sons or daughters left no heirs, their share was to be divided share and share alike between all of his grandchildren. If the word \u201c heirs \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>here means children alone, and a son or daughter died, leaving no children, but grandchildren, such grandchildren, being the great-grandchildren of the testator, would be disinherited, as grandchildren do not take under a devise to children: Gable\u2019s App., 40 Pa. 231. In doubtful cases such a construction should be adopted as would distribute the estate as nearly as possible according to the intestate laws, the word \u201c heirs \u201d we think therefore should not be construed as synonymous with \u201c children.\u201d That it was not used in its general sense is evident from the fact that the limitation over is to testator\u2019s grandchildren, who would be the collateral heirs of a deceased grandchild not leaving lineal heirs. It seems then that the testator intended here to limit the estate given to his children to their lineal heirs, or issue, which shows also his intention to use the word \u201c children \u201d in its comprehensive and extended sense, meaning issue or heirs of the body. If this construction be correct the gift then is to his children for life with remainder to the heirs of their bodies or their issue, which vested in the children a fee tail, enlarged by the act of assembly into a fee simple. Another reason- for so construing this will, is, if the limitation is to grandchildren as such, and none of his sons or daughters left children there would be intestacy, which is to be avoided if possible. This construction is supported by the following eases: Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, where the words \u201c child or children \u201d were held to be used in the sense of issue of heirs of the body; Brinton v. Martin, 197 Pa. 615; Potts v. Kline, 174 Pa. 513; Yarnall\u2019s App., .70 Pa. 335; Sheeley v. Niedhammer, 182 Pa. 163.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-5\">Although the gift to the testator\u2019s sons and daughters is the proceeds or interest of his estate, yet as his intention seems to have been to give the proceeds or interest to them forever, it is equivalent to a devise of the fee: Haldeman v. Haldeman, supra; Saxton v. Mitchell, 78 Pa. 479.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\">As the testator\u2019s sons and daughters took the fee under his will and have made an amicable partition of the land devised to them, this petition must be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree dismissing the petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-8\"><em>O.
