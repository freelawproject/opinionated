Alexander left surviving him five children, namely: Alexander, John, George, Ella and Clara T.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">The most valuable real estate of which the testatrix died seized was the two Philadelphia properties, one known as the Chestnut street and the other as the Broad street property: These properties, by item six, paragraph 4 of her will, she gave to her executors, in trust, to rent and invest the net income for a period of five years from her decease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">At the expiration of five years from her death she directed these properties to be sold, and subject to the advancements in lands, the division of \u201c the net purchase moneys of the said Philadelphia county properties, the accrued rents and income therefrom, and all other the rest and residue of my estate which may be in their possession,\u201d into eight equal parts, and the payment and delivery of one of the equal eighth parts to Wm.

Of one other eighth part $500 were to be paid to Mary Elizabeth Taylor, if she survives to the period of distribution, and the balance of said eighth part divided equally between Edward T.

The other eighth part was given to the Real Estate Trust Company of Philadelphia, in trust for the children of Alexander M\u2019Kibbin, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">The Real Estate Trust Company of Philadelphia, trustee of the minor children of Alexander M\u2019Kibbin, deceased, objects to the cestui que trustent being charged with the $2,100 note given by Alexander M\u2019Kibbin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">This note was expressly made payable out of Alexander\u2019s share in his mother\u2019s city property at her death. It may be argued that this was not an advancement, because advancements are confined to estates of intestates as said in the case of Newell\u2019s Will, 1 Browne, 811, cited in 1 Rhone\u2019s O. C. 66, note 5; and because of the general rule that if the parent take a note or bond for the repayment of the money, with or without in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>terest, it is presumed to be a debt and not an advancement; Higb\u2019s Appeal, 21 Pa. 283 ; Roland v. Schrack, 29 Pa. 125. But where the note or bond taken by its terms makes the money given an advancement, if not in express words yet in effect, all presumptions are overruled. And this is what we regard Alexander\u2019s note as clearly showing. Suppose the testatrix had charged upon a family book the $2,100 to Alexander instead of taking the note she did, there could be no question as to its nature. Or suppose she had taken a writing from Alexander expressly setting out that he had received from his mother $2,100 \u201c as an advancement \u201d on account of his share in the estate, could there be any question about it ? Certainly not. The note taken by her is only so in form. It could not have been collected of Alexander except in the way expressly provided and if his share in his mother\u2019s estate amounted to nothing he, or his estate, could not be called upon to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-4\">But it is further contended that granting it to be an advancement the decedent, having made a will after the death of her son Alexander in which she bequeathes the one eighth of her residuary estate to the children of Alexander, they cannot be charged with the same. This argument concedes that if the testatrix had died intestate Alexander\u2019s heirs would take their share diminished by the sum advanced to their father. It is important to remember the declared principle of equality which runs through the whole will. In the sixth item she saj's: \u201c I am desirous that all my children shall share equally in the distribution of whatever property I have been or hereafter may be possessed, such of them as are deceased being represented by the children they have left to survive them.\u201d She might have said in express words that the share of Alexander\u2019s children was to be diminished by the principal of the note she held against him but taking the whole will with its expressed idea of equality, and particularly the language above quoted, we think the intention is sufficiently expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">The $2,100 is taken as an advancement and so treated in the distribution. The objection is overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">The court confirmed the auditor\u2019s report</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in confirming the report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-8\"><em>Joseph DeF. </em>Junkin, with him <em>Geo, B, Daniels, </em>for appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>lant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alq\">Advancements are confined to the estates of intestates: Newell\u2019s Will, 1 Browne, 311. Agreeing for the sake of the argument, that the payment to Alexander was intended as an advancement at the time it was given (for advancements depend on the intention of the parent at the time of making the gift: King\u2019s Estate, 6 Whart. 370; Weaver\u2019s Appeal, 63 Pa. 309; Christy\u2019s Appeal, 1 Grant, 369), still the doctrine of advancements has no application, because the testatrix in her will makes no reference to the gift or loan to her son. If a donor dispose of his whole estate by will, the doctrine of advancements has no application, unless the will specifically refers to advancements and defines what previous gifts shall be so considered: Watson v. Watson, 6 Watts, 254; Kreider v. Boyer, 10 Watts, 54; Nevins\u2019s Est., 70 Pa. 410; Harris\u2019s Appeal, 2 Grant, 304; Roland v.

Existing debts may be converted into advancements by will: Haverstock v. Sarbach, 1 W. &amp; S. 390; Green v. Howell, 6 W. &amp; S. 203; Levering v.

Watson, 6 Watts, 254; Wright\u2019s Appeal, 89 Pa. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The note involved in this case is a sealed acknowledgment of indebtedness \u201c payable as follows, at my decease to be taken out of my share of her city property after her decease.\u201d Notwithstanding the patent ambiguity of this language and what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ever construction might be given to it, the money at the time of making the obligation was clearly regarded as an advancement. But it is almost equally clear that when she made her will subsequently, the testatrix had changed her intention in regard to this money. Her son Alexander, the maker of the note, had died, and in her will she made express provision for his children. Moreover she had considered the subject of advancements, and gave explicit directions concerning what should be so treated and the amounts, and these directions included by name the children of Alexander. Thus after reciting that she was possessed of real estate in Bedford, Fulton and Philadelphia counties, and had conveyed portions of it to various of her children, she directed \u201c that the Bedford county lands so divided among them shall be treated as advancements to my said sons William, George, Plarry and tci the children of my son Alexander (now deceased) each, of one thousand dollars in the final settlement of my estate as hereafter provided,\u201d and \u201c that the Fulton county lands so divided among them shall be treated in the final settlement of my estate as hereinafter provided, as advancements to my surviving children, and to the children of my deceased children respectively, Alexander and Elizabeth, at the rate of five dollars per acre.\u201d In the subsequent part of the same item' she devised the Fulton county lands to her three surviving sons, subject as aforesaid, and the real estate in Philadelphia to her executors in trust to sell, etc., and \u201c subject to the advancements to my children in land as heretofore mentioned and at the same price designated by me, either already taken or to be taken after my decease, I direct my executors to divide the said net purchase moneys of the said Philadelphia county properties, the accrued rents and income therefrom, and all other the rest and residue of my estate which may be in their possession, into eight equal parts, and to pay over and deliver one of said equal eighth parts to each of my children,\u201d naming the six survivors, one other eighth in trust for a granddaughter and the remaining eighth in trust for the children of Alexander.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">It thus appears that after the making of the advancement to Alexander, evidenced by the note in controversy, the testatrix made her will, in which she carefully considered the subject, provided what should be taken as advancements, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>amount of them and the parties from whose shares they should be deducted, and then provided in explicit terms that \u201csubject to the advancements .... heretofore mentioned \u201d there should be an equal division of the estate inter alios, to the children of Alexander, represented here by the appellant. In the face .of the express consideration and settlement of the subject by the testatrix herself, we are not at liberty to add anything to it. Viewing the note as an advancement at its inception, the testatrix has plainly canceled it as such and directed a distribution to the maker\u2019s children without regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The learned auditor and the court below were guided by the expressed intent of the testatrix to make an equal division of her estate among her children. But they failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that she had herself indicated what she considered equality. Whether the lands in Bedford county previously conveyed to her sons respectively were of equal value, and whether $5.00 an acre was the actual value of those in Fulton county, does not appear nor is it at all material. The testatrix fixed those values and directed that subject to them the distribution should be equal. She thus closed all further inquiry as to her intent with regard to equality.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Decree reversed and distribution directed to be made in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
