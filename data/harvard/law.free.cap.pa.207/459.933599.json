Jesse S. Espy, one of the executors of said will has since died having first made his last will and testament, leaving as his residuary legatee his wife Sarah A. Espy, one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the petitioners for citation. Moses Hickman is now the sole surviving executor of the will of James Espy, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">The said James Espy left to survive him the following persons named in said will: Susan Espy, his wife, now deceased, and the following children: Jesse S. Espy, now deceased, leaving as his heir and devisee one of the petitioners Sarah Agnes Espy; James T. Espy; Eliza Jane, deceased, wife of Moses Hickman, leaving to survive her her said husband and two daughters, viz: Blanche Boon, wife of George Boon, and Effie Simpson, wife of Wm. Simpson; Emma McCabe, wife of Joseph McCabe; Maggie Craighead, wife of Marshall Craighead; and Laura B. W. Bebout, wife of J. C. Bebout. Susan Espy, wife of testator, died on or about December 26, 1901, and under the terms of decedent\u2019s will all legacies bequeathed therein are now due and payable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">The real estate of which the decedent died seized, as stated in the petition for citation, consisted of a house and lot in the borough of Canonsburg, Pa., containing forty-one and nine tenths perches and an undividedone half interest in a tract of eighty-six acres, forty and one fifth perches situate in Bethel township, Allegheny county, Pa.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\">No inventory and appraisement can be found on file of the personal estate of said decedent but in the account of Moses Hickman, the sole surviving executor of said will,- filed on April 13,1903, the accountant charges himself in the first instance, \u201c to amount of inventory filed August 1, 1883, -$12,719.\u201d Various items of increase by way of gains on Iron Mill stock, railroad stock, interest on moneys and bank stock swell the inventory with which the accountant charges himself to $15,805.82. By taking credits for various items and a credit \u201c By error in appraisement of Van Eman mortgage $6,953.44,\u201d the balance shown by the account for distribution among legatees named in the will is $5,763.65.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\">The total amount of legacies bequeathed by said will deducting the sum of $500, from the legacy of $4,000, to James T. Espy Is $13,200. It will be noted that testator does not make any of these legacies payable until one year after his wife\u2019s death. He died in 1883 and his wife died December 26, 1901. It is now claimed by the petitioners Sarah Agnes Espy and James T. Espy legatees, of $4,000 each, Sarah Agnes Espy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>being the sole devise and legatee of her husband Jesse S. Espy, deceased, that the personal estate of James Espy, deceased one year after the decease of his widow by the account filed is not sufficient to pay their legacies and the deficiency as shown by a distributive schedule to said account, is chargeable upon and payable out of the proceeds of the sale of any real estate of which the said James Espy died seized. This is the sole question for determination by the court raised by the petitions for citation and demurrer filed to whole of said petition on behalf of Moses Hickman, surviving husband of Eliza Jane (Espy) Hickman, Blanche (Hickman) Boon, Effie (Hickman) Simpson, Emma (Espy) McCabe, Maggie (Espy) Craighead and Laura B. W. (Espy) Bebout, denying that said legacies, or any part thereof, are chargeable upon or payable out of the proceeds of the sale of the land of which said decedent died seized, as above described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The court citing Schmidth\u2019s Est., 188 Pa. 641; Weidman\u2019s App., 42 Legal Int. 338; Hancock\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 532; Duvall\u2019s Est., 146 Pa. 176; Okeson\u2019s App., 59 Pa. 99; Cable\u2019s App., 91 Pa. 327, dismissed the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing the petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-7\"><em>W.

It is rather to be believed that the testator intended that his personal property should be payable in those sums, and with those differences, and that the real estate should descend to all of his children, share and share alike. A full discussion of the principle involved in this part of the contention is found in Walters\u2019 Estate, 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 303, and, supporting that, very strong cases in favor of our contention that these legacies are not charged on any real estate, are Duvall\u2019s Appeal, 146 Pa. 176; Dickerman v. Eddinger, 168 Pa. 246; and Cable\u2019s Appeal, 91 Pa. 327. All of these cases are collected, explained, followed and confirmed by Chief Justice Sterrett on Mitchell\u2019s Estate, 182 Pa. 530.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKo\">January 4, 1904:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AuW\">Mb. Justice Mestbezat,</author>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We think the learned judge of the orphans\u2019 court properly disposed of the question involved in this case and that the appeal should be dismissed. His position is fully sustained by the authorities he cites.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">It is well settled that unless a testator charges a legacy upon his real estate, his personal estate is the primary and only fund out of which it can be paid. It is conceded here that the testator did not expressly charge the legacy of the appellant\u2019s decedent on his real estate, but it is claimed that, by a proper construction of the entire will, there is a clear implication that he intended to do so. As the trial judge observes, we think there is nothing to justify this conclusion. The legal presumption that the testator did not intend to die intestate is fully met and satisfactorily answered by another presumption of like force and effect, that the heir is never to be disinherited except by plain words or necessary implication: Scbmidth\u2019s Estate, 183 Pa. 641. Here, if the position of the appellant be correct and we construe this will as showing it to be the intention of the testator to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>have his real estate applied to the payment of the legacy, the heirs are disinherited and deprived of any part of their ancestor\u2019s estate. There are no \u201c plain words and necessary implication \u201d arising from the language of the instrument demanding an interpretation which would produce such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The legacies were not to be paid until after the death of the testator\u2019s wife. The amount of the inventory of his personal estate was about equal to the total amount of the legacies. The assets were productive and it is manifest that he believed \u25a0that the income from them would, in addition to the use of his homestead, be sufficient for the support of his wife and daughters, and that the principal would be adequate to pay all the legacies. This is not a case in which the testator had no personal estate, which is regarded as a circumstance tending to show his intention to charge his real estate with the payment of legacies; but simply one where the testator overestimates the probable value of his personal estate at the time it is required to be applied in satisfaction of the legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"Afx7\">The omission of a residuary clause when considered in connection with the language of this will and the extrinsic facts, cannot be regarded as of very much importance in ascertaining the intention of the testator as to what part of his estate should be applied to the payment of the legacies. The omission may have been a mere inadvertence or it may have been intentional on the part of the testator. But be that as it may, had he intended to make his real, as well as his personal, estate subject to the payment of the legacies, he could easily have so declared or have added a residuary clause which would have accomplished the purpose. On this branch of the case we may appropriately conclude by quoting from the opinion of Mr. Justice Green in Schmidth\u2019s Estate, supra: \u201c The omission of a residuary clause in wills is not by any means an uncommon occurrence. But \u2022because of such omission it is neither necessary nor proper to give the residue to some specific legatee upon a forced construction of words which do not indicate such a purpose in the mind of the testator. In all such cases the testator is simply intestate as to the residuary estate, and it must then be distributed according to the intestate laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00a5e discover no error in this record which would warrant us in reversing the court below and hence, the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
