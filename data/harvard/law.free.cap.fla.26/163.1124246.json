Ledwith, Appellee.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b171-8\">1. A market, -within tlie meaning of that provision of the Jacksonville municipality act, chapter 3775, statutes of 1887, authorizing the mayor and city council to establish and regulate markets, is a place to which tlie public may resort for selling and buying certain articles; and where tlie articles are exposed for sale in stalls or space provided for such purpose, and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>use of which stalls or space toll may be charged; and for whose government reasonable regulations, having in view the preservation of peace and good order and the health of the community, may be in'eseribed. &gt;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-5\">2. In the United States the authority to establish and regulate markets falls within the police power of the States; and the right to exercise such authority may be conferred by a State upon municipal corporations, and it is competent for these corporations, if the authority delegated is sufficient, to prohibit the sale of such articles as are within the exercise of the police power and usually sold at markets, elsewhere than at a duly established market.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-7\">3. The question whether or not a grant to a municipal corporation of power to establish and regulate markets implies authority to prohibit the sale of articles falling within the power and vendable at a market, elsewhere than at a duly established market, not decided, but referred to, and authorities cited.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-9\"><em>4. </em>A grant to a municipal corporation of power to regulate by ordinance the vending of meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables, gives authority to prescribe by ordinance the times and places of their sale, and to prohibit the sale of them elsewhere. The restrictions as to such times and places must, however, be reasonable, with reference to the welfare of the community, and not be in general restraint of trade. Under this grant, sales may be restricted, under the same limitations, to markets duly established under a grant of power to establish and \\ regulate markets.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-11\">5. The authority of a municipal government to establish and regulate markets implies power to purchase or provide a site, erect necessary buildings and stalls, and, when they are provided either by a lease, purchase or other lawful mode, to adopt reasonable regulations for the government of the market and the business transacted there.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-13\">6. Where a municipal corporation constructs or rents a building, its principal object being to provide a market house, an appropriation of a portion of the building for another purpose, as the holding of municipal courts, does not x\u2019ender the erection or renting of the building illegal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>I. </em>If reasonable facilities for selling at markets are given, regulations, restricting to markets the sale of articles falling within the police power or the sale of which the health or welfare of the community requires to be regulated, do not constitute a prohibition or illegal restraint of trade, or a monopoly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-6\">8. The courts are the final judges as to what are proper subjects of the police power, and the law-making power cannot arbitrarily make that a subject of its exercise which, from its nature, is not one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-8\">9. Where the language of a statute authorizing an exercise of the police power is so broad as to include things which are not, as well as those which are subjects of the power, the exercise of the power will be confined to things which are legally the subjects of that power.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-10\">10. Where the statute establishing a municipal government provides that its legislative power shall be exercised by a city council, and that no bill shall become a law until it shall be signed by the mayor, unless he shall fail to return it, with his objections, to the council within a prescribed time, or unless it, on being so returned, shall be passed by two-thirds of the whole number of the council, and also provides that the mayor and council shall have power to establish and regulate markets by ordinance, and to regulate the vending of meats and other specified articles in like manner, a market cannot be established, nor can it or the vending of such articles be regulated otherwise than by municipal law, enacted in the manner above indicated; and an ordinance attempting to authorize the city council or a board of health, or both, to exercise either of the above powers independently, and in disregard of the above provision for ths co-ordinate action of the mayor, conveys no authority in the premises. The authority cannot be delegated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-12\">II. The word \u201cprivileges,\u201d as used in the act establishing the municipality of Jacksonville, where power is given to levy and collect taxes, for the purpose of revenue, upon \u201call property and privileges taxable by law for State purposes,\u201d and to license, tax and regulate auctioneers, retailers of liquors, and other named avocations, \u201cand all other privileges taxable by the State,\u201d does not mean such things as are technically privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>leges and can never be enjoyed or exei\u2019cised except under authority of law, but means other occupations of the same kind as those designated. A market being a franchise, or technical privilege, is not taxable by the city of Jacksonville for revenue purposes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b174-5\">12: Th'e municipality of Jacksonville is not given the power which the State has of selecting the subjects of occupational taxes for raising revenue; but is limited to the occupations named in its .charter abt or the revenue laws of the State.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b174-6\">13. The first section of Article XII, chapter 3775, of the statutes, as amended by the eleventh section of the act of May 31st, 1889, does not in its imovision; \u201cprivileges may be licensed and taxed by city ordinances,\u201d designate subjects of taxation. The purpose of the section is to regulate the manner of assessing and levying taxes on real and personal property and taxing avocations elsewhere subjected to municipal taxation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b174-8\">14. Wherever the power to authorize or license a person to establish a market exists in a municipal corporation, a fee for the permit, or license, may be charged by the municipality as a police regulation, although the power to exact a tax for revenue may not exist. A sufficient fee may be charged under the police power to cover not only the necessary exjiense of issuing the license, but also that of the additional labor of officers and other expenses imposed upon the public by the business, but no more.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b174-10\">15. A license to a pei\u2019son to sell meats or other thing named in the grant to the municipality of Jacksonville of power to regulate the vending of meats, etc., is not the grant of a right to maintain a market within the meaning of the legislative grant of authority to establish and regulate markets.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b174-12\">16. The grant of authority to regulate the sale of meats, etc., by ordinance, is one of police power. Under it the hours, the places, and rules for conducting the business may be pre1 scribed, and the establishment of fixed places of sale may be prohibited in localities from which their exclusion is dictated by sanitary considerations, and, as in the case of markets affording reasonable facilities for all who may desire to engage in vending such articles, the sales may be confined to particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>lar places; yet all this must he done by impartial and general regulations, affording the same rights to all alike upon the same conditions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-5\">IT. The grant of authority to regulate the vending of meats', etc., does not give power to tax for purposes of revenue, the occupation of vending any of the named articles, but it, in connection with the grant of power to regulate inspection, justifies the imposition of such fees and charges as will cover the expense of both inspecting the articles offered for sale and of the police supervision of the business necessary to prevent its becoming harmful to the community.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-6\">18. The power to establish markets cannot be used to create a monopoly of the right to sell.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-8\">19. The police power cannot be parted with or impaired by contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-9\">20. The power of a municipal government to establish markets, implies the authority to change their location as the convenience of the community may dictate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-11\">21. Where an ordinance amending a section of a former ordinance provides that such section \u201cshall read as follows,\u201d stating the provisions, the section as amended becomes, for all future purposes, the entire section, and anything which was in the original section but is omitted from it as amended, is repealed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-13\">22. Where an ordinance is passed establishing a public market, and providing that no person shall sell or offer for sale at any other place within the city limits, unless he shall be expressly authorized so to do by the city council, and another ordinance providing for the establishment of so-called private markets at which the same articles may bo sold, is passed on the same day but approved by the mayor on a day subsequent to his approval of the other one, the two ordinances are to be considered as one ordinance for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the municipal law-makers.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-15\">23. Where parts of an ordinance, or of two ordinances which are <em>in pari meter\u00eda, </em>are so connected together or dependent upon each other that it cannot be presumed the municipal lawmaking power would have ordained the one without the other, and one or some more of the parts are void because in conflict with provisions of the charter act, all the parts so connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>or dependent will be held invalid; e. g., where a public market ordinance provided that uo person should sell certain articles elsewhere than at the public market, \u201cunless such person should be allowed to do so by the city council,\u201d meaning by these quoted words unless he should be authorized to do so under the provisions of a private market ordinance, which latter ordinance was void on account of its conflict with the charter act, the prohibitory clause of the public market ordinance falls within the private market ordinance;</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b176-5\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Duval County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">The facts of the c\u00e1se are stated in the opinion;</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-7\"><em>J. M. </em>Barrs, <em>Fletcher &amp; Wurtz, </em>for Appellants;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">Appellants\u2019 brief\u2014statement op Pacts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-9\">On January 7, 1876, the appellee made a contract with the city of Jacksonville, by which a market building, which he erected in pursuance of the contract, was leased to the city for a period of two years, the rents from the stalls to be equally divided between the parties, and the city to have the care and control of the market and under subsequent renewals of this lease the city was to bear the expense of a clerk to collect the rents, and all the costs of keeping the building in proper sanitary condition out of its half of the revenue. (Record 126 to 144.) The lease was renewed from time to time until it finally expired April 1, 1889, when the city authorities took steps to locate the public market elsewhere, under different arrangements and conditions, such as they conceived to be advantageous to the citizens, with more agreeable and respectable surroundings. This new market was to be constructed on the newest and\" most approved plan, with superior facilities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-10\">The Board of Public Works advertised for bids looking to this end. The offer which seemed best to meet the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>quirements of the city\u2014in fact, the only offer at all eligible \u2014was that of M. M. Shoemaker and others, who offered to erect a building, such as was desired, on a lot adjoining the City Post Office, where it would be within one hundred feet of street car communication, and where all the surroundings would be decorous. This site was in the block east of the block containing the Ledwith market. The city was to pay for this building the annual rental of $2,000 for ten years. The building was constructed and was accepted as in full compliance with the contract. The city took possession and pr\u00f3ceeded to rent the stalls by the month for terms not exceeding one year, auctioning off the choice of location to the highest bidder. The City Council then passed two ordinances : first, the Public Market Ordinance (an amendment to an ordinance passed January 28, 1889), declaring said building to be the Public Market, and requiring all sales of fresh meat, etc., to be made there; and second; the Private Market Ordinance, which provided for the establishment and maintainance of private markets at such other places in the city as the Council might determine. These ordinances were both passed July 30, 1889. In violation of these ordinances and amendments to the latter ordinance, the appellee and eighteen of his tenants continued to maintain the old Ledwith market and to sell fresh meats from its numerous stalls. The Mayor sought to enforce the ordinance by arrest of the tenants of the appellee, who filed his bill herein to enjoin the city officials from interfering with him or his tenants. The answer of the appellants sets out their authority and rights in the premises and their duty, and declares the necessity for limiting the number of private markets, and the unfitness of the Ledwith building as a public market. The appellee secured a temporary injunction without notice, and this ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>peal is taken from the order refusing to dissolve the injunction. The questions raised and submitted are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">1. Has the city, under its charter, the power to make and enforce the ordinances in question ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-6\">2. If this power is only implied dr embraced in the general grant, was the power reasonably exercised ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">3. Is the appellee in a position to question the validity of such portions of the ordinances as do not affect <em>him\u2014e. g., </em>the provision for a license fee ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-8\">MUNICIPAL POWERS GENERALLY.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-9\">A municipal corporation can exercise the following powers and no others: first, those granted in <em>express words; </em>second, those <em>necessarily implied in or incident to </em>the powers necessarily granted; third, powers exercisable for corporate objects' and purposes not simply convenient, but indispensable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKZ\">1 Dillon Mun.

And the Private Market Ordinance, passed on the same day, provided that, \u201c Private markets may be established, regulated and abolished at the discretion of the City Council; but no private market for the sale of fresh meats, fish, or vegetables shall be maintained within the limits of the city of Jacksonville except by and with the permission of the Mayor and City Council, granted by ordinance.\u201d These market places were further required to be constructed according to the rules of the Board of Health, and there was further provision for the payment of a license fee of $5*00 for each stall. This ordinance was amended Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>gust 30 by omitting the word \u201c vegetables \u201d therefrom and substituting in the last line the word \u201c resolution \u201d in lieu \u201c of ordinance.\u201d This section was further amended on September 6, by adding the words, \u201cand not more than one stall shall be permitted-or licensed within the same building.\u201d (Record 161 to 165.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">NATURE OF MARKET\u2014POLICE POWER.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-6\">\u201c Markets are places where comestibles, perishable in their nature, are sold for the daily consumption of the people, which, from the very nature of the things there sold, require sanitary regulation, and thus fall within the police power of cities.\u201d \u201cThe right to establish markets is a branch of the sovereign power, and the right of regulating them is necessarily a power of municipal police.\u201d The City of New Orleans vs. Morris, 3 Woods C. C. 107. In this case, also, the Court quotes with approval the following language from Morris vs. Mayor, 2 La., 217: \u201cThe City Council has the power to establish markets and to provide for the cleanliness and salubrity of the city. In establishing markets, they designate certain spots or places for the sale of certain articles of provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-8\">POWER TO ESTABLISH AND REGULATE MARKETS.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-9\">Where an act of the legislature provided that there should not be any private market kept within twelve squares of a public market in the City of New Orleans, <em>held, \u201c </em>not unconstitutional, either as taking away the property of those keeping private markets at the time of the passage of the act within the prescribed limits, or as taking away the vested rights of those holding licenses to keep such markets.\u201d Markets may be closed from considerations of \u2022public security and benefit. The number of markets may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>be reduced as a sanitary regulation. Lessors and lessees of markets, in such cases, must yield their private benefit and advantage to the public advantage. It is within the discretion of the lawmaker when to exercise this power, and persons embark in such occupations subject to the disadvantages which may result from a legal exercise of the power to affect them.

The language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ordinance expresses the clear intention of the makers that the discretion and judgment of the Council are to be directed to the <em>place </em>and not to the person. \u201c Private markets may be established, regulated,\u201d etc., \u201c but no private market for the sale of fresh meats, fish or vegetables, shall be maintained except by the permission of the City Council.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">DELEGATION OF POWER TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">But it is sought to attack the ordinance on the ground that the powers of the City Council are thereby delegated to the Board of Health (Sec. 2.) By this section the Board of Health has only to prescribe the sanitary rules and specifications by which these markets are to be constructed and governed. If these rules are not complied with, so essential in our climate in the matter of handling fresh meats, and the petition for a market does not bear, when it reaches the Council, the endorsement of the Board that such rules have been observed, the Council, under the ordinance, will not permit a market to be located. If these rules, which are intended to protect the public health, and which are reasonable in every respect, (see Record, 188 to 196,) are complied with, and the petition is so endorsed by the Board, the Council may grant the permit, or, in the public interest, it might refuse to grant the permit upon grounds appearing <em>dehors </em>the petition. The Board of Health acts in this capacity as a committee from the Council. They are supposed to understand what sanitary precautions the public jiealth demands, and to frame such regulations as will injure the taking of these precautions. They make personal p^aminatiqn qf proposed markets and report to the Council for its actiqi). The po\\yer of the Board is confined to an examination into and report upon the sanitary condition of the market applied for (Record, i\u00a3j6 to 170.)

The Court will observe, however, that the appellee does not bring this suit on that ground. His construction is that the Public Market <em>must </em>be in his building. We contend that a license fee, such as is here exacted, is not a <em>tax </em>but a fee, justified as a police regulation, and is reasonable and legal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">A license fee charged by a municipal corporation for the privilege of engaging in certain occupations, for instance, that of keeping a market, is not a tax; and such a requirement is valid, not in restraint of trade, neither unreasonable nor unlawful, but is in the nature of a police regulation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-9\"><em>Ex Parte </em>Gregory, 54 Am.

These markets ought to be visited from once to three times daily, and, located as they are, in different parts of a city with a river front of nine miles and extending back about two miles, it will require the services of a man whose whole time will be consumed in the work of looking' after them. It is hardly possible for more than fifteen private markets to maintain themselves in the city, in addition to the public market, for any great while, and this would produce in license fees about seventy-five dollars a month\u2014just about the salary of an inspector.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">\u201cThe amount of a license is not confined to the expense of issuing it; but a reasonable compensation may be charged for the additional expense of municipal supervision over the particular business or vocation at the place where it is licensed.\u201d The ordinance is presumed to be reasonable.

The effect of this resolution was to grant the petition so far as the Council was concerned, without changing or abrogating the ordinance then in force. The mayor could regard it or not; but he had thereby the request of the Council to suspend the enforcement of the ordinance as to the petitioner. An ordinance is a much more solemn form of legislation than a resolution.

The motion on this resolution was reconsidered at the same adjourned meeting of September 6. This was perfectly regular. (Record, 94, 95). Further than this, by action of the Council (Sept. 3) a committee was appointed, looking to definite action on this matter, and required to report on September 6. (Record, 184, 185.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-8\">This was notice to the appellee that he proceeded with any expenditures-at his peril. The resolution last referred to was in effect notice to everyone that on September 6 the number and location of private markets (including Led-with\u2019s) would be determined.

(Record, 123 to 125 and 243 to 248.) If it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ever justifiable, under any circumstances, to oblige private interest to yield to the public good, this case presents such an instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">To compel the citizens to do their marketing in the appellee\u2019s building, in the face of the disadvantages set forth in the answer, outside' of the sanitary objections to the premises \u25a0 (Record i8o)y because, forsooth, the appellee would otherwise be deprived of a large revenue from the rental of his building and adjacent property, would fasten on the city authorities a want of consideration for the public welfare which should condemn them in the estimation of all right-thinking people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">It is argued that if the new market possesses so' many advantages over the Ledwith market, the tenants of the appellee would abandon the latter and occupy the former. Any business man can appreciate the objection on the part of the tenants to such a move; for, if the appellee were to gain his suit other butchers would occupy their former stalls and reap the benefit of their good will. It appears, also, that the butchers in the Ledwith market control all the imported meat, which is the meat principally consumed. The grant of power to \u201c establish and regulate \u201d markets presupposes that markets will not properly regulate themselves. The power is given to enable the authorities to oblige the 'people to do that which is sanitary and best for themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">To sustain this injunction means that the appellee may continue the use of his building as a market, free from any direction by the city. No sanitary inspector or health officer or policeman can set foot on these hallowed premises. The appellee will have gained the extraordinary right to make use of his property just as he may choose, and with absolute disregard of the public welfare. Under his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>supreme control his premises may become a nuisance and a seething pest-hole. The Court will hardly take away all the discretion of the council in a matter of this kind; destroy the police power of the city; destroy its control of sanitary measures; tie the hands of its constituted authorities, and rob them of the ample powers granted by the legislature. The affidavit of Dr. Maxwell (Record, 229,) shows, the existence of a dump-hole in the middle of the floor of this market through which the sweepings and refuse are thrown into the river, there to float under the bulkheads of the river front and to poison the atmosphere. The dumping of this filth into the river directly violates every rule of health obtaining in the city. The affidavit of Acosta, Burbridge, Dancy, Tyler and Gruber (Record, 237 to 246,) refer to a time when the city had direct charge of this place \u2022as its public market. The city employed its own market clerk and sweep, whose duty it was to keep the place clean. Since April, 1889, the property has passed absolutely into the hands of the owner, the appellee, and the city cannot now, as then, exercise the same supervision and control over it. A new, better, cleaner, and more healthful building, with improved appointments, has been prepared and established as the public market, and for sanitary reasons private markets of more than one stall have been forbidden.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-5\">It is not incumbent on the city to establish its market in the middle of its territory. For obvious reasons this is not always advisable. In this light, the affidavits of L\u2019Engle, Walker, Hopkins, Solary, Finch, Baya, Huau, and Stockton, (Record, 246 to 260,) have no relevancy. No doubt many persons, living in the western portion of the city, would place the middle point west of market street. Those owning property in Fairfield, East Jacksonville, Campbell\u2019s Addition, Oakland, and the old city east of Market street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u2022are doubtless desirous of having the middle point placed further east. In any event, the new market is but a square \u25a0and a half east of the appellee\u2019s building, which he asserts is so admirably located. (Record, 160). The butchers, the tenants of the appellee, are not parties to this suit, yet they are made to do battle from page 276 to page 313 of \u25a0this Record, and if their affidavits show anything they prove that a monopoly exists among them, such that people are obliged to buy of them at their prices, or fail to obtain the best in the market; that is, Western and Northern meats. The best cannot be obtained elsewhere, and yet they boast of this \u201c forestalling and regrating of provisions\u201d as a reason why the appellee should prevail in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\">The case is respectfully submitted by the appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-6\">We cite, as sustaining the authorities above, the following from Horr &amp; Bemis on Municipal Police Ordinances: Amount of license, under police powers, should cover cost of regulation.

It also provides that no person shall sell any fresh beef, fresh pork or mutton, or establish or maintain any market, stall or shop for the keeping or sale of fresh beef, pork or mutton at any place within the corporate limits, except at the public market, unless such person or persons shall be expressly authorized to do so by fhe City Council; provided, however, that producers bringing vegetables, poultry, eggs or other country produce to the city for sale shall be ^-mitted to sell the same free of tax anywhere witnm the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The Private Market ordinance provides that private markets may be established, regulated and abolished at the discretion of the City Council, but no private market for the sale of fresh meats or fish shall be maintained within the city except with the permission of the City Council granted by resolution, and not more than one stall shall be permitted or licensed within the same building. Private markets must be constructed and maintained in accordance with specifications, rules and regulations approved by the City Board of Health governing the same and prescribing the size and character of stalls, and no permit for the establishment or maintenance of any private market shall be granted except upon a petition endorsed by the City Board of Health. No person can maintain or do business in a private market except upon paying to the City Treasurer for a license, the sum of five dollars per month for each and every stall used, and no person shall do the business contemplated by this ordinance except upon stalls licensed as heretofore provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">A market, says Blackstone, is a franchise or liberty derived from the crown by grant, or by prescription which supposes a grant. 2 Com., 37 ; the establishment of public marts or places of buying and selling, such as markets and fairs, with the tolls thereunto belonging being in England within the King\u2019s prerogative as to domestic commerce; 1 Com., 274; such prerogative consisting in the discre tionary power of acting for the public good where the positive laws are silent, and if it be abused by him to the public detriment, such prerogative is exerted in an unconstitutional manner. Ibid, 252. In J\u00e1cob\u2019s Law Dictionary, as well as that of Tomlin, a market is defined to -be the liberty by grant or prescription, whereby a town is enabled to set up and open shops, &amp;c., at a certain place therein for buy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ing and selling, and better provision of such victuals as the subject wanteth ; it being less than a fair and usually kept once or twice a week. Bouvier\u2019s definition is : A public place and appointed time for buying and selling, a public place appointed by public authority where all sorts of things necessary for the subsistence or for the convenience of life are sold. In Ketchum vs. the City of Buffalo, 21 Barbour, 296, it is said, citing Crabb\u2019s Law of Real Property, that a market is the privilege within a.town to have a market, and the franchise may be granted to natural persons or bodies politic; the grantee of the franchise has the right to have the market, but the public have also an interest in the market, and the grantee of the franchise is bound to provide suitable accommodations for those who attend the market. Judge Dillon, in his work on Municipal Corporations, note 4 to Section 380, quotes the definition given by Judge Breeze, which is : A designated place in a town or city to which all persons can repair who wish to buy or sell articles there exposed for sale. See also Cincinnati vs. Buckingham, 10 Ohio, 257; State vs. City of Newbern, 70 N. C., 12; City of Burlington vs. Dankworth, 73 Iowa, 170. The public character of markets is further illustrated by Prince vs. Lewis, 5 B. &amp; C., 363, where the grantee of the market for the buying and selling of vegetables, fruits, flowers, roots and herbs, had for his own profit permitted part of the space to be used for other purposes than those specified in the grant, and the residue of the space became insufficient for public accommodation, and there was not on ordinary occasions space within the market for carts and wagons resorting thither with vegetables, etcetera, and it was held that the owner of the market could not maintain an actipn against an individual for selling vegetables in the neighborhood of the market and thereby de - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>priving him of toll, even at a time when there was room in the market, without showing that on the day when the sale took place he gave notice to the seller that there was room within the market. Again, in Moseley vs. Walker, 7 B. &amp; C., 55, it is said by Bayley, J.: I take it to be implied in the terms in which a, market is granted that the grantee if he confine it to particular parts within a town, shall fix it at such parts as will from time to time yield to the public reasonable accommodations; and that if the space once alloted ceases to. give reasonable accommodation, he is bound if he has land of his own to appropriate land on which to hold it; or if not, to get land from other people, in order that the market which was originally granted for the benefit of the people, as well as for the benefit of the grantee, may be effectually held, and that the public may have the benefit which was originally intended they should derive from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In the case of Mayor of Penryn vs. Best, 3 Law Reports, Exchequer Division, 292, decided in 1873, the Court said: \u201cThe mere grant of a market does not of itself confer the right to prevent persons from selling on market days in their private houses, though within the town or manor where the market may be held. This was decided in the case of Mayor of Macclesfield vs. Chapman, 12 M. &amp;. W., 18. It is pointed out in the judgment that an old case, the Prior of Dunstable\u2019s case, 11 H. 6, f. 19 a, and cited in City of London\u2019s Case, 8 Rep., 127, a, had been erroneously supposed to decide the contrary. It may also be considered as decided by the case of Earl of Egremont vs. Saul, 6 Ad. &amp; E., 924. We feel- bound by these authorities, although <em>dicta </em>may no doubt be found to the contrary. See Mosley vs. Chadwick in note to Mosley vs. Walker, 7 B. &amp; C., 47. The second conclusion by which we are bound i\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>that such a right as is contended for may be acquired by immemorial enjoyment or prescription. Mosley vs. Walker, 7 B. &amp; C., 47, Mayor of Macclesfield vs. Pedley, 4 B. &amp; Ad, 397.\u201d In the Court of Appeal,, this view of the law was affirmed though the judgment of the lower court was reversed on the ground that the right to prevent butchers from selling at their private shops on market days within the limits of the franchise was shown by the evidence to exist by prescription. 3 Law Reports. Exchequer Division, pp. 292, 297 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In our own country the authority to establish and regulate markets falls within the police power of the States, and the right to exercise such authority may be conferred by a State upon municipal corporations; and it is competent for these corporations, where the delegation of power is sufficient, to prohibit the sale of marketable articles outside of the regularly established 'markets.

In addition to the grant of authority to \u201cestablish and regulate markets,\u201d the legislature has, as appears in the first paragraph of this opinion, expressly authorized the Mayor and Council to \u201cregulate the vending of meat, poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables,\u201d and under this grant we are satisfied that they may by ordinance prescribe the time and places for the sale of the articles it covers ; and such restrictions as to times and places being reasonable with reference to the welfare of the community, and not being in general restraint of trade, they may likewise prohibit the sale of such articles elsewhere. That the sale of them may under this grant be restricted to markets duly established under the other, where the regulations do not constitute an illegal restraint or a prohibition of the trade, we do not doubt.

N. Y., 356; Smith vs. Newbern, <em>70 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>N. C, 14; Gale vs. Kalamazoo, 23 Mich., 344; Spaulding vs. Lowell, 23 Pick., 71, and Coldwell vs. Alton, <em>supra. </em>If the real and principal object is the building of a market house the appropriation of a portion of the building to other purposes, as for the holding of courts, does not render the erection of the building illegal; Spaulding vs. Lowell, 23 Pick., 71; and the same rule will hold good where, as in the case before us, the premises are leased. Gale vs. Kalamazoo, 23 Mich., 344. An express grant of police power as to regulating the vending of meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables, as has been given to the city of Jacksonville, supplements the other with the restrictive authority as to the time and place at which any article within its meaning and purpose shall be sold. There is nothing in the act which excludes markets as the places to which the vending shall be restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Where reasonable facilities for sale at markets are given, such a regulation is not a prohibition of trade, nor the creation of a monopoly, the subject-matter of the regulation being, as in the case of fresh meat and fresh fish, one which the health .or welfare of the community requires, should be regulated. It is argued by counsel for appellee that the language of the act includes the power to regulate the vending of all kinds of cured meat as well as of fresh meat, and if power is given to prohibit the latter it is also as to the former, and hence it was not intended to give this power as to either. We do not admit that there is \u201cprohibition\u201d of the sale of fresh meats in the fact that an ordinance restricts its sale to market houses, still, it is a sufficient answer to the argument made, to say that if the language of the statute is broad enough to cover any kind of meat, the vending of which cannot reasonably be dangerous to the health or welfare of the people, such language will be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>fined, when considered as authorizing the exercise of the police power, to the proper subjects of that power. It is well settled that the courts are the final judges as to what are proper subjects\"of its exercise, and the legislature cannot arbitrarily make that a subject which from its nature is not so. <em>In re </em>Jacobs, 98 N. Y., 98; Mugler vs. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623. It would be unreasonable to hold that the use of language so broad when considered in the abstract as to cover things not the subject of the police power, shows a legislative intent not to authorize the exercise of the power as to proper subjects of it. Moreover, the provisions of the same section as to preventing nuisances, and regulating or licensing, or prohibiting and suppressing theatrical and other exhibitions, and prohibiting and suppressing gambling houses and other things, certainly do not limit the meaning and effect of a grant of the power to regulate the vending of meat or to establish and regulate markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The general law for the incorporation of cities and towns, as amended in 1877, Section 22, p. 250, McClellan\u2019s Digest, enacts expressly that the city or town council shall have power to establish market houses, and to require each and every person who may have for sale any fresh meat of fresh fish, to bring the same into the market and offer the same for sale only in the market; and in view of the absence of such an express provision from the charter act under consideration, it is contended that a legislative intention to withhold from the municipality of Jacksonville the authority to restrict such sales to market places is manifested. No particular formula of words, or expression is essential to convey a power. The only question is, does the language used in any special or general act clearly confer the power ? As stated above, our opinion is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>both upon principle and authority the grant is unquestionably sufficient to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">It is necessary to a judgment upon the validity of the above ordinances to inquire how the power to establish markets, or to regulate the same, or the vending of meats or other articles mentioned, can be exercised. The statute says : The Mayor and City Council shall \u201chave power by ordinance\u201d to do so. Section 4 of Article III, Chapter 3775) page *64, Acts of 1887. The first section of the same article enacted that \u201cthe legislative power of said incorporation shall be exercised by a City Council,\u201d and this provision is retained in the section, as amended by an act approved May 16th, 1889, Chapter 3952, Acts 1889. The second section of the article of the act of 1887, provides that no bill shall become a law \u201cuntil it shall have been signed by the Mayor, except that it may be passed without his signature as herein provided. No ordinance, or portion of an ordinance, vetoed by the Mayor, shall go into effect unless the same be passed by two-thirds of the whole number of members of the City Council. If the Mayor fail to return any ordinance, at or before the next regular meeting after its passage, he shall be deemed to have approved the'same, and it shall become a law without further action.\u201d Page 164, Acts of 1887. The second section of the same article of this act, p. 162, is to the effect that the Mayor shall carefully examine all bills passed, and should any not meet his approbation, he shall return the same to the next regular meeting of the Council with his objections in writing, and he may veto objectionable features, and \u201capprove\u201d the residue of the bill. From these provisions it is plain that a market cannot be established, nor can regulations thereof or of the vending of meats, poultry, fish, fruits or vegetables be made, except by munic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ipal law duly passed by the Council and afterwards submitted to the Mayor and sanctioned by his*approval attested by his signature, or which he has failed to return to the next regular meeting of the Council after its passage, or which, having been returned to the Council with his objections, has been passed over his veto by two-thirds of the whole number of the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is to be observed that by the Public Market ordinance as given above, no person can sell any fresh beef, fresh pork or mutton, or establish any- market, stall, or shop for keeping or selling the same, or either of them, within the corporate limits of the city, except at the public market, unless such person shall be expressly authorized to do so by the <em>City Council. </em>This provision appears in the ordinance as it was when adopted in January, 1889, and was not changed by the amendment made by the Council and approved by the Mayor July 30th, of the same year. The Private Market ordinance passed by the Council July 30th, but not approved by the Mayor until August 5th, provided in its first section that private markets might be established, regulated and abolished at the discretion-of the City Council, but that no private market for the sale of fresh meats, fish or vegetables should be maintained <em>except by and with the permission of the Mayor and City Council granted by ordinance ; </em>but an ordinance was passed and approved the thirtieth day of August providing that this section should' read as follows : \u201c Private Markets may be established, regulated and abolished at the discretion of the City Council, but no private market for the sale of fresh meats or fish shall be maintained within the limits of the City of Jacksonville except with the permission of the City Council granted by resolution.\u201d The provision that not more than one stall should be licensed-or permitted in the same building, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>added by the amendment passed September 6th, and approved the next day. The fifth section of the Private Market ordinance, approved August 5th, repeals an ordinance of june 6th, 1888, regulating and governing private markets, but it is not shown, nor is it material to know, what its provisions were. We m\u00e1y, however, remark that it does appear there whs in the contract made between appellee and the city, in 1876, as to the Public Market established at the foot of Ocean street, on Water Lot Number Ten, arid continued, with renewals and modifications, immateri\u00e1l td mention, down to May xst, 1889, an express stipulation that all other markets then existing in the city should be abolished, and that be the sole and exclusive market, excepting such markets as might be legally existing under contract with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We do not think it can be doubted that the purpose of the amendment of August 30th was to make the right to keep a private market for the sale of fresh meats, <em>et cetera, </em>dependent upon the permission of simply the Council expressed by resolution, instead of the permission of the lawmaking power duly expressed according to the forms prescribed by the charter act for making municipal law ; and considering the ordinance as thus amended, and also as it stood after the subsequent amendment approved September 7th, its meaning was that the City Council as a separate body might establish, regulate and abolish at its discretion, private markets without its action being subjected to the co-ordinate action of the Mayor or having gone through the course required by the statute to make it municipal law. It is too plain to admit of discussion that this cannot be done. <em>Ex-parte </em>Frazee, 63 Mich., 396; S. C. 6 Am. St. Rep., 310; Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Secs. 96, 357, 716, 779; Cooley\u2019s Constitritional Limitations, 249; not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that legislative action in the form of a resolution and which has been passed by the Council, submitted to the Mayor and received his approval, or not been returned by him, or having been duly returned by him, has received the two-thirds vote, may not be an ordinance, (Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Sections 307 and 769 and notes; Robinson vs. Mayor of Franklin, 34 Am. Dec., note p. 633) but for the reason that markets, cannot be established, nor can regulations for them, or for the vending of meat and other articles specified in the provision of the statute, be made by the Council as an independent part of the city government, or in any other manner than by proper ordinance duly enacted as the statute has provided. Horn vs. People, 26 Mich, 221, and Ruggles vs. Collier, and other authorities cited with it <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The amendatory section of August 30th took the place of and entirely superseded the first section as it was in the original ordinance of August 5th, and the consequence resulting from the omission of the italicised words and the insertion of those proposing to delegate to the Council the power to establish and regulate markets is, that there was from the approval of the amendment no valid provision for the establishment or regulation of private markets. Advisory opinion, 15 Fla., 735; Basnett vs. Jacksonville, 19 Fla., 664; State <em>ex rel. </em>McQuaid vs. Commissioners of Duval County, 23 Fla., 483; Saunders vs. Provisional Municipality, 24 Florida, 226. That which was in the old section, but was left out of the new, ceased to exist as a part of the municipal law because it was actually and, we must hold, intentionally omitted, and the invalidity of the substituted subject-matter in the new section proposing to give to the Council a power which it can not legally exercise, does not change the fact that the italiicised provision of the original section is no longer a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>of the municipal law. The omitted matter is no longer in existence as a part,of the section, or to be construed by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Another part of this private market ordinance to be noticed is its second section, which provides: That such market must be constructed and maintained in accordance with specifications, rules and regulations approved by the City Board of Health governing the same, and prescribing the size and character of stalls, and no permit for the establishment or maintenance of any market shall be granted except upon a petition endorsed by the City Board of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">It appears that on the sixth day of August, or the day after the approval of the private market ordinance, the Board of Health formulated and prescribed rules for the govern ment of private markets. They prescribe, <em>inter alia, </em>that such a market shall have, a water-tight floor of yellow pine heart plank, or portland cement, or of both, as in the judgment of the Board may be deemed necessary, at least one inch in thickness on a solid foundation, the grade of the floor; connections with the sewers and with the water works; that the construction of all markets shall be subject to the supervision and approval of the City Engineer and Health Officer, and the market to the daily inspection of an officer of the Health Department; the size of the stalls (not less than three feet wide and six feet long) and that they shall be covered with a marble slab, white oil cloth or other \u201c acceptable\u201d substance, and furnished with \u201csuitable\u201d meat block and with galvanized iron hooks; the hour at which the markets shall be closed, and the removal of meats after-wards ; the washing of the stalls, floors, <em>et cetera, </em>and the use of disinfectants that may be prescribed by the Board; and how meat shall be moved from one market to another, or transferred through the streets. The fifth of these rules is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>That persons owning and operating private markets and wishing to continue the same, and those desiring to establish and maintain them, must immediately present to the Health Officer or to the Chairman of the Board, for the action of the Board, a petition to the City Council; that it shall state the location, number of stalls, full specifications of the construction, size and other details of the proposed market or building, together with an assurance that the applicant will, in case his application is approved by the Board and granted by the City Council, promptly comply with ordinances of the city and the rules of the Board, adopted or that may be adopted, in relation to the payment of license, and the fulfillment of sanitary requirements and restrictions in the construction and operation of private markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">These rules appear from an endorsement of the Recorder to have been submitted to and adopted by the City Council in regular session on the day they were formulated by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">They are intended to control the establishment of, and to regulate markets. The establishment and regulation of markets must be effected by ordinance enacted or ordained in the manner prescribed by the statute. It cannot be done either by a Board of Health acting, in the language of the brief of appellant\u2019s counsel, \u201cin the capacity of a committee from the Council,\u201d nor by the Council itself, nor by both. The Board of Health in prescribing these rules has done no more than the second section of the ordinance contemplated, and the attempted exercise of this authority by the Board was as much unauthorized as the effort of the ordinance to delegate the power was illegal. A public duty which the Legislature has confided to the deliberative judgment or discretion of the law-making power of a municipality can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>not be delegated by the latter to the judgment or discretion of one constituent element of that power, nor to the judgment or discretion of others. To permit it to be done would be to defeat the will of the Legislature as to whose judgment or discretion should direct the subject-matter of the duty confided.

This act imposes what was styled \u201clicense taxes\u201d on different occupations and professions, and provides that no person shall engage in or manage the business, profession or occupation mentioned therein unless a State license shall be procured in the manner prescribed, and enacts that counties, <em>incorporated, </em>cities and towns, may impose such further taxes of the sama kind upon the same subjects as they may deem proper, but that they shall not impose any such tax on any business, profession or occupation not mentioned therein, nor shall the tax imposed by them exceed fifty <em>per cent, </em>of the State tax. The same limitation upon counties, cities and towns, is to be found in former general revenue laws, as it also is in the amendatory revenue law of May 28th, 1889, Chapter 3847. The revenue law of 1887, Chapter 3681, imposes a license tax on auctioneers, \u201ctaverns\u201d (or what may be deemed the same thing, keepers of hotels and boarding houses.); peddlers and retailers in spirituous, vinous or malt liquors, but not on hackney coaches, carts, omnibuses, wagon's or drays, and all of this is true of the act of 1889; and in each of these general revenue statutes there is to be found a proviso that the license tax provision as to peddlers/ with boat or horse and cart or carriage shall not extend tol boats and carts engaged in the sale of vegetables and plantation products, fish and oysters. The question, assuming the five dollar fee to be a tax for revenue, is : Does the special act authorize the imposition of such a license or occupational tax upon the franchise or business of a market. Counsel for appellants suggests that the right to maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>market being a franchise, it is a privilege, and is therefore| taxable, Admitting, as we do, that the right to keep a market and charge toll is a franchise, and consequently a privilege, within the meaning of Stevens vs. State, 2 Ark., 291; S. C. 35 Am. Dec., 72; Washington vs. State, 13 Ark., 752, still this admission is not conclusive in favor of the right of the city under the above provisions of its charter act to impose a revenue tax upon such markets or persons keeping them, for the meaning of the word \u201cprivileges\u201d in the charter act is unmistakable from the connection in which it is used. When the act gives power to levy and collect taxes upon all property 'and privileges taxable by law for State purposes, and to license, tax and regulate auctioneers, taverns, peddlers and retailers of liquors and all other privileges taxable by the State, it is clear that the Legislature did not use the word, privilege, to designate such things as are technically privileges, and cannot ever be enjoyed or exercised in England except through the prerogative of the Crown or under act of Parliament, or in this country by authority of law, but to denote other occupations and business of the same kind as those mentioned and that are taxable by law for State purposes. In a word, we think the meaning of the Legislature as shown by the language last referred to, was simply that whatever occupations were subjected to taxation by the State laws, might be taxed by the City of Jacksonville under an ordinanee or ordinances duly passed, and none other; and this view is strengthened by the fact of the subsequent provisions of the municipal law as to hackney carriages, carts, omnibuses, wagons and drays which were not subjected to \u201clicense taxes\u201d by the act of 1887, or that of 1889, and hence the necessity for the special mention of them in the charter act. Moreover, this provision as to hackney carriages, etc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>would not have been inserted had it been the intention of the Legislature to delegate to the Mayor and Council by the preceeding provision the same power which the State has of selecting the subject of occupational or license taxes; Section 5, Article IX, Constitution, instead of limiting it to the subjects named in the charter act and the revenue laws of the State. Markets are then not subject as occupations to taxation for revenue under the charter act.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">There was nothing in the provision of Section one of Article XII of the act of 1887 as to \u201cprivileges,\u201d nor is there anything in the amendment of it made in 1889, that qualifies the above conclusion. That section, as it appears in the act of 1889, Chapter 3933, reads, omitting the provision as to licensing dogs, as follows : \u201cAll property which is subject to State taxes shall be assessed and licensed for taxation alphabetically for the entire city without reference to wards. The assessment shall be made by the Comptroller and his assistants, and the valuation of real and personal property shall be subject to be increased or diminished by the Council under regulations to be made by ordinance. Privileges may be licensed and taxed by city ordinances * * * . All the duties now devolved upon the Recorder in reference to the levy and assessment of taxes, shall devolve upon and be performed by the Comptroller.\u201d It is evident that the purpose of the section is, not to designate the subject of taxation, but to regulate the manner of <em>assessing </em>and levying taxes on real and personal property and of licensing and taxing the avocations declared elsewhere to be taxable and designated here as those by the word \u201cprivileges.\u201d 'It prescribes the manner and mode of exercising the taxing power against the previously defined subjects of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Appellants do not admit, however, that the charge of five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>dollars is a tax levied for the purpose of raising revenue, but contend that it is-a fee properly chargeable as incident to the power of police regulation, and as such is authorized. According to this private market ordinance no person can \u201cmaintain or do business in a private market,\u201d except upon paying to the City Treasurer, for a license, the sum of five dollars per month for each stall; and no person can do business in any such stall or private market that is not so licensed. We have seen that by this ordinance not more than one stall can be licensed in the same building. Prior to an amendment of it approved September 7th, 1889, there was no such limitation upon the number of stalls in one building. Assuming that under the power granted to the Mayor and Council, they may by ordinance authorize the establishment of public markets by private individuals, the same being controlled and regulated by the Mayor and Council by ordinance according to the principles of the decisions in Davenport vs. Kelly, 7 Iowa, 102 (notwithstanding LeClain vs. Davenport, 13 Iowa, 210), Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Section 385, and note 4; Gale vs. Kalamazoo, 23 Mich., 344; Indianapolis vs. Indianapolis Gaslight &amp; Coal Co., 66 Ind., 396; Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall., 36; Butchers\u2019 Union vs. Crescent City Co., 111 U. S., 746; Villarasso vs. Barthet, 39 La. Ann., 247, our opinion is that the power to do so includes, as a market is a franchise, the power to license; a permit to establish a market is from the nature of a market, a license; it is a permit to do something which could not be done before without such permit, and hence is the grant of a license. Besides this, as we have stated in the earlier part of this opinion, the power to establish markets is within the police power, and all this being true, we are unable to conclude that the power to charge, as a police regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>a fee for the permit or license to establish and maintain a market, as distinguished from a permit or license for selling meats or vegetables therein, does not exist. It seems to us that, it necessarily does. The fee, however, is not a tax for revenue, but a charge under the police power, and its amount is to be controlled by the principles governing in such cases. What amount of fee or charge can be exacted is a question upon which the authorities are in conflict. By some it is held that no more than the expense of issuing the license can be charged. Judge Cooley\u2019s view is that the right to license an employment, no power being given to also tax it for revenue, gives the corporation authority to impose such a charge for the license as will cover, not only the necessary expenses of issuing it, but also the additional labor of officers and other expenses imposed by the business, but nothing beyond this limit; and this seems to us to be the better rule.

The establishment and regulation of a market means the right to establish and furnish certain places where the public may resort for selling and buying provisions or articles of immediate necessity, and where the owners of the articles may expose them for sale, and to regulate these places and the business done there, and includes also the right to make charges for the use of stalls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>and space used by those resorting there with their products to sell the same. Markets are public conveniencies, and not a mere license or permit to a person to sell his marketable property. Though the grant of authority to regulate the vending of meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables will permit the legislative power of the city to ordain general regulations, applicable to all alike, as to when and where those articles may be sold, it is not one conferring the franchise of establishing a market, but it is a power to -regulate the sale of articles which, but for it, could be sold anywhere and at all times. The power to establish markets cannot be used to create a monopoly of the right to sell. It is not intended for any such purpose. The right to sell at markets must be secured to all alike on the same conditions. The grant as to vending meats, etcetera, is one of police power and it is to be exercised upon considerations, referable to the public health or welfare of the community, and not arbitrarily, nor to create a monopoly in one or several persons, nor to prohibit the trades to which it applies. Though under it the hours of the day, the places, and the mode or manner of and rules for conducting the business may be designated and prescribed, and the establishment of fixed places of sale may be prohibited in localities from which their exclusion is dictated by sanitary considerations, and, as in the case of markets affording reasonably ample facilities for all who may desire to engage in vending such articles, the sales may be confined to specific places, yet all this must be done on principles of impartial and general regulation affording the same rights to all alike upon the same conditions, and not in the exercise of a partial and discretionary or arbitrary will pf the law-making power or of any part of'it.

It does not authorize the imposition of taxes for revenue purposes upon the occupation of vending, but it dose in connection with the grant as to inspection made in the same section justify such fees and charges as may be required to cover the expense of inspecting the articles offered for sale and of the police supervision of the business necessary to prevent its becoming harmful to the community. Though the right to engage in the business at the times and places and under the same conditions applicable to all cannot be denied to any, the business may be so regulated as the public welfare may demand and the courts will not interfere with the enforcement of a regu-j lation except where it shall be manifest that the protection of the public is not its purpose. Austin vs. Muncey, 141 Pick., 126; Dillon on Munic. Corp. note 2, to Section 141; Cooley\u2019s Con. Lim., m. p. 203. The police power is one whose existence is essential to the protection and welfare of the public, and while it should be used unhesitatingly and efficiently for the ends it was intended to subserve, it should not be used for other purposes, nor further than is necessary to fully effect the legitimate end in any particular case falling within its proper exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">It is plain from the record before us that the right claimed by Ledwith, the appellee, is that of maintaining a building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>where stalls and space are provided for butchers or others desiring to sell, for the use of which stalls and space he makes charges. For some years prior to May, A. D. 1889, his premises, at the foot of Ocean street, had been the designated public market, controlled and regulated by the city, under an ordinance and a contract between the city and himself, which contract expired on the first day of that month. The expiration of this contract excludes from the case all question as to the effect which, if existing, it might have had on the right and power of the city authorities to change by ordinance the location of the public market, or, barring any other defects that may exist in the Public Market ordinance of July 30th, 1889, to establish the public market at the foot of Market street, and abolish that at the foot of Ocean street. As against the appellee, or any one whose premises or buildings had been the legally established public market, there can be nodoubt of the right of the city authorities to remove the market to a different place, or to abolish an existing one and establish a new market. Neither the appellee, nor any other person, nor any corporate body other than the municipality of Jacksonville, acting through its law-making authority, has been given power by the Legislature to establish markets within the territory of that city. In Florida the Legislature alone can confer'such power. The power to establish a market includes the power to change the location of it from place to place as the convenience and necessities of the community may dictate. Dillon on Mun. Corp., Section 382; Cooley\u2019s Con. Lim., 744, note 2; Wartman vs. City of Philadelphia, 33 Penn. St., 202; Gall vs. Cincinnati, 18 O. St., 563, Cougot vs. New Orleans, 16 La.

These authorities show how groundless the vested right theory of complaint, based on the injury to the value of his property through decrease of rental, is, and how firmly set is the rule that the police power can not be parted with, or impaired, by contract or barter.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The second section of the Public Market ordinance shows by the words \u201c unless such person or persons shall be expressly authorized so to do by the City Council,\u201d particularly when they are considered in connection with the Private Market ordinance, that it was not the intention of that ordinance to prohibit the sale of fresh meats, etc., elsewhere than the so-called public market. On the same day, July 30th, 1889, that the first section of this ordinance was so amended as to establish the public market at the foot of Market street, the so-called Private Market ordinance was passed, although the latter did not receive the sanction of the Mayor till the 5th day of August, and it is this Private Market ordinance that was intended by' the law-making power of Jacksonville to furnish the rule under which the express authority suggested by the second section of the Public Market ordinance, might be obtained for selling, or offering for sale, fresh beef, fresh, pork or mutton elsewhere than at the public market, or establishing or maintaining a market, stall or shop for the sale of the same. The two ordinances are to be considered together, or as one, in seeking for the intention of the municipal law-maker as to markets and the vending of the meats mentioned in them. Considering them together, we find that the manifest intention to permit and regulate sale elsewhere than in the locus of the public market, as well as that to permit other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>markets, has not been effectually ordained; or, in other words, the ordinance governing such sales and markets is void because it purports to remit their establishment, maintenance, regulation and abolition to the sole discretion of a body\u2014the City Council\u2014that cannot exercise the power, and also to delegate to a. committee\u2014the City Board of Health\u2014authority which the State Legislature has committed to the law-making power of the municipality. It is thus apparent that the City of Jacksonville, as represented in the expression of her legislative agency speaking for her, intended not only that there should be a public market at the foot of Market street, but that there might be other places established at which sales could be made, yet that sales could not be except at the public market or a so-called private market, and to make this intention effectual she has ordained that a person who violates the provision of the public market ordinance as to selling at other places than the public market or a private market should be subject to fine or imprisonment. It happens, however, that the private market ordinance is void, and the question arises as to what effect this fact has upon the validity of the above prohibitory provision of the public market ordinance. In our opinion it invalidates it because it never was the intention of the law-making power of Jacksonville that sales should be confined to the public market, and to enforce it with the effect of prohibiting sales elsewhere in the absence of valid regulations of such sales would be to do what was never intended. Whether or not an ordinance restricting sales to one place in a city of the territorial extent and of the population of Jacksonville would be held to be valid if assailed as unreasonable, it is unnecessary to decide, as such cannot be said to have been the purpose in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The rule as to statutes is ,that part of an act may be unconstitutional without invalidating the whole of it. If all the provisions are connected in subject-matter depending upon each other, operating together for the same purpose, or otherwise so connected together in meaning that it cannot be presumed that the Legislature would have passed the one without the other, the whole act will be declared void. On the other hand, where some parts are not connected with or dependent upon others, as where a statute attempts to accomplish two or more independent objects, it may be void in part and valid as to the residue. If its purpose is to accomplish a single object only and some of its provisions are void, the whole must fail, unless sufficient remains to effect the object without the aid of the invalid poitions. If the valid and the void parts \u201care so mutually connected with and dependent on each other as conditions, considerations or compensations for each other as to warrant the belief that the Legislature intended them as a whole, and if all could not be carried into effect, the Legislature would not pass the residue independently, then if some parts are unconstitutional, <em>all the provisions which are thus dependent, conditional or connected </em>must fall with them.\u201d Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, m. p. 177-179; State <em>ex rel. </em>Boyd vs. Deal, 24 Fla., 293. The same principles apply to city ordinances. Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Section 421 and notes. A valid charter act is the constitution of a municipality as much as the work of a regularly chosen convention ratified by the vote of the people is the organic law of the State. It is evident that the purpose of the public and private market ordinances considered together is two-fold. Outside of its prohibitory provisions the object of the former was to provide a public market where persons could resort to sell and buy as indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>cated above. The object of the prohibitory clause was to regulate the sale of certain articles, and it cannot be denied that it and the private market ordinances are conditions, considerations and compensations for each other. Surely the specified provision of the former with the clause last quoted above would not have been ordained without enacting the private market ordinance unless it should be assumed that it was deemed necessary to have the latter ordinance to make the quoted clause effectual; and that it was not so assumed we are concluded by the fact of the enactment of the private market ordinance. This prohibitory clause of the so-called public market ordinance, and the private market ordinance are as connected with, conditional upon and compensatory to each other as if they were in the same ordinance or section of an ordinance, and the invalidity of the latter ordinance is fatal to the specified provision of the former. To hold the contrary would be to enforce what was never intended by any branch of the lawmaking power of Jacksonville in passing or approving either of these by-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It is evident that there is no valid regulation prohibiting sales elsewhere than at the public market, and for this reason there is no legal impediment to the sale in the appellee\u2019s building, and he should, in the absence of legal restriction' of sales to other places, not be interfered with in the alleged use -of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">It may be well for us to remark that it is not to be inferred from anything said in this opinion, that the municipal authorities may not avail themselves of all sources of knowledge and experience in framing rules and regulations, nor is the power of the city to use all usual or proper agencies for the enforcement of the same when <em>duly ordained </em>to be doubted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>We have gone as far into the questions affecting the vendors of meat doing business in Ledwith\u2019s building as is hecessary to a decision of the case. Ledwith is not such a vendor, and it is not proper that we should say more than we have upon any question not affecting his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
