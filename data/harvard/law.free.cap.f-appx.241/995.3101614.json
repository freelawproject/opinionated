The district court sentenced him to 151 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-17\">On appeal, Trujillo-Gudino argues he received ineffective assistance because counsel failed to (1) advocate his innocence at the Rule 11 hearing; (2) move to withdraw his guilty plea; and (3) advocate for a lesser sentence during the sentencing hearing. This court \u201cmay address [claims of ineffective assistance of counsel] on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1203, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006). Because we find that ineffective assistance of counsel does not conclusively appear on the record, we decline to address these claims on direct appeal. Rather, any claims of ineffective assistance of counsel Trujillo-Gudino wishes to raise should be pursued in a timely motion for post-conviction relief submitted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-19\">Accordingly, we affirm Trujillo-Gudino\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
