For the reasons below, we will affirm both the conviction and the sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need not recite the facts of this case except where necessary to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Malik first argues that his conviction must be reversed because the District Court included the so-called \u201ctwo-inference\u201d charge in the jury instructions. The Court stated, \u201c[i]f you view the evidence in the case as reasonably permitting two conclusions, one of innocence, the other of guilt, then you should adopt the conclusion of innocence, or not guilty, because the burden on the Government is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not 50/50.\u201d App. 390. Malik contends that this misled the jury about the government\u2019s burden to proof, thereby denying him due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">We have consistently criticized this language in a reasonable doubt instruction. <em>See United States v. Isaac, </em>134 F.3d 199, 203 (3d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>44 F.3d 1219, 1226 (3d Cir.1995). In its brief, the Government concedes that, although technically correct, \u201can instruction of this type ... is disfavored and should not have been given.\u201d Government\u2019s Br. at 8. Nevertheless, as the Government also notes, while consistently criticizing this charge, we have consistently held that it does not automatically result in a due process violation. Rather, we have explained: \u201c[d]ue process is satisfied if the instructions, taken as a whole, accurately convey the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\u201d <em>Isaac, </em>134 F.3d at 203. Thus, we must \u201cconsider whether this deficiency was rectified by the remainder of the reasonable doubt instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Thayer, </em>201 F.3d 214, 221 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">Here, the Court used the phrase \u201c50/50,\u201d to explain that the presumption and the appropriate burden of proof required an acquittal if the defendant\u2019s guilt was not established. When the court used that term, it had already spoken of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in connection with the Government\u2019s burden but had not yet defined the term. App. 389. The Court explained that \u201cthe burden on the Government is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not 50/50.\u201d App. 390 (emphasis added). The Court then explained the term using familiar contrasts to \u201cmathematical certainty\u201d and \u201call possible doubt.\u201d App. 391-92; <em>see, e.g., United States v. Milan, </em>304 F.3d 273, 284-85 (3d Cir.2002). Moreover, as the Government notes, during closing, defense counsel told the jury: \u201c[t]he judge read to you a very good explanation of reasonable doubt----You have it before you .... I encourage you to refer to it.\u201d App. 432, Appellee\u2019s Br. at 17. We have reviewed the Court\u2019s charge in its entirety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>and we agree that, though the inclusion of \u201c50/50\u201d was unfortunate, it was not sufficient to undermine the Court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt taken as a whole, as it was \u201cnot reasonably likely to have mislead the jury.\u201d <em>See Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 6, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994) (\u201cthe proper inquiry is not whether the instruction \u2018could have\u2019 been applied in an unconstitutional manner, but whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury <em>did </em>so apply it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Malik argues for the first time on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cthe Muslim guy\u201d during direct examination of a witness was prosecutorial misconduct that unfairly prejudiced him at the trial. Since defense counsel did not initially object and the Court instructed the Assistant United States Attorney to use a different reference as soon as counsel did object, Malik argues that the Court should have declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte. </em>Our review is for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Prosecutorial misconduct only justifies a new trial where the \u201cerror in the prosecutor\u2019s comments is so serious as to \u2018undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Pungitore, </em>910 F.2d 1084, 1126 (3d Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)). Even where it is alleged that misconduct was intentional and pervasive, the focus on appeal is the impact upon the jury whether it \u201cdistracts\u201d the trier of fact. <em>Marshall v. Hendricks, </em>307 F.3d 36, 68 (3d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 182 n. 15, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986)). \u201cEspecially when addressing plain error, a reviewing court cannot properly evaluate a case except by viewing such a claim against the entire record.\u201d <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. at 16, 105 S.Ct. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Malik argues that, following the tragedy of \u201cSeptember 11,\u201d referring to him as the \u201cMuslin guy\u201d inflamed the jurors\u2019 emotions against him. We agree that the term could have an impact on the jury. However, the term was only used because the witness being examined, Charlene Parker, did not know either of the men her uncle met on March 12, 2004 by name. She referred to the man they picked up at Cooper Hospital as \u201cthe other guy\u201d or \u201cthe guy that was supposed to be my cousin.\u201d App. 81. Parker referred to the man she later identified as Malik as \u201cthe Muslim guy\u201d to distinguish him from \u201cthe other guy\u201d because Malik was wearing a khaffiyeh.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> App. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Malik makes much of the Government\u2019s using the phrase thirteen times. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1, 5, 17. When Parker first spoke of \u201cthe Muslim guy,\u201d she had not yet identified Malik as the person she was referring to. App. 81-83. Prior to the in-court identification, the Government had little choice but to adopt that term without including his name in the question and thereby improperly leading the witness. Although the references could have been more innocuous by identifying Malik as \u201cthe man who was wearing a knit cap when I saw him on a previous occasion,\u201d the Court surely should not have declared a mistrial based on Parker\u2019s manner of identifying him.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Once Parker made her in-court identification, the Government adopted the witness\u2019s phrase for Malik (\u201cthe Muslim guy\u201d) five more times before the defense objected. App. 85, 86, 88. One of these occasions was a specific request to explain why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>she referred to him that way. App. 86. After the Court sustained the objection to the usage, the Government referred to the defendant as \u201cMr. Malik.\u201d App. 88, 89. During cross-examination, Charlene Parker again referred to Malik as \u201cMuslim guy,\u201d although the defense invariably called him Mr. Malik. App. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Although the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) could have been more careful about the use of the term, the circumstances of Parker\u2019s examination certainly did not require a mistrial, and the District Court properly and promptly responded when defense counsel objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Finally, Malik argues that the 96-month sentence imposed by the District Court is unreasonable because it exceeded the Sentencing Guidelines range of 63 to 78 months as calculated by the District Court. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16. The District Court did not characterize the sentence enhancement as a formal departure from the Guideline range. Rather, the Court referred to it as an exercise of its discretion based on the determination that a criminal history category of III did not adequately reflect Malik\u2019s actual criminal history. App. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we review sentences for reasonableness using the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 543 U.S. 220, 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The sentence range calculated under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines is among the factors to be considered. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4). In evaluating the reasonableness of the sentence, we must first determine whether the sentencing court correctly calculated the Guideline range. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 324, 327-28 (3d Cir.2006). We next determine whether the trial court \u201cconsidered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. We must then \u201cascertain whether those factors were reasonably applied to the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Although the Government has not appealed the sentence in this case, it does argue that the District Court erred in calculating the Guidelines. The Government notes that Malik served nine months for a May 26, 1995 probation violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Government\u2019s Br. at 32 (citing PSR \u00b6 45). Since this incarceration was within ten years of the March 12, 2004 crime of conviction, two additional criminal history points should have been assigned but were not. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4Al.l(b), 4A1.2(e)(2), 4A1.2(k). Criminal history points would then total 8, rather than 6, yielding a corrected criminal history category of IV and increasing the Guideline range to 77 to 96 months. U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table, Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">Although there is no fixed formula a trial court must employ to demonstrate meaningful consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and arguments raised by the defendant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we have also explained that merely stating that these have been considered is insufficient. <em>See United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 571 (3d Cir.2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding trial court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he Court believes that 100 months is reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>able in view of the considerations of section 3558(a)\u201d to be insufficient); <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Here, the District Court made it abundantly clear that the reason for the enhanced sentence was that Malik\u2019s extensive criminal history was not adequately represented by a criminal history category of III. App. 529; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a). The Court insisted that the Government provide a chronological history of Malik\u2019s history of adult convictions and incarcerations. App. 513-19. In addition, the District Court considered, but did not grant, the Government\u2019s request for a sentence of the statutory maximum of ten years. App. 528-29; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2); <em>Grier, </em>475 F.3d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In not imposing this maximum, the Court specifically considered Malik\u2019s age. App. 529. Thus, we find that it considered the \u00a7 3353(a) factors as well as arguments raised by Malik, and reasonably and fairly applied those factors to Malik\u2019s circumstances and the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-12\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction over the challenges to the final judgment of conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we review the sentence that was imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">. Charlene Parker did not recall whether Malik was wearing a khaffiyeh on March 12, 2004. App. 86. Detective Sawicki testified that the man later arrested had been wearing a khaffiyeh that day. App. 163.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-8\">. The Government also argues that Malik\u2019s incarceration through 2002 represented, at least in part, the serving out of the sentence imposed for his 1977 murder conviction and that three additional criminal history points should be assessed per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Since the Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSR) is unclear in this regard, we consider only the two points under \u00a7 4Al.l(b) here. We do not, however, decide that the additional three points urged are invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-16\">. <em>See Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
