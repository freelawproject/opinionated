On appeal, Lopez raises only one issue: that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2(e) (2007), which provides that an application for legalization under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1255a (West 2005 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007) must be filed with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (\u201cCIS\u201d), with review to an Administrative Appeals Unit, rather than with an immigration judge, deprives him of his constitutional rights of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-20\">\u201cThe Attorney General enjoys broad powers with respect to \u2018the administration and enforcement of [the Immigration and Nationality Act] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 279 (4th Cir.2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a)(3) (2000)). Aliens have only those rights that Congress, and the Attorney General as guided by the applicable statutes, elect to provide them. <em>Id. </em>at 280. Here, the governing regulations place jurisdiction over legalization applications with the CIS, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2(e), with a single level of appeal in the Administrative Appeals Unit. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2(p). The Immigration Court and the Board have no jurisdiction to assess a legalization application or review its denial. <em>Matter of Singh, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 427, 433 (B.I.A. 1996). Lopez was provided with the proper procedures; therefore, he has received all the process he was due. <em>See Orquera v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 413, 426 (4th Cir.2003). (\u201cTo state a due process claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>the [alien] must first demonstrate that [he] ha[s] a protected interest and [he] ha[s] such an interest only as set out in [the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986] and [8 C.F.R.] \u00a7 245a.2 []\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
