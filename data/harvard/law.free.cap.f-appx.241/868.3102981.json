Because we conclude that this appeal lacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-27\">Goode, an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution at Schuykill, filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that his constitutional rights were violated due to his exposure to second-hand smoke at the prison. Defendant Nash filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that he was entitled to qualified immunity and that Goode\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Magistrate Judge assigned to the case recommended that the motion be granted, but the District Court declined to adopt the recommendation, noting that the record showed that Goode had a history of infirmary visits for breathing and sinus prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>lems that potentially could have been caused by second-hand smoke, and that Goode had complained to Nash about his exposure. The Court noted that \u201cseveral of these elements are supported only by minimal evidence, and sometimes by only the allegations of Goode\u2019s brief in opposition and those affidavits submitted into evidence,\u201d but the Court determined that Goode was entitled to develop his allegations through limited discovery. District Court order entered 9/26/05, doc. #27.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The Magistrate Judge thereafter granted the parties 90 days following the filing of an answer to complete discovery and file dispositive motions. Nash filed an answer on February 2, 2006, and on May 17, 2006, filed a motion for summary judgment, followed by a supporting brief and statement of facts on June 1, 2006. Goode filed a brief in opposition, an \u201cappendix attachment,\u201d and various other filings in response, but did not submit any further support for his allegations. Aside from personal allegations, the only evidence Goode submitted was the following: (1) two inmate affidavits indicating that Goode\u2019s possession and purchases of tobacco were on their behalf and not for Goode\u2019s personal use; (2) a case summary of <em>Atkinson v. Taylor, </em>316 F.3d 257 (3d Cir.2003)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and (3) an excerpt from an appendix in the FCI-Schuykill handbook setting forth certain prisoner rights and responsibilities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">As the Magistrate Judge noted, we have recently emphasized that although the party opposing summary judgment is entitled to \u201cthe benefit of all factual inferences in the court\u2019s consideration of a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must point to some evidence in the record that creates a genuine issue of material fact,\u201d and \u201ccannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda or oral argument.\u201d <em>Berckeley Inv. Group, Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, </em>201 (3d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). We agree with the District Court that Goode did not meet his burden of pointing to some evidence in the record that creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding his allegations that defendant violated his Eighth Amendment rights by exposing him to second-hand smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeal will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">. In <em>Atkinson, </em>we held that prison officials were not entitled to qualified immunity <em>from </em>an inmate\u2019s claim that they violated his Eighth Amendment rights by exposing him to second-hand tobacco smoke.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">. Goode argued in his opposition to the second motion for summary judgment that he was \"NEVER ADVISED as to any [discovery] date deadline of May 3, 2006.\u201d We agree with the Magistrate Judge that Goode had ample notification that the discovery period had commenced and that it would be necessary for him to engage in some discovery in order to substantiate his claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
