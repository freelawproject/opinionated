Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">In 1990, Ignazio Lena pleaded guilty to charges that he engaged in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). The District Court determined that his base offense level was 36. The court imposed a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a firearm and a two-level enhancement for the purity of the drugs involved, yielding a total offense level of 40 and a sentencing range of 292-365 months. Lena was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 340 months. He appealed his sentence, which we affirmed. <em>United States v. Lena, </em>928 F.2d 398 (3d Cir.1991) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Lena filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 seeking to void his guilty plea and sentence. It was denied without prejudice. Lena filed his second \u00a7 2255 motion claiming that his counsel was ineffective in advising him to accept the plea agreement. The District Court denied the motion and we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Lena, </em>C.A. No. 97-7364, 151 F.3d 1027 (3d Cir. May 1, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">In 1997, Francesco Bellitti, one of the leaders of the conspiracy, was granted a re-sentencing hearing. At the hearing, Bellitti, who had received a 420-month sentence, was sentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">Lena then filed this motion for re-sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), or in the alternative, for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Crv. P. 60(b)(6). In his motion he claimed that his sentence should be reduced to eliminate the disparity between his and Bellitti\u2019s sentence. He argued that the imposition of the two-level enhancement for the purity of drugs involved was inequitable because Bellitti was not assessed with a similar enhancement. He also argued that the enhancement under 2Dl.l(b) for possession of a firearm was in error because it was not reasonably foreseeable that his coconspirators would be armed. He subsequently added the claim that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), retroactively reduced his sentencing range. The District Court denied the motion and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines is plenary. <em>United States v. Yeaman, </em>194 F.3d 442, 456 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">Section 3582(c)(2) does not grant courts the authority to reduce a sentence merely to correct disparities in sentences which are unrelated to retroactive amendments to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. As a general matter, without specific authorization, a court cannot alter a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed. <em>United States v. DeLeo, </em>644 F.2d 300, 301 (3d Cir.1981). However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) allows a court to reduce a sentence when a defendant has been sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>tenced to a term of imprisonment within a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission has subsequently lowered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). <em>United States v. McBride, </em>283 F.3d 612, 614 (3d Cir.2002). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may only reduce a sentence in response to an amendment of the Sentencing Guidelines if the amendment is one of the amendments named in the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement \u00a7 1B1.10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Lena argued that subsequent amendments in 1992, listed in Appendix C to the Sentencing Guidelines as 439, and 1994, listed as 503, lowered his sentencing range because, under the Guidelines as amended, he would not have received the firearm sentence enhancement. Regardless of whether these amendments would have affected his sentence, they cannot serve as the basis for a sentence reduction because they are not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Further, we agree with the District Court that <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1007 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In short, upon consideration of the record below and Lena\u2019s \u201cPetition on Summary Action,\u201d we conclude that his appeal presents us with no substantial question. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-8\">. \u00a7 IB 1.10(c) reads: \"Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in Appendix C as follows: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341, 371, 379, 380, 433, 454, 461, 484, 488, 490, 499, 505, 506, 516, 591, 599, 606, and 657.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b903-30\">.
