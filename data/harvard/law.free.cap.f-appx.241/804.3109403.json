He entered the United States on December 3, 1995 as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until May 2, 1996. Sutikno did not file an application for asylum until April 2003. Shortly thereafter, he received a notice to appear, charging him with being subject to removal for remaining in the United States beyond his admission period, in violation of Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the INA. When Sutikno appeared before the IJ, he conceded removability but requested withholding of removal under the INA and relief under the CAT. He was afforded a hearing before an IJ, who denied Sutikno\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. Sutikno appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. He then filed this petition for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">This court reviews the BIA\u2019s factual finding that an alien has failed to demonstrate eligibility for relief from removal under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483 (3d Cir.2001). A factual finding will fail to meet the substantial evidence standard only if \u201cthe evidence not only <em>supports </em>\u201d a contrary conclusion, \u201cbut <em>compels </em>it[.]\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Where, as here, \u201cthe BIA both adopts the findings of the IJ and discusses some of the bases for the IJ\u2019s decision, we have authority to review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>376 F.3d at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-18\">Aliens are generally ineligible for asylum unless they file their applications within one year of their arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The one-year deadline will not bar an asylum application if the applicant can demonstrate \u201ceither the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Because Sutikno filed his application over seven years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>his arrival in the United States and he did not demonstrate the requisite changed or extraordinary circumstances, the IJ held that Sutikno was statutorily ineligible for asylum. We do not have jurisdiction to review this determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 635 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Sutikno argues that the IJ erred in concluding that he had not suffered past persecution and that he had failed to establish a clear probability of future persecution. To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3)(A) of the INA, the applicant must demonstrate that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [the country of removal] because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d In order to show the requisite clear probability of future persecution, the applicant must prove that the persecution is more likely than not to occur. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Sutikno first attempts to establish eligibility for withholding of removal through proof of past persecution, which would entitle him to a rebuttable presumption that he would be subject to future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). In order to constitute persecution, the past incidents must have been committed by the government or by forces that the government is either unable or unwilling to control. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). Not all unjust or unlawful treatment amounts to persecution. <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">At his removal hearing, Sutikno testified that, during his childhood, native Indonesians would often harass him because of his Chinese ethnicity. Additionally, while Sutikno was in high school, a group of people once threw rocks at him on his way to Church while deriding his Catholicism. Sutikno also testified that he was advised not to apply to the University of Indonesia, as his Chinese heritage meant he would have a very slim chance of admission. He did not claim any other forms of mistreatment or persecution from his time in Indonesia. Sutikno does not want to return to Indonesia because he \u201cwould have to experience those horrible incidents.\u201d App. at 57-58. The IJ found no past persecution, and therefore no presumption of future persecution, because none of the incidents described by Sutikno \u201crise to the level of persecution.\u201d App. at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">An applicant may also establish eligibility for withholding of removal by showing that there is a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution\u201d against a group to which he belongs, \u201csuch that it is more likely than not that his or her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)\u00a9, (ii). In an apparent attempt to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against Chinese Christians, Sutikno submitted two State Department reports on Indonesia and various news reports detailing attacks on Chinese Christians. Ordinary criminal activity, such as generalized lawlessness and violence between diverse populations, usually does not amount to a pattern or practice of persecution. <em>Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 494-95 (citing <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998)). The IJ faded to find the requisite pattern or practice of persecution, in part because the articles submitted by Sutikno show that the Indonesian government had actually attempted to protect its Chinese citizens during the riots that did occur. The IJ ultimately concluded that Sutikno had failed to prove either past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">The IJ and BIA findings, with respect to both past and future persecution, were \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481, 112 S.Ct. 812 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)(4)). Because we are also not persuaded that a \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), we see no reason to disturb these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision that Sutikno did not suffer past persecution and would not be subject to future persecution upon return to Indonesia were supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-11\">. The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s grant of Sutikno\u2019s application for voluntary departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\">. Sutikno has waived his claim under the CAT by failing to raise the issue in his brief. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 221 (3d Cir.2004). Even if Sutikno had raised the issue, we would have agreed with the denial of relief under the CAT, because Sutikno provided no evidence to support a finding of past or future torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-20\">. We have jurisdiction to review this petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
