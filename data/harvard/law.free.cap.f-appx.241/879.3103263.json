For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-18\">The Government charged Heron in a three-count indictment with using an altered Jamaican passport to unlawfully reenter the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1543, and misusing a non-immigrant Visa for entry into the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a). After plea negotiations failed, Heron entered an open guilty plea to all three counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-19\">Prior to sentencing, Heron filed a motion for: (1) a four-level departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 to avoid sentencing disparity with defendants sentenced under fast-track programs; (2) a downward departure for cultural assimilation; and (3) an additional point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) for extraordinary acceptance of responsibility. The district court denied the motion and sentenced Heron to a term of imprisonment of forty-six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-20\">Heron concedes that the district court\u2019s Guidelines computations were correct. He argues the district court should have exercised its discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) to reduce his sentence to mitigate the disparity arising from sentences imposed for illegal reentry in jurisdictions that have fast-track programs. Heron also argues that the district court\u2019s failure to adjust his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 denied him equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-21\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-22\">Heron\u2019s contention that the court should have adjusted his sentence to eliminate sentencing disparity arising from fast-track programs in other jurisdictions can readily be dismissed. We rejected that argument in <em>United States v. Vargas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>477 F.3d 94, 99 (3d Cir.2007). There, we \u201c[held] that a district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program does not make a sentence unreasonable.\u201d Accordingly, the court did not err in refusing to adjust Heron\u2019s sentence on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">In <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2006), we established a three-step process for district courts to follow at sentencing: (1) a court must calculate the correct Guidelines sentence; (2) rule on any motions for departure, stating on the record whether the motion was granted and explaining how disposition of any motion affects the calculation; and (3) exercise its discretion by considering the relevant factors set forth under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 247. Heron concedes that the court properly calculated his sentence pursuant to that process here. Nonetheless, Heron argues that the district court should have exercised its discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) to further adjust his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">The record here clearly reflects that the district court was fully aware that, although Heron filed a motion that he cast as a request for a downward departure, he was actually requesting a favorable exercise of discretion under \u00a7 3553(a). The court refused to exercise its discretion in Heron\u2019s favor. The sentencing hearing here incorporated the sentencing hearings in the cases of <em>United States v. Freddy Morales-Aponte, </em>and <em>United States v. Kevin Bryan. </em>After the court heard arguments in Heron\u2019s behalf, the court referred to the prior sentencing proceedings and stated: \u201c[f]or the same reasons, the motion is denied.\u201d JA9. This record does not establish that the court was unaware of its sentencing discretion, the proper role of the Guidelines, or the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court simply relied upon the explanations it had previously given for denying similar arguments of Bryan and Morales-Aponte, and incorporated that rationale into the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Heron also argues the district court\u2019s refusal to reduce his offense by one additional level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) violated his right to equal protection of the law because the Government granted the additional decrease in offense level to others, but refused to do so for Heron. He does not rest this claim of disparate treatment upon any suspect classification such as race. Rather, he seems to be arguing that he is entitled to relief because the Government\u2019s sentencing recommendations under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) are inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), a defendant\u2019s offense level is decreased one additional level for exceptional acceptance of responsibility if, among other things, the Government moves for the adjustment. Despite Heron\u2019s claim that the Government did not afford him equal treatment in refusing to move for an additional departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), the transcript of the sentencing hearings of Kevin Bryan and Freddy Morales-Aponte establish that the Government also refused to move for the additional reduction in their cases. In fact, during Bryan\u2019s sentencing hearing the court asked the Assistant United States Attorney why the Government was not willing to move for the additional departure for him, and the Government explained its reasoning. JA 33-35. Accordingly, Heron has not established any disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
