They are whether appellant failed to meet its burden of apportioning the fees attributable to its defense of appellee\u2019s civil theft claim \u2014 as distinguished from appellee\u2019s claims for negligence and conversion \u2014 and whether the district court erred in determining that the compensable time appellant spent in defense of the civil theft claim was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Having considered the parties\u2019 arguments, we agree with the district court, for the reasons stated in its dispositive order, that appellant failed to satisfy its apportionment burden. As for the attorney\u2019s fees, we find no error in the court\u2019s determination of the hourly rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
