On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming there are no meritorious issues on appeal, but raising the question of whether the sentences were reasonable. Neither Appellant filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">We find Appellants\u2019 ranges of imprisonment were properly calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines. Thus, their sentences at the low end of the Guidelines range of imprisonment were reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences. We require counsel to inform the clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If a client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
