Al-Beshrawi also appeals the denial of his motion for reconsideration. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Moore Bros. Co. v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>207 F.3d 717, 722 (4th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 958 (4th Cir.1996). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Al-Beshrawi v. Gutierrez, </em>No. 1:05-cv-1101-TSE-LO (E.D. Va. filed Jan. 31, 2006 &amp; entered Feb. 1, 2006; filed Feb. 13, 2006 &amp; entered Feb. 14, 2006). We also deny Al-Beshrawi\u2019s pending motion to supplement the record on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
