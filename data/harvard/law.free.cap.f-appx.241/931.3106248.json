The properly calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range of imprisonment was seventy-seven to ninety-six months. The district court took note of Carbajal-Martinez\u2019s criminal history and his prior re-entries after deportation, and sentenced him to ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment. Carbajal-Martinez claims the sentence is unreasonable and the court erred by not considering his motion for a variance sentence below the guidelines or by not providing an adequate statement of reasons. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">A sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. Un<em>ited States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>473 F.3d 556, 560 (4th Cir.2007). It is the district court\u2019s responsibility to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Tucker, </em>473 F.3d at 561. If the appeals court concludes that the sentence achieves this goal, the sentence may be affirmed as reasonable. <em>Id. </em>To this end, the sentencing court should correctly determine the advisory guideline range and decide whether a sentence within the range serves the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-16\">\u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, - L.Ed.2d - (2007). \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable ... if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.) (alteration added), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>(2006). \u201c[A] district court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication (1) that the court considered the \u00a7 3558(a) factors with respect to the particular defendant; and (2) that it has also considered the potentially meritorious arguments raised by both parties about sentencing.\u201d <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 380 (internal citations omitted). A court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. \u201c[I]n determining whether there has been an adequate explanation, [this Court does] not evaluate a court\u2019s sentencing statements in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 381. Rather, \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation may imbue it with enough content for [this Court] to evaluate both whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether it did so properly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">We find the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and considered CarbajalMartinez\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence. We further find the district court provided an adequate explanation as to why it imposed a sentence at the high end of the guidelines. Thus, we find the sentence was reasonable. We further find that by virtue of the sentence within the guidelines, the court denied Carbajal-Martinez\u2019s motion for a variance sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
