The relevant inquiry in a summary judgment analysis is \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Garofolo v. Donald B. Heslep Assocs., Inc., </em>405 F.3d 194, 198 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">The evidence in the record tends to establish that in May 2003 Wadley purchased a car from Jerry\u2019s Ford in Alexandria, Virginia. Ford Motor Credit Corporation (\u201cFMCC\u201d) financed the purchase. Shortly thereafter, Wadley returned the car to Jerry\u2019s Ford, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tending that it had several problems. Dissatisfied with the response from Jerry\u2019s Ford, Wadley removed his personal belongings and the tags from the car and left it at the dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Thereafter, Wadley quit repaying the FMCC loan. When he informed FMCC that he should not have to repay the loan, FMCC told him that his failure to do so would adversely affect his credit. Because Wadley had abandoned the car at Jerry\u2019s Ford, FMCC treated it as being voluntarily surrendered and sold it at a public auction. After the proceeds were applied to the balance of the loan, a total of $9,467.46 remained due and owing from Wadley to FMCC. Wadley failed to repay the balance, and FMCC filed a lawsuit seeking repayment in Virginia state court. FMCC eventually took a voluntary non-suit, but it continued to maintain that Wadley owed the loan balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Experian is a consumer reporting agency that supplies consumer information pursuant to the FCRA. Because of Wadley\u2019s failure to repay the loan, FMCC reported the deficiency balance to Experian and other consumer reporting agencies that supply consumer credit information pursuant to the FCRA. In turn, Experian reported Wadley\u2019s FMCC debt on his credit report.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Wadley contacted Experian several times about the FMCC account. In June 2003, Wadley wrote Experian about \u201ca negative customer service experience\u201d he had with FMCC. J.A. 24. Wadley stated that FMCC told him his actions would affect his credit, but he contended that \u201c[a]s a dissatisfied customer [he] should not be penalized in this way simply because [he] returned a defective product within the parameters of the 30-day period.\u201d J.A. 24. Wadley also contacted Ex-perian in May 2004 to dispute the FMCC debt. Experian apparently investigated the loan with FMCC, and FMCC confirmed the delinquency. By letter dated June 2, 2004, Experian informed Wadley that the investigation confirmed the accuracy of the loan and that the loan would remain on his Experian credit file, but that he could add a statement disputing the accuracy or completeness of the information to his Experian report.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In July 2004, Wadley\u2019s attorney (Carl Crews) wrote to Experian requesting an investigation of the FMCC account. Crews enclosed a copy of FMCC\u2019s nonsuit, but he did not argue that the credit report was inaccurate because Wadley disputed the debt. Rather, Crews argued that the fact of the nonsuit supported Wadley\u2019s contention \u201cthat a debt was never owed\u201d and that the account could not have been delinquent because it never should have arisen. J.A. 27. Experian responded to Crews by stating that it had conducted an investigation regarding the FMCC account and that it could not assist Wadley in resolving his dispute with FMCC. Experian again noted that Wadley could add a consumer statement specifying the nature of his dispute with FMCC to his credit report. Experian also wrote to Wadley, explaining that the dispute had been previously investigated and informing him that he could add the consumer statement to his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">In his amended complaint, Wadley alleged that the information reported by Ex-perian relating to his FMCC account was inaccurate and that Experian violated the FCRA by willfully and negligently failing to: (1) \u201cconduct a proper and reasonable reinvestigation concerning the inaccurate information after receiving notice of the dispute from [sic];\u201d (2) \u201cprovide prompt notice of the inaccurate information and of plaintiffs dispute to the furnishing entities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(a);\u201d (3) \u201cprovide all relevant information provided by the Plaintiff regarding the dispute of the inaccurate information to the furnishing entities, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(a);\u201d (4) \u201creview and consider all relevant information submitted by the Plaintiff concerning the dispute of the inaccurate information, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(4);\u201d (5) \u201cdelete the inaccurate information from plaintiffs credit file after reinvestigation, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(a);\u201d and (6) \u201cemploy and follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of plaintiffs [sic] credit report, information and credit file, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e.\u201d J.A. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In granting summary judgment, the district court noted that this case concerns Wadley\u2019s allegations that Experian violated the FCRA \u201cby reporting inaccurate information\u201d on Wadley\u2019s credit report, and it framed the issue as being \u201cwhether a genuine issue of fact remains regarding whether Experian reported inaccurate information on [Wadley\u2019s] credit report when [he] concedes that he entered into a loan with FMCC, failed to pay the loan, and the loan was reported with a derogatory status.\u201d J.A. 45. Without elaborating specifically on the various alleged FCRA violations noted above, the district court concluded that Experian was entitled to summary judgment because Wadley \u201cfailed to establish that the consumer report contains inaccurate information, which is an essential element of a FCRA claim.\u201d J.A. 49. The district court primarily cited \u00a7 1681e(b) for the proposition that inaccurate information is an essential element of a FCRA claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court also held that summary judgment was warranted because Wadley \u201cis attempting to collaterally attack the basis of accurately reported information. The FCRA does not provide a cause of action to collaterally attack an accurate credit report.\u201d J.A. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Wadley raised two issues in his appellate briefs. First, he contended that the district court erred in dismissing his FCRA claim to the extent that it is brought under \u00a7 1681e(b) because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the FMCC information reported by Experian was accurate. Second, he contended that, in any event, the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 1681i failure-to-reinvestigate claim because it did not specifically address that claim and because Experian had a duty to reinvestigate the credit report after notice of the non-suit regardless of whether the FMCC report was accurate. During oral argument, Wadley abandoned his \u00a7 1681e(b) claim, which was premised on the alleged inaccuracy of the FMCC report, but he continued to maintain for purposes of his \u00a7 1681i claim that the FMCC report was in fact inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Thus, we are now presented with only the issue of whether the district court properly entered summary judgment against Wadley on his \u00a7 1681i claim. As Wadley correctly observes, the district court did not address the \u00a7 1681i claim in its summary judgment order. In this circumstance, we find it appropriate to remand the case to the district court for further consideration of the summary judgment motion as it pertains to the \u00a7 1681i reinvestigation claim. <em>See French v. Assurance Co. of America, </em>448 F.3d 693, 707 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cwe adhere to the general rule that a federal appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>does not consider an issue not passed upon below\u201d); <em>Whittle v. Timesavers, Inc., </em>749 F.2d 1103, 1106 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cbecause the district court\u2019s opinion did not adequately discuss this issue, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We express no opinion on the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate the summary judgment and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">. The district court also cited <em>Dalton v. Capital Assoc. Indus., Inc., </em>257 F.3d 409, 415 (4th Cir.2001) (citation and internal punctuation omitted), in which we stated that \u201c[t]o make out a violation under \u00a7 1681e(b), a consumer must present evidence tending to show that a credit reporting agency prepared a report containing inaccurate information.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-20\">. On remand, the district court may, as it deems necessary, permit the parties to engage in further discovery and submit additional evidence concerning the nature of the reinvestigation conducted by Experian.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
