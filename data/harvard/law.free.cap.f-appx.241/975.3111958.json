We deny all four petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought and no other means to seek the requested relief. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Crawford has not established he is entitled to the relief sought, as he fails to establish the requisite extraordinary circumstances. Further, mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). Although Crawford appears to dispute the propriety of the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition, he has not appealed that order and thus that issue is not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petitions for writs of mandamus. We further deny Crawford\u2019s motion for en banc hearing and all other pending motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
