The district court granted the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion and dismissed Roland\u2019s complaint on the basis that Roland had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Roland filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Roland argues that the district court erred in finding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies through the use of the prison grievance procedure. Roland filed a Step One grievance form numbered 2033222407. He did not, however, file a Step Two grievance form. He contends that he filed another Step One grievance form that he intended to serve as his Step Two form. It is undisputed that the second Step One form was returned to Roland unprocessed. Roland has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Roland also argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his requests for appointment of counsel. We have considered the relevant factors and conclude that there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant the appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
