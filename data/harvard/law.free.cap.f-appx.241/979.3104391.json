CedillosGuzman was sentenced by the district court to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">On appeal, Cedillos-Guzman contends his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to give proper weight to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, as well as provide a statement of reasons for selecting a twelve-month sentence. However, the district court appropriately calculated the advisory guideline range and considered it in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). Cedillos-Guzman\u2019s twelve-month sentence, which is at. the lowest end of the applicable guideline range and below the statutory maximum, is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Though the court concededly failed to explicitly discuss \u00a7 3553(a) factors on the record, we conclude it does not render Cedillos-Guzman\u2019s sentence unreasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468-69; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). We note that the court heard extensive arguments from the parties relating to the potential applicability of \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We deny as moot Cedillos-Guzman\u2019s motion to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
