Miller argues on appeal that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erroneously determined that Miller was a person \u201cclosely approaching advanced age,\u201d as opposed to a person \u201cof advanced age,\u201d in determining whether he was disabled under the SSA\u2019s Medical-Vocational Guidelines (\u201cgrids\u201d). Because the ALJ did not rely exclusively on the grids, and because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Miller was not disabled, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">Miller filed an application for SSI and DIB in March 2003, alleging a disabling condition commencing on February 10, 2003. His application was denied initially and on reconsideration. Miller requested and was granted a hearing by an ALJ. At the time of the hearing, Miller was 54 years old and a high school graduate. His past work included driving and unloading trucks and cleaning. Miller stopped working because he could not pass the required physical examination. Thereafter, further he experienced several medical problems, including: passing out, low pulse rate, difficulty standing for a long period of time, falling asleep at any time, frequent urination, swelling of his legs, arthritis in his knee, pain in his shoulder and hands, and an inability to stand for more than five minutes at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">A vocational expert (\u2018VE\u201d) also testified at the hearing, indicating that he characterized Miller\u2019s past work as medium to heavy and unskilled to semiskilled. The VE testified that, with a maximum residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) for a restricted range of light work activity and limitations including (1) alternating sitting and standing at three minute intervals, and (2) no climbing, balancing, or driving, Miller could not perform any of his past work. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The VE further testified that Miller\u2019s skills that he acquired as a result of his past work would not transfer to other semiskilled jobs that were consistent with the above-described RFC, but that there were other unskilled jobs that would have been appropriate, namely, a bench worker or assembler, a packager, and a cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">After the hearing, the ALJ issued his decision, first determining that Miller had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity since his alleged onset date. As to Miller\u2019s impairments, the ALJ determined that the medical evidence indicated that Miller suffered from high blood pressure, obesity, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and diabetes. The ALJ noted that doctors had evaluated Miller\u2019s complaints of hand pain and that \u201c[apparently [Miller\u2019s] symptoms [were] not severe enough to warrant treatment.\u201d Thus, the ALJ found that Miller\u2019s impairments were severe, but did not meet or medically equal any of the listed impairments. The ALJ next found that Miller retained the following RFC: \u201ca full range of light work with a sit/stand option and no working around heights, no driving and no balancing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">As to what work, if any, Miller could perform with that RFC, the ALJ determined that he could not perform any of his past relevant work. The ALJ noted that, as a 54-year-old, Miller was \u201can individual closely approaching advanced age\u201d and that Miller had work skills that were transferable to other semiskilled jobs. The ALJ then found that, under grids, if Miller were able to perform a full range of light work, a finding of \u201cnot disabled\u201d would be required. The ALJ found, however, that Miller\u2019s ability to perform a full range of light work was impeded by his additional exertional and non-exertional limitations. The ALJ then used the VE\u2019s testimony, that someone of Miller\u2019s age, education, past relevant work experience, and RFC could perform jobs as a bench worker or assembler, packager, or cashier, to help determine whether there existed a significant number of jobs in the national economy that Miller could perform. The ALJ thus determined that, although Miller\u2019s exertional limitations prevented him from performing the full range of light work, the VE\u2019s testimony, together with Miller\u2019s characteristics and the framework of grid rule 202.15, required a finding of \u201cnot disabled\u201d because Miller could adjust to work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. The ALJ denied Miller\u2019s applications for DIB and SSI payments. The Appeals Council denied review. The district court affirmed the SSA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">On appeal, Miller argues that the ALJ should have treated him as a person of advanced age, rather than a person closely approaching advanced age because, at the time the ALJ rendered the decision, Miller was \u201cless than 2 months shy of his 55th birthday.\u201d Miller contends that the distinction was significant because, had he been considered a person of advanced age, the fact that his skills were not transferable would have required a finding of \u201cdisabled,\u201d whereas, being considered a person closely approaching advanced age, the transferability of his skills was of no consequence to the ultimate disability finding. Miller admits that the ALJ would have been correct in finding him not disabled under Rule 202.14, as opposed to Rule 202.15, upon which the ALJ relied. He nonetheless argues that the ALJ should have considered him a person of advanced age and, consequently, found him disabled under Rule 202.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">We review a social security case to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). The Commissioner\u2019s decision will not be disturbed \u201cif, in light of the record as a whole, it appears to be supported by substantial evidence,\u201d .which is \u201cmore than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1439-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">A claimant applying for disability benefits must prove that he is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512; <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). The Social Security regulations outline a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). First, the claimant must show that he has not engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1228. Second, he must prove that he has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. In step three, if his impairment meets or equals a listed impairment, he is automatically found disabled. If it does not, he must move on to step four, where he must prove that he is unable to perform his past relevant work. Finally, if the claimant cannot perform past relevant work, then the burden shifts to the Commissioner in the fifth step to show that other work is available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In attempting to meet its burden, the Commissioner may rely upon the grids to establish that other work exists in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform. <em>Patterson v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1455, 1458 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cThe grids are based on the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, education and work experience, and in cases where they apply, they direct a conclusion oh the issue of whether the claimant is capable of performing substantial gainful activity in the national economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[exclusive reliance on the grids is not appropriate either when [a] claimant is unable to perform a full range of work at a given functional level or when a claimant has non-exertional impairments that significantly limit basic work skills.\u201d <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 1002-03 (11th Cir.1987) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen the grids are not controlling, the preferred method of demonstrating job availability is through expert vocational testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We have explained that the Commissioner \u201cmay not apply the grids in a mechanistic fashion on the basis of a claimant\u2019s age, in order to establish conclusively a claimant\u2019s adaptability to a new work environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1002. While the Commissioner may rely upon the claimant\u2019s age as evidence of adaptability to a new work environment, the claimant may then proffer \u201csubstantial credible evidence that his ability to adapt is less than the level established under the grids for persons his age.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 519, 525 (11th Cir.1984). If the claimant presents such evidence, the Commissioner \u201ccannot rely on the age factor of the grids and must instead establish the claimant\u2019s ability to adapt to a new work environment by independent evidence\u201d and, thus, the district court would be required to remand the case to the Commissioner for reconsideration of the issue. <em>Id.; see also Patterson, </em>799 F.2d at 1458-59. \u201cIf, on the other hand, the claimant does not make such a proffer, the ALJ\u2019s mechanistic use of the age grids would be harmless error and there would be no need to remand to the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>799 F.2d at 1459.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">In considering a claimant\u2019s age as a vocational factor, the SSA defines a \u201cperson closely approaching advanced age\u201d as someone who is between the ages of 50 and 54, and a \u201cperson of advanced age\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>someone 55 years\u2019 old or older. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1563(d), (e). According to the grids, Table 2 applies to persons with a RFC that allows limited to light work. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, table no. 2. Under Rule 202.06, a person of advanced age, who is a high school graduate or more, where that educational level does not provide for direct entry into skilled work, and has skilled or semi-skilled skills that are not transferable is categorized as \u201cdisabled.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, table no. 2, \u00a7 202.06. However, a person with those same characteristics, except that his skills are transferable, is categorized as \u201cnot disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 202.07. A person closely approaching advanced age, who is a high school graduate and has either transferable or nontransferable skills, is categorized as \u201cnot disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 202.14, 202.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Miller\u2019s argument, that the ALJ should have treated him as a person of advanced age, is without merit for two reasons. First, the treatment of Miller as either a person of advanced age or closely approaching advanced age under the grids is essentially theoretical because the ALJ did not rely exclusively on the grids in making the disability determination. As discussed above, where a claimant is unable to perform a full range of work at a given functional level or has non-exertional impairments that significantly limit basic work skills, the ALJ must not exclusively rely upon the grids; rather, the ALJ should consider testimony of the VE to establish job availability. <em>See Walker, </em>826 F.2d at 1002-03. Here, the ALJ correctly followed <em>Walker\u2019s </em>requirements. At step five of the sequential evaluation process, the ALJ determined that, although the grids would ordinarily support a finding of \u201cnot disabled\u201d in Miller\u2019s case, the ALJ needed to utilize the VE\u2019s testimony to establish whether a significant number of jobs existed for Miller in the national economy because Miller\u2019s ability to perform all or substantially all of the requirements of light work was impeded by his exertional and nonexertional limitations. Miller does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s factual findings with regard to his RFC or the conclusion that he could not perform a full range of light work. Given the VE\u2019s testimony that there existed three types of jobs in significant numbers in the national economy that a person with Miller\u2019s RFC could perform, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that, because the Commissioner met its burden at step five, Miller did not demonstrate that he was disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, the ALJ\u2019s decision was not made in reliance upon the grids and, thus, a determination of whether Miller was a person of advanced age or closely approaching advanced age was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Second, assuming without deciding that the ALJ relied solely upon the grids, the ALJ\u2019s categorization of Miller as a person closely approaching advanced age is supported by substantial evidence. Admittedly, Miller was 54 years\u2019 old at the time of the hearing and the ALJ\u2019s decision. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s initial determination that Miller was a person closely approaching advanced age was correct. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1563(d). Under our prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>dent, if a claimant wishes to establish that his ability to adapt was less than the level established under the grids for persons his age, he must proffer evidence tending to establish that fact. <em>See Reeves, </em>734 F.2d at 525. If the claimant makes such a showing, the district court is required to remand the case to the Commissioner for reconsideration in light of the evidence. <em>See Patterson, </em>799 F.2d at 1458-59. In his briefs before the district court and this Court, Miller\u2019s only reason in support of his contention that he should have been treated as a person of advanced age is that he was only two months short of turning 55 at the time of the hearing and the ALJ\u2019s decision. Nothing in Miller\u2019s argument suggests that his ability to adapt to new work environments was less than the level established under the grids for persons his age. Thus, to the extent that the ALJ relied exclusively on the grids, the ALJ\u2019s mechanistic use of the age grids was harmless error. <em>See Patterson, </em>799 F.2d at 1459.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In conclusion, the question of whether Miller should have been treated as a person of advanced age or closely approaching advanced age was inconsequential because the ALJ did not rely exclusively on the grids and substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that Miller was not disabled. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of DIB and SSI payments is</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\">. It is noteworthy that the ALJ explicitly indicated that his determination was based upon the VE\u2019s testimony, Miller\u2019s RFC and other characteristics, and the framework of Rule 202.15. Rule 202.15 considers a person closely approaching advanced age. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, table no. 2, \u00a7 202.15. Even assuming without deciding that the AU's finding that Miller was a person closely approaching advanced age was erroneous, that error was harmless because substantial evidence (e.g., the VE\u2019s testimony and Miller's RFC) supported the finding that other jobs were available that Miller could perform. <em>See Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1228; <em>Walker, </em>826 F.2d at 1003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">. Miller also argues that the district court erred in concluding that the ALJ could have properly found, under Rule 202.08, that Miller was a person of advanced age and not disabled. However, because we review the ALJ\u2019s determination, and, here, that decision is supported by substantial evidence, we need not consider the district court\u2019s reasoning. <em>See Graham v. Bowen, </em>790 F.2d 1572, 1575 (11th Cir.1986) (explaining that, \"[t]he question is not whether substantial evidence supports a finding made by the district court but whether substantial evidence supports a finding made by the\u201d Commissioner).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
