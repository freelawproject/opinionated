The district court sentenced Mann to 312 months in prison, Bare to 288 months, Alexander to 228 months, and Zacarolo to 268 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Appellants assert (1) the district court erred by enhancing their sentences based upon uncharged attempted murder, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A2.1; (2) the district court erred by not considering all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in imposing severe sentences; and (3) this Court\u2019s presumption that a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable is a return to unconstitutional mandatory guidelines sentencing. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guidelines range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then should consider the resulting advisory guidelines range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.CA. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>a court imposes a sentence outside the guidelines range, the district court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Appellants contend that their sentences are unlawful because the district court made findings by a preponderance of the evidence that increased their sentences beyond both the conduct with which they were charged and the facts to which they admitted. However, this general argument was rejected in <em>Booker. </em>After <em>Booker, </em>the sentencing court is authorized to make factual findings in order to appropriately determine the advisory sentencing range under the guidelines. <em>See Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370; <em>see also United States v. Martinez, </em>136 F.3d 972, 979 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that sentencing court may enhance defendant\u2019s sentence based on its findings of conduct by a preponderance of the evidence, even when jury acquitted defendant of that conduct). Under the now advisory sentencing guidelines, these authorized factual findings would include a finding as to whether the object of the offense would have constituted first-degree murder. First degree murder means conduct that, if committed within the special and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, would constitute first degree murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111. Such conduct would call for application of the murder guideline, USSG \u00a7 2A1.1 (First Degree Murder). <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Under federal law, murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, and first degree murder requires that the murder is willful, deliberate, malicious and premeditated. Attempt requires a culpable intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards its commission. <em>United States v. Neal, </em>78 F.3d 901, 906 (4th Cir.1996). A substantial step requires more than mere preparation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The evidence presented at the sentencing hearings supported the district court\u2019s conclusion by a preponderance of the evidence that each defendant was involved in the attempted murder of Castle. The actions and statements of the defendants reflect a premeditation and deliberate and malicious intentions. The attack upon Castle\u2019s home was undertaken at night, when Castle was likely to be home asleep, which would both reduce the likelihood of his escape and increase the likelihood he would be injured or killed. In addition, it would be more difficult to apprehend Appellants under the cover of darkness. Moreover, statements such as they were headed to Castle\u2019s to \u201cshoot up the place,\u201d indicate an intent to kill Castle. The fabrication of the Molotov cocktails and the possession of firearms also demonstrate premeditation. Upon arriving at Castle\u2019s home, there were cars parked outside, and all of the lights were off, indicating Castle was at home and asleep. The four defendants then either threw the six flammatory devices or fired rounds of ammunition into the house. Two Molotov cocktails entered the home. After the six devices were thrown at the home, Bare shot at the house, demonstrating an intent to light the cocktails on fire. An examination of the front bedroom determined that the cocktails and rounds from the firearms caused a fire in the bedroom occupied by Castle\u2019s guests, the Bowers. Moreover, Ms. Bowers was struck by a bullet in the back during her attempt to escape the home with her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">While defendants argue they were under the influence of drugs and alcohol and lacked the ability to form intent to kill and to premeditate, their actions clearly demonstrate otherwise. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the district court\u2019s determination by a preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>evidence that the conduct presented at sentencing would have supported a conviction for attempted first degree murder under 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1111. The district court thus did not err in applying the attempted murder cross-reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Defendants next assert their sentences are unreasonable because the district court did not consider each factor in \u00a7 3553 and the sentences are more severe than necessary to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 3553. As discussed above, this court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion;\u2019 \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432 <em>(quoting United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)). This court has repeatedly held that a sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumed reasonable, and the Supreme Court has upheld this presumption. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459-60, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">The district court specifically stated that after considering the guidelines ranges and the \u00a7 3553 factors, the guidelines ranges were appropriate for fashioning a sentence in each of the four cases. The court looked at prior criminal records and recidivism, substance abuse and psychiatric issues, lack of work history, and educational history. Because the district court adequately explained the basis for its sentencing decision and considered the defendants\u2019 arguments, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the cross-reference for murder enhancement, and because the sentences were within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range, we conclude the Appellants\u2019 sentences are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Finally, Appellants argue that this circuit\u2019s presumption that a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable is an unconstitutional return to mandatory guidelines sentencing. As previously noted, the Supreme Court recently upheld our reasonableness presumption for sentencing within a properly calculated guidelines range. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 2459-60, 2462-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">Accordingly, we affirm each Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
