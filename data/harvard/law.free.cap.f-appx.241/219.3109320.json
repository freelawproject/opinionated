The district court concluded that the suit was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">Daniels argues that defendant Beasley gave him the wrong medication, which resulted in excessive sleep, a loss of appetite, and a temporary loss of vision. Daniels has not challenged the district court\u2019s conclusion that the other named defendants were not personally involved in the submission of the wrong medication, and any such claim is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). With respect to Beasley, Daniels has not established that her actions involved more than negligence. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Additionally, Daniels has not shown that his injuries were more than de minimis. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">Daniels\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Daniels is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous, and the district court\u2019s dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>missal of his complaint as frivolous, count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). He is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will be unable to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
