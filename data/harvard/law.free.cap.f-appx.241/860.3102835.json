In her Amended Complaint filed after removal, Hutchinson charged Todd Scull and Bennigans/Metromedia Restaurant, Inc., with race, national origin, and age discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq., and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (\u201cNJLAD\u201d), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion and denied Hutchinson\u2019s. Hutchinson appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">Hutchinson is a Jamaican-American woman in her mid-fifties who was hired in 1984 to serve as a cook at the Bennigan\u2019s Restaurant in Springfield, New Jersey. In 1989, she became a full-time host and eventually was promoted to head host.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-19\">On the evening of December 8, 2000, a female customer accused Hutchinson and another host, Elaine Lambert, of staring at her and her girlfriend and making inappropriate comments to her because of her sexual orientation. When the general manager, Todd Scull, arrived at the restaurant the next day, he learned what had happened and called the customer, who was still upset. She told Scull how rude the women had been to her, the statements they had made, and reiterated that she felt discriminated against because of her sexual orientation. Scull found the allegations to be serious; believed that he was required, therefore, to terminate both hosts; and, in fact, did so. Thereafter, Bennigan\u2019s hired an African-American male to replace Hutchinson as head host.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-21\">We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Kautz v. Met-Pro Corp., </em>412 F.3d 463, 466 (3d Cir.2005). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). Summary judgment will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>warranted only if the record contains insufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmoving party at trial. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). All facts and reasonable inferences are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Eddy v. V.I. Water &amp; Power Auth., </em>369 F.3d 227, 228 n. 1 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">We analyze Hutchinson\u2019s claim of discriminatory discharge, as did the District Court, by applying the familiar burden-shifting framework the Supreme Court enunciated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this framework, Hutchinson must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on race, age, or national origin. If she succeeds, the burden shifts to defendants to produce evidence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason or reasons for terminating her. Hutchinson must then show that defendants\u2019 articulated reason or reasons were a pretext for discrimination. <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The District Court found, first, that Hutchinson failed to make out a prima facie case of race or national origin discrimination because, as to the former, her job was ultimately filled by a member of the protected African-American class and, as to the latter, she alleged no facts that would permit an inference that her termination had anything to do with anti-Jamaican motives. While Hutchinson claims that the District Court erred in these regards, she offers little to support that claim and we reject it without further discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As for the age discrimination claim, and although there was no evidence as to whether her replacement was or was not under the age of 40, the Court found that the claim failed because Hutchinson failed to carry her burden of showing that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason or reasons given for her termination were a pretext for age discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stated somewhat differently, even assuming that Hutchinson established a prima facie case of age discrimination, no reasonable jury would believe that defendants\u2019 reason or reasons for terminating her were illegitimate or that \u201cinvidious discriminatfion] ... was more likely than not\u201d a motivating factor. <em>Stanziale v. Jargowsky, </em>200 F.3d 101, 105 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Hutchinson takes issue with the legitimacy of the reasons or, as the District Court put it, the \u201ctwo key points\u201d invoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>by defendants and argues that she showed the requisite pretext. A14. The customer\u2019s accusation that Hutchinson (and Lambert) discriminated against her because of her sexual orientation was the initial and stated reason for the termination of the two women. Hutchinson does not dispute that the customer complained and that Hutchinson was terminated immediately following the complaint; she merely questions whether the customer should have taken offense. As the District Court found, \u201cFor the purposes of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, it is not relevant whether the customer was right or wrong to complain; what matters is that the customer did make a complaint to management.\u201d As defendants argued, and the District Court also found, the complaint appeared in the context of a \u201cconsiderable\u201d history of job performance problems, problems which Hutchinson did not specifically contest but only \u201ccountered with the unsubstantiated allegations that Defendants have concocted fraudulent evidence.\u201d A14, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Hutchinson argues that these reasons were unworthy of belief because, although not disputing that she was terminated immediately on the heels of the customer\u2019s complaint of discrimination or the \u201cconsiderable\u201d evidence of her job performance difficulties, she claims to have been a good employee. The minimal evidence she offered in support of that claim does not begin to call into question the basis for her termination which, the District Court found, was legitimate and nondiscriminatory. And while she has pointed to a male coworker under 40 who, she states, was supposedly \u201csimilarly situated\u201d but received more favorable treatment than she did following a customer complaint, he, too, was immediately terminated. Although he was subsequently rehired, Hutchinson has neither alleged nor established that she sought to be rehired.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">There is simply no evidence that age, race, or national origin played any part in the decision to terminate Hutchinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">We will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">. Title VII does not cover claims of discrimination based on age, <em>Kremer v. Chemical Const. Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 466 n. 4, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982), and Hutchinson does not bring a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>Accordingly, we evaluate her age discrimination claim only under the NJLAD. We nevertheless apply the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework because, as the Supreme Court of New Jersey has observed, New Jersey courts have \"frequently looked to case law under Title VII ... for guidance in developing standards to govern the resolution of [NJ]LAD claims.\" <em>Carmona v. Resorts International Hotel, Inc., 189 </em>N.J. 354, 915 A.2d 518, 528 (2007). <em>See also Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 N.J. 188, 723 A.2d 944, 954 (1999) (adopting the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework to evaluate an age discrimination claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-13\">. We also reject without further discussion Hutchinson\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in \"determining summary judgment ... without a hearing thus creating a record for appeal____\u201d Br. at 2. We note, however, that the appendix on appeal numbers more than a thousand pages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-16\">. We, thus, disagree with the parties that the District Court reached the issue of pretext on all three claims of discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
