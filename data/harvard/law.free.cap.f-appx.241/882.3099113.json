For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The deportation proceedings in this case commenced prior to April 1, 1997, and the relevant notification procedures are therefore governed by the Immigration Act of 1990, \u00a7 545, Pub.L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5061-65, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the relevant provision, \u201can alien\u2019s initial notice of deportation proceedings was provided in an Order to Show Cause, which had to be delivered in person or by certified mail.\u201d <em>Adeyemo v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 558, 559 (7th Cir.2004) (citing \u00a7 1252b(a)(l)). This Order notified the alien of the charges against her and required that the alien inform the government of any changes in address. <em>Id. </em>When service of the Order was effected by certified mail, the mailing receipt had to be signed for by \u201cthe respondent or a responsible person at the respondent\u2019s address and returned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560 (quoting <em>Matter of Huete, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 250, 253 (BIA 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Subsequent to the Order to Show Cause, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the \u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would send an alien a Notice of Hearing, \u201cinforming the alien of the time and place at which proceedings would be held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559-60 (citing \u00a7 1252b(a)(2)). Although the Order to Show Cause had to be served by personal delivery or certified mail, the Notice of Hearing required only proof of attempted delivery for there to be effective service. <em>Id. </em>at 560 (citing <em>Matter of Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 27, 33 (BIA 1995)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">To enter an <em>in absentia </em>order of deportation, the government was required to show \u201cby clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d that the alien received the Notice of Hearing. \u00a7 1252b(c)(l). After 180 days, such an <em>in absentia </em>order could be rescinded only if, in relevant part, \u201cthe alien demonstrates that [she] did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section\u201d \u2014 i.e., if she did not receive the Notice of Hearing. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">On July 5, 1996, the INS issued Diaz an Order to Show Cause, charging her with seeking entry into the United States by fraud. According to the Order, Diaz had entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure, but had adjusted her status within six months to \u201cconditional permanent resident,\u201d based on her marriage to an American citizen. Cert. Rec. at 79. This marriage, the Order stated, \u201cwas for immigration purposes only,\u201d and Diaz was therefore deportable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>INS sent the Order by certified mail to Diaz\u2019s last known address, 373 North 9th Street, Prospect Park, NJ 07508 (\u201cNorth 9th Street\u201d). It was signed for by Patricia Castro.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">On July 30, 1996, the INS sent Diaz a Notice of Hearing by certified mail to the same address. The Notice indicated that a hearing before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) had been scheduled for November 14, 1996 at 9:30 AM. It also stated that, should Diaz fail to appear, the IJ could enter an \u201corder of deportation ... against you[, provided that] the [INS] establishes by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence that ... you or your attorney has been provided this notice and ... you are deportable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. On August 9, 1996, Diaz signed for this mailing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On November 14, 1996, Diaz failed to appear at the deportation proceeding and the IJ ordered her deported <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">More than eight years later, on February 16, 2005, Diaz filed a motion to reopen her proceedings, on the grounds that she \u201cneither received nor was provided written notification of the hearing on November 14, 1996.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. In affidavits submitted with the motion, Diaz denied having received notification of the deportation proceedings, explaining that, by the time the Order to Show Cause was mailed to North 9th Street, she had already moved out. Diaz also stated that Patricia Castro, who signed for the Order, had never contacted her about the mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">In a subsequent affidavit, however, Diaz explained that her attorney had shown her \u201ca certified mail receipt which I signed in August 1996, almost nine years ago.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Seeing the receipt refreshed her memory of \u201cgoing to the post office and signing for an envelope,\u201d but did not remind her of \u201cwhat was inside the envelope,\u201d or whether she had received \u201ca notice to appear before an immigration judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Diaz explained that it was \u201cpossible that I received a notice to appear before immigration and, believing that my case was over ... did not bother to find out what it meant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">On May 23, 2005, an IJ denied Diaz\u2019s motion to reopen. The IJ stated that the Order to Show Cause and the Notice of Hearing were served by certified mail to the same address, on July 5 and August 9, 1996, respectively. Since Diaz had signed for the Notice of Hearing, and because the Order to Show Cause had been mailed to the same address, the IJ explained that Diaz\u2019s \u201cclaim that she never received notice is without merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. The BIA dismissed Diaz\u2019s appeal of this decision, concluding, for largely the same reasons as the IJ, that \u201cproper notice was provided to [Diaz].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Diaz petitions this Court for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Diaz\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cUnder the abuse of discretion standard, the Board\u2019s decision must be reversed if it is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Fadiga v. Attorney General, </em>488 F.3d 142, 153 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>175 (3d Cir.2002)). We review factual determinations for substantial evidence and legal questions de novo. <em>Borges, </em>402 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Diaz argues that the BIA\u2019s decision to deny her motion to reopen was based on an erroneous reading of \u00a7 1252b. In her view, the statute places the burden on the government to prove \u201cby clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence\u201d that effective service of the Order to Show Cause was provided. Pet. Br. at 12. Accordingly, she contends, the government failed to prove that the Order to Show Cause was properly served, because Patricia Castro, who signed for it, was thirteen-years old at the time of signing and therefore not a \u201cresponsible person,\u201d as required by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 13 (citing, <em>inter alia, Huete, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 253).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Contrary to these contentions, however, the subsection requiring the government to establish written notice \u201cby clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d refers to the Notice of Hearing, not the Order to Show Cause. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252b(c)(l) (referring to subsection (a)(2), governing notice of proceedings); <em>Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 33 (\u201cBy its plain meaning, subsection (c)(1) refers to service of the notices of deportation proceedings, and only pertains to these notices and not to the Orders to Show Cause.\u201d). Accordingly, even had there been inadequate delivery of the Order, this does not mean Diaz was not notified of the proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the burden of proof in a motion to reopen is on the petitioner, not on the government. <em>See Giday v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 230, 233 (D.C.Cir.1997) (noting that, in a motion to reopen under \u00a7 1252b, the alien has the burden of demonstrating lack of notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Diaz argues that her case \u201chinges on the distinction between Orders to Show Cause and Notices of Hearing.\u201d Pet. Br. at 16 (quoting <em>Adeyemo, </em>383 F.3d at 559). According to Diaz, \u201ca strong presumption of effective service arises\u201d when a Notice of Hearing is sent by certified mail, but <em>not </em>when an Order to Show Cause is sent by certified mail. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 37). She therefore contends that the Board erred in \u201cpresuming\u201d that the Order to Show Cause was properly served because it was sent by certified mail. Pet. Br. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">The distinction Diaz draws is not dispositive in this case, however, because, as the Board concluded, she was actually notified of the proceedings. Both the IJ and BIA concluded that Diaz was adequately served with the Order, and this determination is supported by substantial evidence. As the IJ and BIA noted, the Order was sent by certified mail to Diaz\u2019s last know residence, at which Diaz herself later signed for the Notice of Hearing. Based on the mailing receipt in the record, and Diaz\u2019s admission that she signed for the Notice of Hearing, we cannot disturb the conclusion that Diaz was actually notified of the deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Our review is limited to the Board\u2019s denial of Diaz\u2019s motion to reopen, and we conclude that it properly determined that Diaz failed to demonstrate a lack of notification. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B). In light of the finding of actual notice, the Board did not err in its reading of the statute governing the motion to reopen. <em>Cf. Gurung v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 718, 722 (10th Cir.2004) (stating, in context of post-IIRIRA notice procedures, that \u201c[a] motion to reopen focuses on whether the alien actually received notice.\u201d). We therefore reject Diaz\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>is \u201ccontrary to law\u201d and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">. The applicable provision, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b (1994), was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d), \u00a7 308(b)(6), Pub.L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-615. This change, however, does not apply to aliens in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997. <em>See Luntungan v. Attorney General, </em>449 F.3d 551, 556 &amp; n. 10 (3d Cir.2006). For convenience, we do not repeat, in the remainder of this opinion, that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b was repealed by IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">. \"On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an independent agency within the United States Department of Justice and the INS\u2019s functions were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.
