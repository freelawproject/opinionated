Because we conclude that this appeal lacks an arguable basis, we will dismiss it pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-28\">Williams is presently incarcerated at the State Correctional Institute at Fayette, Pennsylvania (\u201cSCI-Fayette\u201d). In Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>ary 2000, Williams commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County against prison employees who provided medical treatment to him while he was at SCI-Pittsburgh. The Honorable Joseph James presided over Williams\u2019s case for several years, after which it was transferred to the Honorable R. Stanton Wettick. It appears that this action is still pending in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In July 2006, Williams commenced a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Judges James<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Wettick. In the complaint, Williams alleged that the defendants violated his constitutional rights when they \u2014 both independently and in concert \u2014 issued various rulings against him in the state-court action. Williams requested that the District Court compel Judge Wettick to rule in his favor on his \u201cmotion of preliminary objection,\u201d remove Judge Wettick from the case, and \u201ctake jurisdiction over\u201d the state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">On August 3, 2006, Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan recommended that the complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The District Court adopted Judge Lenihan\u2019s report and, on September 7, 2006, dismissed Williams\u2019s complaint. Williams now appeals from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999). Because Williams is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we must review this appeal to determine whether it should be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). We dismiss an appeal if it \u201clacks an arguable basis in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">We agree with the District Court that Williams failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In general, an individual aggrieved by the violation of section 1983 may seek an award of money damages, a declaratory judgment, and/or injunctive relief from the District Court. <em>See, e.g., Hubbard v. Taylor, </em>399 F.3d 150, 153 (3d Cir.2005) (recognizing inmate\u2019s action for damages, declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983). In his complaint, Williams does not appear to request money damages against Judges James and Wettick. Moreover, although he states in the \u201crelief requested\u201d section of his complaint that he seeks \u201ca declaratory judgment,\u201d it is difficult to discern any such claim from the pleading. Rather, the only actions he asks the Court to take \u2014 i.e., to compel Judge Wettick to rule on his \u201cmotion of preliminary objection\u201d and to take over the adjudication of the state court proceedings \u2014 are injunctive in nature. Therefore, we construe Williams\u2019s complaint as seeking solely injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Williams, however, is not entitled to such relief. Although a District Court may have the power to enjoin a state judge in some limited circumstances, \u201cinjunctive relief shall not be granted\u201d in an action brought against \u201ca judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity ... unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Because Williams has not alleged that a declaratory decree was violated or that declaratory relief is unavailable, and because the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>junctive relief sought pertains only to actions taken in Judge Wettick\u2019s official capacity, his claim for injunctive relief was barred. In any event, under the circumstances of this case, the District Court\u2019s refusal to oust Judge Wettick and take over the adjudication of the state court proceedings was certainly not error. <em>See, e.g., In re Campbell, </em>264 F.3d 730, 731-32 (7th Cir.2001) (stating that a federal court cannot, as a general rule, use its power to issue mandamus to a state judicial officer to control or interfere with state court litigation); <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>654 F.2d 268, 278 (3d Cir.1981) (noting that \u201cexcept in carefully circumscribed situations, the federal courts should not disrupt an ongoing state judicial process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Williams has also failed to state a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), a complaint must include \u2018\u201ca short and plain statement of the claim\u2019 that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, </em>507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). Thus, a \u201cplaintiff should plead basic facts, such as they are, for those are \u2018the grounds\u2019 upon which the plaintiffs claim rests.\u201d <em>In re Tower Air, Inc., </em>416 F.3d 229, 237 (3d Cir.2005). Williams, however, fails to plead even \u201cbasic facts\u201d in support of his allegation that Judges James and Wettick conspired to deprive him of due process and other constitutional rights. Williams does not suggest that the defendants entered into some kind of agreement, nor does he allege any facts from which we can infer that the judges worked in concert to make certain decisions in the case. Rather, the complaint contains only a general averment of conspiracy amounting to nothing more than a conclusion of law. As a result, Williams\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim under section 1985.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Accordingly, because Williams\u2019s appeal lacks an arguable basis, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">. Williams\u2019s complaint mistakenly identifies Judge Joseph James as \"Judge James Joseph.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-21\">. Although Williams was not given an opportunity to amend the complaint, we conclude that any such amendment would have been futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
