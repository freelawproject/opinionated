Johnson appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000) and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Johnson v. Maryland, </em>Nos. 1:06-cv-02781-WMN; 1:07-cv-00403-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>WMN (D.Md., May 14, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
