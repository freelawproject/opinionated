For the reasons set forth below, we will dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">On February 12, 2004, an immigration judge (IJ) found that Hamilton was removable. Hamilton\u2019s administrative appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) was due on March 15, 2004. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b). Hamilton did not take this administrative appeal, and the IJ\u2019s order of removal became final on March 15, 2004. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">On February 27, 2004, apparently in lieu of taking his administrative appeal, Hamilton filed a petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, claiming that he was a citizen of the United States and that his detention was unlawful. The district court denied Hamilton\u2019s petition and Hamilton appealed the decision. On December 8, 2004, 119 Fed. Appx. 427, we vacated the order of the district court because Hamilton had not exhausted his administrative remedies by appealing to the BIA. Hamilton\u2019s nonexhaustion precluded our assertion of jurisdiction to review his order of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), and it precluded the District Court from asserting jurisdiction to review his habeas petition. <em>Duvall v. Elwood, </em>336 F.3d 228, 232-33 (3d Cir.2003). Accordingly, we remanded to the District Court so that it could dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">On February 5, 2005, Hamilton sent a letter to the IJ, captioned as a motion \u201cRequesting Permission to Return to the BIA, and/or Reopen Case!\u201d In this letter, Hamilton asserted that the IJ had instructed him to bypass the BIA and file a habeas petition and that, in light of the dismissal on nonexhaustion grounds, further review should be permitted. The IJ responded to Hamilton with an informal letter, dated March 2, 2005, in which he explained that on February 12, 2004, Hamilton was instructed of his right to appeal directly to the BIA and received an appeal packet. Oddly, the IJ also explained that Hamilton had until March 15, 2005, to file an appeal with the BIA. (The actual deadline had been March 15, 2004.) Never did the IJ state that he was reopening Hamilton\u2019s case or providing him with any sort of extension in filing time.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">Hamilton filed an appeal with the BIA on March 11, 2005, seeking review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>removal order of February 12, 2004. On March 31, 2005, the BIA issued an order dismissing Hamilton\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to its untimeliness. Hamilton filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which the BIA denied on July 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">On April 19, 2005, Hamilton filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 with the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In this petition, Hamilton argued that his detention was unconstitutional and he challenged the final removal order of February 12, 2004, on the ground that he was a citizen or national of the United States. On July 26, 2005, the District Court removed Hamilton\u2019s petition to our Court insofar as it attacked the final removal order; a petition for review filed in the Court of Appeals is the sole means by which Hamilton may obtain judicial review of a final removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5). The District Court also denied Hamilton habeas relief; Hamilton did not appeal. It is Hamilton\u2019s transferred petition for review to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">As we explained on Hamilton\u2019s previous appeal to our Court, we may review a final order of removal only if the petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The requirement of administrative exhaustion is jurisdictional, and we lack jurisdiction to consider a petition for review where the petitioner has not brought a timely appeal before the BIA. <em>See Bejar v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 127, 132 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 594-95 (3d Cir.2003). Hamilton never presented the BIA with an opportunity to review his final removal order because he never brought a timely administrative appeal of that order. Hamilton argues that the BIA erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his appeal for reasons of untimeliness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Hamilton\u2019s removal order became final on March 15, 2004, after his time to file an appeal with the BIA expired. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.39. Since that date, the BIA has lacked jurisdiction to review the order. Hamilton\u2019s correspondence with the IJ did nothing to change that fact. Hamilton\u2019s letter to the IJ was not a properly filed motion to reopen, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3), and the informal response from the IJ most certainly did not serve to reopen Hamilton\u2019s case and provide him with a second chance to appeal to the BIA. We note that the IJ erred in stating that Hamilton had unt\u00fc March 15, 2005, to file his administrative appeal. In fact, Hamilton\u2019s time to file had expired long before, on March 15, 2004. Nonetheless, Hamilton was in no way prejudiced by this error because his appeal was already nearly a year overdue by the time that he received this misinformation. Also, we are not troubled by Hamilton\u2019s claim that the IJ had instructed him to file a habeas petition rather than an administrative appeal; the record contains no evidence of any such instructions being given, beyond Hamilton\u2019s own statement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Finally, although we recognize the constitutional concerns inherent in Hamilton\u2019s claim that the government is removing a citizen or national of the United States, we note that, when Hamilton previously challenged his removal order in our court, we found that had his claim properly been before us, we would have found it unmeritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The petition for review is accordingly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
