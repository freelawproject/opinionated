Harris County, Texas, </em>197 F.3d 173, 193 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">As for Clark\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, the summary judgment awarded the defendants is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>E.g., Threadgill v. Prudential Sec. Group, Inc., </em>145 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1998). Such judgment is proper when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see, e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Clark fails to show a violation of his constitutional rights in connection with the defendants\u2019 entry into his home. <em>See Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 603, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). Concomitantly, he fails to show the defendants were <em>not </em>entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Harris v. Victoria Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>168 F.3d 216, 223 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">Because his action was properly dismissed pursuant to the defendants\u2019 motions, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); Fed. R.CivJP. 56(c), Clark\u2019s motion for appointment of appellate counsel is denied. His motions to dismiss his indictment and for new counsel in his criminal proceedings are also denied. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999); Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
