For the reasons below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-27\">On November 19, 2004, Cook filed a pro se habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 against the Warden at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Cook challenged the loss of 27 days\u2019 good conduct time which was imposed upon him as a disciplinary sanction for committing Prohibited Act 297 (Code 297), a third party call, on May 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>2003, at the federal correctional institution. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3. The District Court denied the petition. Cook timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>See Gould Elec., Inc. v. United States, </em>220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In his petition, Cook argued that: (1) he was denied due process when he did not receive written notice of newly discovered evidence to be used against him; (2) Code 297 as applied is unconstitutionally vague; (3) the hearing officer was not fair or impartial and abused his authority; and (4) he was not given a written copy of the hearing officer\u2019s decision within 10 days as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Cook\u2019s original disciplinary hearing was postponed by the Disciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO) for the purpose of obtaining evidence whether Cook had actually received adequate notice of the prohibited act. The \u201cnew\u201d evidence used at Cook\u2019s reconvened hearing was an Admissions and Orientation handbook from the Federal Detention Center (FDC) in Philadelphia, where Cook was housed before his transfer to FCI-Fort Dix. The DHO determined that the FDC-Philadelphia handbook clearly outlined Code 297 and its sanctions. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Appendix, 85, 138. Moreover, the Admission and Orientation handbook Cook received upon his arrival at FCI-Fort Dix also clearly stated that three-way telephone conversations were prohibited. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Appendix, 85, 127. Cook\u2019s signature on the acknowledgment of receipt form evidences that he received the FDC-Philadelphia handbook. <em>See </em>D. Ct. Mem., 13. Even if Cook did not receive the Philadelphia handbook, he admitted to receiving the FCI-Fort Dix handbook. <em>See id. </em>Both handbooks delineated prohibited third-party telephone calls and the applicable sanctions. On appeal, Cook argues, not that Code 297 is unconstitutionally vague, but that he was not given adequate written warning or notice that third-party calling was prohibited. Although it concedes that the handbook from FCI-Fort Dix does not provide the same level of detail regarding prohibited calls as the one from FDC-Philadelphia, the Government emphasizes that Cook did receive written material from both FDC-Philadelphia and FCI-Fort Dix regarding what types of telephone activities were prohibited. We agree that Cook had sufficient notice that the type of phone call he made on May 14, 2003, was prohibited. The use of this evidence against him at the hearing thus did not violate his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The decision of the DHO is entitled to deference by a reviewing court. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). Here, the DHO prepared a detailed, written report identifying the evidence relied upon and explaining the bases for the sanctions imposed. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Appendix, 83-86. The record supports the DHO\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">We agree with the District Court that there is nothing in the record to show that the DHO was biased or abused his authority. Finally, we agree with the District Court that, even if Cook did not receive the DHO\u2019s written report within 10 days, pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.17(g), the delay had no prejudicial effect on Cook\u2019s administrative appeal and thus does not provide a basis for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Based on the foregoing, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
