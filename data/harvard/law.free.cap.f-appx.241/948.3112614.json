In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after \u201cthe entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The district court entered its order on March 9, 2007. Myers\u2019 undated notice of appeal was postmarked on April 11, 2007, after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Myers has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplement ed, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
