For the reasons that follow, we will deny Tjen\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">Tjen is a female native and citizen of Indonesia. She entered the United States on January 13, 2001 as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to remain temporarily until July 12, 2001. On June 2, 2003, the government served her with a notice to appear, charging her with being subject to removal for remaining in the United States beyond her admission period in violation of section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. On October 27, 2004, Tjen appeared before the IJ at a removal hearing, seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The IJ denied Tjen\u2019s applications. Tjen thereafter timely appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction to review this petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">This court reviews the BIA\u2019s factual finding that an alien has failed to demonstrate eligibility for relief from removal under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. We will reverse only if no reasonable factfinder could have failed to find the past persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner\u2019s burden. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (reversal permitted only where the record evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">To be eligible for asylum under section 208 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, the applicant must demonstrate \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinionf.]\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To be eligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), the applicant must demonstrate that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [the country of removal] because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To qualify for relief under the CAT, the applicant must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Tjen contends that the IJ failed to specifically conclude that she did not suffer past persecution. We disagree. Although the IJ found that the background material submitted corroborated Tjen\u2019s report of civil rioting, she concluded that \u201cother than suffering trauma from witnessing the civil rioting ... and facing threats the ... only direct harm [to Tjen and her family] was to lose the contents of their home.\u201d App. at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Tjen also contends that the violence the ethnic Chinese experienced during the May 1998 civil riots will reoccur and that her alleged well-founded fear of future persecution if she returns is based on continued contact with family members who have informed her that there are continued demonstrations and riots in which the Chinese are always targets. The IJ concluded, however, that Tjen \u201chas provided absolutely no reliable background of current conditions in Indonesia which would establish that ethnic Chinese ... will more likely than not be harmed because of their identities,\u201d App. at 38-39, and that she \u201cfailed to ... show any clear probability that she would be subjected to persecution on account of one of the enumerated asylum grounds.\u201d App. at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">In <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530 (3d Cir.2005), we explained that persecution is limited to \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). To establish a well-founded fear of persecution, the petitioner must demonstrate through credible testimony that his or her fear is genuine and that, objectively, \u201ca reasonable person in the alien\u2019s circumstances would fear persecution if returned to the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">The IJ concluded that: (1) Tjen \u201cwas unable to cite any current country conditions in Indonesia currently which support her claim that she has a well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to Indonesia, i.e.[,] that she will more likely than not be harmed if she returns to Indonesia based on her Chinese ethnicity and/or her Buddhist religion\u201d; (2) Tjen \u201chas not shown that the government is unwilling or unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>to ... protect citizens from terrorists reasonably\u201d; and (3) that the \u201ccontinued presence of [Tjen\u2019s] family in Indonesia unharmed for ... a period of time after her departure reduces the reasonableness of her expressed fear of persecution.\u201d App. at 38, 40, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Given our highly deferential standard of review, we see no reason to disturb the findings of the IJ, as they were \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, and we are not persuaded in this case that a \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision that Tjen did not suffer past persecution and would not be subject to torture upon return to Indonesia was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we will deny her petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-16\">. We review directly the IJ's decision because the BIA adopted the ruling of the IJ without further independent analysis. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
