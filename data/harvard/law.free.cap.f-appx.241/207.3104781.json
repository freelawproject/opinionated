He argues that the district court erred by imposing an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2005) based on the determination that his prior Maine conviction of aggravated assault was a crime of violence. He also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">The offense level for illegal reentry is increased by 16 levels if the defendant has a prior conviction of a crime of violence. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). A crime of violence is (1) any specified enumerated offense, including \u201caggravated assault,\u201d or (2) \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.(l)(B)(iii)); <em>see United States v. Velasco, </em>465 F.3d 633, 637 (5th Cir.2006). This court reviews de novo whether the district court properly applied \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) for having committed a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d 492, 493 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1350, 167 L.Ed.2d 143 (2007). Rivera argues that his prior offense is not a crime of violence because it is not an enumerated offense and because it does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">Because the enumerated offenses are not defined, this court uses a \u201ccommon sense approach,\u201d giving the offense their \u201cgeneric, contemporary, meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As Rivera argues, the relevant section of the Maine aggravated assault statute criminalizes \u201crecklessly\u201d causing bodily injury with a deadly weapon, while the Model Penal Code does not include the term \u201creckless<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ly\u201d in the subsection that sets forth the offense of causing bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1(2)(b); Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 208(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">However, in <em>United States v. Mungia-Portillo, </em>484 F.3d 813, 816-17 (5th Cir.2007), when analyzing the Tennessee aggravated assault statute, this circuit held that \u201creckless aggravated assault\u201d falls within the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault.\u201d The reasoning of <em>Mungia-Portillo </em>is persuasive in light of the text of the Maine statute under which Rivera was charged and convicted. Thus, as set forth in <em>Mungia-Portillo, </em>the district court did not err when it concluded that Rivera\u2019s prior Maine conviction for aggravated assault fit within the definition of the enumerated offense of aggravated assault, and it did not err when it determined that Rivera\u2019s prior offense warranted a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because Rivera\u2019s prior offense qualifies as a COV as the enumerated offense of aggravated assault, we need not consider Rivera\u2019s argument that his prior offense did not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Additionally, Rivera\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rivera properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
