We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Rogers challenged his convictions for murder and robbery. He filed the petition in the Middle District of North Carolina, where he is incarcerated. He was convicted and sentenced in Wayne County, North Carolina, which is in the Eastern District of North Carolina. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 113 (2000). The district court dismissed the action upon the finding that it should have been filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">A state prisoner incarcerated in a state with two or more judicial districts may file a habeas corpus petition in either the district of confinement or the district where the defendant was convicted and sentenced. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d); <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., </em>410 U.S. 484, 497, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973). Thus, under the statute, Rogers\u2019 action was properly filed in the Middle District of North Carolina. While the district court could have transferred the petition to the Eastern District of North Carolina, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(d) (explaining that a district court, \u201cin the exercise of its discretion and in furtherance of justice,\u201d may transfer a \u00a7 2241 petition to the district of conviction or the district of confinement), it erred in dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s orders and remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
