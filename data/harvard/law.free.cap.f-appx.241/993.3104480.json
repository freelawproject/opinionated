The government has moved to dismiss the appeal. In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-24\">The district court entered judgment on June 21, 2005. The notice <em>of </em>appeal was filed on December 21, 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Hutchinson failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 224, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960) (holding that timely filing of notice of appeal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-19\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
