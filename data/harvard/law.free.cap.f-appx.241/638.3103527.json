Collins raises two issues on appeal: (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial after the jurors expressed concern that, given that violent activity was associated with the crimes at issue, they may suffer harm as a result of their verdict; and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for making a false statement to an agent of the FBI. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">At Collins\u2019s trial, Linda Bobo testified that she began a romantic relationship with Collins in 1981. According to Bobo, Collins supported her financially, controlled all of her actions, and physically abused her. In 1995, Bobo met James McLemore at the Touch of Class nightclub and began a secret relationship with him, but she ultimately informed Collins of her relationship with McLemore because she was afraid that Collins would harm her if he found out on his own. Bobo told Collins that she wanted to leave him and have a relationship with McLemore. Sometime later, McLemore was shot in Bobo\u2019s driveway, but he survived. After McLemore recovered, he and Bobo went to the nightclub, and as they were leaving the nightclub, McLemore was shot again. McLemore died from the shot. On cross-examination, Collins\u2019s counsel asked Bobo whether she was \u201cever anywhere where Mr. Collins and [McLemore] were face-to-face.\u201d Bobo answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">Willie McCrary, a friend of Collins\u2019s for more than 30 years, also testified at trial. During McCrary\u2019s direct testimony, the government played an audio tape of a recorded conversation between McCrary and Collins. The transcript of the tape recording is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-15\">McCrary: Well, you know, now, we\u2019re talking about it. It\u2019ll be all right. We ain\u2019t gonna talk about this no more. I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve been thinking about it \u2018cause I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>never cared about it. Why, you told me, James slapped you and you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">Collins: He did. He pushed me. He didn\u2019t slap me. Down here at Bubba\u2019s, he did. Now, here\u2019s how he slapped me. He didn\u2019t push, he, he slapped me. He pushed me. Down to Bubba. At the time, I didn\u2019t know who James was until uh, uh, uh Lucky told me. If he\u2019d had told me that was James, I would\u2019ve taken care of \u2018em.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">McCrary: Well (UI) you kept that back. After you find out that with James, that was what made the animosity come in your heart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">Collins: That\u2019s, that\u2019s what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aja\">After the tape was played, McCrary testified that the \u201cJames\u201d to whom he referred on the tape was McLemore.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Mark Flint, a Florida Department of Law Enforcement officer, testified that he and FBI Special Agent Leo Martinez interviewed Collins in January 2003. With regard to anything that Collins had said during the interview concerning McLemore, Officer Flint testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">[Collins] replied to Agent Martinez and I that Linda Bobo had basically asked him who killed McLemore, and also if he had done it or paid somebody else to do it. Collins told us that he had never met McLemore and said, ... \u2018If I was going to be involved, I\u2019d do it myself or words to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">After the government rested its case, Collins\u2019s counsel moved for judgment of acquittal as to Count Three of the superseding indictment, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Collins made a false statement to an FBI agent. Specifically, Collins\u2019s counsel asserted that there was no evidence proving that Collins\u2019s statement, that he did not know McLemore, was false because none of the government\u2019s witnesses testified that Collins had ever met McLemore. The district court denied Collins\u2019s motion without explanation. Collins renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of his evidence, and the court again denied the motion without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Approximately 25 minutes after the jury retired to the jury room for its deliberations, it sent the court the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">Because there is testimony of violent activity associated with these crimes we have several jurors concerned about them safety after returning a verdict one way or the other. What is the support system in place to protect a juror after a trial? What [protocol] should we use in the event of something odd happening]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">The court allowed the parties an opportunity to present arguments regarding the correct way for the court to respond to the jury\u2019s letter. Thereafter, Collins\u2019s counsel joined his codefendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the grounds that the jury\u2019s note indicated that the jurors\u2019 concern for their safety influenced their ability to be fair and impartial. Specifically, counsel argued that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-14\">[i]t seems that some of these people are worried about their safety and linking it to a guilty verdict and for reasons unrelated to the evidence in this case, either the testimony or the exhibits; and because of the fact that this extraneous concern now is such a powerful influence, it appears, in the jury room, we would move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">The court denied the motion for mistrial, and the government suggested a response to the jury\u2019s note. The court asked whether the defendants agreed with the government\u2019s suggestion, and they responded that, \u201conce the Court denied our motion for mistrial, then our belief is this is really about the only alternative that we have, and we agree with the language.\u201d Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the court returned the following response to the jury: \u201cThe Court and the parties agree that there is no reason for any concern about the safety of any juror in this case. You should continue to deliberate on the issues before you and should not let any such concerns be part of your consideration in your further deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The jury found Collins guilty on all four counts of his superseding indictment. The court sentenced him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to be served consecutively, for a total term of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ASg\">A. Motion for Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Collins argues on appeal that, under the unique circumstances of his case, the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial. He maintains that the court\u2019s failure to investigate the specifics of the jurors\u2019 concerns for their safety resulted in a record devoid of evidence regarding what prejudice he may have suffered, thus leaving an incomplete record for the district court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.Sd 838, 845 (11th Cir.1998). Ordinarily, the district court\u2019s decision whether to hold a hearing to investigate alleged juror misconduct also is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Watchmaker, </em>761 F.2d 1459, 1465 (11th Cir.1985). \u201c[T]he failure to hold a hearing constitutes an abuse of discretion only where there is evidence that the jury was subjected to influence by outside sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we will review Collins\u2019s argument that the district court erred in failing to hold an investigatory hearing for plain error because Collins did not object or request a hearing before the district court. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that this Court will not \u201ccorrect an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights ... but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings\u201d) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Collins\u2019s argument on appeal centers around the district court\u2019s failure to investigate the jurors\u2019 concerns and determine whether those concerns would prejudice his defense. Notably missing from Collins\u2019s arguments on appeal, and in the district court, however, is any assertion that there was extrinsic evidence to which the jurors may have been exposed that would have caused them to raise concerns for their safety. Collins merely blames the court for failing to investigate the jurors\u2019 concerns, but fails to demonstrate that there was any need to investigate in the first instance. As we have held, the district court abuses its discretion, or plainly errs, in failing to hold an investigatory hearing \u201conly where there is evidence that the jury was subjected to influence by outside sources.\u201d <em>See Watchmaker, </em>761 F.2d at 1465. A careful review of the record in Collins\u2019s case does not reveal any possibility that the jurors may have been exposed to extrinsic evidence, nor does Collins point to any such occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">On the other hand, the record is replete with testimony from Bobo of Collins\u2019s violent nature and history of violent acts. Moreover, the jurors\u2019 note to the court supports the conclusion that their concerns arose from the evidence produced at trial: \u201cBecause there is testimony of violent activity associated with these crimes we have several jurors concerned about their safety after returning a verdict one way or the other.\u201d We have explained that \u201c[djiscus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>sions among the jurors as to their fear of the defendants are not inappropriate, so long as such discussions do not lead them to form an opinion of the defendants\u2019 guilt or innocence of the offenses charged.\u201d <em>Watchmaker, </em>761 F.2d at 1466. There was no evidence that the jurors\u2019 fear lead them to form such an opinion, nor was there evidence that the jurors had been influenced by outside evidence so as to warrant an investigation into the jurors\u2019 fear. In light of the trial testimony, the jurors\u2019 note to the court, and the lack of any suggestion in the record that the jury had received extrinsic evidence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold an investigatory hearing or in denying Collins\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Collins argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence at trial to support his conviction for making a false statement to an FBI agent. He first asserts that there was no evidence to establish that he made a false statement to an FBI agent. He contends that the only testimony regarding the statement at issue came from Officer Flint, who was a state law enforcement officer, and not from Special Agent Martinez, who the government asserted was the FBI agent receiving Collins\u2019s false statement. He argues that it was insufficient for the government to provide only third-party testimony concerning the alleged false statement. Collins secondly argues that the government presented no evidence that his statement was false. He notes that, contrary to the government\u2019s charge, Bobo testified that, to her knowledge, he and McLemore never had met face-to-face. In his reply brief, Collins asserts that the conversation between himself and McCrary did not prove that his statement to the FBI agent was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of evidence to support convictions. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 944 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1305, 167 L.Ed.2d 117 (2007). \u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion for acquittal, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Count Three of Collins\u2019s superseding indictment charged that, in violation of \u00a7 1001(a)(2), Collins made a false statement during an interview with a special agent of the FBI, specifically, that he \u201cstated that he had never met James McLemore, when in truth and fact as [he] then and there well knew he had previously met James McLemore.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 1001(a)(2), \u201cwhoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government ... knowingly and willfully ... makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\u201d shall be subject to a fine or imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2). In order to establish a violation of \u00a7 1001, the government must prove: \u201c(1) that the defendant made a false statement; (2) that the statement was material; (3) that the defendant acted with specific intent to mislead; and (4) that the matter was within the purview of a federal government agency.\u201d <em>United States v. McCarrick, </em>294 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">As to Collins\u2019s first assertion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the evidence in the record is sufficient to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>a finding that he made the statement at issue to a FBI agent, as charged in his superseding indictment. At trial, Officer Flint, a state law enforcement officer, testified that he had held an interview between himself, Special Agent Martinez, and Collins. Officer Flint testified that, during the interview, Collins stated that he had never met McLemore. Officer Flint\u2019s testimony indicates that Collins was talking to both Officer Flint and Special Agent Martinez when he made the statement at issue. The fact that Officer Flint, rather than Special Agent Martinez, testified to the statement does not negate the evidence from Officer Flint\u2019s testimony that Collins stated to a FBI agent, namely Special Agent Martinez, that he never had met McLemore. Given Officer Flint\u2019s testimony, and the lack of evidence that Collins did not make that statement during the interview with both a state officer and a federal agent, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Collins made the statement at issue to a FBI agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Collins\u2019s second assertion, that the government failed to establish that his statement was false, is similarly without merit. Review of the record and the government\u2019s appellate brief reveals that the only evidence that the government introduced to establish that Collins had actually met McLemore before he made the allegedly false statement was the testimony of McCrary and the transcript of the conversation between McCrary and Collins. In that conversation, Collins detailed an encounter that he had with an individual named \u201cJames,\u201d in which James pushed or slapped him. Collins additionally told McCrary that, at the time when he was pushed, he did not know that the individual was \u201cJames,\u201d but at a later date, someone named \u201cLucky\u201d told him that he had been pushed by \u201cJames.\u201d After the government played the tape of the conversation at trial, McCrary testified that the \u201cJames\u201d to whom he referred on the tape was McLemore. The government later called Officer Flint to testify that, during the interview with Collins and Special Agent Martinez, Collins stated that he had never met McLemore.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Viewing the evidence in the fight most favorable to the government, a rational trier of fact could have found that, based upon Collins\u2019s own statements during his conversation with McCrary, he actually had met McLemore during the pushing incident, and, thus, made a false statement during his interview with Officer Flint and Special Agent Martinez. <em>See Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 944 (explaining that, in reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we will view the evidence in the fight most favorable to the government). Accordingly, Collins has failed to demonstrate that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for making a false statement to a special agent of the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">In fight of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Collins\u2019s motion for mistrial or in failing to question the jurors regarding their safety concerns. Also, the district court did not err in denying Collins\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>judgment of acquittal on Count Three because the government presented sufficient evidence of Collins\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, Collins\u2019s convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"A47\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\">. According to Collins\u2019s indictment, \u201d[t]he NCIC database collected and maintained records relating to criminal histories of millions of people as well as persons and vehicles sought by law enforcement agencies nationwide. Access to the NCIC database was restricted to law enforcement officers authorized to access it for law enforcement purposes.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\">. In his initial brief, Collins limited his argument on this issue to two assertions: (1) there was no evidence that he made the statement to a FBI agent; and (2) there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that the statement was false. However, in his reply brief, Collins expands his argument to include challenges to the materiality of the statement and whether he had the specific intent to mislead. We need not address those additional arguments, however, because Collins raised them for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1276 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1011, 126 S.Ct. 643, 163 L.Ed.2d 520 (2005) (explaining that we decline to consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief). As such, the scope of our review is limited to the first two arguments that Collins raised in his initial brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b668-26\">. This is the appeal of Leroy Collins. Collins and Charles Daniel Maye were codefendants before the district court, but Maye\u2019s appeal was voluntarily dismissed on August 28, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
