Applying the standard laid out in <em>In re: Morfesis, </em>270 B.R. 28 (Bankr.D.N.J.2001), the Bankruptcy Court concluded that the debtors could be consolidated on account of their \u201csubstantial identity.\u201d The District Court affirmed. After we decided <em>In re: Owens Corning, </em>419 F.3d 195 (3d Cir.2005), articulating our standard for substantive consolidation, the District Court reconsidered the issue, and concluded that consolidation was still appropriate. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Substantive consolidation is a \u201cconstruct of federal common law\u201d that \u201c \u2018treats separate legal entities as if they were merged into a single survivor with all the cumulative assets and liabilities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Owens Corning, </em>419 F.3d at 205 (quoting <em>Genesis Health Ventures, Inc. v. Stapleton (In re Genesis Health Ventures, Inc.), </em>402 F.3d 416, 423 (3d Cir.2005)). In this case, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a liquidation plan proposing to substantively consolidate three debtors (former wholesale distributors of Italian specialty food products) into a single entity for subsequent distribution to creditors. (A-108) In approving consolidation, the Court considered, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwhether there is a substantial identity between the entities to be consolidated.\u201d (A-604)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In making its determination, the Court heard testimony from two witnesses, which, in the Court\u2019s view, established substantial identity among the debtors. Specifically, these witnesses testified that \u201call three debtors have the same officers, same directors and shareholders. They conducted the same general business operations under very similar names.... [Intercompany dealings were done without the usual corporate formalities.... [Moreover,] the debtors did not charge each other for all services which they rendered to one another\u201d (A-604) and they were \u201cmoving profits between and among the debtors.\u201d (A-605) The witnesses also testified that \u201cfor the purposes of ... secured lending, the debtors were viewed as a single entity,\u201d and that \u201cthe unsecured creditors likewise viewed the debtors as a single entity when extending credit terms.\u201d (A-605-06) Relying on this testimony, the Bankruptcy Court held that, \u201cthrough the witnesses, the proponents have established that both debtors <em>and creditors </em>viewed the debtors as a single enterprise.\u201d (A-606 (emphasis added))</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">In this appeal, appellants challenge whether the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings are sufficient to support substantive consolidation under the standard articulated in <em>In re: Owens Corning, </em>419 F.3d 195 (3d Cir.2005), a decision we announced after the Bankruptcy Court rendered its decision. Under <em>Owens Corning, </em>a proponent of substantive consolidation must demonstrate one of two rationales for its application: \u201cthat (i) prepetition [the entities for whom substantive consolidation is sought] disregarded separateness so significantly their creditors relied on the breakdown of entity borders and treated them as one legal entity, or (ii) postpetition their assets and liabilities are so scrambled that separating them is prohibitive and hurts all creditors.\u201d 419 F.3d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">The application of <em>Owens Corning </em>was directly at issue before the District Court, which, in a thorough and carefully reasoned opinion, concluded that \u201cthe evidence presented in the bankruptcy hearings ... provides ample support for granting substantive consolidation under the first prong (creditor reliance on prepetition disregard of separateness) of the newly articulated <em>Owens Corning </em>standard.\u201d (SA20-21) We fully agree with this conclusion. The findings of the Bankruptcy Court, which may only be disturbed if clearly erroneous, <em>In re: Am. Pad &amp; Paper Co., </em>478 F.3d 546, 551 (3d Cir.2007), comfortably support a conclusion that the \u201ccreditors relied on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>breakdown of entity borders and treated them as one legal entity,\u201d <em>Owens Corning, </em>419 F.3d at 211. As the District Court recognized, \u201c[although the Bankruptcy Court used creditors\u2019 reliance on Debtor unity as evidence of \u2018substantial identity,\u2019 it also speaks directly to, and satisfies, the first prong of the <em>Owens Corning </em>test.\u201d (SA21)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Therefore, and for substantially the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-6\">. The Court also considered whether consolidation would benefit or harm creditors, concluding that the benefits of consolidation would heavily outweigh any harm to a creditor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
