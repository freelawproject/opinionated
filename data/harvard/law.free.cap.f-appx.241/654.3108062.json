Upon review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b679-20\">In his first complaint, No. 06-60128-UUB (S.D.Fla., Jan. 30, 2006) (hereinafter \u201cComplaint # 1\u201d), O\u2019Berry claimed that the Office of the State Attorney in Bro-ward County, Florida, and the Ft. Lauder-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>dale Police Department conspired to violate his civil rights by using false evidence to indict and convict him in 1969 for a rape that he did not commit. O\u2019Berry alleged that this conduct constituted a criminal act; he invoked 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 as the statutory basis for his complaint. O\u2019Berry moved to amend his complaint to allege additional facts, but the magistrate judge declined to permit an amendment. The magistrate judge construed O\u2019Berry\u2019s complaint as being a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (\u201c \u00a7 1983\u201d) rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242. The magistrate judge then recommended a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of O\u2019Berry\u2019s complaint, because the complaint was time-barred. The district court then dismissed O\u2019Berry\u2019s complaint, pursuant to its authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based on the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that the complaint was barred by Florida\u2019s four-year statute of limitations for claims of false arrest or malicious prosecution. The court concluded that all other pending motions should be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">O\u2019Berry\u2019s second complaint, No. 06-60268-KMM (S.D.Fla., Feb. 16, 2006) (hereinafter \u201cComplaint # 2\u201d) was filed approximately a month after Complaint # 1. This time O\u2019Berry lodged claims against against the City of Ft. Lauderdale; the Risk Management Division; the City Council; the City Civil Service Board; Detectives Ozzie Davenport, Jerry Meltzer, and Bill Capko; Officer Ronald Hanks; and Assistant State Attorney Edward Stephens. O\u2019Berry again claimed that the defendants had conspired to violate his constitutional rights in convicting him in 1969, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985(3), and 1986. Complaint #2 was based on the same facts that O\u2019Berry had alleged in Complaint # 1. The magistrate judge recommended a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Complaint # 2. The magistrate judge first concluded that the earlier dismissal of Complaint # 1 should have a <em>res judicata </em>effect on Complaint # 2, as O\u2019Berry\u2019s new complaint was \u201cseek[ing] to relitigate\u2019the identical claims that were already litigated in this Court.\u201d Rl-7 at 6. Furthermore, even if <em>res judicata </em>were not to apply Complaint # 2, the magistrate judge concluded that Complaint #2 was well beyond the four-year statute of limitations applicable to claims of false arrest. The district court agreed and dismissed Complaint # 2, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">O\u2019Berry has separately appealed the court\u2019s dismissals, filing one appeal for Complaint # 1 and a separate one for Complaint # 2. For ease of reference, we consolidated the two cases. We now discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\"><em>A. Arguments On Appeal Concerning Complaint </em># <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">We first address O\u2019Berry\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of Complaint # 1. We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A. <em>Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(per </em>curiam). A civil complaint filed by a prisoner seeking redress from an employee or officer of a governmental entity is reviewed under \u00a7 1915A, and may be dismissed if the complaint \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b). <em>\u201c[P]ro se </em>pleadings are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(per curiam) </em>(citation omitted). However, \u201cthis leniency does not give a court license to serve as de <em>facto </em>counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Inv., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">O\u2019Berry\u2019s first argument with respect to Complaint # 1 is that the district court improperly construed that complaint as one based on \u00a7 1983, rather than an action based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242. The district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that O\u2019Berry could not bring an individual action under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242, as it was a criminal statute and the power to prosecute criminal cases is vested exclusively in the Executive Branch. Thus the court construed O\u2019Berry\u2019s action in Complaint # 1 as being civil in nature, and treated it as being brought under \u00a7 1983. O\u2019Berry contends that this re-characterization of his action was in error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, individuals who conspire to \u201cinjure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate\u201d another person\u2019s \u201cfree exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution\u201d shall be fined, or imprisoned, or both. In addition, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, any individual, who, while acting under color of any law, willfully deprives a person of his constitutional rights based upon that person\u2019s race shall be fined, or imprisoned, or both. The statute\u2019s civil counterpart, \u00a7 1983, provides that any individual, who, under the color of law, deprives a person of constitutional rights or privileges, \u201cshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Thus, \u00a7 1983 \u201cprovides for private relief in civil actions from the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution and its laws,\u201d whereas \u00a7 \u00a7 241 and 242 \u201cprovide for criminal penalties for the deprivation of such rights.\u201d <em>In re Estelle, </em>516 F.2d 480, 486 (5th Cir.1975); <em>see also Lewis v. Brautigam, </em>227 F.2d 124, 128 (5th Cir.1955) (characterizing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 as \u201cthe criminal counterpart of \u00a7 1983\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Here, O\u2019Berry attempted to file his complaint pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242. However, as the magistrate judge and the district court surmised, O\u2019Berry could not force the U.S. Attorney General to bring a criminal prosecution against the defendants. Moreover, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the court was obligated, as part of its screening protocol, to seek out and identify any and all cognizable claims of the plaintiff. The court\u2019s decision to construe O\u2019Berry\u2019s claim as a \u00a7 1983 action was an attempt to adhere to this statutory obligation. Thus, we conclude that the magistrate judge and the district court acted properly in construing O\u2019Berry\u2019s complaint as being civil in nature, and in thereby treating his claim \u2014 for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A screening purposes \u2014 as sounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>in \u00a7 1983 rather than its criminal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">O\u2019Berry next argues on appeal that he should have been permitted to amend Complaint # 1, so that he could have included facts demonstrating that the statute of limitations should be subject to equitable tolling. O\u2019Berry argues that he didn\u2019t learn of his constitutional injury until 2004 \u2014 and that, had he been permitted to amend his complaint to address this fact, the statute of limitations bar would have been subject to equitable tolling in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion. <em>Steger v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1080 (11th Cir.2003). A district court\u2019s discretion to dismiss a complaint without granting leave to amend is restricted by Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which directs that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d The district court, however, does not need to \u201callow an amendment ... where amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) <em>{per curiam) </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). The underlying legal conclusion of whether a particular amendment to a complaint is futile is reviewed <em>de novo. Harris v. Ivax Corp., </em>182 F.3d 799, 802 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). A court\u2019s denial of leave to amend is justified on futility grounds \u201cwhen the complaint as amended [would] still [be] subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1263 (11th Cir.2004) (internal citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In Florida, \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a four year statute of limitations. <em>See Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1188 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). \u201cFederal law determines when a federal civil rights claim accrues.\u201d <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). \u201cThe general federal rule is that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561-62 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cPlaintiffs must know or have reason to know that they were injured, and must be aware or should be aware of who inflicted the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">This case, however, is governed by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), where the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">[I]n order to recover [monetary] damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal.... A claim of damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. The district court must, therefore, determine \u201cwhether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">We discern no error in the district court\u2019s action. First, because O\u2019Berry\u2019s claim was barred by <em>Heck, </em>the court\u2019s granting leave to amend his complaint would have been \u201cfutile,\u201d because, under the holding of <em>Heck, </em>\u201cthe complaint as amended [would] still be subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>367 F.3d at 1263; <em>see id. </em>(finding an amendment to a complaint to be futile, because the amended complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>would still contain \u201cno potentially meritorious claims\u201d). In addition, we are unpersuaded by O\u2019Berry\u2019s argument in favor of equitable tolling. O\u2019Berry\u2019s claim was plainly time-barred, as the pertinent facts occurred in 1969, over 80 years before he filed Complaint # 1. Moreover, as the magistrate judge observed in his report, equitable tolling would not have been warranted, since: (1) O\u2019Berry failed to demonstrate that the newly discovered evidence was necessary to inform him that he had been subject to constitutional violations in 1969; and (2) O\u2019Berry arguably could have discovered the facts giving rise to his complaint earlier, had he exercised \u201creasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Rozar, </em>85 F.3d at 561-62. We agree that O\u2019Berry\u2019s Complaint # 1 was properly framed as a \u00a7 1983 claim, and that it was plainly time-barred. Moreover, we discern no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s and the district court\u2019s refusal to grant O\u2019Berry leave to amend Complaint # 1, as permitting an amendment in this case would have been futile. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Complaint # l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><em>B. Arguments On Appeal Concerning Complaint </em># <em>2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">With respect to Complaint # 2, O\u2019Berry\u2019s argues that the district court erred in dismissing Complaint # 2 on <em>res judicata </em>grounds, without allowing him an opportunity to join his two complaints. He also argues that the court improperly construed his complaint as being brought entirely pursuant to \u00a7 1983, rather than treating it as based in \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985(3), and 1986.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">As noted previously, we review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A. <em>Leal, </em>254 F.3d at 1278-79. The determination that <em>res judicata </em>applies is a pure question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo. Norfolk Southern Corp. v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>371 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bars a subsequent action if: (1) the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the parties are the same in both suits; and (4) the prior and present causes of action are the same. <em>See Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2003) (internal citations and quotations omitted). The bar \u201cpertains not only to claims that were raised in the prior action ... but also to claims that could have been raised previously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) In determining if \u201cprior and present causes of action are the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>we must decide whether the actions arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or are based upon the same factual predicate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Here, the district court correctly determined that O\u2019Berry\u2019s claim in Complaint # 2 was barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The district court had jurisdiction over O\u2019Berry\u2019s complaint in Complaint # 1, and the court\u2019s determination in Complaint # 1 that O\u2019Berry had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted constituted a final judgment on the merits. Moreover, Complaint # 2 alleged that the same defendants committed the same wrongdoings that O\u2019Berry had alleged in Complaint # 1, thereby supporting the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that <em>res judicata </em>was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">While it is true that in Complaint #2 O\u2019Berry named as defendants the City of Ft. Lauderdale, an individual Assistant State Attorney, and individual police officers, whereas in Complaint # 1 O\u2019Berry named as defendants the Office of the State Attorney and the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department, the essence of both complaints was that both the State Attorney\u2019s office and the Police Department falsified evidence to improperly indict, arrest, convict, and sentence him. In other words, these two claims, which arose \u201cout of the same nucleus of operative fact\u201d and are \u201cbased on the same factual predicate,\u201d involved essentially the same defendants and the same causes of action. Thus, the district court acted properly in concluding that <em>res judicata </em>applies, and O\u2019Berry has offered no evidence to the contrary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Furthermore, although the district court did not explain why it considered O\u2019Berry\u2019s claim in Complaint # 2 as being based entirely under \u00a7 1983, rather than including \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3) and 1986, any action brought under \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3) and 1986 would also have been barred by <em>res judicata, </em>because O\u2019Berry could have raised those claims in Complaint # 1. <em>See Davila, </em>326 F.3d at 1187. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Complaint # 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">O\u2019Berry, a <em>pro se </em>prisoner, has appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Complaints # 1 and # 2, both of which alleged constitutional violations on the part the Florida State Attorney\u2019s Office and the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department in connection with his indictment and conviction for rape in 1969. After reviewing the record, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of these complaints, since Complaint # 1 was plainly time-barred and Complaint # 2 was barred by the <em>res judicata </em>effect of Complaint # 1. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-5\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A requires that a court review \"a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer,\u201d and states that upon such review, the court shall identify the cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, if the court finds that the complaint \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (a), (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\">. It should be noted that O'Berry\u2019s main argument as to the unreasonableness of the district court\u2019s re-characterizing his claim in Complaint #lasa\u00a7 1983 action is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 imposes a \"willfulness\u201d requirement on the officer\u2019s conduct, whereas \u00a7 1983 does not impose any such <em>mens rea. </em>He claims that the notion of willfulness is \"incognizable\" to the statutory scheme set forth in \u00a7 1983. Br. of Appellant, 06-12840, at 14. If anything, this fact would seem to inure to O\u2019Berry\u2019s benefit, since the threshold for establishing a constitutional violation under \u00a7 1983 would be substantially lower than the threshold for establishing a criminal constitutional violation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\">. O\u2019Berry also argues on appeal that the district court improperly refused to refund the allegedly excessive filing fees that he paid when he filed Complaint # 1. The fee filing provision of the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act requires that a prisoner bringing a <em>pro se </em>civil action \u201cpay the full amount of a filing fee,\u201d whether or not he proceeds <em>in forma pauperis, </em>but provides that a court may not collect a filling fee in excess of \"the amount of fees permitted by statute for the commencement of a civil action.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1), (3). Here, however, O\u2019Berry has presented no evidence that he paid excessive filing fees to the district court. Thus, the court did not err in refusing to refund any (allegedly) excessive filing fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b683-12\">. As noted previously, section 1983 \"provides a cause of action for constitutional violations committed under color of state law. To prevail, plaintiffs must demonstrate both that the defendants deprived them of a right secured under the Constitution or federal law and that the deprivation occurred under color of state law.\u201d <em>Burton, </em>178 F.3d at 1187-88. Section 1985 addressees conspiracies to interfere with civil rights. <em>Childree v. UAP/GA Chem. Inc., 92 </em>F.3d 1140, 1146 (11th Cir.1996). Section 1986 provides that if a person has knowledge of a conspiracy in violation of \u00a7 1985 and has the power to prevent the violation, but refuses or neglects to do so, he may be liable under \u00a7 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">. We also note, as the district court did, that even if <em>res judicata </em>was not a bar to O'Berry\u2019s claim in Complaint # 2, the action would nevertheless would be plainly time-barred\u2014 just as Complaint # 1 was \u2014 due to the four-year statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 1983 actions under Florida law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
