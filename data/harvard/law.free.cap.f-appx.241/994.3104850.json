Wheeler <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to grant the Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment and deny relief on Wheeler\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. This order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Wheeler has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-19\"> The district court spelled the Appellant's last name \"Wheller/\u2019 and the Appellant used that spelling in a district court pleading. However, the South Carolina Department of Corrections indicates the correct spelling is \"Wheeler,\" and that is the spelling the Appellant has used in documents filed in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
