The district court sentenced Williams to eighty-five months in prison. Williams timely appealed, arguing that the district court miscalculated his criminal history points and erroneously determined that he held a leadership role. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-24\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews a sentence to determine whether the district court has correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range and has considered the range, as well as the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a), and whether the sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-25\">First, Williams argues the district court misapplied <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.ll) (2005), resulting in an increased criminal history score. We conclude the district court correctly interpreted \u00a7 4A1.2 and properly applied the guideline when it calculated Williams\u2019s criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-26\">Williams also argues the district court erroneously assigned him two points for holding a leadership role in criminal activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>ty pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). We conclude the district court properly applied a leadership enhancement because Williams provided the funds involved in the transaction and directed another participant to purchase a specific type of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We therefore affirm Williams\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
