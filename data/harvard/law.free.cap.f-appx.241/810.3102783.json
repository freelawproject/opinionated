The parties agree that we should vacate and remand the BIA\u2019s final order. In this opinion, we address the appropriate scope of the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">Petitioner Raymond Stewart is a native and citizen of Jamaica. He has lived in the United States since 1993, and since 1996 he has been a lawful permanent resident. In December 1998, Philadelphia police arrested Stewart on drug charges. Stewart pleaded guilty to violations of 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) (\u201cManufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance\u201d), and 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16) (\u201cpossessing a controlled ... substance\u201d). The Philadelphia Municipal Court sentenced Stewart to 18 months of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-21\">In April 2000, immigration authorities commenced removal proceedings against Stewart. The Notice to Appear alleged that Stewart was removable based on his commission of the \u201caggravated felony\u201d of \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(b), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and based on his violation of a \u201claw ... relating to a controlled substance,\u201d \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). At a hearing before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) in June 2003, Stewart\u2019s counsel admitted that Stewart\u2019s conviction under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) constituted an aggravated felony. However, counsel informed the IJ that Stewart was attempting to appeal his Pennsylvania conviction <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Unfortunately, counsel failed to provide any documentation of that fact, and the IJ refused to consider the possibility of a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal. The IJ then ordered Stewart removed to Jamaica based on his aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">Through counsel, Stewart filed a Notice of Appeal to the BIA. The only issue raised was Stewart\u2019s pending motion to file a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal. Counsel predict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>ed that \u201con June 22, 2003 Judge Bashoff [of the Philadelphia Municipal Court] will grant the appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>thereby granting [Stewart] a new trial____\u201d Appendix (\u201cApp\u201d) 39.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Question 8 on the Notice of Appeal form asks: \u201cDo you intend to file a separate written brief or statement after filing this Notice of Appeal?\u201d App. 39. Directly below that question, the form states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtO\">WARNING: If you mark \u201cYes\u201d in item # 8, you will be expected to file a written brief or statement after you receive a briefing schedule from the Board. The Board may summarily dismiss your appeal if you do not file a brief or statement within the time set in the briefing schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-7\"><em>Id. </em>Stewart\u2019s counsel marked \u201cYes\u201d in answer to Question 8, but he failed to file a brief. As a result, in October 2003 the BIA summarily dismissed the appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">After the BIA\u2019s order, Stewart remained in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. In January 2004, Stewart wrote a letter, <em>pro se, </em>to the Clerk of the Executive Office of Immigration Review. Stewart asserted that the BIA\u2019s decision was erroneous. Stewart\u2019s attorney had given Stewart a copy of the Notice of Appeal, and on that copy the answer to Question 8 was left blank. Stewart also stated that his attorney \u201cdid not show up for a court hearing ... at the criminal court in Pennsylvania,\u201d and that he had been unsuccessfully attempting to contact his attorney for four months. App. 46. Stewart asked the BIA to consider whether his \u201cattorney\u2019s conduct is sufficient for finding ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d and to \u201callow [him] a chance to find another attorney.\u201d App. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">An Appeals Examiner responded to Stewart\u2019s letter in February 2004. She explained that Stewart\u2019s case was \u201cno longer before the Board,\u201d and as a result she stated that \u201cyour letter ... is returned to you herewith.\u201d App. 61. The Appeals Examiner said that motions e to reopen must comply with the provisions of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 1003.2 and 1003.8, and must include a \u201c$110 fee or fee waiver request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She also stated that \u201cthe regulations governing motions ... include strict time limits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the Appeals Examiner encouraged Stewart to \u201cconsult promptly with an attorney.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Stewart never received this letter. Although he remained in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, the letter was returned as undeliverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">On February 17, 2004, Stewart filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court. After Congress passed the REAL ID Act, the District Court converted the matter to a petition for review and transferred it to this Court. <em>See Silva-Rengifo v. Attorney General, </em>473 F.3d 58, 62 (3d Cir.2007). Because the agency determined that Stewart was removable by reason of an aggravated felony conviction, our jurisdiction extends only to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D); <em>Silva-Rengifo, </em>473 F.3d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Stewart\u2019s primary argument is that he is entitled to a hearing on an application for Cancellation of Removal because his conviction under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) is not an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stewart, however, did not raise this claim before the IJ or the BIA. His failure to exhaust his administrative remedies forecloses our review of this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Joseph v. Attorney General, </em>465 F.3d 123, 126 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Stewart also argues that his January 2004 letter constituted a motion to reopen, which the BIA should have addressed on the merits. However, as the Appeals Examiner stated, Stewart\u2019s letter did not comply with the procedural requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 1003.2 and 1003.8. It is not error for the BIA to insist on compliance with the regulations governing motions to reopen. <em>See Nocon v. INS, </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1033 (3d Cir.1986) (stating that \u201c[b]ecause the petitioners were not in compliance with the prescribed regulations, the Board was justified in denying the motion\u201d to reconsider); <em>see also Sinistaj v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 516, 519-20 (6th Cir.2004). Although, as Stewart points out, <em>pro se </em>motions should be liberally construed, the BIA is entitled to insist on at least minimal compliance with the governing regulations. Accordingly, there was no legal error in the BIA\u2019s refusal to treat Stewart\u2019s letter as a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Finally, Stewart contends the BIA erred when it dismissed his appeal for failure to file a brief. The applicable regulation states that the BIA \u201cmay summarily dismiss an appeal\u201d when \u201c[t]he party concerned <em>indicates ... </em>that he or she will file a brief,\u201d but fails to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) (emphasis added). Stewart argues that his Notice of Appeal form does not \u201cindicate[]\u201d any intent to file a brief. <em>See id. </em>He points out that the mark in the \u201cYes\u201d box for Question 8 appears to have been made with a pen, while the four other check marks on the Notice of Appeal form appear to have been generated by a computer program. Thus, according to Stewart, the mark in the \u201cYes\u201d box for Question 8 was probably an inadvertent smudge, and the BIA\u2019s contrary conclusion was an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">Although the Attorney General views Stewart\u2019s inadvertent-smudge theory \u201cwith dubiety,\u201d he has \u201cagree[d] to a remand of the matter to the BIA for the limited purpose of addressing the claims set forth in the [Notice of Appeal form] on the merits.\u201d Attorney General Brief 17. In light of this agreement, we will remand the case to the BIA for that limited purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-16\">Based on the foregoing, we will vacate the final order of removal and remand to the BIA for consideration of whether Stewart has perfected a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal of his Pennsylvania convictions. The BIA is under no obligation to consider Stewart\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\">. As it happened, counsel\u2019s prediction was incorrect. Stewart\u2019s current attorney informs us that Stewart\u2019s efforts to pursue a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal \"have, as of yet, been unsuccessful.\" Stewart Brief 14. Stewart, however, continues to pursue a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal in Philadelphia Municipal Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-10\"><em>. </em>Section 1003.l(d)(2)(i)(E) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-15\">A single Board member or panel may summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal in any case in which:....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-16\">(E) The party concerned indicates on [the Notice of Appeal] form that he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing[.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b836-10\">.
