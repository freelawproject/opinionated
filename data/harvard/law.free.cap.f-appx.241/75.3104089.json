On June 4, 2007, we directed Kokoski to show cause as to why he should not be enjoined from filing petitions for writs of mandamus without leave of court or an appeal without a district court order certifying the appeal is not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Because Kokoski has a history of filing frivolous cases, appeals and petitions for writs of mandamus, we will limit his opportunity to file pleadings in this court. Kokoski is enjoined from filing petitions for writs of mandamus without leave of court. In the future, if Kokoski wants to file a petition for a writ of mandamus in this court, he must file a motion for leave in this court, accompanied by the proposed petition. The proposed petition will be reviewed. If the proposed petition is found to be frivolous, no judicial action will be taken and the motion for leave will be deemed denied thirty days after the motion was filed. Otherwise, the petition will be filed. Kokoski is also enjoined from filing a notice of appeal from a district court order without a district court order certifying the appeal is not frivolous. If Kokoski wants to appeal a district court order, he must first file a motion for leave accompanied with the notice of appeal and this opinion in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">After reviewing the record and the district court order, we find the appeal is frivolous for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Kokoski v. Pauer, </em>No. 5:02-cv-01254 (S.D.W.Va. Mar. 29, 2007). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
