For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">Hallett is a federal prisoner incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (\u201cFCI\u201d) in Fairton, New Jersey. In 1993, the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina sentenced Hallett to life imprisonment after he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and \u00a7 846. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence. In 1997, Hallett filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the sentencing court denied. The Fourth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">On December 1, 2006, Hallett filed the current habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District of New Jersey. He alleged three claims: that his conviction was obtained by perjured testimony, that the prosecution knew that the testimony was perjured and failed to hand over evidence of the perjury, and that his attorney was ineffective for failing to file motions for <em>Brady </em>and Jencks Act material. At the crux of all the claims in Hallett\u2019s petition is the assertion that, because his conviction is based upon perjured testimony, he is actually innocent. The district court found that Hallett\u2019s claims do not constitute \u201cnew evidence\u201d and noted that Hallett raised them before in his earlier motion under \u00a7 2255. The court determined that, because the claims pose challenges to his conviction, they would properly be asserted in a \u00a7 2255 motion, and not a petition under \u00a7 2241. Furthermore, the district court acknowledged that \u00a7 2255 does not provide an \u201cinadequate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>ineffective\u201d remedy for relief under the circumstances, such that Hallett should be permitted to proceed under \u00a7 2241. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997). The district court dismissed Hallett\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Summary action is warranted when \u201cno substantial question\u201d is presented by the appeal. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002). After reviewing the record, we conclude that there is no substantial question presented and will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">We agree with the district court that Hallett\u2019s claims fall within the purview of \u00a7 2255. A federal prisoner\u2019s challenge to the legality of his conviction and sentence must be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, except where the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 249. The \u201csafety-valve\u201d of \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow, and we have held that it applies in unusual situations, such as when a prisoner has had no opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that is later deemed not to be a crime by an intervening change in the law. <em>See id.; Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120-21 (3d Cir.2002). That is not the situation here, although it appears that Hallett is attempting to allege that there has been an intervening change in the law. But the case Hallett relies on, <em>House v. Bell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006), dealt with the actual innocence gateway whereby a claim may be entertained by the federal court even if it is procedurally defaulted. That case does not affect Hallett\u2019s situation. <em>House </em>did not change the substantive law as to the elements of the offense for which Hallett was convicted, nor did it amend the legal standard for actual innocence in a way that affects Hallett\u2019s case. The fact remains that Hallett did not present any new, reliable evidence of his innocence. Indeed, the evidence of perjury that he points to \u2014 a witness\u2019 testimony at a trial in Kentucky \u2014 was apparently presented with the claims that he raised in his previous \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">The district court thus properly determined that Hallett could not raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition and that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Hallett\u2019s petition under \u00a7 2255, as it was not the sentencing court. <em>See Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 249. We will summarily affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
