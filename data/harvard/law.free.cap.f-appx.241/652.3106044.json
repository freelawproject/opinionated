Ever-son appeals the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of CCC in her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 retaliation action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ever-son contends she established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, and the district court erred by finding she had failed to do so based on a lack of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">We have recognized that \u00a7 1981 includes a cause of action for retaliation, although the elements of a claim for retaliation under \u00a7 1981 are not settled. <em>See Bass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1120 n. 10 (11th Cir.2001). The parties utilized the Title VII framework for retaliation claims, and we will do the same. \u201cTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must show that: (1) [s]he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) [s]he experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the alleged adverse action.\u201d <em>Hurlbert v. St. Mary\u2019s Health Care Sys., Inc., </em>439 F.3d 1286, 1297 (11th Cir.2006). The district court concluded Everson could not meet the third prong of the prima facie case. After a <em>de novo </em>review, we agree. <em>See Fisher v. State Mut. Ins. Co., </em>290 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2002) (stating we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in favor of the non-moving party).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Everson asserts retaliation based on (1) the termination of her employment in February and March 2005, and (2) CCC\u2019s failure to respond to her internal complaints, or to reinstate her benefits in a timely manner in 2005. Neither CCC\u2019s alleged failure to respond to Everson\u2019s internal complaints or its failure to timely reinstate her benefits constitutes an adverse employment action because these are not the types of actions that would have any \u201cmaterial\u201d affect on her employment. <em>See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Florida, </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001) (holding \u201can employee must show a <em>serious and material </em>change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment ... [,] as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances\u201d in order to establish an adverse employment action) (emphasis in original). Indeed, Everson\u2019s benefits were reinstated for a brief period of time. Thus, the viability of Everson\u2019s action for retaliation depends on whether she can demonstrate a causal connection between the termination of her employment and her filing of a race discrimination lawsuit in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Everson primarily relies on the \u201ctemporal proximity\u201d between her termination and the court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in her race discrimination lawsuit, as evidence of causation. However, this reliance is misplaced as it was the <em>filing </em>of her lawsuit that qualified as a protected activity. <em>See Donnellon v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>794 F.2d 598, 601 (11th Cir.1986) (holding the filing of a discrimination complaint constitutes a \u201cprotected activity\u201d for the purposes of this analysis). The nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>four years that lapsed between the filing of her race discrimination lawsuit and the termination of her employment, without more evidence, fails to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation as a matter of law. <em>See Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (stating the temporal proximity between the employer\u2019s knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action must be \u201cvery close\u201d to be sufficient evidence in itself to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case). While Everson attempts to illustrate causation with alternative evidence, the evidence she presented is insufficient to establish causation. Without additional supporting evidence, the fact her termination occurred nearly four years after her protected activity is fatal to Everson\u2019s claim. <em>See Clark County Sch. Dist., </em>121 S.Ct. at 1511. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to CCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\">. Because the individually named defendants were never served with Everson\u2019s complaint and never filed any documents in the district court or on appeal, and because Everson sued them only in their capacity as CCC employees, they are treated collectively as CCC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-11\">. Everson also argues she is entitled to relief under Title VII. She raises this issue for the first time in her reply brief, however, so we need not consider it. <em>See Bauknight v. Monroe County, Fla., </em>446 F.3d 1327, 1330 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
