Finding no error, we affirm the agency\u2019s determination. We also reject the nursing facility\u2019s contention that the agency\u2019s review process violated the Administrative Procedure Act or due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Federal regulations require that nursing facilities receiving Medicare funds comply with certain safety requirements. If surveyors find a facility has failed to comply, they assess the level of the noncompliance to determine the appropriate penalty. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(h) (2006); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 483.1 et seq. (2006); \u00a7 488.301 (2006). Liberty Commons, a nursing facility in Benson, North Carolina, participates in and receives funds from Medicare, and was surveyed for regulatory compliance on October 23, 2003. The North Carolina State Department of Health and Human Services conducted the annual survey as an agent for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency of the federal department of Health and Human Services (HHS or \u201cthe Secretary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The surveyors found that Liberty Commons had neglected to provide proper care to residents, in violation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13(c) (2006). In particular, one resident of the facility, referred to as Resident # 2, was cared for on October 21, 2003, by a nurse\u2019s assistant wearing latex gloves, even though the resident had a documented allergy to latex of which the nursing facility was aware. The resident then complained of shortness of breath, and was hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">CMS found that the following series of staff errors at the nursing home had led to this noncompliance: (1) the nurse\u2019s assistant was unfamiliar with the resident and his allergy; (2) warning signs about the latex allergy were missing from the resident\u2019s room; (3) the nurse\u2019s assistant did not receive a verbal warning at the beginning of her shift about the allergy; and (4) the nurse\u2019s assistant failed to consult the resident\u2019s record until the end of her shift. Accordingly, CMS found that the noncompliance was at the \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d level, and the Secretary imposed a civil monetary penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">Liberty Commons challenged the CMS decision through the administrative adjudication process provided by HHS. Following a January 12, 2005 hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) upheld the findings of noncompliance and immediate jeopardy, but reduced the fine against the nursing facility. The ALJ found that although Liberty Commons had a plan for preventing this type of violation \u2014 i.e. providing care to patients with known allergies \u2014 it was lax in implementing this plan and had not sufficiently trained its staff, and that the multiple failures to alert the nurse\u2019s assistant constituted \u201cpersuasive proof that [the] problem was systemic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The ALJ further concluded that even if there was not sufficient medical evidence to establish that Resident #2 did have a latex allergy, an \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d designation was still appropriate because of \u201cthe weakness of [Liberty Commons\u2019] system for protecting its residents demonstrated by the series of errors that occurred in providing care to Resident # 2.\u201d It is not disputed that at the time of the incident, Liberty Commons believed Resident #2 did have a latex allergy. The ALJ inferred from the treatment given to Resident # 2 \u201cthat other residents would be jeopardized when placed.in similar circumstances and that there would be a likelihood of serious injury, harm, or death as a consequence\u201d and that \u201c[t]he systemic failure to implement protective measures ... would jeopardize any resident who is dependent on a staff to treat him or her subject to safety precautions.\u201d Several other residents of Liberty Commons had allergies to foods or other substances, so the facility\u2019s \u201csystemic failure\u201d to handle residents\u2019 allergies with appropriate precautions could endanger them, as well as future residents with allergies or special needs. <em>See </em>Respondent\u2019s Br. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Liberty Commons appealed the ALJ decision to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (DAB). The DAB, in a June 12, 2006 decision, held that (1) the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Liberty Commons was not in substantial compliance was supported by substantial evidence, and (2) the immediate jeopardy finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Liberty Commons concedes that it failed to comply with the regulatory requirements. It contends, however, that the Secretary erred in determining that the noncompliance rose to the \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d level. It maintains that because the evidence does not sufficiently establish that Resident #2 actually had a latex allergy or suffered serious harm because of the noncompliance, neither he nor any other particular, identifiable resident was likely to be harmed by its particular violations on October 21, 2003. Liberty Commons also asserts that the DAB applied the wrong burden of proof in its review of the ALJ decision. Br. of Petitioner at 41-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The federal regulation at issue here defines \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d as \u201ca situation in which the provider\u2019s noncompliance with one or more requirements of participation has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a resident.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301. Liberty Commons does not dispute that this provision controls the case; it merely disagrees with how the Secretary has interpreted and applied the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">\u201cWhen the question before the court is whether an agency has properly interpreted and applied its own regulation, the reviewing court must give the agency\u2019s interpretation \u2018substantial deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland General Hosp. v. Thompson, </em>308 F.3d 340, 343 (4th Cir.2002). That said, \u201can interpretation that is inconsistent with the plain language of an unambiguous regulation cannot be upheld simply because the interpretation, standing alone, seems reasonable enough.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347. Thus, we must defer to the Secretary\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the regulation so long as it is not inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation. Moreover, we must defer to the agency\u2019s findings of fact \u201cif supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Liberty Commons argues that the Secretary has misinterpreted and misap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>plied the regulation in question in finding that the facility was in noncompliance at the \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d level. Liberty Commons rests its case \u2014 as it must given the deference owed to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulation \u2014 on its reading of \u201cthe regulation\u2019s plain language,\u201d Br. of Petitioner at 39, which it asserts is \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 22. Liberty Commons reads the \u201cthe plain language\u201d of the regulation to state that an \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d finding \u201crequires a determination of [the noncompliance\u2019s] impact on <em>one or more </em>of the facility\u2019s <em>actual </em>residents.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Reply Br. at 9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">But these are the words of Liberty Commons, not of the regulation. By its terms, the regulation only requires that the nursing home\u2019s noncompliance is likely to cause harm to \u201ca resident.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301 (emphasis added). The word \u201cactual\u201d does not appear in the regulation; the phrase \u201cone or more\u201d does appear in the regulation, but in reference to the nursing home\u2019s noncompliance with \u201cone or more requirements\u201d of the regulatory scheme, not as a modifier of \u201cresident.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Br. of Petitioner at 22; Petitioner\u2019s Reply Br. at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The use of the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d\u2014 and no other modifier \u2014 before \u201cresident\u201d suggests that the regulation does not require that the noncompliance jeopardizes \u201cone or more actual\u201d or identifiable residents. If the Secretary had intended that specific requirement, he would have used that language in writing the rule. Moreover, because no actual harm to a resident is required for an \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d finding, only \u201clikely\u201d harm, the definition as a whole encompasses future harms to an as yet unidentified resident. If, as Liberty Commons insists, the regulation required otherwise, there would be no need to include the word \u201clikely\u201d \u2014 for an actual resident either would or would not have been harmed. For these reasons, we believe the Secretary\u2019s view \u2014 that \u201ca resident\u201d has a broader meaning and does not require establishing harm from a particular, identifiable compliance violation to a particular, identifiable, resident \u2014 is, at the very least, a reasonable interpretation of the regulation\u2019s language, to which we must defer. <em>See Maryland General Hosp., </em>308 F.3d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Accordingly, Liberty Commons cannot prevail. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that the facility\u2019s noncompliance problem was \u201csystemic.\u201d That is, the noncompliance consisted not merely of using latex on a single resident believed to be allergic to latex, but also of failing to follow the necessary plan and procedures to protect residents who have allergies. As the ALJ found, \u201cthe weakness of [Liberty Commons\u2019] system for protecting its residents [is] demonstrated by the series of errors that occurred in providing care to Resident # 2.\u201d For this reason, the ALJ concluded that \u201c[t]he systemic failure to implement protective measures ... would jeopardize any resident who is dependent on a staff to treat him or her subject to safety precautions.\u201d Finding no error, we affirm the Secretary\u2019s determination that the noncompliance met the requirement of \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d under the governing regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Liberty Commons further contends that the burden of proof the Secretary applied during the administrative review process \u201coffendfs]\u201d the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500 et seq. (2000), and due process of law. Br. of Petitioner at 23; 41-50. In particular, Liberty Commons objects that, after the ALJ found it was not in compliance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>DAB placed the burden on it, the petitioner, to show that CMS\u2019s determination that the noncompliance was at the \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d level was clearly erroneous, rather than requiring the Secretary to again establish this during the appeals procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">This argument ignores the relevant regulation, which explicitly sets forth the burden of proof with respect to the level of noncompliance: \u201cCMS\u2019s determination as to the level of noncompliance ... must be upheld unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 498.60 (2006). In light of the clear instructions in this regulation, which the Board unquestionably followed, we construe Liberty\u2019s argument here to be either that (1) HHS lacks statutory authority to have issued this regulation, or (2) the regulation is unconstitutional. Neither is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The APA, on which Liberty relies, only creates default rules for agency adjudications. But Congress, in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1302, 1395hh (2006), empowered HHS to create regulations for its Medicare adjudications, and so the APA provision relied on by Liberty Commons simply does not apply to this case. Moreover, we find no support for the position that the agency appeal procedure violates the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause. The purpose of the statutory and regulatory framework is to guide the distribution of Medicare funds to appropriate facilities \u2014 namely, those that comply with safety regulations. To be sure, Liberty Commons was due some process before being sanctioned and fined for a regulatory violation, <em>see Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). But, it received a full evidentiary hearing before an ALJ, followed by an opportunity to appeal the ALJ\u2019s decision to the DAB. Balancing the Government\u2019s interests in spending Medicare funds appropriately and protecting the safety of nursing home residents, and a nursing home\u2019s interest in the financial and reputational cost of the noncompliance finding, we can only conclude that the process Liberty Commons received was sufficient to reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation. <em>Id. </em>Because Liberty Commons received all the process it was due, its constitutional due process claim must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Secretary is</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
