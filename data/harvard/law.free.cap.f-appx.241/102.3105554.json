We dismiss the appeal for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We are obligated to review our jurisdiction sua sponte in all cases. <em>See Maksymchuk v. Frank, </em>987 F.2d 1072, 1075 (4th Cir.1993). When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The district court\u2019s order denying Cash\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was entered on its docket on June 23, 2005. The district court\u2019s order denying Cash\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was entered on its docket on July 14, 2005. On January 23, 2006, Cash filed a motion in the district court to reopen the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). The district court granted Cash\u2019s motion to reopen and Cash noticed his appeal within fourteen days of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Although the district court granted Cash\u2019s motion to reopen the appeal period, we conclude Cash was not entitled to that relief. The plain language of Rule 4(a)(6) requires a motion to reopen be filed \u201cwithin 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, whichever is earlier.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). Because Cash\u2019s motion to reopen was filed more than 180 days after the district court\u2019s orders were entered, the district court lacked authority to reopen the appeal period. <em>See Hensley v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>651 F.2d 226, 228 (4th Cir.1981) (noting expiration of the time limits in Rule 4 deprives the court of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Because Cash\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
