Subsequently, the district court entered an order on February 16, 2007, in which it granted in forma pauperis status but did not require Pfeffer to pay a filing fee to prosecute his appeal. We grant Pfeffer in forma pauperis status in his underlying appeal and vacate the district court\u2019s January 5, 2007 order. We remand with instructions that any fee collected pursuant to the January 5, 2007 order be refunded to Pfeffer. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-22\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
