Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, the judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">In October 2002, Paul Revere, the insurer and administrator of O\u2019Rear\u2019s LTD plan, approved his claim for LTD benefits. Under the plan, for the first 24 months of disability (first phase), recovery of benefits required proof that he was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d from <em>his own </em>occupation. After 24 months of disability (second phase), however, recovery of benefits required proof that he was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d from <em>any </em>occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">As the second phase approached, Paul Revere reviewed O\u2019Rear\u2019s medical records and, based on that review, conducted a vocational assessment, which identified three occupations that matched his physical abilities and experience. Accordingly, having determined O\u2019Neal was not \u201ctotally disabled\u201d from <em>any </em>occupation, Paul Revere terminated his benefits at the conclusion of the first phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">O\u2019Rear filed this action, claiming Paul Revere\u2019s benefits-denial was an abuse of discretion. As noted, Paul Revere\u2019s summary-judgment motion, which O\u2019Rear did <em>not </em>oppose, was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>E.g., Meditrust Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Sterling Chems., Inc., </em>168 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1999). As O\u2019Rear concedes, Paul Revere\u2019s benefits denial is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 214 (\u201cDeciding the medical progress of a patient through analysis of medical reports and records is similar to the factual determinations we have reviewed for abuse of discretion in other ERISA cases.\u201d); <em>Sweatman v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>39 F.3d 594, 597-99 (5th Cir.1994). Such review is limited to the administrative record, and seeks to determine \u201conly whether the \u2018record adequately supports the administrator\u2019s decision\u2019\u201d. <em>Gooden v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>250 F.3d 329, 333 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Vega v. Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 287, 298 (5th Cir.1999) (en banc)). Under such review, an administrator abuses its discretion if it denies a claim \u201c[w]ithout some concrete evidence in the administrative record\u201d. <em>Vega, </em>188 F.3d at 302. Moreover, such review \u201cneed only assure that the administrator\u2019s decision fall somewhere on a continuum of reasonableness\u2014 even if on the low end\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">Less deference is given under the abuse-of-discretion standard where an administrator is self-interested. <em>Id. </em>at 296-97. Here, however, the only evidence of a conflict of interest is the insurer\u2019s position as both the insurer and the administrator. Accordingly, to the extent such a conflict affects the amount of discretion afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Paul Revere\u2019s decision, we conduct our review \u201cwith only a modicum less deference than we otherwise would\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In stating the relevant facts, both Paul Revere\u2019s <em>unopposed </em>summary-judgment motion and the district court\u2019s memorandum ruling cite to the administrative record. These facts, which are <em>not </em>contested by O\u2019Rear, demonstrate that Paul Revere\u2019s benefits denial was supported by adequate evidence. The record shows that Paul Revere based its benefits-denial on, <em>inter alia, </em>an evaluation of O\u2019Rear\u2019s medical records, which included O\u2019Rear\u2019s own physician\u2019s finding O\u2019Rear capable of: standing for 30 minutes at a time for up to two hours per day; sitting for one hour at a time for up to a \u201cvarying\u201d amount of time per day; and driving for one hour at a time for up to four hours per day. Based on those medical records, Paul Revere\u2019s vocational assessment identified three occupations that matched O\u2019Rear\u2019s physical abilities and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Subsequent to Paul Revere\u2019s notifying O\u2019Rear of its benefits-denial decision, O\u2019Neal\u2019s physician found that O\u2019Rear was, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201ctotally disabled\u201d and \u201cnot able to work\u201d; and limited to four hours of sedentary activity per day. The record shows Paul Revere rejected these findings, as they were <em>not </em>supported by objective medical evidence such as diagnostics or office notes. O\u2019Rear was explicitly advised by Paul Revere that, in appealing its benefits denial, he could submit such evidence. He did <em>not </em>do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Accordingly, the post-notification findings by O\u2019Rear\u2019s physician do <em>not </em>undermine Paul Revere\u2019s benefits denial. <em>See Gooden, </em>250 F.3d at 333-34 (letter from treating physician stating that the insured was disabled did <em>not </em>undermine administrator\u2019s benefits-denial because \u201cit was written after [the insured] learned he was being terminated, and was unaccompanied by medical evidence indicating that [the insured]\u2019s condition changed since the last time [the physician] had seen [the insured]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
