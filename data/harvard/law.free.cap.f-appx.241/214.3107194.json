Her sentence is within the applicable advisory sentencing guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">Lerma-Castillo does not challenge the guideline range that the district court considered in determining her sentence. She instead argues that the presumption of reasonableness afforded within-Guidelines sentences under <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), and its progeny, violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Id. </em>at 7-13. This argument is confuted by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rita v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), which held that a \u201ccourt of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-22\">Lerma-Castillo, who was 62-years-old when sentenced, alternatively argues that her sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to properly account for her age and lack of criminal history. This court has jurisdiction to \u201cdetermine whether the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 06-11834 (U.S. May 21, 2007). Lerma-Castillo\u2019s criminal history category score under the Sentencing Guidelines reflected her lack of criminal history. The district court expressly stated that it had considered, inter alia, Lerma-Castillo\u2019s particular circumstances and the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court was not required to provide a more explicit state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ment of its \u00a7 3558(a) rationale. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468-69; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Lerma-Castillo\u2019s sentence is reasonable, <em>see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 262-65, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 518-19, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
