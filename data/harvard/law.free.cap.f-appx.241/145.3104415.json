He was sentenced to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>On appeal, Dudley\u2019s counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in denying Dudley an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Dudley has filed a pro se supplemental brief reasserting the issue raised by counsel and alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for filing an <em>Anders </em>brief. After a thorough review of the record and finding no reversible error, we affirm Dudley\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Counsel claims that the district court erred in denying Dudley an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility based on his drug use while on bond pending sentencing. We review the district court\u2019s determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>934 F.2d 553, 557 (4th Cir.1991). Dudley violated the terms of his pretrial release on several occasions while on bond awaiting sentencing, including testing positive for cocaine, which eventually led to revocation of his pretrial release. The continued use of drugs after conviction may be a basis for denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Kidd, </em>12 F.3d 30, 34 (4th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>970 F.2d 1336, 1339 (4th Cir.1992). We find the district court did not clearly err in finding Dudley\u2019s continued criminal conduct was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Dudley argues in his pro se supplemental brief that appellate counsel was ineffective for filing an <em>Anders </em>brief. An allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel should not proceed on direct appeal unless it appears conclusively from the record that counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). We find no support that such a claim \u201cappears conclusively from the record.\u201d Dudley fails to identify any issues that appellate counsel should have raised on appeal. Instead, he merely states that counsel erred in failing to present any claims of error on appeal. However, counsel did raise a potential claim of error on appeal, but properly concluded that the claim was without merit. Because our review of the record leads us to conclude that deficient performance is not conclusively shown, Dudley\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Therefore, finding no error, we affirm Dudley\u2019s conviction and sentence. We also deny Dudley\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for a trial transcript. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
