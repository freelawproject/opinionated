The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure from the thirty-two-year sentence and sentenced Mack to twenty-four years in prison. Mack timely appealed. Mack\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the adequacy of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing and the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure. Mack was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not file one.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea hearing, but does not specify any deficiencies in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 inquiries. Because Mack did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard). Our careful review of the record convinces us that the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Mack\u2019s guilty plea and ensured that Mack entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily and that the plea was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Counsel also questions the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure. This court does not have \u201cjurisdiction to review the <em>extent </em>of the district court\u2019s downward departure, except in instances in which the departure decision resulted in a sentence imposed in violation of the law or resulted from an incorrect application of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995). The court considered the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) and explained its reasons for imposing its sentence. We do not find under these circumstances that Mack\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Mack\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
