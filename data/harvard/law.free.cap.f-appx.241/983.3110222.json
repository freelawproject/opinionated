We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>reasons stated by the district court. <em>Skipper v. Cobb-Vantress, Inc., </em>No. 3:05-cv-00076, 2007 WL 922900 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 26 &amp; 27, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-13\"> In his informal brief, Skipper alleged that defense counsel had an ex parte meeting with the district court judge, and that the district court failed to review the evidence prior to granting summary judgment. However, Skipper has provided no evidence to support these claims and has failed to identify any materials that were not reviewed by the district court. Accordingly, we find Skipper\u2019s claims to be meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
