Himes, as such agent, rented the property to Frank Holmes. Holmes took possession under his lease and for a time paid the rent as agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Appellant having in the meantime purchased the property at sheriff\u2019s sale after the lapse of the statutory time for redemption, obtained a sheriff\u2019s deed to the same, served notice upon Himes of its title, and demanded payment of rent from the tenant. In pursuance to this demand the rent was paid to appellant for some months, apparently with the acquiescence of Himes, but as soon as his principal was notified of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>this she protested and notified her agent to this effect, and that there would be a suit between her and The Merchants\u2019 State Bank \u201c to settle this matter as to the ownership and title of this property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">As we have stated, Holmes was appellee\u2019s tenant and put \u2022 in possession by her agent. His possession was the possession of plaintiff. She never consented to the rent being paid to appellant, or acknowledged in any way the title it set up to the property. The district court upon issues joined found for the plaintiff and quieted the title in her, no evidence being offered to show that the title had ever passed from her. Under these circumstances her possession of the property is sufficiently shown to enable her to maintain this action. Civil Code, sec. 255. The judgment is according^ affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
