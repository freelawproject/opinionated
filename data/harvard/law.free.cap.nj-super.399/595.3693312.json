REISNER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Petitioner Lenape Regional High School District Board of Education (School Board or petitioner) appeals from an April 4, 2007 decision of the State Board of Education (agency or State Board), affirming a decision of the Commissioner of Education dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal from a final investigation decision of the Office of Special Education Programs. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The appeal before us presents one narrow issue: whether a school district may appeal to the Commissioner of Education from an investigation decision of the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP). The two sub-issues are whether the agency has correctly construed the Department of Education\u2019s regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(c), as giving OSEP authority to issue final decisions in these cases, and if so, whether the agency may lawfully delegate to OSEP the final decision-making authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">The complicated procedural history of this case is set forth in detail in the June 27, 2006 initial decision of Administrative Law Judge Jeffrey Masin, and need not be repeated here. In brief, the parents of two students filed complaints against the School Board with OSEP, alleging violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq. </em>OSEP resolved the complaints in the students\u2019 favor. The School Board sought to appeal the OSEP decisions to the Commissioner, who eventually transmitted the issue of her jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for an initial decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Masin concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>that under the Department\u2019s regulations, OSEP was authorized to render a final decision on an IDEA complaint investigation, and that an administrative appeal to the Commissioner was not available. The Commissioner adopted the initial decision and the State Board affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The School Board\u2019s appellate brief does not identify any material disputes of fact requiring an evidentiary hearing, as to any of the OSEP complaint investigations. In its statement of facts, the School Board takes issue with the thoroughness of OSEP\u2019s investigations and with the conclusions OSEP drew from the investigations, but none of those contentions are developed in the legal argument section of its brief. Therefore, in deciding this appeal we will only address the jurisdictional issue and not the merits of OSEP\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We begin by briefly reviewing the purpose of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. <em>As </em>explained in <em>Beth V. v. Carroll, 87 F.3d </em>80, 82 (3rd Cir.1996),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">IDEA, originally enacted in 1970 as the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), Pub.L. No. 91-230, \u00a7\u00a7 601-662, 84 Stat. 175, confers on disabled children a substantive right to a \u201cfree appropriate public education.\u201d 20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1400(c); that free appropriate education \u201cconsists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the [disabled] child, supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child \u2018to benefit\u2019 from the instruction.\u201d Under IDEA, a disabled student is entitled to an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), a specially tailored educational program detailing the student\u2019s present abilities, educational goals, and specific services designed to achieve those goals within a stated timeframe. <em>See </em>20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1401(a)(20).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">IDEA places on the states the primary responsibility for satisfying the goals of the statute. IDEA, described by several courts as a model of \u201ccooperative federalism,\u201d authorizes federal funding for states providing the special education that the statute requires, but funding is contingent on state compliance with its array of substantive and procedural requirements, 20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1412.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 82 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\"><em>See also In re Adoption of Amendments to N.J.A.C. 6:28-2.10, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>389, 394, 702 A.2d 838 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>In order to ensure the children\u2019s right to the educational benefits required by IDEA, the statute gives their parents two alternative means of seeking redress for violations of the statute. They can request a due process hearing, which entails a full-fledged adjudicatory proceeding, or they can file an administrative complaint with the designated state education agency, which must investigate and issue a decision within sixty days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.152.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[T]he current [federal] regulations, like the preceding regulations, require the state agency to have procedures for the receipt and resolution of such complaints and impose a time limit (60 days <em>since </em>1980) for the state to carry <em>out </em>\u201can independent on-site investigation,\u201d if necessary, with an extension beyond the 60 calendar days, \u201conly if exceptional circumstances exist with respect to a particular complaint.\u201d <em>See, e.g\u201e </em>300 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 330.661 (1995); 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 100b.780-.781 (1980). The current regulations not only require the state educational agency to conduct any necessary investigation of a complaint, but also require that the state\u2019s complaint resolution procedures permit complainants to submit additional information, and that the state educational agency review all relevant information and issue a written decision addressing all allegations. 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.661 (1995). The state educational agency must also adopt, where necessary, \u201cprocedures for effective implementation\u201d of its final decisions, including \u201ccorrective actions to achieve compliance.\u201d \u00a7 300.661(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\"><em>[Beth V. v.

As required by the federal IDEA regulations, 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.152, OSEP must investigate and decide those complaints within sixty days. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(c) and (e). The issue raised here is whether, once OSEP issues a decision, a school district may appeal that decision to the Commissioner of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">There is no dispute that, in general, the Commissioner has broad authority to hear and decide disputes arising under the school laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">The commissioner shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine, without cost to the parties, all controversies and disputes arising under the school laws, excepting those governing higher education, or under the rules of the state board or of the commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\"><em>[N.J.S. </em>A 18A:6-9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\"><em>See also N.J A.C. </em>6A:2-1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">The School Board bases its claim on this statutory provision, as well as a section of the agency\u2019s IDEA regulations pertaining to appeals from monitoring reports and findings of noncompliance with compliance plans. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.1(h).

The Office of Special Education Programs will determine the appropriate steps to consider the claim of error after receipt of the letter. <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(c)(l).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The regulation does not provide for a right of further administrative appeal beyond OSEP. However, it does permit a party to file a request to OSEP, within fifteen days of the original decision, for reconsideration of its decision. <em>N.J. A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">In 2005, the State Board of Education proposed amendments to <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:14-9.2(c), which would have included a provision that \u201cif either party does not agree with the decision in [OSEP\u2019s] final report, the party may file an appeal pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:3 [governing appeals to the Commissioner].\u201d 37 <em>N.J.R. </em>4629(a). However, the proposed amendment was not adopted. Instead, in 2006, the State Board adopted the rule in its current form, which does not provide for a right of appeal to the Commissioner pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:3, and instead provides only for a right to file a motion with OSEP for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The history of the current rule indicates that the agency redrafted the previously proposed rules in 2006. <em>See </em>38 <em>N.J.R. </em>2253(a). A comment to the 2006 proposal explained that \u201ca provision is added [to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(c)] allowing parties, within 15 days of issuance of the final report, to allege an error material to the determination in the report, and providing that appropriate steps will be taken upon receipt of any such allegations submitted in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This version of the rule was adopted effective September 5, 2006. <em>See </em>38 <em>N.J.R. </em>3530(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We infer from the insertion of the appeal provision in the 2005 rule proposal that the State Board did not construe the regulations as already providing for such an appeal. We also infer that in deleting the appeal provision from the version of the rules it adopted, the Board signaled its intent that the rules should not confer a right of appeal to the Commissioner. In concurring with the decisions of the Commissioner and the State Board, we are also mindful of our obligation to defer to a State agency\u2019s reasonable construction of a statute it is charged with enforcing and to the agency\u2019s interpretations of its own regulations. <em>See Matturri v. Bd. of Trs. of the Judicial Ret. Sys., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>368, 381, 802 A.2d 496 (2002); <em>Essex County Bd. of Tax. v. Twp. of Caldwell, </em>21 <em>N.J.Tax </em>188, 197 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>426, 824 A.2d 156 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">We next turn to the School Board\u2019s contention that precluding review by the Commissioner will lead to an inadequate record for our review of OSEP\u2019s decisions. We conclude this issue is not ripe for our consideration, because the School Board\u2019s brief does not properly present a challenge to OSEP\u2019s decisions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>does not indicate how OSEP\u2019S investigation record would be inadequate for our review in this case. In fact, during the OAL proceedings the Board moved for summary disposition in the cases involving A.M.\u2019s child, because there were no material facts in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Consequently, this appeal does not properly place before us the question of how OSEP creates a record, and in particular, whether under any circumstances OSEP may hold an evidentiary hearing in the event a complaint investigation reveals material disputes of fact concerning whether a school district has violated IDEA. However, we do note that the last sentence of the reconsideration provision in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(e) appears to leave to OSEP\u2019s discretion the possibility of holding an evidentiary hearing, if a reconsideration request highlights the existence of material factual disputes that cannot otherwise be resolved. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(c)(1) (\u201cThe Office of Special Education Programs will determine the appropriate steps to consider the claim of error after receipt of the letter.\u201d). We need not decide this issue here since no material factual disputes were identified and no hearing was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Finally, we address an issue inferentially raised by this appeal, namely, whether the State Board may lawfully delegate final decision-making authority to OSEP, despite the Commissioner\u2019s general statutory authority to hear and decide disputes arising under the school laws, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-9. <em>See R.H. Macy &amp; Co. v. Dir., Div. of Tax., </em>77 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 174-75, 185 A.2d 682 (App.Div.1962), <em>aff'd, o.b., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>3,194 A.2d 457 (1963) (discussing delegation of decision-making authority). We conclude that such delegation is consistent with IDEA, which requires expeditious decisions on complaints. It is also consistent with the State\u2019s adoption of legislation implementing IDEA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-1 to - 46, and with the State Board\u2019s statutory authority to adopt regulations necessary to implement the school laws. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:4-15. Adding an extra layer of review by the Commissioner would impede the agency\u2019s ability to decide complaints in sixty</p>\n<p id=\"AWWd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>days as IDEA requires, and thus would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent to create a statutory scheme compliant with IDEA. <em>See Lascari, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 34, 560 A.2d 1180; <em>Adoption of Amendments to N.J.A.C. 6:28-2.10, supra, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 394-95, 702 A.2d 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Moreover, authorizing OSEP to issue the final decision is consistent with the overall scheme of resolving individual complaints under IDEA. Pursuant to IDEA, 20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1415(g) and (i), even when a parent or school district receives a due process hearing, as opposed to an investigation decision from OSEP, the Commissioner does not issue the final administrative decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The due process hearing request is filed with OSEP, which transmits the matter to the Office of Administrative Law for hearing. The decision of the ALJ in those cases is the final decision at the administrative level and cannot be appealed to the Commissioner. <em>See N.J.A.C. 6A</em>:14-2.7(l) Rather, a party \u201caggrieved\u201d by the ALJ\u2019s decision may file a civil action in the Law Division of Superior Court or in the United States District Court. <em>See </em>20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(2); <em>Hasbrouck Heights Bd. of Educ. v.

The intervenor contends that a school district's right to a due process hearing is limited. This case does not require us to decide the issue. However, we suggest that the State Board revise its regulations to address the scope of a school district's right to request a due process hearing, whether either party may request a due process hearing while OSEP <em>is </em>conducting its investigation, and whether OSEP's final investigation decision on an issue precludes one or both parties from later requesting a due process hearing on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\"> The relevant federal regulations were previously codified at 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.661.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> The Federal IDEA regulations also specifically require that the State Education Agency designate an impartial hearing officer to preside over due process hearings, 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.511(b), that the hearing officer issue the final decision at the administrative level, 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.514(a), and that a party aggrieved by the final decision may file a civil action in State or Federal court. 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.516(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\"> We need not decide here whether a party seeking review of a final OSEP decision should proceed first in this court or in the Law Division. <em>See Hasbrouck Heights Bd. of Educ. v. W.J., supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 11, 816 A.2d 1056. The intervenor\u2019s contention that the School Board lacks standing to challenge OSEP\u2019s decision at all is without sufficient merit to warrant discussion here. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E). We reject this argument for the reasons stated by the Commissioner in her October 16, 2006 decision, which the State Board affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
