For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">On December 12, 2004, N.E. was hospitalized at Monmouth Medical Center after suffering a serious hemorrhage. He was transported to the HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital on December 31, 2004, and on February 28, 2005, he was transferred to the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center, where he remained until his death on December 28, 2006. On May 27, 2005, N.E.\u2019s spouse, D.E., filed an application on N.E.\u2019s behalf with the Somerset County Board of Social Services (Board) seeking Medicaid Only benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">As of May 1, 2005, N.E. and D.E. had combined countable resources in the amount of $206,734.55, which included an individual retirement account (IRA) in N.E.\u2019s name with a balance of $196,857.10. Pursuant to a State regulation then in effect, D.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>was permitted to retain $92,760 of the couple\u2019s countable resources as her \u201ccommunity spouse resource allowance\u201d or CSRA. This left N.E. with available resources in the amount of $113,974.55. The Board issued a determination dated August 12, 2005, denying the application because an institutionalized spouse is only eligible for Medicaid Only benefits if his \u201cremaining resources are less than or equal to $2,000[.]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">N.E. filed a request for a fair hearing pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-8.4(a), and challenged the Board\u2019s determination. The matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Law for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). In that proceeding, N.E. argued that all of his remaining resources should be transferred to D.E. to generate sufficient income to meet the deficit in her \u201cminimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u201d or MMMNA, thereby making N.E. Medicaid-eligible as of May 1, 2005. In response, the Board asserted, among other things, that the transfer of N.E.\u2019s remaining resources was not permitted under the State\u2019s regulations because N.E.\u2019s income had to be applied first to the deficit in D.E.\u2019s MMMNA and, furthermore, N.E. had been receiving social security disability payments since June 2005 that were sufficient to address the shortfall in D.E.\u2019s MMMNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The ALJ issued an initial decision dated August 17, 2006. The ALJ found that the State\u2019s regulations require that an applicant\u2019s eligibility be determined based upon the resources available to the institutionalized spouse as of \u201cthe first moment of the first day of the month\u201d in which the application is submitted. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8(a)(2). The ALJ stated that, under the regulations, the agency \u201ctakes a snapshot of the couple\u2019s finances\u201d as of that date. The ALJ found that \u201c[s]inee [N.E.\u2019s] [s]ocial [security benefits were not awarded until June 2005, they have no relevance to whether [N.E.] was resource eligible on May 1, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The ALJ further found that all of N.E.\u2019s available resources were required to generate sufficient income to meet the shortfall in D.E.\u2019s MMMNA. The ALJ therefore determined that D.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>was \u201centitled to [N.E.\u2019s] remaining resource balances so that [D.E.] and her family may be provided for under the current regulations.\u201d For these reasons, the ALJ concluded that N.E. did not have any excess resources as of May 1, 2005, and consequently he was eligible for Medicaid benefits on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The Board filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s initial decision with the Director, who issued a final decision dated November 15, 2006, in which she concluded that the ALJ erred by finding N.E. Medicaid-eligible. The Director noted that, under the State\u2019s Medicaid regulations, N.E.\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid benefits must be based on the amount of his countable resources that remained after the deduction of D.E.\u2019s CSRA, and that determination had to be made based on the couple\u2019s resources as of May 1, 2005. On that date, after deduction of the amount prescribed for D.E.\u2019s CSRA, N.E. had resources that exceeded the maximum permitted. The Director further noted that in June of 2005, N.E. began to receive social security disability benefits. She concluded that the ALJ erred by \u201creformulating [the] CSRA\u201d as of May 1, 2005 and granting D.E. \u201ca larger share of [the couple\u2019s] resources\u201d without taking into account N.E.\u2019s disability payments that were sufficient \u201cto make up the shortfall\u201d in D.E.\u2019s MMMNA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">We begin our consideration of the appeal with a review of the pertinent statutes and regulations that govern eligibility for Medicaid Only benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">\u201cMedicaid was created to provide medical assistance to the poor at the expense of the public.\u201d <em>Mistrick v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>158, 165, 712 A.2d 188 (1998) (citing <em>Atkins v. Rivera, </em>477 <em>U.S. 154, 156, 106 S.Ct. </em>2456, 2458, 91 L.Ed.2d 131, 137 (1986)). Medicaid is an \u201coptional cooperative program in which \u2018[t]he Federal Government shares the costs ... with States that elect to participate in the program.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165-66, 712 A.2d 188 (quoting <em>Atkins, supra, 477 U.S. </em>at 156-57, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>at 2458, 91 L.Ed.2d at 137). Participating states \u201care required to comply with Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and the regulations adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 712 A.2d 188 (citing <em>Atkins, supra, 477 U.S. </em>at 157, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2458, 91 L.Ed.2d at 137). New Jersey has elected to participate in the program by enacting the Medical Assistance and Health Services Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 to -19.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">States that participate in the program are required to provide medical assistance to the \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d who are persons eligible to receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). <em>Id. </em>at 166, 712 A.2d 188. Participating states also may elect to provide benefits to persons who are \u201cmedically needy.\u201d These are individuals \u201cwho have income and resources that are insufficient to pay their medical expenses, but are too high to qualify them for AFDC or SSI, and who otherwise meet the nonfinancial eligibility requirements for those programs.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>New Jersey provides Medicaid benefits to the \u201cmedically needy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 712 A.2d 188 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-3i(8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In addition, states that participate in the Medicaid program have the option to provide benefits to any \u201creasonable categories\u201d of persons who do not qualify as \u201ccategorically needy\u201d or \u201cmedically needy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 712 A.2d 188 (citing 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)). One such category includes persons who are in medical institutions for at least thirty consecutive days and meet certain resource and income requirements. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">New Jersey provides benefits to these individuals under its Medicaid Only program. <em>Ibid. </em>Medicaid benefits are available when a married individual seeks services at a nursing facility. In order to qualify for Medicaid, the couple must spend down their available resources on the cost of care and other expenses. However, the couple is permitted to reserve a specified amount of their resources and income for the needs of the community spouse. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-360, 102 Stat. 683 (1988) (MCCA), to ensure that the community spouse has sufficient income and resources when his or her spouse is institutionalized. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 712 A.2d 188. Prior to the enactment of the MCCA, \u201cwhen a married person became institutionalized, all of the couple\u2019s jointly-held assets were deemed available to the institutionalized spouse and were required to be spent down to the SSI eligibility limits before the institutionalized spouse would be eligible for Medicaid.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Congress included the \u201cspousal impoverishment\u201d provisions in the MCCA to provide \u201cspecial treatment\u201d for institutionalized individuals and their spouses. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 712 A.2d 188 (citing 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These provisions were intended \u201cto end the pauperization of the community spouse by allowing that spouse to protect a sufficient, but not excessive, amount of income and resources to meet his or her own needs while the institutionalized spouse was in a nursing home at Medicaid expense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The MCCA provides that when a married individual seeks Medicaid benefits to pay for the cost of care in a nursing home, that person\u2019s eligibility for benefits is determined based on the couple\u2019s resources \u201cas of the beginning of the first continuous period of institutionalization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 712 A.2d 188 (citing 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r\u20145(c)(1)(A)). The State\u2019s Medicaid Only regulations accordingly provide that in determining Medicaid eligibility, the amount of couple\u2019s countable resources is determined \u201cas of the first moment of the first day of the month of the current period of institutionalization[.]\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.8(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Under the MCCA, the community spouse is permitted to retain a share of the couple\u2019s combined countable resources, which is the \u201ccommunity spouse resource allowance\u201d or CSRA. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(f)(2). The maximum amount of the CSRA is set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8(a)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only resources that are considered in determining the Medicaid eligibility of the institutionalized spouse are those that exceed the CSRA. <em>Mistrick, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 712 A.2d 188 (citing 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2)(B) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8). Those resources are deemed to be available to the institutionalized spouse, and he or she will only be eligible for Medicaid benefits if they are less than or equal to $2,000. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In addition to allocating the couple\u2019s resources between the institutionalized spouse and the community spouse, the \u201cspousal impoverishment\u201d provisions of the MCCA govern the allocation of the couple\u2019s income. In general, the income of the community spouse is not considered available to the institutional spouse. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(b)(l). Furthermore,, income paid solely in the name of one spouse is not available to the other spouse. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">However, the MCCA provides that the community spouse is entitled to a minimum monthly allowance of income for her maintenance needs, an amount that is referred to as the MMMNA. 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(3). The MCCA further provides that if the community spouse\u2019s income is less than the MMMNA, the amount of the shortfall is deducted from the income of the institutionalized spouse. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(l)(B). The deduction is called the \u201ccommunity spouse monthly income allowance\u201d or CSMIA. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The MCCA additionally provides for a \u201cfair hearing\u201d at which the couple can contest the various components of a state\u2019s eligibility determination. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e). At the hearing, the couple may seek an increase in the CSRA. The MCCA states in pertinent part that, \u201c[i]f either ... spouse establishes that the [CSRA] (in relation to the amount of income generated by such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>allowance) is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the [MMMNA], there shall be substituted, for the [CSRA] under subsection (f)(2) an amount adequate to provide [the MMMNA].\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In determining whether to increase the CSRA pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(C), the participating states may employ either the \u201cincome-first\u201d or the \u201cresources-first\u201d methodology. <em>Wisconsin Dep\u2019t. of Health v. Blumer, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>473, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>962, 151 L.Ed.2d 935 (2002). Under the \u201cincome-first\u201d approach, the monthly income of the institutional spouse is transferred to make up any shortfall in the community spouse\u2019s MMMNA before any of the institutional spouse\u2019s countable resources may be reallocated to the community spouse. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 969, 151 L.Ed.2d at 946. On the other hand, the \u201cresources-first\u201d approach allows the transfer of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s resources to the community spouse before the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income. <em>Id. </em>at 484,122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 969,151 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>at 946-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">New Jersey had adopted the \u201cincome-first\u201d approach. <em>Cleary v. Waldman, </em>167 <em>F.3d </em>801, 806 (3d Cir.1999). The State\u2019s regulations therefore provide that in a fair hearing requested under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-8.4, either spouse may seek the reallocation of the couple\u2019s resources if it is shown that \u201cthe income generated by the community spouse\u2019s share of the couple\u2019s resources is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income (together with the community spouse maintenance deduction) to the maximum authorized level[.]\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-5.7(d). Because the \u201ccommunity spouse maintenance deduction\u201d includes income transferred from the institutionalized spouse, the regulation requires that the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income be transferred to the community spouse before any of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s remaining resources may be allocated to the community spouse. <em>Cleary, supra, </em>167 <em>F.3d </em>at 806-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">We turn to the specific contentions raised in this appeal. The parties stipulated that D.E.\u2019s standard MMMNA was $1,562. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>From that amount, the ALJ deducted $443.55, which was the amount that D.E\u2019s gross monthly income exceeded her so-called \u201cExcess Shelter Allowance,\u201d in accordance with <em>N.JAC. </em>10:71\u2014 5.7(c). The ALJ then added $922, which represented a maintenance allowance for the couple\u2019s two children who are under twenty-one years of age, as permitted by <em>N.JAC. </em>10:71-5.7(g). The ALJ also added the income that had been earned as interest on N.E.\u2019s IRA. The ALJ thus found that there was a deficit in D.E.\u2019s MMMNA in the amount of $1,837.03. The Director did not make a contrary finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Appellant contends, however, that D.E.\u2019s MMMNA shortfall was $2,040.25. Essentially, the difference is the amount of the income earned on N.E.\u2019s IRA. The ALJ found that the income from the IRA must be credited to D.E., thereby reducing the amount of her MMMNA shortfall. We are convinced that this treatment of the IRA income is entirely consistent with <em>N.JAC. </em>10:71-5.7(c). The record shows that the IRA income was N.E.\u2019s income. Under the regulation, that income had to be allocated to D.E., and it reduced the amount of her MMMNA shortfall to $1,837.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Appellant next argues that D.E. was entitled to the reallocation of all of N.E.\u2019s remaining resources in order to produce sufficient income to make up the deficit in her MMMNA. Appellant contends that the Director erred by first applying N.E.\u2019s monthly social security disability benefits of $1,990 to D.E.\u2019s MMMNA deficit because N.E. was not receiving those payments on May 1, 2005, the date as of which the couple\u2019s resources were allocated and N.E.\u2019s Medicaid eligibility was determined.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>In our view, the Director correctly rejected these arguments. The Director properly determined that appellant\u2019s contentions are inconsistent with the \u201cincome-first\u201d approach that New Jersey had adopted for its Medicaid Only program. As we explained previously, the State\u2019s regulations provide that, if there is a shortfall in the community spouse\u2019s MMMNA, the shortfall must be addressed with the income of the institutionalized spouse before any of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s remaining resources may be allocated to the community spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Furthermore, the Director correctly found that the income subject to transfer from the institutionalized spouse is not limited to income that the institutionalized spouse was earning as of the date when the couple\u2019s resources are allocated for purposes of determining whether the institutionalized spouse is eligible for Medicaid. Rather, New Jersey\u2019s regulations provide that the community spouse\u2019s MMMNA deficit must be made up not only with transfers of income that the institutionalized spouse is earning on that date, but also with any income that the institutionalized spouse is reasonably expected to earn thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The record shows that N.E. began receiving social security benefits in June 2005, and it was clear that N.E. would continue to receive those benefits. Therefore, N.E.\u2019s social security benefits had to be applied to D.E.\u2019s MMMNA deficit <em>before </em>any of N.E.\u2019s remaining resources could be allocated to D.E. to meet the shortfall in her MMMNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The Director\u2019s determination on this issue is squarely in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blumer. </em>There, the Court explained that in a fair hearing under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(C), either spouse may seek the transfer of additional resources from the institutionalized spouse in order to provide sufficient income for the maintenance needs of the community spouse. <em>Blumer, supra, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>at 483, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 969, 151 L.Ed.2d at 946. However, in a state that employs the \u201cincome first\u201d approach, the income of the institutionalized spouse first must be transferred to the community spouse before the CSRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>may be increased by a transfer of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s resources. This includes the income that the institutionalized spouse is earning at the time of the fair hearing as well as the \u201cpotential posteligibility income transfer\u201d from that spouse. <em>Id. </em>at 484,122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 969,151 L.Ed.2d at 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The Court in <em>Blumer </em>noted that although the fair hearing is conducted prior to Medicaid eligibility, the purpose of that proceeding \u201cis to anticipate the <em>posteligibility </em>financial situation of the couple. The procedure seeks to project what the community spouse\u2019s income <em>will be </em>when the institutionalized spouse becomes eligible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 973, 151 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 951. The Court emphasized that in a fair hearing, \u201c[t]he hearing officer must measure that projected income against the MMMNA, a standard that, like the CSMIA, is operative only posteligibility.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Therefore, the Director correctly concluded that under the \u201cincome-first\u201d approach, before any of N.E.\u2019s share of the couple\u2019s countable resources could be allocated to D.E. to meet the shortfall in her MMMNA, N.E.\u2019s social security benefits had to be applied to that deficit. Moreover, because N.E.\u2019s monthly social security disability benefits were sufficient to meet the MMMNA deficit, there was no basis for increasing D.E.\u2019s share of the couple\u2019s countable resources beyond the limits established by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71 \u2014 4.8(a)(1). Accordingly, the Director correctly found that N.E. was not eligible for Medicaid as of May 1, 2005. On that date, N.E. had resources of more than $113,000, and that exceeded the maximum amount permitted by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> Although certain provisions of the MCCA were repealeci by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989, Pub.L.
