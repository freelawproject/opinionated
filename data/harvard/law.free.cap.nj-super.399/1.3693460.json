The matter originally came before the court on plaintiff SWH Funding Corporation\u2019s (\u201cSWH\u201d) complaint seeking damages in a breach of contract case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reviewing the record, and in light of prevailing legal standards, we affirm the order denying the motion to vacate; reverse the order fixing the amount of damages; and remand for the court to enter judgment in the amount reflected in the original arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Defendants filed a responsive pleading denying liability and asserting failure to state a cause of action and lack of subject matter jurisdiction as affirmative defenses. The matter was thereafter scheduled for court-ordered arbitration on September 14, 2004. Defendants obtained an adjournment of the September arbitration, and the hearing was rescheduled for November 16, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">On November 15, 2004, defense counsel sought to adjourn the arbitration a second time. After obtaining plaintiffs counsel\u2019s oral consent to the adjournment, defense counsel telephoned the Bergen County Arbitration Administrator to request the adjournment. The Administrator denied the adjournment request on November 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Arbitration proceeded on November 16, 2004. Defense counsel did not appear, nor did any individual representing defendants\u2019 business interests. After confirming that the arbitration was going forward, plaintiffs counsel appeared and presented the ease on behalf of his client. The arbitrator entered an award for plaintiff and against defendants in the amount of $326,534.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">On December 15, 2004, plaintiff filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award. Defendants opposed the motion and the parties had oral argument before the Law Division on February 4, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 15, 2005, the motion judge entered an order: (1) requiring defendants to post a surety bond in the amount of $200,000; (2) stating that failure to post the bond would result in an immediate judgment confirming the November 16 arbitration award; and, (3) restraining defendants from transferring or en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cumbering any asset pending a further order by the court. Defendants failed to post the bond. On March 10, 2005, the Law Division entered a default judgment against defendants in the amount of $343,746.76.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The court denied defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration, and ordered a plenary hearing on damages to modify the amount of the award. Pursuant to evidence presented by plaintiff at the plenary hearing, the court entered an order increasing the amount of the original arbitration award to $416,508.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\n<em>The Underlying Factual Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Before addressing the legal issues raised by defendants, we will briefly describe the salient facts. Plaintiff SWH Funding Corporation held a mortgage over property owned by Straight Course, LLC, located in Poughkeepsie, New York. Defendants Merchants Building, LLC, leased the premises from Straight Course. Defendant Merchants Associates, Inc. was the operating entity at the premises. Plaintiff alleges that defendants Walden Printing Company and Walden Merchants are successors in interest to Merchants Building and Merchants Associates. Defendant Daniel Churchill is an owner of Merchants Building and Merchants Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">During the summer of 2001, plaintiff sought to foreclose on Straight Course\u2019s mortgage on the premises. In light of defendants\u2019 desire to remain on the premises, the parties entered a settlement agreement on August 1, 2001, whereby plaintiff agreed not to foreclose on the premises during two forbearance periods. During these forbearance periods, defendants would pay rent and real estate taxes on the premises and could either perform due diligence to acquire the premises or enter into a long-term lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>for the premises. The first forbearance period ended February 28, 2002. The second forbearance period ended May 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">As part of the settlement agreement, defendant Daniel Churchill signed a personal guaranty. By the terms of the guaranty, Churchill assumed personal liability for any and all obligations of the corporate defendants arising under the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">According to plaintiff, defendants remained in possession of the premises until on or about August 2003, and failed to make the required monthly rental payments for the premises for the months of March, April, May, June, July, and August 2003. Plaintiff also alleges that defendants failed to make certain required payments in real estate taxes and assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\n<em>The Arbitration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In the days immediately preceding the November 16, 2004, arbitration hearing, defense counsel of record asserts that he developed a \u201cflu-like illness.\u201d The day before the hearing, at defense counsel\u2019s request, plaintiffs counsel agreed to adjourn the arbitration. Immediately thereafter, defense counsel instructed his legal assistant to call the Bergen County Arbitration Administrator to make a formal request for the adjournment. Defense counsel and his assistant both left the office before receiving the Administrator\u2019s response to the request for adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Later that same day, the Administrator left defense counsel a voicemail message denying the adjournment request, and advising counsel that the arbitration would proceed the following day at 11:00 a.m. as scheduled. Mistakenly assuming that the arbitration had been adjourned, defense counsel did not report to work on November 16, 2004, nor did he make any arrangements to have another attorney in his firm appear on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">On November 16, 2004, the defense counsel\u2019s assistant retrieved the Administrator\u2019s voicemail message denying the request. At approximately 9:30 a.m., by telephone call, the assistant informed the Administrator that defense counsel could not appear at the arbitration, but that the law firm could send another attorney in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>his stead. The assistant advised the Administrator, however, that given the time and distance, substitute counsel would probably not make it to the arbitration until early afternoon. According to the assistant, the Administrator told her that the arbitration would not be delayed and would proceed at 11:00 a.m. as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The record does not indicate what steps, if any, defense counsel\u2019s firm took either to renew its request for an adjournment, or to dispatch a substitute attorney as soon as possible. According to the assistant, however, she did inform plaintiffs counsel that no one from the defense firm would be able to appear at the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In her certification in support of the motion to vacate the default, the assistant indicated that plaintiffs counsel told her that he would not pursue an arbitration award by default, and would allow defense counsel to restore his responsive pleading by stipulation. In his certification opposing the motion, plaintiffs counsel denied having made any such representation. Indeed, counsel claimed that he told the assistant that his client was anxious to proceed with the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The arbitration ultimately proceeded at 1:15 p.m. on November 16, 2004. Defendants made no appearance. Plaintiff submitted documentary evidence of the terms of the settlement agreement, including defendants\u2019 agreement to pay rent, the forbearance clauses, and the guaranty. This evidence established that defendants performed through February 2003, when they ceased performance but maintained occupancy of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Based on plaintiffs presentation, the Arbitrator entered an award for plaintiff and against defendants. The award reflected damages in the form of: (1) unpaid real estate taxes; (2) six months of unpaid rent; (3) unpaid telephone bills; and, (4) equipment subject to third parties\u2019 security interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">On December 15, 2004, twenty-nine days after the arbitrator entered his decision, plaintiff filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(3). Defendants opposed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>motion, and the matter came before the Law Division on February 4, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In his certification filed in opposition to the motion to confirm the arbitration award, defense counsel raised only the following defenses: (1) \u201clack of jurisdiction\u201d based on the guaranty\u2019s \u201cJurisdiction, Venue, Service of Process\u201d clause; and, (2) that any action against Walden Merchants was automatically stayed by that defendant\u2019s involuntary bankruptcy. Although defendants did not raise any substantive defenses as to liability, defense counsel noted a general objection to the amount of damages awarded by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The Law Division entered an order dated February 15, 2005, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">ORDERED that the Defendant shall have until 5:00 pm on February 17, 2005 to post a bond in the amount of $200,000.00 on terms satisfactory to the Court, or in the alternative, to deposit in the trust account of Mandelbaum Salzburg, or such other New Jersey counsel as Defendants may engage to represent their interests in this case, the sum of $200,000.00 in cash, to serve as security for Plaintiff until further order of this Court; and it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">FURTHER ORDERED, that in the event Defendants fail to post a bond or deposit said cash collateral as security for Plaintiff\u2019s claims herein on or before 5:00 p.m. on February 17, 2005, this Court shall, on February 18, 2005 and without further healing, enter an Order and Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, confirming the arbitration award entered in Plaintiffs favor on November 16, 2004, and entering the amount of said arbitration award as a Judgment, jointly and severally, against Defendants, and it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">FURTHER ORDERED, that until further order of this Court, or until a judgment is entered by this Court, Defendants and each of them are hereby restrained and prohibited from selling, transferring, encumbering, or alienating any asset owned by any of them, or in which any have any interest, other than in the ordinary course of business____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">When defendants failed to post the $200,000 bond,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court entered default judgment on March 10, 2005. The court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration and to vacate the arbitration award. By order dated August 10, 2005, the court further ordered a plenary hearing on damages to modify the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The plenary hearing on damages took place on November 28, 2005. At the hearing, the court heard testimony from Churchill and from Sanford Herrick, principal of plaintiff SWH. Thereafter, the court issued a supplemental opinion, making findings of fact as to damages from the record developed at the hearing. On August 2, 2006, the court entered a final judgment increasing the damages reflected in the arbitration award by $89,974.17. The final amount of the judgment was then fixed at $416,508.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Defendants argue that the trial court abused its discretion: (1) by not vacating the arbitration award under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f); and, (2) by not vacating the February 15, 2005, order and March 10, 2005, judgment under <em>R. </em>4:50-1. In order to properly address defendants\u2019 arguments, we first need to identify and clarify the different standards for relief available under each of the <em>Rules </em>cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Relief from a default judgment entered pursuant to an arbitration award is ordinarily found in <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f). Our conclusion in this respect is buttressed by the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>clear language,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">(f) Failure to Appear. An appearance on behalf of each party is required at the arbitration hearing. If the party claiming damages does not appear, that party\u2019s pleading shall be dismissed. If a party defending against a claim of damages does not appear, that party\u2019s pleading shall be stricken, the arbitration shall proceed and the non-appearing party shall be deemed to have waived the right to demand a trial de novo. <em>Relief from any order entered pursuant to this rule shall be granted only on motion shmoing good cause and on such terms as the court may deem </em>appropriate, <em>including litigation expenses and counsel fees incurred for services directly related to the non-appearance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Thus, those seeking relief from an arbitration award entered by default, must show \u201cgood cause\u201d under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f) for their failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Relief under <em>R. </em>4:50-1 is available when a party can meet any of the specific grounds enumerated under the <em>Rule. </em>The only grounds for relief potentially applicable here are found in subsection (a), which affords relief from a judgment based on \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We emphasize, however, that \u201cgood cause\u201d under <em>R. </em>4:21A \u2014 4(f) is not synonymous with the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard in <em>R. </em>4:50-l(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">While carelessness and inadvertence on the part of an attorney is insufficient grounds for the establishment of excusable neglect, such is not necessarily the case when it comes to a determination of whether good cause exists to excuse late filings. In <em>Martindell v. Martindell, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>341 [122 A.2d 352] (1956), our Supreme Court dealt with the issue of good cause in determining whether or not to excuse an attorney\u2019s inadvertent failure to file a notice of appeal within the time period required by the rules. Notwithstanding the general proposition that a litigant is bound by the mistakes of his or her attorney, the Supreme Court in <em>Martindell </em>held that inadvertence of counsel may justly be deemed to constitute good cause where the delay does not prejudice the adverse party and a rational application under the circumstances present favors a determination that provides justice to the litigant. <em>Id. </em>at 349 [122 A.2d 352], Absent demonstrable prejudice, \u201cit is neither necessary nor proper to visit the sins of the attorney upon his blameless client.\u201d <em>Jansson v. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ., </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 196 [486 A.2d 920] (App.Div.1985); <em>see also Parker v. Marcus, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 594 [658 A.2d 1326] (App.Div.1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\"><em>[Burns v. Belafsky, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 471, 741 A.2d 649 (App.Div.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>466, 766 A.2d 1095 (2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Here, given the undisputed facts surrounding defense counsel\u2019s failure to appear at the scheduled arbitration hearing, we are satisfied that the only grounds for relief available to defendants is one rooted in the concept of \u201cgood cause\u201d under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f). <em>Rule </em>4:50-l(a) relief is not available, because inadvertence of counsel alone is insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d <em>Burns, supra, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 471, 741 A.2d 649; <em>Quagliato v. Bodner, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 138, 278 A.2d 500 (App.Div.1971) (\u201cBy no stretch of the imagination can the attorney\u2019s tardiness on the day the motion was listed be considered excusable neglect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Rules </em>4:21A-1 to -9 govern the course of pre-trial arbitration in certain civil actions. <em>Rule </em>4:21A-4(f) controls where, as here, a party fails to appear at an arbitration hearing and an award is entered against it. On its face <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f) does not set forth any mandatory time frame in which a party must seek relief. While a motion rejecting an award and demanding a trial de novo must be filed within thirty days, <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l), that time frame does not apply to <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f) because the right to a trial de novo is deemed waived. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, as presently written, there is no time frame for seeking relief under subsection (l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We will now address the question of \u201cgood cause.\u201d To set aside an arbitration award under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f), a party must show \u201cgood cause\u201d for failing to appear at the arbitration. <em>Del. Valley Wholesale Florist v. Addalia, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 232, 793 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2002). Addressing the need for specificity in applying this standard, we have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">Good cause is difficult of precise delineation. Its application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case considered in the context of the purposes of the Court Rule being applied. Here, the judgment arises from the defendant\u2019s default in failing to appear at the arbitration. As such it is very much analogous to a default judgment where the rule is that a motion to vacate \u2018should be viewed with great liberalty, and every reasonable ground for indulgence is tolerated to the end that a just result is reached.\u2019 <em>Davis v. DND/Fidoreo, Inc., </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 99, 721 A.2d 312 (App.Div.1998) (quoting <em>Morder v. Realty Contr. Co., </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>313, 319, 202 A.2d 175 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>508, 205 A.2d 744 (1964)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Upon a showing of \u201cgood cause,\u201d a court may vacate a default arbitration award under subsection (f) if the defaulting party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>makes a \u201cgood faith assertion of a meritorious defense\u201d to the plaintiffs claims. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In <em>Delaware Valley, </em>the plaintiff was a wholesale florist suing to collect from defendants for goods that plaintiff had delivered to the defendants\u2019 flower business. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 793 A.2d 139. The plaintiff relied upon a guaranty for defendant-flower business\u2019s obligations that bore defendant Jean Addalia\u2019s signature. <em>Ibid. </em>Jean Addalia denied the genuineness of her signature on the document and her husband-codefendant Thomas Addalia admitted that he had forged Jean\u2019s signature. <em>Ibid. </em>The matter eventually reached mandatory arbitration. <em>Ibid. </em>At arbitration, only the plaintiff appeared and the arbitrator entered an award against the individual defendants based on the guaranty. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In <em>Delaware Valley, </em>the defendants\u2019 counsel claimed that he missed the arbitration because: (1) he had a very heavy trial calendar; and, (2) based on several conversations with plaintiffs counsel, he had been \u201clulled\u201d into believing that no action would be taken directly against defendant Jean Addalia at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 793 A.2d 139. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 request to vacate the default arbitration award under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f). <em>Id. </em>at 230, 793 A.2d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In reversing the court\u2019s denial and remanding the matter for trial we held: (1) that the defendants\u2019 failure to appear at the arbitration was for \u201cgood cause\u201d considering the attorney\u2019s heavy trial calendar and the evidence that counsel was \u201clulled\u201d into believing that his client would not be pursued at the arbitration; and, (2) that the evidence that defendant\u2019s husband had forged her signature on the guaranty was a \u201cmeritorious defense\u201d under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f). <em>Id. </em>at 232, 793 A.2d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Here, by contrast, there is very little, if any evidence suggesting that defense counsel may have been \u201clulled\u201d into believing that the arbitration would not go forward. A brief summary of the salient facts illustrates the point. Defense counsel admits that after obtaining the consent of his adversary for the adjournment, he left his office without confirming that his adjournment request had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>been favorably received by the Arbitration Administrator. Indeed, defense counsel operated at all times as if this second adjournment request would be granted automatically. This inference is supported by counsel\u2019s failure to have in place a contingency plan wherein another attorney in the firm would be available to cover for him in the event his adjournment request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We recognize that counsel\u2019s assistant certified that plaintiffs counsel told her that he would not pursue an arbitration award by default, and that he would consent to restore defendants\u2019 responsive pleadings if necessary. We cannot overlook, however, that plaintiffs counsel denies this account of events, and claims that he made clear to counsel\u2019s assistant that his client was anxious to proceed with the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Defendants argue that these factual disputes must be deemed resolved in their favor for the purposes of vacating the default judgment. <em>See Farrell v. TCI of Northern N.J., </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 350, 875 A.2d 1017 (App.Div.2005). Thus, if the assistant\u2019s certification is taken as true, it was reasonable for defendants\u2019 counsel to think that the arbitration would not proceed. What this approach fails to appreciate, however, is that plaintiffs counsel was not in control of the arbitration; the decision to go forward with the arbitration was made by the Arbitration Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Finally, we note that no one from defense counsel\u2019s firm even attempted to have the Administrator\u2019s decision denying the request for adjournment reviewed by the vicinage Civil Division Presiding Judge. Nor did counsel take any affirmative steps in the days immediately following the arbitration to discover what had transpired, and what action he needed to take to restore his client\u2019s case to the active trial calendar. The only action taken by defense counsel here occurred in response to plaintiffs motion to confirm the arbitration award. Under these circumstances, defense counsel\u2019s implicit assumption that his failure to appear at the arbitration hearing was legally inconsequential was clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Despite our unequivocal disapproval of defense counsel\u2019s conduct, we are loath to visit the sins of the lawyer upon the innocent client. <em>Jansson v. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 196, 486 A.2d 920. We are also mindful of the well-established public policy disfavoring final dispositions based solely on procedural irregularities. <em>Galik v. Clara Maass Med. Ctr., </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>341, 356, 771 A.2d 1141 (2001); <em>Ragusa v. Lau, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>276, 283-84, 575 A.2d 8 (1990). We thus conclude that defense counsel\u2019s conduct, although not arising to excusable neglect, constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f), warranting giving his clients the opportunity to have their defenses rise or fall on the merits of their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Additionally, here, the attorney\u2019s neglect did not cause substantial prejudice to plaintiffs case. Had the default been vacated, the only quantifiable measure of harm to plaintiff that we can discern from these facts is the cost incurred in litigating these issues. A remedy for such a limited harm is directly addressed by <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f). That <em>Rule </em>authorizes the trial court to impose \u201csuch terms as the court may deem appropriate, <em>including litigation expenses and counsel fees </em>incurred for services directly related to the nonappearance.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">However, our holding in favor of defendants on the question of \u201cgood cause\u201d does not end the discussion. Even though defendants are able to establish \u201cgood cause,\u201d there is no evidence in the record before us that shows a meritorious defense. The following colloquy between defense counsel and the Law Division judge illustrates this point.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: The second prong, Your Honor, that we take issue with is the lack of a meritorious defense. Mr. Churchill [defendant] ... will present evidence, if permitted, that <em>the amount claimed, is not due. We don't deny that there are monies due, but certainly not almost $825,000.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">THE COURT: He doesn\u2019t set forth how much is due, though, does he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: He does not, Judge. But if \u2014 if we could just have some time and allow us to submit, the way \u2014 the way, I feel, Judge, is that these papers are not as comprehensive as they might be, but considering the quantum of damages that are going to be assessed, not just against a corporation, but against an individual guarantor, to have to come up with $325,000 to pay a judgment, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>think \u2014 I would respectfully request the Court to give us some indulgence and allow us to present evidence as to what the true amount due is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Counsel thus conceded before the trial court that the only-disputed issue was the amount of damages due, not liability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to damages, we agree with defendants that the trial court did not have the legal authority to increase the amount of damages awarded by the arbitrator. Under <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(3), the court\u2019s authority in adjudicating a motion to confirm an arbitration award is limited to reducing to judgment the amount of damages found by the arbitrator, supplemented only by prejudgment interest provided in <em>R. </em>4:42-11(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Despite defendants\u2019 concession that they were unable to establish a meritorious defense, the trial court thoroughly reviewed defendants\u2019 arguments, and concluded that they fell far short of meeting the required threshold of proof. The court explained its reasoning thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">Defendant further claims meritorious defenses that include (1) the choice of forum clause in the guaranty is exclusively New York State; (2) the documents upon which liability rests for the default judgment expired prior to the conduct complained of; (3) plaintiffs contention about the scope of the holdover period is erroneous, thereby undermining the compensatory damage award; (4) an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs is contrary to the plain language of the guaranty; and (5) a genuine dispute exists concerning the $27,000.00 claim to be owed in real estate taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">Defendants stated that they were never served with the arbitration award within the time for defendants to seek a de novo hearing on the merits; hence, the defendants state that the default judgment should be vacated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">By way of background, defendant, Merchants Building, LLC, was a tenant at a warehouse located at 17 Noxon Road, Poughkeepsie, New York (the \u201cPremises\u201d). The operating entity at the Premises was defendant, Merchants Associates, Inc., a printing company. Plaintiff, SWH Funding Corp. (\u201cSWH\u201d) is a lender who lent monies to Straight Course, LLC, the landlord at the Premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-12\">During 2001, SWH sought to foreclose on Straight Course\u2019s ownership interest in the Premises. During that time, defendant, Daniel Churchill, an officer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>defendant entities, was considering acquiring Merchants Press, the tenant at the Premises. Since it would have been uneconomic to move the business, and Merchants Press wanted to continue to occupy the Premises and not be disturbed by the foreclosure action, the parties agreed to provide the defendants with time to consider whether they wanted to acquire the Premises or continue and enter into a long-term lease for the Premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">As of August 1, 2001, the parties entered into a settlement agreement and a personal guaranty signed by Churchill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">The settlement agreement provided for two forbearance periods during which defendants could either perform due diligence to acquire the Premises or, alternatively, enter into a long term lease for the Premises. There was a default by the borrowers and the plaintiff, SWH, sought herein to collect on its loan from the defendant, Churchill, pursuant to the unconditional guaranty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">In return for the corporate defendants paying rent and real estate taxes, SWH would forbear from concluding its foreclosure action against Straight Course (an entity unaffiliated with the defendants) and permit defendants to remain in the Premises. A first forbearance period ended February 28, 2002, and a second one ended May 31, 2002. During the forbearance periods, the corporate defendants paid a $33,000.00 fee for each period plus monthly rental payments of about $30,000.00 plus escrow deposits for realty taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">According to the moving papers, the forbearance period ended May 31, 2002, and it is claimed that the fees were paid plus monthly rental and taxes. Defendants state that monthly payments continued to be paid after that period through March 2003 and that they did not vacate the premises. Clearly, the conduct of the parties indicated that the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement were still in effect, as the status of the parties remained the same after the expiration date of May 31, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">The guaranty contains a \u201cconsent to modification\u201d clause and a waiver of notice of any modification or extensions. The settlement agreement was extended and SWH performed under that extension by (a) not evicting defendants from the Premises and (b) accepting defendants\u2019 payment of the required monthly amount for nearly one year after the so-called \u201cexpiration\u201d of settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, detailed above, that defendants have not demonstrated a meritorious defense. We also agree with the trial court that the legal principles addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>America\u2019s Pride Construction v. Farry, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>60, 811 A.2d 906 (2002), are inapplicable to this ease. In America\u2019s <em>Pride, </em>the Court applied a version of <em>R. </em>4:21A-5 which has since been superseded by the wholesale reforms known as \u201cBest Practices.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that earlier version, the <em>Rule </em>required the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>arbitrator \u201cwithin ten days after the completion of the arbitration hearing\u201d <em>to mail </em>a copy of the arbitration award to each of the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 811 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Addressing that mailing requirement, the Court considered \u201cwhether the arbitrator\u2019s failure to provide [defendants] with a copy of the arbitration award as prescribed by [the <em>Rule </em>was] a sufficient basis to toll the filing deadlines\u201d to request a trial de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 811 A.2d 906. The Court answered the question in the affirmative. Despite defendants\u2019 failure to appear at the arbitration, the court held that defense counsel had a right to rely upon the \u201cmailing\u201d requirement of the <em>Rule. Id. </em>at 65, 811 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">By contrast, in adopting the current versions of both <em>R. </em>4:21A-5 and <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f), the Supreme Court specifically eliminated the requirement that the arbitrator mail a copy of the award to the parties, and denied the non-appearing party the right to file for a trial de novo. This signaled the Court\u2019s clear intention to depart from the scenario addressed in <em>America\u2019s Pride.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f), a party seeking to vacate a civil arbitration award entered by default must establish both \u201cgood cause\u201d and a \u201cmeritorious defense.\u201d Here, defense counsel\u2019s neglect in failing to appear at the arbitration, and in failing to be diligent in ascertaining the outcome of the proceeding, constituted \u201cgood cause\u201d under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f). Defendants have failed, however, to demonstrate a \u201cmeritorious defense.\u201d Thus the trial court correctly denied defendants relief from the consequences of their default at the arbitration hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Thereafter, in the context of adjudicating plaintiffs motion to confirm the arbitration award, the trial court erroneously increased the damage award entered by the arbitrator by considering evidence not presented by plaintiff in the original arbitration hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>We affirm the trial court\u2019s order denying defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the arbitration award; reverse the amount of damages fixed by the trial court; and remand for the entry of judgment limited to the confirmation of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Affirmed in part. Reversed in part. Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-15\"> The complaint alleged: (1) breach of contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) wrongful use and occupancy; (4) successor liability; (5) fraudulent transfer; and, (6) fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> At oral argument on the motion, the trial judge noted that second requests for an adjournment of arbitration hearings are \"always denied in Bergen County.\u201d This practice is not acceptable. We have made clear, that the Rules of Court are to be consistently and uniformly applied throughout the State. Indeed, the \"Best Practices\u201d reforms were specifically intended to eradicate such \"county rules.\" <em>Brun v. Cardoso, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 421, 915 A.2d 1053 (App.Div.2006). We thus expect that future requests for adjournments will be considered and decided on their merits, not based on some arbitrary local practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b33-10\"> The initial arbitration award was in the amount of $326,534.37, By entering judgment in the amount of $343,746.76, the trial court awarded plaintiff $17,212.39 in prejudgment interest as of December 31, 2004, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-11(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b36-11\"> Defendants have not explained their failure to post the bond ordered by the court; nor do they argue that the trial court abused its discretion under <em>R. </em>4:21A-4(f) by conditioning their ability to proceed upon the posting of such a bond. We are nevertheless compelled to note that a non-binding arbitration award, entered by default, should not be treated as the functional equivalent of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>final judgment. Thus, requiring the posting of such a bond in this context seems to be facially unwarranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> We deem this to be a regulatory oversight that should be addressed by the Civil Practice Committee. We also note that <em>R. </em>4:21A-5 requires the arbitrator to file the written award with the civil division manager. Thereafter, \u201cthe court shall provide a copy thereof to each of the parties.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:21A-5. The <em>Rule </em>is silent, however, on how such notice is served upon an absent party when the arbitration award is entered by default. We thus further recommend that the Civil Practice Committee consider language specifically addressing this scenario, by specifying who bears responsibility for serving the arbitrator's decision upon the party in default.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b43-13\"> In their brief, defendants also argue that New Jersey is an improper venue based on the guaranty\u2019s forum selection clause. The clause in question clearly gives plaintiff the discretion to bring suit in New Jersey. Thus, defendants' improper venue argument is not worthy of further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b44-12\"> The actual package of amendments known as \"Best Practices\" were adopted on July 5, 2000, and became effective on September 5, 2000.
