The court sentenced defendant to an extended term of fifteen years imprisonment with five years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>parole ineligibility, concurrent to an extended term of seven years imprisonment, three years to be served without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Defendant appeals, and we reverse because the police tactics in executing the knock-and-announce search warrant violated defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, paragraph 7 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In executing a knock-and-announce warrant, the police must give the occupants of the dwelling a reasonable opportunity to respond before resorting to the use of force to gain entry to the residence. Under the circumstances presented, the police by breaking down the entrance door of the dwelling, twenty to thirty seconds after announcing their presence converted the knock-and-announce warrant into a de facto no-knoek warrant. This constituted a violation of a material condition imposed by the court, rendering the search unreasonable and unconstitutional. Furthermore, the use of a so-called flash bang explosive device by the police here was factually unwarranted, and rendered a nullity the warrant\u2019s knock-and-announce condition imposed by the court. Under these circumstances, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence gathered by the police while executing the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\n<em>The Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The State\u2019s case against defendant began as part of an investigation into illicit drug sales in Camden County. The Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office (CCPO) initially targeted defendant James Robinson, and a woman identified as Diane Winter. Specifically, the CCPO received intelligence, gathered by confidential informants, that illicit narcotics were being sold from a private residence located in the Borough of Pine Hill. CCPO Investigator Robert Ferris was assigned to work as an undercover officer with the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On December 10, 2003, Borough of Pine Hill Detective Jack Welker showed Ferris a photograph of both Diane Winter and James Robinson and gave him sixty dollars to purchase \u201cany CDS.\u201d In response, Ferris went to a residence located at 12 Wilson Road in Pine Hill. The residence is located 150 feet from a public park named the Mayor Steven Wills Playground. Ferris arrived at the residence at about 8:05 p.m. Once inside, he met with Winter and asked her to sell him three bags of crack cocaine; Winter responded by placing a telephone call to an individual subsequently identified as \u201cManny.\u201d At approximately 9:00 p.m. the person identified as \u201cManny\u201d arrived at the house. Ferris immediately recognized the man calling himself \u201cManny\u201d as defendant James Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">When defendant asked Ferris what he needed, Ferris replied \u201cthree,\u201d referring to bags of cocaine. Defendant then produced three bags from his inner coat pocket and handed them to Ferris, who gave him thirty dollars in exchange. Ferris then left the residence, and linked up with his backup unit at a predetermined location. Once there, Ferris dated and initialed the three bags, and turned them over to Welker. He also viewed defendant\u2019s photograph again to confirm that the individual who had just sold him three bags of cocaine was defendant. Ferris then signed the photo, and printed his name and badge number on it. The contents of the three bags tested positive for cocaine. At trial, Ferris identified both the photograph and the three bags of cocaine, based on these identifying markings.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\n<em>The Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Welker and Ferris submitted a joint affidavit in support of an application for a warrant to search defendant\u2019s apartment. The affidavit referred to two confidential informants identified as PH-24 and PH-25, who had gathered information on defendant\u2019s drug activities. Specifically, PH-24 accompanied Ferris when he made his controlled purchase of cocaine from defendant on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>10, 2003, at 12 Wilson Road. PH-25 met with the investigators on January 5, 2004 to arrange a second controlled buy from defendant at defendant\u2019s apartment located in the Village Green Apartments, Borough of Hi-Nella. PH-25 carried out the second illicit transaction under a police-controlled process. He was searched to insure that he was not concealing contraband, and was then provided with the currency to buy the drugs. Although the two illicit sales occurred in different locations, the description given by PH-25 of how the actual transaction was consummated was factually similar to the account given by Ferris of the first controlled buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The search warrant issued by the court specifically required the police to first knock on the door of defendant\u2019s residence, identify themselves as police officers, and announce their intended purpose to search the apartment. The joint affidavit submitted by the police in support of the issuance of the search warrant did not mention or even allude to defendant\u2019s propensity for violence, or of the violent tendencies of other likely occupants of the residence. The affidavit is equally devoid of any information referring to the possible presence of weapons in the residence. In short, the affidavit did not alert the judicial officer reviewing the application that the police had reason to believe that the execution of the warrant could expose the officers involved to an exceptionally dangerous situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">At approximately 6:30 a.m., on January 16, 2004, the police executed the search warrant. Detective Sergeant Leonard Check, of the Berlin Township Police Department, described what transpired at the evidentiary hearing conducted by the trial court to consider defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>DIRECT EXAMINATION</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">Q. Okay. And Zone 4 tactical team, what was the team\u2019s role in executing this particular search warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">A. What our tactical team does is, we get called out to execute any type of high-risk warrant where they think there might be, you know, a propensity for violence or something like that. They call the tactical team out for that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>So our role is to go into a location, secure everyone in the location, make the scene safe, and then turn the location over to investigators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">Q. And how many officers were part of this particular tactical team?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">A. Thirteen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">Q. Was there a team briefing before the warrant was executed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">A. Yes. The briefing took place at Pine Hill Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">Q. And what was the purpose of the briefing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">A. The briefing was to give the information of the exact location to team members, information of <em>possible </em>occupants in the dwelling. The team leader at that time puts the team members in specific locations and gives those guys specific duties for that, you know, specific entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">Q. Okay. And what was your duty for this particular entry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">A. My duty was to make a knock and announce at the residence because it was a knock and announce warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-14\">Q. Okay. And when you arrived on the scene and before this warrant was executed, did you in fact knock and announce your presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-16\">Q. Okay. And when you knocked, you knocked on F-3, Village Green Apartments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-18\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-19\">A. As soon as we made entry, there was an entry door, made entry through the main entry door and then the apartment door was to the left. I knocked and announced on the apartment door prior to entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-20\">Q. Okay. And when you knocked and announced your presence, what exactly did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-21\">A. Police department; search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-22\">Q. Did anybody answer the door at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-23\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-24\">Q. Okay. And what did you do after no one answered the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-25\">A. We waited approximately 20, 30 seconds. The door was forcibly breached, and then we deployed a percussion grenade inside the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-26\">Q. I\u2019m sorry go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-27\">A. We deployed a distraction device inside the doorway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-28\">Q. And what distraction device was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-29\">A. The distraction device, it emits smoke and also a loud bang and a loud flash. Q. Okay. And what\u2019s it called?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-30\">A. It\u2019s a distraction device or also known as a flash bang.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-31\">Q. Okay. And can you explain how it works?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-32\">A. Yeah, it\u2019s like you pull a pin and you release it right inside the doorway maybe one or two feet inside the doorway. And in approximately two seconds it goes off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and emits a loud flash, loud bang, and smoke. It gives the members of the team a surprise to the occupants of the dwelling so we can get in safely, get through the doorway safely and secure everyone in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">Q. Now you testified that you\u2019ve executed over a hundred search warrants. Is a flash bang always used when executing search warrants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">A. No, it\u2019s not primarily used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">Q. Why was it used in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">A. At the briefing we had information that the occupant of the dwelling\u2019s nephew sometimes stays with him and he operates a blue Crown Victoria with tinted windows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge I\u2019m going to object to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">THE COURT: Okay. This is beyond the point of anything. I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\n<em>CROSS-EXAMINATION</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">Q. Okay. And you said you that you threw some type of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-13\">A. I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t throw it, the team did. A member of the team threw it. Q. And what was the purpose of throwing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-14\">A. The purpose of throwing that was to give the members of the tactical team\u2014 it\u2019s to make the occupants of the dwelling a little bit shocked so we can enter the dwelling safely if we feel that there may be more violence inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-15\">Q. Okay. And you testified earlier that you first knocked, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-17\">Q. And you also testified that the reason for that device is to give \u2014 so the team can surprise someone. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-18\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-19\">Q. How do you surprise them when \u2014 if you already knocked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-20\">A. That\u2019s why we use it; because we do knock. They know we\u2019re there, so we try to give a little bit more of a shock and surprise to make the team make entry after the knock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">There were four adults inside the apartment when the police detonated the flash bang device; defendant, his girlfriend, Myra Ramirez, and . two other unidentified persons. No weapons were found; from all accounts, the occupants of the residence did not offer any physical resistance to the police or otherwise interfere with the execution of the search warrant. Inside the apartment, the officers found a quantity of cocaine, $4124 in cash, a ledger and a black scale. All of the cocaine was found on the person of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Myra Ramirez. The money was found in defendant\u2019s jeans, which were in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Defendant was arrested and transported to the Pine Hill Police Department. Welker informed defendant of his rights under <em>Miranda;</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>he did not question him, however, because defendant told him he did not wish to speak to the police at that time. According to Welker, as defendant was walking to the processing room, defendant told him that \u201che didn\u2019t want his girlfriend to go to jail, and the drugs that were found on her were his.\u201d The police characterized defendant\u2019s statement as spontaneous and unsolicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">[At the direction of the court, the discussion of the other issues in the appeal has been omitted from the published version of the opinion.!</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">We now address the argument raised by defendant challenging the court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence gathered by the police in connection with the execution of the warrant to search defendant\u2019s residence. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress after hearing the testimony of one of the officers who executed the warrant. As a threshold issue, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the warrant was not supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">A probable cause determination is based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Jones, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>377, 389, 846 A.2d 569 (2004) (quoting <em>Schneider v. Simonini, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>336, 361, 749 A.2d 336 (2000)). \u201cInformation related by informants may constitute a basis for probable cause, provided that a substantial basis for crediting that information is presented.\u201d <em>Ibid,, </em>(citing <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>204, 212, 777 A.2d 60 (2001); <em>State v. Smith, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>83, 92, 713 A.2d 1033 <em>cert, denied, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>1033, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>576, 142 L.Ed.2d 480 (1998)). The joint affidavit presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>by the State in support of the application for the issuance of the warrant provides sufficient, detailed information to establish that defendant\u2019s residence was being used for distributing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Our concern here is centered on the execution phase of the search warrant as that may impact on the reasonableness of the search itself. It is well-settled, that \u201cthe method of an officer\u2019s entry into a dwelling \u2018is an element of the reasonableness inquiry under the Fourth Amendment,\u2019 \u201d and its New Jersey State Constitution analog. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>608, 616, 775 A.2d 1273 (2001) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>927, 931, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1914,1916,131 L.Ed.2d 976, 980 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the search of his home on the grounds that the methods employed by the police to gain entry were so unreasonable that they warrant the suppression of the evidence gathered therefrom comes before us in a bifurcated fashion. The execution of the knock-and-announce provision in the warrant was directly raised before the trial court. The propriety of the police using a so-called \u201cflash bang\u201d explosive device immediately upon entering the home, was raised before us in defendant\u2019s appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">We are satisfied, however, that these issues substantially implicate the public interest, and are so interrelated, that a proper examination of their legal significance cannot be done in isolation from each other. <em>See State v. Walker, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 410, 897 A.2d 411 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>83, 899 A.2d 305 (2006) (citing <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 300 A.2d 142 (1973); <em>Ferraro v. Demetrakis, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 431-32, 400 A.2d 1227 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>290, 405 A.2d 834 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">We begin our analysis by emphasizing that nothing in the joint affidavit in support of the issuance of the warrant reveals a concern by the State that the search of defendant\u2019s residence presented an unusually dangerous situation. Despite the absence of any indication of potential danger in the joint affidavit, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>clear that the officers who executed the warrant did not consider this situation as ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">From its inception, the officers involved viewed this mission as a potentially dangerous operation, requiring a military-style tactical approach. As Sergeant Check testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">What our tactical team does is, we get called out to execute any type of high-risk warrant where they think there might be, you know, a propensity for violence or something like that. They call the tactical team out for that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">This specialized team, consisting of thirteen officers from various law enforcement agencies, is designed to aggressively secure the targeted area, using both a tactical deployment of personnel and force. From the perspective of the magistrate who issued the warrant, it seems to us that this highly aggressive posture by the police was not anticipated or warranted. It must be emphasized, that the warrant here required the police to: (1) knock on the door of the residence; (2) announce their identity; and (3) state the reasons for their presence. These requirements serve a three-fold purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">(1) \u201c[decreasing! the potential for violence, as an \u2018unannounced breaking and entering into a home could quite easily lead an individual to believe that his safety was in peril and cause him to take defense measures\u2019 \u201d (2) \u201c[protecting] privacy by minimizing the chance of entry of the wrong premises and subjecting the innocent persons to \u2018the shock, fright or embarrassment attendant upon an unannounced police intrusion,\u2019 and even when there is no mistake, allow[ing] those within a brief time to <em>prepare </em>for the police entry\u201d; and (3) \u201c[preventing] the physical destruction of property by giving the occupant, the opportunity to voluntarily admit the officer into his home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\"><em>[State v. Bilancio, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>408, 417-18, 724 A.2d 278 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>478, 734 A.2d 793 (1999) (alteration in original) (quoting 1 Wayne R. LaPave <em>&amp; </em>-Jerold H. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>(1984) \u00a7 3.4(h)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In <em>Johnson, supra, </em>the Court noted that \u201cto pass muster under the knock-and-announce rule, the time lapse between the police announcement and any forced entry must be reasonable but not necessarily extensive in length, depending on the circumstances of a given case.\u201d 168 <em>N.J. </em>at 621-22, 775 A.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">We recently had occasion to review the \u201ctime lapse\u201d between the police announcement and forced entry, in the context of an execution of a knock-and-announce warrant. In <em>State v. Rodri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>guez, </em>the police had information that illicit narcotics were located in a third floor apartment. 399 <em>N. J.Super. </em>192, 404, 943 A.2d 901 (App.Div.2008). Armed with a knock-and-announee warrant, the police arrived at this location at 8:18 a.m., and took the following actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\"><em>Officer Smith testified that he knocked three times in succession and waited ten or fifteen seconds. Upon receiving no response, Officer Smith knocked three times again, this time yelling \u201cpolice, search warrant.\u201d Again, there was no response, and, after fifteen or twenty seconds, the police entered through this unlocked door. </em>Officer Smith yelled \u201cpolice\u201d at least three times as he and the others entered. The door opened into a vacant kitchen. From there the police entered the living room where Jameel Griggs \u2014 the man known as \u201cGroove\u201d for whom the police were searching \u2014 was sleeping on a couch. Griggs awoke and lifted his head; Officer Smith indicated he had a search warrant for the apartment. Officer Smith then entered a bedroom. There, Lashawanda Williams, defendant, and a small child were in bed. According to Officer Smith, it appeared \u201cthey had been sleeping and just woke up.\u201d The police searched the apartment and found CDS in the bedroom, near the bed where defendant was awakened when the police entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 404-05, 943 A.2d 901 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">After reviewing the applicable case law, the panel in <em>Rodriguez </em>concluded that the actions taken by the police in executing the warrant did not violate the knock-and-announce restriction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">Here, the police executed the search on a Wednesday, a short time after 8:00 a.m., when the police could reasonably expect that anyone inside would be up and about. It is also reasonable to expect the police to wait a longer period of time before entering when the premises are large as opposed to an apartment or hotel room. In this case, the breach was of a two-bedroom apartment, and, thus, what constitutes a reasonable wait time would be shorter here than a large or multi-story home, although perhaps not as short as what would be reasonable if the premises was a hotel room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 410, 943 A.2d 901.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Finally, addressing the amount of time the police waited before entering the apartment, the panel concluded that \u201calthough close to or at the limit of what constitutes a reasonable wait time in these circumstances,\u201d the total amount of time that transpired between the first knock and actual entry (thirty to forty seconds) was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 410-11, 943 A.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Here, the facts are sharply different from those addressed by the court in <em>Rodriguez. </em>In this case, the officers arrived at defendant\u2019s residence at 6:30 a.m. According to Sergeant Check, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>they knocked on the door, announced their presence and purpose, then, after waiting for just <em>twenty or thirty seconds, </em>they \u201cforcibly breached\u201d the door, and deployed a \u201cpercussion grenade\u201d inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">There is no justification in the record before us for such extreme measures. Given that it was 6:30 a.m., it is entirely reasonable to expect that it might take a person more than thirty seconds to wake up, put on an item of clothing, and walk an unknown distance to answer the door. Under these circumstances, waiting just twenty to thirty seconds before forcibly breaking down the door of a residence renders the search facially unreasonable, and practically nullifies the knock-and-announce condition specifically imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We recognize, however, that even in cases where the warrant specifically requires the officers to knock and announce their presence, exigent circumstances may necessitate entry of a dwelling by force without first securing specific judicial authorization to do so. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 617-18, 775 A2.d 1273 (quoting <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>385, 394, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1416, 1421-22, 137 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 615, 624 (1997)). In such a case, the burden is upon the police officers to show that the circumstances were such that announcing their presence, as required by the warrant, would have been dangerous, futile, or would have inhibited the effective investigation of the crime. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Here, the only evidence showing the circumstances facing the police at the time they arrived at defendant\u2019s residence came from the testimony of Sergeant Check. From this evidence, it is clear that the police were predisposed to the use of force from the moment the decision was made to deploy the tactical team. Nothing in Check\u2019s testimony indicates that the officers executing the search warrant were responding to an unforeseen dangerous condition, or that their mere presence had compromised the effectiveness of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">All of the evidence thus leads to one conclusion: the officers gave the knock-and-announce requirement in the warrant only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>perfunctory consideration. The decision to gain entry by force had been reached long before the officers arrived at defendant\u2019s residence. Under these circumstances, the judicial restriction was rendered a nullity, converting the police\u2019s actions into a warrant-less invasion of defendant\u2019s dwelling, requiring the suppression of any evidence gathered therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We recognized that since our State Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>(upholding the suppression of evidence gathered in violation of the knock-and-announce rule), the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>586, 594, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2159, 2165,165 L.Ed.2d 56, 66 (2006), holding that the exclusionary rule cannot be invoked in response to a police entry in violation of the knock-and-announce rule. Writing for a plurality of the Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Justice Scalia noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">One of [the] interests [protected by the knock-and-announce rule] is the protection of human life and limb, because an unannounced entry may provoke violence in supposed self-defense by the surprised resident. Another interest is the protection of property. Breaking a house (as the old cases typically put it) absent an announcement would penalize someone who \u201c\u2018did not know of the process, of which, if he had notice, it is to be presumed that he would obey it____\u2019 \u201d The knock-and-announce rule gives individuals \u201cthe opportunity to comply with the law and to avoid the destruction of property occasioned by a forcible entry.\u201d And thirdly, the knock-and-announce rule protects those elements of privacy and dignity that can be destroyed by a sudden entonce. It gives residents the \u201copportunity to prepare themselves for\u201d the entry of the police. \u201cThe brief interlude between announcement and entry with a warrant may be the opportunity that an individual has to [put] on clothes or get out of bed.\u201d In other words, it assures the opportunity to collect oneself before answering the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">\u25a0What the knock-and-announce rule has never protected, however, is one\u2019s interest in preventing the government from seeing or taking evidence described in a warrant. <em>Since the interests that were violated in this case have nothing to do with the seizure of the evidence, the exclusionary rule is inapplicable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 594,126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2165, 165 L.Ed.2d at 66 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Writing in dissent on behalf of himself and three other members of the Court, Justice Breyer wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Today\u2019s opinion is [ ] doubly troubling. It represents a significant departure from the Court\u2019s precedents. And it weakens, perhaps destroys, much of the practical value of the Constitution\u2019s knock-and-announce protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Without such a rule, ... [the] police know that they can ignore the Constitution\u2019s requirements without risking suppression of evidence discovered after an unreasonable entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\"><em>lid. </em>at 605, 609, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2171, 2174, 165 L.Ed.2d at 73, 76 (Breyer, J., dissenting)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Fortunately for the residents of our State, we need not decide which side of this debate accurately reflects and safeguards the concerns expressed by our nation\u2019s founders when they adopted the Fourth Amendment, because, <em>\u201cHudson </em>by no means governs the application of our [S]tate [C]onstitution to a knock and announce violation.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 412, 943 A.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">As our Supreme Court clearly stated in <em>Johnson, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axe\">lW]e note for completeness that our disposition [suppressing evidence gathered in violation of the knock-and-announce rule] is required under both the Fourth Amendment and the analogous provision in the New Jersey Constitution. Although our disposition is consistent with federal jurisprudence, we also conclude that the no-knock entry was impermissible on State constitutional grounds for the reasons already stated. <em>See State v. Cooke, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>657, 666, 751 A.2d 92 (2000) (outlining those occasions in which \u201cthis Court has interpreted our State Constitution as affording its citizens greater protections than those afforded by its federal counterpart\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">[168 <em>N.J. </em>at 625-26, 775 A.2d 1273.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Thus, our holding here suppressing the evidence gathered by the police in violation of the knock-and-announce rule is exclusively grounded on Article I, paragraph 7 of our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">\n<em>Flash Bang Device</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">The use of the \u201cpercussion grenade\u201d or \u201cflash bang\u201d device here presents an independent, and arguably more significant basis for invalidating the search. <em>State v, Fanelle, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 897 A.2d 1104 (App.Div.2006) is the only reported decision in this State that has addressed the use of this type of tactical explosive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>device. The facts presented to the magistrate who issued the search warrant in <em>Fanelle </em>are in sharp contrast to the facts we confront here.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In <em>Fanelle, </em>we sustained the authorization for a no-knock warrant based on: (1) the physical layout of the targeted property; (2) the ease with which the evidence could be destroyed; and (3) the danger posed by defendant\u2019s history of violence, as reflected in his criminal record. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 897 A.2d 1104. The configuration of the structures made it \u201cvirtually impossible to approach the house without being observed by [its] occupants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 897 A.2d 1104. There were also structures detached from the main dwelling which were being used to store contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 897 A.2d 1104. Thus, the police needed to coordinate simultaneous entries from different locations. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 897 A.2d 1104. All this made it highly likely that evidence would be destroyed without a no-knoek authorization. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">On the question of the danger posed to the officers, Fanelle had a well-documented history of violence; he had been arrested twenty-one times; had eleven narcotic convictions, and one conviction for assaulting a police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 897 A.2d 1104. In this light, we upheld the trial court\u2019s issuance of the no-knock warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 897 A.2d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Concerning the use by the police of the flash bang device, we reviewed the published opinions from other jurisdictions that have addressed the use of these devices in executing a warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 528-33, 897 A.2d 1104. In each of the cases examined, the police had either secured a no-knoek warrant, or otherwise gained entry by force. <em>Id. </em>at 529-31, 897 A.2d 1104. Thus, it seems obvious to us, that there is a rational nexus between the use of a flash bang device, and an entry by force, whether expressly authorized by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>no-knock warrant, or otherwise required by exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">A no-knock warrant permits, by definition, the use of force to enter a dwelling. Its legal legitimacy is derived from the notion that the \u201cno-knock entry is required to prevent the destruction of evidence, to protect the officer\u2019s safety, or to effectuate the arrest or seizure of evidence.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 775 A.2d 1273. The flash bang device is thus a tactical expression of the force authorized by the no-knock entry; it is one of many possible forceful means the State is authorized to use in connection with an unannounced entry. Stated differently, the use of a flash bang device is antithetical to and irreconcilable with the public policy grounds supporting a knock-and-announce warrant. <em>See Bilancio, supra, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 418, 724 A.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">We thus hold that absent unforeseen exigent circumstances supporting the use of force, the use of a flash bang device in connection with the execution of a \u201cknock-and-announce\u201d warrant, nullifies the legal efficacy of such warrant, rendering the entry and search of the dwelling unconstitutional, in violation of a defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, paragraph 7 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Our analysis would be deemed incomplete, however, if we were to end our discussion without giving some guidance to the trial courts on how to address issues dealing with the use of this explosive device. In <em>Fanelle, supra, </em>we specifically rejected the notion that the police need to obtain prior judicial approval for the use of a flash bang device. 385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 533-34, 897 A.2d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">We reaffirm that holding here. It is neither wise nor practical for judges to involve themselves in the tactical decisions of law enforcement agencies. Our role is to review the actions taken by law enforcement officials to ensure compliance with relevant legal standards. In order to make this assessment, a reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>must create a thorough and comprehensive record. As we noted in <em>Fanelle:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">[T]he use of such a device, when challenged, requires a more detailed presentation than defendant\u2019s motion received. There are various factors in the record before us which could tend to support the use of such a device here, as well as factors tending to indicate that its use was not warranted. We are aware from our own research that there are a number of such devices, with varying strengths and capabilities. The particular weight to be ascribed to particular factors may well be affected by the details of the device that was used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\"><em>lid. </em>at 533, 897 A.2d 1104.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Specifically, among the factors a reviewing court should consider are: (1) does the law enforcement agency have a protocol (written or oral) governing the use of the flash bang device; (2) if so, is the protocol sufficiently sensitive to constitutional considerations involving the use of force to obtain entry into a dwelling; and (3) if the protocol is constitutionally acceptable, were the actions taken by the officers in compliance with it. This, by no means, constitutes an exhaustive list of the possible issues to be addressed. The analysis and issues addressed will ultimately depend on the facts of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The reviewing court should also keep in mind the inherently dangerous nature of a flash bang device. As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted in <em>Boyd v. Benton County, </em>\u201cit cannot be a reasonable use of force under the Fourth Amendment to throw a flash bang device \u2018blind\u2019 into a room occupied by innocent bystanders absent a strong governmental interest, careful consideration of alternatives and appropriate measures to reduce the risk of injury.\u201d 374 F.3d 773, 779 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">The order of the trial court denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence gathered by the police in connection with the execution of the knock-and-announce search warrant is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>versed. Consequently, defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed, and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-12\"> <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona, 384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\"> Three other Justices joined Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion.
