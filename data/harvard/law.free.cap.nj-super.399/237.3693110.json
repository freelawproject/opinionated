Seward Johnson (Johnson or the grantor). The principal issue is whether the grantor intended, by use of the term \u201cspouse\u201d in the trust instrument, to include a surviving or divorced spouse as an eligible beneficiary at termination of the charitable lead trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The issues in this case were first disposed of almost nine years ago by summary judgment after the trustees of the 1961 trust filed an accounting and asked for guidance in interpreting the 1961 trust instrument. The motion judge determined that the term \u201cspouse\u201d was clear and unambiguous and meant a person current<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ly married to one of the grantor\u2019s then-living children and did not include a divorced spouse or a surviving widow or surviving widower. In an unreported opinion, this court reversed the motion judge\u2019s determination that the meaning of the term \u201cspouse\u201d was clear and unambiguous, finding that the term was ambiguous on its face and remanded the matter for further discovery and trial on the grantor\u2019s probable intent in using the word \u201cspouse.\u201d <em>In Re 1961 Trust, </em>A-5762-96T1 (App.Div. Aug. 25, 1999) (slip op. at 20-29). This opinion also addressed a number of other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court reversed only that portion of this court\u2019s decision addressing the ability of third parties to challenge the paternity of one of the grantor\u2019s grandchildren by a particular marriage. <em>In re Trust Created December 20, 1961, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>340, 765 A.2d 746, <em>cert, denied sub nom Ryan v. Johnson, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>889,122 <em>S.Ct. </em>203,151 L.Ed.2d 143 (2001). The Court did not address the issues implicated in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Following a six-day bench trial, Judge Messina found that the grantor intended to include surviving spouses, but not surviving divorced spouses, as eligible beneficiaries. The trial judge admitted into evidence the testimony of the scrivener of the trust instrument. He also rejected a request to reform the 1961 Trust to exclude the so-called illegitimate daughter of one of the grant- or\u2019s sons and denied counsel fees to the surviving spouse who benefited from the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Four separate appeals were filed. These appeals originally calendared back-to-back are consolidated on the court\u2019s motion for purposes of opinion only. At oral argument, we were informed that the issues regarding Jenia Johnson as a beneficiary and the conflict of interest raised by Eric B. Ryan and Hillary A. Ryan in A-1487-03 had been dismissed. Thus, the only issues that will be addressed in this opinion are the rulings that a surviving spouse is an eligible beneficiary, a divorced spouse is not an eligible beneficiary, and that the prevailing surviving spouse is not entitled to an award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>J. Seward Johnson was born in 1895 and was a son of the founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson. During his life, Johnson established a number of trusts to which his several children were made beneficiaries. Four children were born to him and his first wife, Ruth: Mary Lea Johnson Ryan (1926), Elaine Johnson Wold (1927), J. Seward Johnson, Jr. (1930), and Diana Johnson Stokes (1932). Two children were born to him and his second wife, Esther: Jennifer Johnson Gregg (1941) and James Loring Johnson (1945). Among the trusts established by Johnson were four identical irrevocable trusts (the 1939 trusts) for the children of his first marriage. In 1944, Johnson created six substantially similar trusts (the 1944 trusts), one for each of his children and primarily funded with shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson stock. The 1944 trusts included power-of-appointment provisions that did not appear in the 1961 Trust at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Between 1948 and the creation of the 1961 Trust in December 1961, Johnson had eleven grandchildren, specifically, six by Mary Lea Johnson Ryan (Erie Ryan, 1951; Seward Ryan, 1952; Roderick Ryan, 1953; Hillary Ryan, 1954; Alice Ryan, 1956; and Quentin Ryan, 1958); two by Elaine Johnson Wold (Keith Wold, 1950; and Diana Wold, 1951); two by J. Seward, Jr. (Bruce Johnson,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1948; and Jenny Johnson,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1961), and one by Diana Johnson Stokes (Loran D.J. Stokes, 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">On December 20,1961, Johnson created the trust at issue in this appeal, the 1961 Trust. The trustees were to pay income to charities until the earlier of January 10, 1997, or the death of the last of certain named measuring lives, expressly, his first four children and all of his then-born eleven grandchildren. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>January 10, 1997, the trust provided as follows with respect to income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">[2.](b) [I]f this Trust shall still be in existence on January 10, 1997, ... and for so long as this Trust shall be in existence, to accumulate the net iiicome and add it at the end of each calendar year to the Trust Property provided, however, that the Trustees may use for or distribute and pay to and among the Grantor\u2019s four children, MARY LEA JOHNSON RYAN, ELAINE JOHNSON WOLD, JOHN SEWARD JOHNSON, JR., and DIANA MELVILLE JOHNSON STOKES, their spouses, and their issue, or any one or more of them, so much of the net income and in such shares as the Trustees in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion may deem to be for his or her best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Also after that date the trustees were authorized to make corpus distributions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">[3.](b.) After January 10,1997, and for so long as this Trust shall be in existence, from time to time, and whenever in the absolute and uncontrolled discretion of the Trustees they deem it to be for his or her interests, to use for or distribute and pay over to and among the Grantor\u2019s four children, MARY LEA JOHNSON RYAN, ELAINE JOHNSON WOLD, JOHN SEWARD JOHNSON, JR., and DIANA MELVILLE JOHNSON STOKES, their spouses, and their issue, or any one or more of them, in such shares as the Trustees may determine, to be his or hers absolutely, outright, and forever, any or all of the Trust Property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">At termination, the trustees were directed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxY\">[3.(c.)](i) to divide the Trust Property then remaining into as many equal shares as there shall be children of the Grantor\u2019s four children (MARY LEA JOHNSON RYAN, ELAINE JOHNSON WOLD, JOHN SEWARD JOHNSON, JR., and DIANA MELVILLE JOHNSON STOKES) then living, or children of the Grant- or's four children who died leaving issue who are then living, and to transfer and pay over, absolutely, outright, and forever, one of each such equal shares to each child then living of the Grantor\u2019s four children and one of each such equal shares to the issue, <em>per stirpes, </em>then living of each deceased child of the Grantor\u2019s four children, or failing all such persons, then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">(ii) to divide, transfer, and pay over, absolutely, outright, and forever, the Trust Property to those persons, other than the Grantor, who, under the laws of New Jersey then in force, would have been entitled to inherit from the children of the Grantor\u2019s four children, MARY LEA JOHNSON RYAN, ELAINE JOHNSON WOLD, JOHN SEWARD JOHNSON, Jr. and DIANA MELVILLE JOHNSON STOKES, (had such children of the Grantor\u2019s four children at that time died intestate domiciled in New Jersey) personal properly located in New Jersey of which he or she died possessed and in the same proportions as they would have been so entitled, or failing such persons, then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">... [to distribute the Trust Property to educational, religious or charitable organizations meeting certain IRS requirements and as selected by the trustees in their discretion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Thus, the 1961 Trust provided for discretionary distributions to \u201cspouse[s]\u201d after 1997, of income and corpus, until the trust\u2019s termination, at which point the children or issue of the oldest four Johnson children named in the instrument were to be the primary beneficiaries. Notably, designation as a beneficiary did not guarantee a distribution from the 1961 Trust, except on termination and then only to the beneficiaries designated to receive distributions on termination. The trustees were always to be two senior Johnson &amp; Johnson executives. The third trustee was originally Kenneth Perry, the former General Counsel of Johnson &amp; Johnson. He was succeeded in 1964 by James Hill, who remained a trustee at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The 1961 Trust does not define \u201cspouse.\u201d It does define \u201cissue,\u201d and it also provides a limitation on the number of adopted issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As with the grantor\u2019s prior trusts, the 1961 Trust was funded with Johnson &amp; Johnson stock. At the time of the creation of the 1961 Trust, the grantor\u2019s first four children were alive, married and none had been divorced. As of December 1961, none of the grantor\u2019s married grandchildren were yet divorced. Thereafter, additional grandchildren of the grantor were born or adopted (two to J. Seward, Jr., three to Diana Johnson Stokes, two to Jennifer Johnson Gregg, and seven to James Loring Johnson).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Much of the trial following the remand focused on the grantor\u2019s lawyer\u2019s knowledge and understanding of Johnson\u2019s intent under the 1961 Trust. Kenneth Perry, the former General Counsel of Johnson &amp; Johnson and the architect of the Johnson trust and estate plan, died in 1964. James Hill was hired by Perry as an attorney in 1949, and he eventually succeeded Perry in managing the Johnson estate and other personal family matters. Initially, Hill worked as Perry\u2019s subordinate or associate and under Perry\u2019s supervision drafted Johnson family wills and documents in addition to his other duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Johnson started to come to Hill\u2019s office on a regular basis and Hill sometimes went to meet Johnson at his house or farms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Occasionally, Hill traveled with Johnson. Hill felt that the two men came to know each other very well, and that Johnson approved of his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">By the early 1950s, Perry assumed special counsel status and moved to Arizona. Hill became the person in the Law Department with the day-to-day responsibility of addressing Johnson\u2019s questions. By this time, Hill was also serving as trustee of a number of trusts Johnson had established for family members. Hill also worked with Johnson on a host of family and charitable projects. Nevertheless, Hill continued to solicit Perry\u2019s approval of some of the legal work he performed on Johnson family matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Beginning in 1959 or 1960, based on what Hill had learned from another attorney in New York whom he held in high regard, Hill formed the idea to create what would become the 1961 Trust as part of an overall process of qualifying Johnson for the so-called unlimited charitable contribution deduction from income tax. Hill drafted the 1961 Trust document, but he sought Perry\u2019s review and advice throughout the finalization of the instrument because Perry designed Johnson\u2019s overall estate plan. Hill incorporated any concerns expressed by Perry and then presented the draft to Johnson, telling him of Perry\u2019s approval and discussing with Johnson whatever questions Johnson had. Hill observed Johnson read the documents. Johnson asked questions about the meaning of particular paragraphs during the extended drafting process. Johnson also proposed some changes, although Hill could not recall any specific ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">In that way, therefore, Hill tried to \u201cincorporate Mr. Johnson\u2019s intent.\u201d He recalled that the two men disagreed at times over a provision, and it would be changed to reflect Johnson\u2019s will, unless the change was not allowed by law. Alterations were made in the trust instrument almost up to the date of execution. It was finally executed by Johnson on December 20, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Hill provided a succinct overview of the 1961 Trust in the following testimony: \u201cWell, during the general term, it was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>devote all of its income to charity, and after the charitable term, the trustees would decide which members of the family [within the identified class] were to get how much and when.\u201d He further explained that Johnson excluded the two children by his second wife because Johnson was cognizant which children would inherit additional monies, and overall \u201che wanted the children generally to be treated equally.\u201d Regarding distributions prior to termination, Hill understood that Johnson wanted his trustees to have \u201cuncontrolled discretion\u201d as to whether any beneficiary received them, an intent Hill understood as complementing the grantor\u2019s general concern that the trustees be able to address what Johnson often referred to as the \u201cvicissitudes of life,\u201d or the \u201cunanticipated, unforeseen problems that would arise in anybody\u2019s life.\u201d The grantor \u201cwanted absolute maximum discretion\u201d given to the trustees so that \u201cthey would never be in trouble or sued or bothered by any \u2014 as he put it \u2014 lawyers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">With respect to the class of eligible beneficiaries, Hill had many discussions with Johnson but particularly recalled how Johnson was \u201cinsistent that the last two beneficiaries [the children of his son J. Seward Johnson, Jr.] be identified\u201d by name. He added that \u201cI think he thought it would help the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Hill was also sure he had conversations with Johnson about \u201cspouses of his children\u201d as a class of beneficiaries, but he could not recall them specifically. Nonetheless, Johnson did not want to \u201cdistinguish among the different classes of beneficiaries ...[,] [h]is children, spouses and grandchildren,\u201d saying instead \u201cthat that\u2019s up to the trustees to distribute within that broad category as they saw best.\u201d Thus, Hill believed that the grantor\u2019s intent was that surviving spouses of any of the named children should be considered beneficiaries under the trust. Although the grantor never expressed as much, and Hill \u201cnever discussed the subject directly with him,\u201d Hill added that \u201ccertainly, it was my understanding that he wanted to include surviving spouses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Hill garnered that impression from his long association with Johnson. Over time, the two men discussed family matters, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>well as \u201cworld issues,\u201d and Hill believed that they shared the same views about family in particular. He referred to Johnson as a \u201cfamily man.\u201d Johnson had what Hill agreed was a \u201cbroad definition\u201d of family, a view Hill likened to that held by \u201cmost laymen,\u201d the bounds of which included \u201cparents, children, spouses, nephews, nieces, grandparents, brothers, siblings.\u201d In fact, according to Hill, Johnson was \u201cdevoted\u201d to his family, and seemed to be interested in the spouses of his children as well as in his children themselves, though he was closer to some than others. Thus, Hill identified Johnson\u2019s overall goals in estate planning as providing for family and charities, noting that as time went by Johnson became more interested in charitable giving and particularly in the prospect of setting up a foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In addition to general conversations, Hill also recalled two particular subjects of conversations. One concerned a widow in Trenton whose infant son was the beneficiary of a considerable amount of money. The widow, however, had very little money because no provision had been made for her as the spouse or the surviving spouse. Hill recalled that the situation was terrible. Hill related that he \u201cgot the impression from [Johnson] that if somebody \u2014 somebody died and left a spouse that he would that [sic] spouse to be taken care of, either under the instrument or what have you.\u201d The second instance concerned Johnson\u2019s knowledge of the gift tax implications of gifts from a beneficiary to a spouse. Hill related that Johnson \u201cwas knowledgeable about tax law, and he knew that a beneficiary of his could not give to his or her spouse without worrying about gift tax, and he said how we can avoid that, and I said we\u2019ll permit transfers directly from the trust to the spouses.\u201d Hill noted, however, that \u201cI don\u2019t think he distinguished between surviving spouses and spouses at that time.\u201d Especially with respect to the tax issues and Johnson\u2019s concerns over limitations of gifts to a spouse, the grantor asked Hill whether he could \u201cavoid that in these documents, and I said yes, [and] I meant the trustees [would have the power] to distribute directly to a spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>As for divorced spouses generally, Hill testified that they were no longer considered a member of the family once there was a divorce. As Hill stated, \u201cthey were out of the family.\u201d He elaborated by reference to the personal history of Johnson and his brother, both of whom had been divorced. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">Well from his and brother\u2019s record of having been divorced a couple times and those spouses were no part of the family, and he never discussed specifically with me a divorced child that I recall, but I think he felt that way. Once you\u2019re divorced, you\u2019re out of the family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Nonetheless, during his testimony, Hill at times equivocated on the specifics of any discussion with Johnson of the word \u201cspouse,\u201d though he never represented he could recall an exact conversation of the subject. For example, in answer to the question \u201cdid you have any discussions with Mr. Johnson about spouses of his children?\u201d Hill replied, \u201cI\u2019m sure we did.\u201d Then, when asked further if they talked about spouses of his children \u201c[a]s a class of beneficiaries,\u201d he answered \u201cI\u2019m sure we did. I don\u2019t recall them.\u201d Or, when asked if Johnson ever expressed that he wanted \u201csurviving spouses\u201d to be eligible to \u201creceive distributions,\u201d Hill answered plainly: \u201c[H]e never said that, and I never discussed the subject directly with him, but certainly, it was my understanding that he wanted to include surviving spouses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Moreover, for Hill\u2019s part as scrivener \u201cI felt quite strongly that surviving spouses were part of the word \u2018spouse.\u2019 It was a redundancy\u201d as far as he was concerned and Hill believed that \u201cif it hadn\u2019t been [the grantor\u2019s] understanding, I think he would have communicated that to me.\u201d In any event Johnson never told Hill to exclude surviving spouses from the beneficiary class.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Over objection, Hill also was permitted to give not just his impressions, but also his opinions on Johnson\u2019s intent regarding surviving spouses and divorced spouses as beneficiaries under the 1961 Trust. He reiterated that Johnson intended the surviving spouses be included while divorced spouses were not to be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Johnson died in 1983. Mary Lea Johnson divorced William Ryan in 1972. They had six children. In 1973 or 1974, she met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Martin Richards and they married in 1978. She had no other children and remained married to Richards until her death in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">According to Richards, he and Johnson had a personal relationship. He remarked that Johnson was not an \u201coutgoing man,\u201d but he \u201cwas as close fas] one could possibly get with [Johnson].\u201d He recounted that Johnson taught him to fish and asked Richards to escort his third wife through Europe. Richards was at Johnson\u2019s side in the days leading to his death and on the day of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Richards acknowledged, however, that his relationship with Mary Lea Johnson Ryan\u2019s children was not harmonious even before her death. He described some of the acrimony that existed including litigation against their mother before her death in anticipation of estate issues. Richards inherited $42,000,000 from his wife, which he claimed \u201che never saw,\u201d although he conceded that he did create three charitable medical transplant trusts in her memory after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">According to Hill, in the course of administering the 1961 Trust, he had believed that Richards was a proper eligible beneficiary, but the other trustees disagreed with him. Ultimately, when the complaint in this case was filed, Hill acquiesced with their opinion, but he still believed that his opinion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Eric Ryan, one of Mary Lea\u2019s children, testified that certain incidents over the years led him to believe that Hill misapprehended the intended beneficiaries of the 1961 Trust. Ryan believed that the 1961 Trust was intended to primarily benefit the grandchildren\u2019s generation and beyond rather than the oldest four children. Ryan also acknowledged that he had disagreed with the trustees\u2019 disposition of a funding request he had presented to them. He emphasized, however, that they funded the proposal after further research on his grandfather\u2019s philanthropic history. These interactions caused him to doubt Hill\u2019s ability to accurately reflect his grandfather\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Following trial and the submission of proposed findings of fact, Judge Messina issued an oral opinion on July 14, 2003. In that opinion, he announced that he found Hill\u2019s testimony \u201creliable, trustworthy and very credible.\u201d Judge Messina proceeded to find that \u201cRichards is a member of the class of beneficiaries eligible under the 1961 Trust, and I find that Mr. Ryan is not.\u201d The judge then explained the reasons for his assessment of Hill as a witness; Judge Messina stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">I believe he had in my view impressive, professional credentials. He was a trusted member of the Law Department at Johnson and Johnson from 1949 to 1966. He did substantial personal work for members of the Johnson family. Hill knew Seward Johnson very well and had a close personal as well as professional relationship with him. In 1961 Hill was deeply involved with Johnson\u2019s estate planning and Hill himself was experienced in trust and estate and also the tax laws relating thereto. Hill was in a unique position to understand and to know Mr. Johnson\u2019s probable intent. Johnson\u2019s goals in estate planning were to provide for his family, to support charity and to minimize taxes. He was devoted to his family and this included spouses of his children who he considered to be within the family, at least unless divorced when he considered them to be out of the family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Judge Messina then found that Johnson took an active role in the formulation of the 1961 Trust. He made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">With regard to the preparation of the 1961 trust Johnson played an active role, he proposed and requested changes in the drafts. Hill and Johnson were very careful and Johnson would only sign if he chose to do so. Hill and Johnson worked very closely with each other with regard to the drafting of the 1961 trust document. The relationship between Johnson and Hill was such that Johnson wanted Hill to be a trustee. It was very important to Mr. Johnson that the trustees have utmost discretion with regard to the administration of the trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Judge Messina proceeded to then find that Johnson intended to designate a broad class of beneficiaries. He found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">Mr. Johnson intended a broad class of possible beneficiaries and he wanted his trustees in whom he had great trust and confidence to take into account the vicissitudes of life in allocating funds among the eligible members of the beneficiary class. Johnson and Hill did speak about spouses. Hill thought it was Johnson\u2019s objective to include surviving spouses, that the word spouses included surviving spouses and that the term surviving spouse was a redundancy. It is also noteworthy that if the word spouse had not been used and surviving spouse had been used that that would remove the spouses of living children as eligible beneficiaries and that certainly was not Johnson\u2019s intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The judge also expressly found that Johnson would have informed Hill, if he did not want surviving spouses included as beneficiaries. Moreover, the judge noted that Johnson had provided for surviving spouses in other trusts he had created, including the 1939 Trusts and the 1944 Trusts. Johnson also provided for his surviving spouse in his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In addition to the findings of fact rendered in his oral opinion, Judge Messina informed the parties that he adopted the proposed findings of fact submitted by Richards\u2019 attorney, except the portion that addressed judicial estoppel because he did not conclude as a matter of fact or law that the circumstances warranted invocation of the rule. The judge then applied these facts to the governing law. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">The Court in this case was charged with determining the probable intent of Mr. Johnson with regard to the word \u2014 word spouse in the 1961 trust. In doing this the Court looked at extrinsic evidence, the document itself and the language therein, and impulses common to human nature. The goal was to ascertain the grantor\u2019s intent and not be thwarted by stressing the literal meaning of word. The Court should put itself in the position of the grantor insofar as possible to attempt to accomplish what the grantor would have done had he envisioned the present inquiry and that\u2019s what I tried to do in reaching the determination which I have reached here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The judge noted that this court had found that the term was ambiguous on its face and that he was able to resort to a broad range of evidence to determine the probable intent of the grantor. The judge related that Hill testified based on personal knowledge not only of the grantor but also of the preparation of the trust instrument because he was the scrivener. Hill\u2019s testimony and the other estate planning measures used by Johnson over the years revealed that he wanted to provide for his family and that he had a broad sense of family because he included as beneficiaries the spouses of his children. Moreover, in his 1939, 1944 and 1961 Trusts, he provided for surviving spouses. On the other hand, Johnson\u2019s broad sense of family did not include divorced spouses. He had never made provision for divorced spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">As to human impulses, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>With regal\u2019d to human impulses, Johnson consistently included surviving spouses within his broad concept of family and as possible beneficiaries. There is nothing inconsistent with Johnson\u2019s actions generally and in other estate planning instruments with regard to human impulses. Human experience teaches us that a husband does not lose his status as a spouse merely because his wife passes away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On the other hand, common human impulses can be utilized to exclude divorced spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Judge Messina held that Ryan\u2019s argument that the term \u201cspouse\u201d in the 1961 Trust was determined at the time of the execution of the trust instrument was unpersuasive. He noted that the children were referred to expressly by name, but the general term \u201cspouse\u201d and \u201cissue\u201d were used, thereby indicating that \u201cmembership in the class of beneficiaries was to be kept open and determined at the time of distribution.\u201d He asserted that the trust created a \u201cclass gift to a class of persons.\u201d Once again, he held that \u201cit was clear from the testimony that Mr. Johnson considered divorced spouses out of the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Although Judge Messina ruled in favor of Richards, the surviving spouse, he denied his application for attorneys\u2019 fees. This court had previously denied Richards\u2019 application for attorneys\u2019 fees because he had not sought to protect the trust. <em>In re 1961 Trust, supra, </em>slip op. at 72-73. Judge Messina reasoned that Richards was furthering his own interests; therefore, he would not allow trust funds to bear the cost of his litigation. The judge also denied Richards\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Although the judge acknowledged Richards\u2019 claim that he was furthering the best interests of the trust, as well as the rights of other potential beneficiaries, he repeated that ultimately Richards was pursuing his own personal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Although stated in different ways by the several appellants, the issues before this court on appeal can generally be characterized as follows. First, the court erred in construing the term \u201cspouses\u201d to include surviving spouses; second, the court erred by construing the word \u201cspouses\u201d to exclude divorced spouses; third, the court erred by receiving testimony from Hill and Richards on the question of the grantor\u2019s intent; fourth, the trial judge erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>in allowing Hill to express an opinion on the issue of the meaning of the term \u201cspouses\u201d; fifth, the findings of faet are not supported by credible evidence in the record; and sixth, the trial judge erred in denying attorneys\u2019 fees to Richards.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We start by recognizing the limited scope of review of an appellate tribunal of findings of fact made by a judge sitting without a jury. A trial judge\u2019s findings are binding on appeal as long as those findings are supported by adequate, substantial credible evidence. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-12, 713 A.2d 390 (1998) (citing <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)). Such deference is particularly \u201cappropriate when the evidence is largely testimonial and involves questions of credibility.\u201d <em>In re J.W.D., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>108, 117, 693 A.2d 92 (1997). This standard of review does not absolve this court from conducting a painstaking review of the record. We may not, however, substitute our view of the evidence if we determine that the trial judge\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Appellants contend that the trial judge\u2019s adoption of the findings of fact submitted on behalf of Richards prevents this court from conducting a careful review of the record. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\"><em>Rule </em>l:7-4(a) requires a judge to issue a decision either orally or in writing which \u201cfind[s] the facts and state[s] its conclusions of law thereon in all actions tried without a jury____\u201d How that is accomplished is vested in the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Homann v. Torchinsky, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 340, 686 A.2d 1226 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>141, 693 A.2d 110 (1997). Thus, a judge may grant or deny a new trial motion \u201cfor the reasons posited by the parties\u201d rather than issue a statement of its grounds, <em>Vartenissian v. Food Haulers, Inc., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>603, 612, 475 A.2d 626 (App.Div.1984), as long as the judge makes such reliance explicit. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>on <em>B. </em>1:7-4 (2006). The purpose of the rule is to make sure that the court makes its own determination of the matter. <em>See Jarvis v. Jarvis, </em>832 A.2d 775, 779 (Me.2003) (expressing approval of \u201ca trial court considering and utilizing, when appropriate\u201d draft orders and findings, even without itself amending them, so long as on review it is clear they \u201creflect the application of judgment by the court and not simply one of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Here, Judge Messina made clear the extent of his agreement with and reliance on Richards\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. He also supplied a summary of his findings in his oral opinion. The oral opinion provides clear evidence that the trial judge carefully considered the evidentiary record and did not abdicate his decision-making responsibility. Moreover, his adoption of a substantial portion of one party\u2019s submission does not hamper our appellate function in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We have carefully reviewed the record in its entirety and conclude that the trial judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. Judge Messina considered and accepted the testimony of Hill. As the drafter of the 1961 Trust, he was in a particularly favored position to understand the purpose of the 1961 Trust and the intent of the grantor. Moreover, Hill was thoroughly versed in the entire estate plan. The 1961 Trust was not an isolated document. Rather, it was part of a complex estate plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Hill was also required to learn Johnson\u2019s goals. Over the years, he learned that Johnson wanted to care for his family, minimize taxes, and distribute funds to charities. As to his family, Hill learned of Johnson\u2019s interest in not only his children, but also their spouses. He also perceived by observation that Johnson\u2019s interest in spouses vanished on the occasion of a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Hill\u2019s statement that he considered use of the term \u201csurviving spouse\u201d redundant and the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of this statement has evidential support. First, Hill recounted two instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>in which he and Johnson spoke of situations in which no provision had been made for a surviving spouse. He also related that Johnson was troubled by the omission. It is not unreasonable to find that Johnson did not want that to occur in his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In addition, Hill\u2019s familiarity with the other trusts created by Johnson, in which express provision had been made for surviving spouses, supports Hill\u2019s statement that the use of the term was unnecessary. To him, prior practice had manifested the grantor\u2019s inclusiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Although the reference to surviving spouses in the other trusts appears in a provision concerning the Johnson children\u2019s ability to exercise a power of appointment, the inclusion of surviving spouses in this limited fashion is no less instructive of Johnson\u2019s view of family. Indeed, it corroborates Hill\u2019s testimony of Johnson\u2019s inclusive concept of family. It indicates his willingness to allow his fortune to be shared with a person who became associated with the family through marriage. The caveat was that the person must continue to be married to one of his children at the time of the child\u2019s death. By the same token, the use of the term in the other trust instruments also corroborates Hill\u2019s testimony that a person was no longer included as family once divorced. Moreover, there is no evidence that Johnson ever instructed Hill to exclude surviving spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Judge Messina also referenced the entire testamentary and estate plan. As noted, that plan revealed a grantor who favored not only his children and their issue, but also their spouses. Coupled with Hill\u2019s testimony about Johnson\u2019s interest in his family, including the spouses of his children, Judge Messina had substantial evidence from which he could find that Johnson did not intend to sever ties with the surviving spouse of a child. By contrast, the record also firmly supports the finding that Johnson had no interest in furthering the interests of a child\u2019s spouse once a child parted from a spouse through divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Our responsibility as an appellate tribunal does not stop at this point. We must also determine whether the trial judge properly admitted the testimony of Hill and Richards and whether he properly applied the governing law to the facts as found.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In our prior opinion, we held that the term \u201cspouses\u201d was ambiguous and that the intent of the grantor could not be determined without resort to extrinsic evidence. <em>In re 1961 Trust, </em>slip op. at 20-28. We reversed the summary judgment order and remanded for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 29. The Supreme Court did not disturb that disposition. <em>In re Trust Created December 20, 1961, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 340, 765 A.2d 746. We discern no basis to disturb that prior ruling. Similarly, the pre-trial motion for summary judgment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Recently, the Supreme Court addressed the rule of probable intent. <em>In re Estate of Payne, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>324, 895 A.2d 428 (2006), provides a succinct summary of the purpose of the rule and the tools available to ascertain a testator\u2019s or grantor\u2019s probable intent. Justice Wallace wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">In interpreting a will, our aim is to ascertain the intent of the testator. \u2018[W]hen we say we are determining the testator\u2019s intent, we mean his probable intent.\u2019 <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Robert, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>561, 564, 178 A.2d 185 (1962) (citation omitted). We continue to adhere to the view of the doctrine of probable intent expressed by <em>Fidelity Union. </em>In that case, the Court stated that in determining the testator\u2019s subjective intent, \u2018courts will give primary emphasis to his dominant plan and purpose as they appear from the entirety of his will when read and considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 564-65, 178 A.2d 185. The trial court should \u2018ascribe to the testator \u2018those impulses which are common to human nature and ... construe the will so as to effectuate those impulses.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 565, 178 A.2d 185 (citation omitted). More recently, this Court emphasized that \u2018[ejourts are enjoined to \u2018strain\u2019 toward effectuating the testator\u2019s probable intent \u2018to accomplish what he would have done had he envisioned the present inquiry.\u2019 <em>In re Estate of Branigan, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>324, 332, 609 A.2d 431 (1992) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">The trial court is not \u2018limited simply to searching out the probable meaning intended by the words and phrases in the will.\u2019 <em>Engle v. Siegel, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>287, 291, 377 A.2d 892 (1977). Extrinsic evidence may \u2018furnish [ ] information regarding the circumstances surrounding the testator [and] should be admitted to aid in ascertaining [the testator\u2019s] probable intent under the Will.\u2019 <em>Wilson v. Flowers, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>250, 260, 277 A.2d 199 (1971). To be sure, the testator\u2019s own expressions of his or her intent are highly relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63, 277 A.2d 199. Once the evidence establishes the probable intent of the testator, \u2018the court may not refuse to effectuate that intent by indulging in a merely literal reading of the instrument.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 260, 277 A.2d 199.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 335, 895 A.2d 428.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In <em>Payne, </em>the Court considered a direct statement of the testator in a letter to the attorney drafting his will to ascertain the testator\u2019s probable intent that any property burdened by a debt should pass debt-free to his heirs. <em>Id. </em>at 336-37, 895 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In <em>Fidelity Union, </em>the Court held that the trial court should have admitted an affidavit of a grandson of the testator to ascertain the probable intent of the testator. <em>Fidelity Union, supra, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 178 A.2d 185. The affidavit contained a statement that the testator disliked his sons-in-law and did not believe women should have large sums of money but should have an adequate income. <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Robert, </em>67 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564, 573,171 A.2d 348 (App.Div.1961). In <em>Flowers, </em>the trial court received testimony from the scrivener of the document. He testified that he used the words \u201cphilanthropic\u201d in place of the word \u201ccharitable\u201d because he had an aversion to using the same word twice in a sentence. <em>Flowers, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 259, 277 A.2d 199. With that testimony, the Court held that trust funds should be distributed only to charitable organizations. <em>Id. </em>at 264, 277 A.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The testimony of Hill was properly admitted at trial. Indeed, as explained in <em>Fidelity Union </em>and its progeny, the exclusion of this testimony would have been error. Hill was the person entrusted with drafting the document. His statement that he considered the term \u201csurviving spouse\u201d redundant is no less relevant than the testimony of the scrivener in <em>Flowers. </em>He also was in a unique position to provide information about the circumstances surrounding the drafting and execution of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Similarly, the testimony of Eric Ryan was also properly admitted. It served to cast doubt on Hill\u2019s apparent lack of bias and Hill\u2019s interpretation of the grantor\u2019s intent. The testimony of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>fered by Richards was of marginal relevance. He did not know Johnson\u2019s daughter at the time of the execution of the 1961 Trust; therefore, his testimony provided no information about the circumstances at the time of execution. He was able to provide some information, however, on the manner in which Johnson treated people once they became \u201cfamily\u201d by virtue of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Contrary to the assertion of appellants Eric and Hillary Ryan, we do not perceive that the trial judge viewed Hill as a lay expert on the interpretation of the 1961 Trust. The drafter of a will or trust has long been recognized as a primary source of information about the formulation of the contested document. It is the drafter who is usually in the best position to provide specific information about the testator\u2019s or grantor\u2019s concerns and desires. It is from the drafter that the court is often able to obtain evidence of direct statements of the grantor. <em>See Engle, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 295-96, 377 A.2d 892 (relating conversations between the testators that occurred in the presence of the drafter). Here, Hill was undoubtedly well-educated and skilled in estate planning and the preparation of the requisite documents. It is clear, however, that Judge Messina\u2019s findings are founded on Hill\u2019s role as the drafter and confidant of the grantor rather than his position as a skilled estate planning professional.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Judge Messina utilized several accepted forms of extrinsic evidence to ascertain Johnson\u2019s probable intent. He carefully considered the testimony of Hill, the drafter. He examined the entire testamentary and estate plan. He considered common human impulses. All of these resources are considered reliable sources of information. <em>In re Estate of Payne, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 335, 895 A.2d 428. Appellants rely on <em>In re Estate of Bonardi, </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>508, 871 A.2d 103 (App.Div.2005). Although we focused entirely on the text of the trust instrument to reverse an order allowing termination of a trust, we did not hold that extrinsic evidence of intent was inadmissible, or, if admissible, of no probative value. <em>Id. </em>at 519-20, 871 A.2d 103. Rather, the text of the trust instrument left no doubt that the relief requested by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the widow was wholly contrary to the probable intent of her deceased husband. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 871 A.2d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We are also unpersuaded by the argument that the trial judge improperly failed to consider the issue of when a spouse\u2019s interest vested. William Ryan, the divorced husband of Mary Lea Johnson Ryan, argues that his interest vested at the time the trust was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Initially, we note that Judge Messina ruled on this issue by implication. He found that the class of spouses and grandchildren was an open class to be determined in January 1997, when beneficiaries could receive distributions from the trust. Of greater significance, the ruling comports with the general rule for identification of a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Article 3(b) of the 1961 Trust allows the distribution of net income after January 10, 1997, and until the termination of the trust. The persons who may receive a distribution of net income are designated by name or by class, such as spouses and issue. Here, we must determine whether the named beneficiaries\u2019 spouses are those at the time the agreement was executed or at the time the beneficiaries are eligible to receive a distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Generally, when property is to be divided among members of a group, such as children, grandchildren or spouses, membership in the group is defined at the time of distribution. Scott, <em>The Law of Trusts </em>\u00a7 127.4 (2001). In the case of a postponed gift, as exists in this case, membership in the group is ascertained at the end of the postponed period. <em>Restatement of Property </em>\u00a7 308, comment I (1940). In all instances, the language of the trust document is determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\"><em>In re Twist for the Benefit of Dons Duke, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>408, 702 A.2d 1008 (Ch.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 702 A.2d 1007 (App.Div.), <em>certif denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>73, 697 A.2d 546 (1997), reflects this general rule. In <em>Duke, </em>the issue was whether an adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>adult was a lineal descendent and, thus, a beneficiary of the trust. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 702 A.2d 1008. The trial judge recognized the general rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">A class gift is defined as a gift to a group of persons, which group is uncertain in number at the time the gift is made and which is to be ascertained at a future time, who are all to take in equal or other definite proportions. <em>Rippel v. King, </em>126 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>297, 8 A.2d 777 (Ch.1989), <em>aff'd, </em>128 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>179, 15 A.2d 758 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A.1940)____ When a class gift is made, the testator is presumed to intend that those shall take it who constitute the class at the time the gift is to take effect, providing no contrary intent is shown. <em>Damron v. Mast, </em>121 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>489, 191 <em>A. </em>467 (Ch.1937). A class must be determined as of the date of death of the [settlor], unless the indenture or will plainly indicates otherwise. <em>[Commercial Trust Co. of N.J. v.] Adelung, </em>136 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>37, 40 <em>A.2d </em>214 [E. &amp; A.1946]. Here the instrument clearly requires the determination to be made as of Miss Duke\u2019s death, since her lineal descendants cannot be ascertained until her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 425, 702 A.2d 1008.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In <em>Duke, </em>the trial judge held that the adult adoptee could not be considered a lineal descendent because the trust provided that the law in effect at the time the trust was created was to be applied in construing the document. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 702 A.2d 1008. The law in effect at the time did not recognize adult adoptions, thereby precluding the adoptee from qualification as a lineal descendent. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 702 A.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Here, unlike <em>Duke, </em>the 1961 Trust does not designate the law to be applied in the event construction of the instrument is required. On the other hand, as in <em>Duke, </em>the composition of the class of issue and spouses could only be determined at the time of distribution. Therefore, we reject William Ryan\u2019s contention that composition of the class of spouses was fixed as of the execution date of the 1961 Trust rather than the date at which the designated beneficiaries were eligible to receive distribution of net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Finally, we address Richard\u2019s contention that the trial judge should have granted his application for attorneys\u2019 fees. Richards argues that his complaint served to clarify the trust instrument and that the ruling may benefit others in the future. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The trial judge held that Richards was \u201cprimarily attempting to further his own interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The court may award counsel fees in any case where such fees are permitted by statute. <em>R. </em>4:42 \u2014 9(a)(8). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:14-23(1) authorizes trustees \u201cto employ and compensate attorneys for services rendered to the estate or trust or to a fiduciary in the performance of his duties.\u201d Furthermore, under <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(2), a fiduciary may make counsel fee payments from a fee entrusted to him or her \u201csubject to approval and allowance or to disallowance by the court upon settlement of the account.\u201d <em>See also R. </em>4:42-9(a)(3) (awards in probate actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">With respect to funds in court, the justification for an allowance of counsel fees is found in part in an acknowledgment of a litigant\u2019s efforts to create sums to benefit others. <em>Sunset Beach Amusement Corp. v. Belk, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>162, 169, 162 A.2d 834 (1960). If counsel fees are not provided for by statute, rule or contract, they are generally borne by the parties themselves. <em>Satellite Gateway Commc\u2019ns v. Musi Dining Car Co., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>280, 285, 540 A.2d 1267 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In certain circumstances, our courts will allow payment of counsel fees necessary to interpret a will or trust. <em>Risley v. Kirkman, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>464, 471, 267 A.2d 50 (1970). In <em>Risley, </em>the challenger was the decedent\u2019s widow who was successful in her efforts to obtain a life estate in her late husband\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 267 A.2d 50. On appeal, the Court reversed the denial of fees to the widow noting that the sole beneficiary was the decedent\u2019s attorney and the attorney\u2019s partner had drawn the will. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 267 A.2d 50. Moreover, there was evidence that the decedent had given instructions to provide for his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 267 A.2d 50. Holding that the widow was entitled to an actual trust, the Court held that she was entitled to counsel fees but only limited to that narrow aspect of her claim. <em>Id. </em>at 471-72, 267 A.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">This court also upheld a counsel fee award limited to the fees incurred to prosecute the removal of an administratrix of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>estate. <em>In re Estate of Silverman, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189,194-95, 227 A.2d 519 (App.Div.1967).

As a surviving spouse, Richards has succeeded only in being added to the class of beneficiaries who may receive a distribution. Due to the vast discretion bestowed on the trustees, Richards\u2019 success simply establishes eligibility; it does not assure a monetary award. It is simply too speculative whether his success may benefit similarly situated spouses. This uncertainty strongly suggests that the litigation is a personal success and, as such, does not warrant an award of counsel fees. Under these circumstances, we discern no legal error and certainly no abuse of the discretion reposed in the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> Bruce was adopted by J.

After correctly determining that, as a matter of probable intent, the term spouse as used in the 1961 Trust is not broad enough to include former (divorced) spouses, the majority nevertheless deems the term not too restrictive so as to exclude widows or widowers of Johnson\u2019s deceased children, a result in which I do not concur.

Jacobs </em>\u2014 The <em>Doctrine of Probable Intent, </em>28 <em>Rutg. L.Rev., </em>251, 259 (1974)). Wilson is a will construction ease in which the issue was whether the scrivener\u2019s use of the word \u201cphilanthropic\u201d was intended to be the legal equivalent of \u201ccharitable.\u201d <em>Wilson,, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 263, 277 A.2d 199. In finding the terms interchangeable, the Court relied chiefly on the scrivener\u2019s testimony as to the testator\u2019s express and direct declarations that he wanted his entire residuary estate to go to charity, and that the scrivener used the word \u201cphilanthropic\u201d as a synonym for \u201ccharitable.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Courts, however, have been careful to distinguish between direct statements of a testator or grantor, which constitute competent evidence bearing on dispositional intent, and mere opinions or beliefs of third parties as to the grantor\u2019s or testator\u2019s probable intent, which are irrelevant and inadmissible. Thus, for example, in <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>the will, which gave the corpus of each child\u2019s trust to that child\u2019s \u201cdescendants per stirpes\u201d, was other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>wise silent as to whether adopted children of the testator\u2019s daughter were entitled to take the corpus of the daughter\u2019s trust after her death. In holding for the adopted children, the Court flatly rejected, as incompetent, the \u201copinion\u201d testimony of the testator\u2019s cousin that he believed the testator would not have wanted an adopted child to take based on the premise that he and the testator thought alike. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, supra, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>at 417, 251 A.2d 128. In marked contrast, in <em>Engle, </em>the testimony of the draftsman, recalling the testator\u2019s clear and direct declaration that in the event of a common disaster, he and his wife would like all of their property to be divided equally between their two families, was deemed not only competent, but dispositive of the testator\u2019s probable testamentary intent. <em>Engle, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 295-96, 377 A.2d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The recent case of <em>Payne </em>distinguished between both kinds of proofs. The issue in <em>Payne </em>was whether the testator intended that his New Jersey home pass unencumbered to his devisee. His will specifically provided that the mortgage on his Maine vacation home would be satisfied from the estate, but omitted any mention of the New Jersey residence. In light of this omission, the Court resorted to extrinsic evidence, finding dispositive a letter from the testator to his attorney expressing the testator\u2019s clear desire to pay off the mortgages on all his real estate, and soundly rejecting both the draftsman\u2019s testimonial account of what he believed the testator meant and his interpretation of the otherwise clearly worded letter. <em>Payne, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 338, 895 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Here, in ruling that the term \u201cspouse\u201d includes widows and widowers who thereby fall within the eligible class of spouse beneficiaries of the 1961 trust entitled to receive distributions from the trustees in their absolute discretion, the trial judge relied heavily on the testimony of the primary witness, the trust draftsman, James Hill. But, as all concede, there were no particular expressions from Johnson to Hill about the meaning of the term \u201cspouse\u201d or the qualification of surviving spouses of his deceased children to take under the trust instrument. Hill himself acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>edged \u201cnever discussing] the subject directly with [Johnson]\u201d, and could recall, like the draftsman in <em>Payne, </em>no conversations with Johnson in which the settlor dealt expressly with \u201csurviving spouse\u201d or directly stated his intentions as to them. Rather, Hill\u2019s testimony, insofar as it bore on the issue of Johnson\u2019s probable intent, was couched in such qualifying terms as \u201cit was my understanding\u201d, \u201cgeneral impression,\u201d \u201cthinking,\u201d \u201cbelief,\u201d or \u201cfeeling\u201d. Having ruled Hill competent, as draftsman, to answer questions about Johnson\u2019s intentions, the trial judge allowed Hill to testify as to what he believed Johnson meant in connection with drafting the 1961 trust and permitted the witness to opine as to Johnson\u2019s understanding in using words like \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cspouse\u201d in the trust document. In other words, Hill expressed his opinion as to what he thought Johnson\u2019s intent was, rather than recount actual statements of intent directly from the settlor himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Such an attempt at proof does not suffice to establish a grant- or\u2019s probable intent. Hill\u2019s belief is no more than a conclusion by supposition of the grantor\u2019s state of mind and, therefore, inadmissible as failing the requisite testimonial qualification of personal knowledge. <em>See Priest v. Poleshuck, 15 N.J. </em>557, 562-63,105 A.2d 541 (1954); <em>State v. Colon, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 614, 588 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1991); <em>In re Trust ex rel. Duke, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>408, 420, 424, 702 A.2d 1008 (Ch.Div.1995), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 702 A.2d 1007 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>73, 697 A.2d 546 (1997); <em>see also Hester v. BIC Corp., </em>225 F.3d 178, 184-85 (2d Cir.2000). It really amounts to no more than mere impression, rather than competent proof, and falls far short of the requisite declaration or expression of a grantor\u2019s intent. Worse yet, it is an opinion questionably formed since seemingly predicated largely on Johnson\u2019s perceived negative reaction to Hill\u2019s anecdotal account of a Mercer County widow left penniless while her minor child inherited a substantial amount of money. Having testified from no surer ground than his subjective thinking, Hill\u2019s testimony does not, in my view, support the conclusion that \u201csurviving spouses\u201d qualify as a beneficiary class under the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Nor do the surrounding circumstances, to the extent relied upon by the trial court, support its finding. Nothing in the overall dispositional scheme, nor in tax minimization strategies, nor in \u201cimpulses common to human nature\u201d, suggests that Johnson intended to make surviving spouses eligible for the beneficiary class. In fact, just the opposite appears from this record. When Johnson wanted to make provision for surviving spouses, he specifically and expressly did so, as in the earlier 1939 and 1944 trusts, and, therefore, their omission from the 1961 trust is telling. Indeed, in the 1961 trust, no \u201cspouse\u201d of a child was even named as a measuring life or provided for in the event that all of the grantor\u2019s children, grandchildren and their issue had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Lacking any foundation either in the settlor\u2019s own words or surrounding circumstances, Hill\u2019s opinion testimony does not qualify as competent proof of Johnson\u2019s probable intent. Having failed to carry his burden of proving eligibility for the class of spouse beneficiaries of the 1961 trust, <em>Payne, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 338, 895 A.2d 428, respondent Martin Richards, in my view, is not entitled to receive distributions thereunder and I would, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\"> \"[GJeneral principles governing the interpretation of a trust instrument are the same as those ... governing] interpretation of ...
