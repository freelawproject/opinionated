On appeal, the State contends the trial court \u201cdiscounted the prosecutor\u2019s stated consideration of defendant\u2019s mental illness\u201d and \u201csubstituted its judgment for that of the prosecutor.\u201d Based on our review of the record and the applicable law, we conclude the prosecutor\u2019s decision to reject defendant\u2019s application was not a patent and gross abuse of discretion, and we reverse the order admitting defendant into PTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In a five-count indictment, defendant was charged with third-degree terroristic threats, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3(a) and (b) (counts one and two); third-degree resisting arrest, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2(a)(3)(a) and/or (b) (count three); third-degree possession of a weapon (kitchen knives and a butcher knife) for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(d) (count four); and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d) (count five). On April 23, 2007, a PTI investigator provided a report to the court recommending defendant be accepted into the PTI program. The report noted defendant was a forty-eight-year-old female who had \u201cno prior criminal involvement,\u201d and concluded she was \u201ca suitable candidate for participation in PTI provided she eomplie[d] with directives regarding her mental health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In a four-page \u201cPTI rejection memorandum\u201d dated May 16, 2007, the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office described the events leading up to defendant\u2019s arrest as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">On November 21, 2006[,] at approximately 10:19 [p.m.,] Sergeant William Cowan, Corporal Mary Ann Smith, Patrolman Michael Tristao, Patrolman [Richard] Jaeger and Patrolman [William] Marvel were dispatched ... in response to the homeowner, Thelma Stewart[,] reporting that her daughter, the defendant^] was out of control in the house and was armed with a knife. All units arrived at the same time. Upon approaching the house the defendant had the front door open and the screen door open and yelled to the police as they approached, \u201cI am going to string you up tonight, you are done.\u201d The defendant continued to yell and told the police to leave. The defendant at this time was armed with two large kitchen knives in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>her left hand and a large meat cleaver in her right hand. The defendant pointed the knives at the police and yelled, \u201cI will kill you unless you can prove who you are.\u201d All officers on the scene were dressed in full uniform. Corporal Smith told the defendant her name and told her to put the knives down____ The defendant though kept flailing the knives pointing the knives in the direction of the police and acting as if she was going to throw them at the police____ The defendant was told again to put the knives down so that the police could talk to her. She refused and continued yelling that she was going to kill the police.... The defendant continued to yell and was more violent and began cutting and stabbing a cardboard box that was on the front porch. The defendant stated that this is what she was going to do [to] the police.... The defendant was told repeatedly to put the knives down, but she refused____ Patrolman Tristao then sprayed his mace at the defendant. She turned her head and then came back out even more agitated. Patrolman Tristao sprayed again and this time the defendant was more affected by the spray and slammed the door ... At this point the defendant was in the kitchen and still agitated and yelling. The defendant came to the door and opened it. Patrolman Tristao and Patrolman [Jaeger] ... were able to secure the defendant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">... While the defendant was being taken into control she attempted several times to force her way out of the police officers]?] hold____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-13\">The defendant is currently disabled and not employed____She began receiving [S]ocial [S]ecurity disability in December of 2006. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-15\">... [The defendant] states that she has a history of depression since the 1990\u2019s. In November of 2006[,] she was admitted to the Riverview Medical Center for five days for depression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">While noting defendant had presented \u201cpositive facts\u201d in support of her application, the prosecutor found \u201cthe negative factors significantly outweigh the positive making the defendant an inappropriate candidate for PTI.\u201d The prosecutor gave three reasons for rejecting defendant\u2019s PTI application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-17\">1. ) [N.J.S.A] 2C:43-12e(2) The facts of the case. The facts of this case show that the defendant\u2019s mother called the police because her daughter, the defendant was out of control and armed with a knife ... The defendant in this case armed herself with several knives and a meat cleaver and subsequently threatened five police officers. It took police time and effort to subdue the defendant who resisted arrest. Two police officers suffered minor injuries as a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-18\">2. ) [W./.S.A] 2C:43-12e(4) The desire of the complainant or victim to forego prosecution. Sergeant [Cowan] has responded on behalf of the police officers involved and is opposed to the defendant\u2019s entry into PTI. He described this as one of the most stressful calls he has been on____ He and the other officers oppose PTI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>3.) [W./.S.A] 2C:43-12e(10) Whether or not the crime is of an assaultive or violent nature, whether in the criminal act itself or the possible injurious consequences of such behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">After learning her application was rejected, defendant provided the prosecutor with additional medical documentation and requested reconsideration of her application. The additional information included a letter from Dr. Sahar Kousa stating defendant was \u201cbeing treated for Schizophrenia, a severe and persistent mental illness.\u201d Defendant also presented a letter from Dr. Fazal R. Panezai indicating she was suffering from \u201cparanoid ideation requiring life long medications.\u201d In a letter dated July 18, 2007, the PTI prosecutor advised defendant\u2019s attorney that the additional medical information had been considered \u201cin conjunction with the application and the entire file,\u201d but the State maintained \u201cits original rejection of the defendant\u2019s application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Pursuant to <em>R. </em>8:28(h), defendant appealed the prosecutor\u2019s decision and the matter was heard by the trial court on August 8, 2007. Defendant\u2019s attorney argued the charges resulted from \u201can isolated event because Miss Hoffman has no prior criminal history whatsoever.\u201d He also explained defendant\u2019s \u201cparanoia condition\u201d caused her to believe \u201cthere were intruders in the house [and] she responded by grabbing a meat cleaver and a knife.\u201d On the other hand, the prosecutor argued defendant created a \u201cvery[,] very dangerous situation,\u201d and it would be appropriate to have her \u201cpsychiatric status\u201d monitored by the Monmouth County Probation Department. Following oral argument, the trial court found the prosecutor\u2019s decision \u201cwas a gross and patent abuse of discretion\u201d because (1) the prosecutor \u201creally didn\u2019t consider\u201d defendant\u2019s mental illness, (2) the prosecutor relied too heavily on the \u201cassaultive nature\u201d of the offenses, and (3) the prosecutor placed \u201ctoo much emphasis\u201d on the wishes of the victims. The court\u2019s decision included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">The State argues that the police were called by the defendant\u2019s mother because she was out of control and armed with knives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">They further assert that the defendant threatened the police with knives and resisted arrest and, therefore, there were minor injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>But, I think the prosecutor has not considered a lot of the other facts of the case here; and that is that this defendant is ill____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">Also, the desire of the complainant to forgo prosecution, certainly the police have been upset. They claim they were upset. They claim they were stressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Being a policeman in and of itself is a stressful position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">So I don\u2019t think we can consider solely the fact that the complainant or the victims do not wish to forgo prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">And the third, whether or not the crime is of an assaultive or violent nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">... [Although [the prosecutor\u2019s office] sent a letter, stating that they considered the defendant\u2019s mental illness, they really didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">They did not consider the facts of the case in their entirety and placed too much emphasis on the desire of the complainant to forgo prosecution and also that the crime was of an assaultive nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">So I will find that this is a patent and gross abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">I will grant the motion and the defendant will be accepted into the PTI program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">PTI has been described as \u201ca discretionary program diverting criminal defendants from formal prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Caliguiri, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>28, 35, 726 A.2d 912 (1999). The scope of judicial review of a decision to reject a PTI application is \u201cseverely limited.\u201d <em>State v. Negran, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>73, 82, 835 A.2d 301 (2003). A defendant seeking to overcome rejection <em>from </em>PTI must \u201cclearly and convincingly establish that the prosecutor\u2019s decision constitutes a patent and gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Watkins, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>302, 305, 915 A.2d 561 (App.Div.2007), <em>aff'd, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>507, 940 A.2d 1173 (2008); <em>see also State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 582-83, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996) (\u201cA patent and gross abuse of discretion is more than just an abuse of discretion as traditionally conceived; it is a prosecutorial decision that has gone so wide of the mark sought to be accomplished by PTI that fundamental fairness and justice require judicial intervention.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). In <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 93, 402 A.2d 217 (1979) (citation omitted), the Court elaborated on the patent and gross abuse of discretion standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">Ordinarily, an abuse of discretion will be manifest if defendant can show that a prosecutorial veto (a) was not premised upon a consideration of all relevant factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>(b) was based upon a consideration of irrelevant or inappropriate factors, or (e) amounted to a clear error in judgment In order for such an abuse of discretion to rise to the level of \u201cpatent and gross,\u201d it must further be shown that the prosecutorial error complained of will clearly subvert the goals underlying Pretrial Intervention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Prosecutors are guided by a number of different principles when determining whether a defendant qualifies for PTI. For example, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-12(e) lists seventeen factors that prosecutors \u201cshall consider in formulating their recommendation of an applicant\u2019s participation in a supervisory treatment program.\u201d Included among these factors is the \u201cnature of the offense,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-12(e)(l), the \u201cdesire of the complainant or victim to forego prosecution,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2G:43-12(e)(4), and \u201c[w]hether or not the crime is of an assaultive or violent nature,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-12(e)(10). Moreover, <em>R. </em>3:28 provides eight \u201cGuidelines,\u201d which prosecutors shall consider in determining whether PTI is appropriate. For instance, Guideline 3(i) states individuals who engage in crimes \u201cdeliberately committed with violence or threat of violence against another person ... should generally be rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u201cAlthough the Guidelines do represent a somewhat greater attempt to channel prosecutorial discretion than the statute, in the end it remains the responsibility of the prosecutor to weigh the various factors and to reach a determination.\u201d <em>Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 586, 684 A.2d 1355. Thus, a prosecutor must use his or her independent judgment to fully and fairly evaluate the weight to be given to each of the relevant factors. <em>See State v. Dalglish, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>503, 510-11, 432 A.2d 74 (1981) (\u201cIndividual PTI applications turn on an assessment of the defendant\u2019s background, the circumstances of his [or her] crime, the likely value of supervisory treatment, and the prosecutor\u2019s current enforcement policy.\u201d); <em>see also Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 589-90, 684 A.2d 1355 (\u201cA prosecutor has the prerogative to view seriously matters of domestic violence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Preliminarily, we note the record does not support the trial court\u2019s determination that the prosecutor\u2019s office \u201creally didn\u2019t\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>consider defendant\u2019s mental illness. Generally, \u201cit is presumed that the prosecutor considered all relevant factors before rendering a [PTI] decision.\u201d <em>Dalglish, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 509, 432 A.2d 74; <em>see also Bender, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 94, 402 A.2d 217 (\u201c[Ujnless and until a defendant demonstrates the contrary, our judges must presume that all relevant factors were considered and weighed prior to a prosecutorial veto.\u201d). Moreover, in the present matter, it is apparent from (1) the PTI rejection memorandum dated May 16, 2007, (2) the prosecutor\u2019s rejection letter after defendant submitted additional medical documentation, and (3) the prosecutor\u2019s comments during oral argument, that all of the relevant factors \u2014 including defendant\u2019s mental illness \u2014 were considered and evaluated by the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office prior to its PTI decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Because there was no failure to consider relevant factors, and defendant does not claim the prosecutor\u2019s decision was based on irrelevant or inappropriate factors, defendant has failed to satisfy her burden of demonstrating an abuse of discretion under the first two prongs of the <em>Bender </em>standard. We must therefore determine whether defendant satisfied the third prong by demonstrating the prosecutor committed \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d The trial court reasoned the prosecutor\u2019s office abused its discretion by placing \u201ctoo much emphasis\u201d on the \u201cassaultive nature\u201d of the offenses and the wishes of the victims (who opposed defendant\u2019s PTI application). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The Supreme Court has defined \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d as a decision \u201cbased on appropriate factors and rationally explained, but ... contrary to the predominant views of others responsible for the administi-ation of criminal justice.\u201d <em>State v. Baynes, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 444, 690 A.2d 594 (1997) (internal quotations omitted). In the present matter, defendant does not dispute she repeatedly threatened to kill the police officers while armed with a knife, or knives, in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other. Defendant also began cutting and stabbing a cardboard box while warning the officers she would do the same thing to them. Given these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>circumstances, the threat of violence was undoubtedly present and, in such cases, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s application should generally be rejected.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:28, Guideline 3(i)(3); see <em>also State v. Motley, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 321-22, 848 A.2d 875 (App.Div.2004) (finding trial court erred in admitting defendant, who was charged with third-degree possession of assault weapons, into PTI program over objection of Attorney General because of potential for violence and injury \u201cassociated with the maintenance of such weapons in an unsecured area\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Furthermore, we are convinced the victims\u2019 status as police officers does not eviscerate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12(e)(4), which requires prosecutors to consider \u201c[t]he desire of the complainant or victim to forego prosecution.\u201d Indeed, a prosecutor has the prerogative to view a potentially dangerous situation, such as this, as a serious matter and to weigh the victims\u2019 wishes accordingly. In this case, as in <em>State v. Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492, 499, 457 A.2d 455 (1983): \u2018We discern no legislative intention to discount assault upon police officers as though it were something to be expected, a part of the game, so to speak.\u201d <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b)(5)(a) (simple assault on a police officer elevated to aggravated assault regardless of severity of injury); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3(b)(2) (automatic life sentence without parole for murder of a law enforcement officer). Thus, it was entirely appropriate for the prosecutor to consider the wishes of the victims, notwithstanding their status as police officers, and we find no support in the record for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201ctoo much emphasis\u201d was given to the victims\u2019 preference for prosecution rather than diversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">A trial court does not evaluate a PTI application \u201cas if it [stands] in the shoes of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 589, 684 A.2d 1355. And it cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the prosecutor even when \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s decision is one which the trial court disagrees with or finds to be harsh.\u201d <em>State v. Kraft, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106,112-13, 625 A.2d 579 (App.Div.1993); <em>see also State v. Nwobu, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>236, 254, 652 A.2d 1209 (1995) (\u201cThe question is not whether we agree or disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s decision, but whether the prosecutor\u2019s decision could not have been reasonably made upon weighing the relevant factors.\u201d). In the present matter, the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for rejecting defendant\u2019s application are consistent with the legislative standards applicable to PTI enrollment, with the PTI guidelines promulgated by the Court, and with judicial precedent regarding PTI admissions. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s application was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable, and it certainly was not a clear error of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The order admitting defendant into PTI is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b245-7\">SABATINO, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ5\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">I join the majority in reversing the Law Division\u2019s order admitting defendant into the PTI program, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, because I agree that the record does not bespeak a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion\u201d by the prosecutor. <em>State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 582-83, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996). I write separately to make three additional points.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">First, as a matter of sound practice, it would have been preferable for the assistant prosecutor to have provided some substantive commentary in her July 18, 2007 letter to defense counsel, after receiving the written reports from Dr. Kousa and Dr. Panezai confirming that defendant suffers from mental illnesses. The prosecutor\u2019s terse written response, asserting in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he State ... maintains its original rejection of the defendant\u2019s [PTIj application,\u201d was conclusory and uninformative. The prosecutor should have explained in her letter, at least briefly, why those expert diagnoses were inconsequential. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12(f) (the prosecutor must \u201cprecisely state his [or her] findings and conclusion which shall include the ... reasons offered for the denial\u201d); <em>see also Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 584, 684 A.2d 1355 (\u201cthe requirement that the prosecutor put his or her thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>process on paper tends to protect against the consideration of inappropriate factors and promotes reasoned decision-making\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Such responsive commentary would have been particularly useful in this case, since the prosecutor\u2019s initial analysis in her May 16, 2007 memorandum had invoked PTI Guideline 3(i), which involves a state-of-mind element, i.e., whether the crime was <em>\u201cdeliberately </em>committed with violence or threat of violence.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:28, Guideline 3(i) (emphasis added). The presence or absence of mental illness surely bears upon that state-of-mind assessment. Even so, I am satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent remarks at the oral argument before the motion judge, reflecting her appreciation of the mental health experts\u2019 findings, cures the shortcomings of her July 2007 follow-up letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Second, I wish to underscore that we were assured at oral argument that the Prosecutor\u2019s Office does not have a policy of automatically opposing PTI whenever it is requested to do so by victims who are police officers, and the record lacks proof of such a rigid approach. <em>See State v. Imbriani, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 180, 677 A.2d 211 (App.Div.1996) (\u201clack of [the victim\u2019s] consent does not require a PTI rejection\u201d); <em>see also State v. Catlin, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 474, 521 A.2d 1385 (Law Div.1987). The absence of such a rigid policy fortifies our conclusion that the prosecutor did not abuse her authority in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Lastly, I would point out that nothing in our disposition forecloses defendant from arguing at trial that she is not guilty by reason of insanity, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-1, or that she acted on the evening in question with a diminished mental capacity, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4r-2. This observation, while perhaps an obvious one, enhances at least my own sense that defendant has not been treated in an unjust manner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
