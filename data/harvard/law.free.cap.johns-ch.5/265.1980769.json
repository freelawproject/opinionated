Woolsey, </em>deceased, and by the plaintiff <em>M. T. W., </em>as administrator of the said <em>M. L. W. </em>It stated, that the ancestor filed his bill, on the 11th of <em>June, </em>1819, against the defendants, as assignees of <em>Matthew Van Benschoten, </em>deceased, and in which he stated, that on the 1st of <em>July, </em>1800, he executed a bond to <em>M. V, B., </em>conditioned for the payment of 500 dollars, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Interest, and also a mortgage to secure the same; that the bond and mortgage were assigned to <em>Gilbert Livingston, </em>(of whom the defendant <em>L. </em>was executor,) and to the defendant <em>T,, </em>and that he, the ancestor, on the 19th of November, 1801, executed his bond to <em>G. L., </em>conditioned for the payment of 466 dollars; on which last bond, the defendant <em>L., </em>as executor, entered a judgment in the Supreme Court, in 1809, and issued an execution, with directions to levy the penalty, with interest and costs, (1,105 dollars 14 cents.) That the defendants had filed their bill to foreclose the mortgage so assigned, as aforesaid; that <em>G. L. </em>had received divers sums towards payment of the two bonds, and that they were both satisfied. The bill concluded with a prayer to redeeip the mortgage, and that the bond and mortgage given to <em>M. V. B., </em>and so assigned, might be brought into this Court and cancelled, and that the sums paid might be accounted for, and the judgment cancelled, and the defendant <em>L. </em>restrained from proceeding on the judgment and execution aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">An injunction issued, as prayed for. The bill of revivor further stated, that <em>M. L. W. </em>afterwards died, whereby the suit abated, and that the plaintiffs were his legal representatives ; and <em>prayed </em>that the bill might stand revived, and for process of subpoena, &amp;cc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">The bill of <em>M. L. W. </em>against the defendants, recited in the bill of revivor, was partly of the nature of a <em>cross bill, </em>as the defendants had, on the 11th of <em>November, </em>1818, filed their bill to foreclose the mortgage so given to <em>M. V. B., </em>and assigned, to <em>G. L, </em>(of whom the defendant <em>L. </em>was executor,) and the defendant <em>T., </em>and <em>M. L. W. </em>had put in his answer to that bill on the day that he filed his bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">To this bill of revivor by the representatives of <em>Woolsey, </em>the defendants demurred, and assigned for cause, that if the bill of revivor be true, it does not contain ground for any decree or relief to the plaintiffs, because, as there was no decree for an account in the original suit, filed by the present defendants, the present plaintiffs are not entitled to revive.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Foote, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An\">cited 2 <em>Maddock\u2019s Tr. </em>401. 10 <em>Vesey, </em>406. 1 <em>Har.

L., </em>deceased- There does not appear any good reason why the suit should not be revived. The present representatives of <em>Woolsey </em>are interested in the subject matter of the suit sought to be revived, and the question is only whether they may revive the suit, or be driven to a new bill. The latter remedy may be attended with inconveniences not now anticipated, and it would appear to be immaterial, in point of interest and convenience, to the present defendants, whether they are called to answer to this bill of revivor, or to the original bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Demurrer overruled, and defendants ordered to answer in six weeks.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
