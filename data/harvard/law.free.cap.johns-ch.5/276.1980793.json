The infant was of the age of nine years, and sued by her guardian. The defendants admitted assets, and that the interest being 28 dollars, was due, which they were ready to pay, as the Court should direct.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-4\"><em>Chattle, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-5\"><em>Case, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">An objection was raised, that the sum was too small for the jurisdiction of this Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b285-7\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AQx\">Executors are not suable before a Justice of the Peace, for a legacy. They are expressly excepted in the statute from the jurisdiction of the Justice, as to actions against them. But this suit might have been brought in the Court of Common Pleas of the county where the defendants reside, under the 19th section of the act entitled \u201c an act concerning executors and administrators, and the distribution of intestates\u2019 estates.\u201d For a demand under 50 dollars, the plaintiff ought to have sued there; it is too expensive, and consequently oppressive, to sue in this Court, except in special cases, for so small a sum as 28 dollars. This point was fully examined in the case of <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Lyttle. </em>(4 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>183.) I shall, therefore, dismiss the bill, but without costs and without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
