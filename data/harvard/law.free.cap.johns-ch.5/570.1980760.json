D. </em>Crane, on the 26th of <em>August, </em>1818, upon a house and lot in the <em>fifth </em>ward; and also <em>upon a house and lot in Vandewater street, in the city of New-York. </em>The mortgage was executed to secure the payment of a bond for 4,500 dolllars, given by those two defendants to the plaintiff, to secure the purchase money of the house and lot. in the <em>jfifth </em>ward, which the plaintiff had then sold, and conveyed to those two defendants. The mortgage was duly registered on the day after its date. The defendant <em>Bill, </em>had previously, on the 9th of <em>April, </em>1817, mortgaged the lot in <em>Vandewater </em>street to the defendant <em>J. D. Crane, </em>to secure the payment of one thousand dollars, which mortgage was registered on the same day, and was assigned by <em>J. ID. Crane, </em>on the 22d of <em>September, </em>1818, to <em>V. Fare, </em>of whom the defendant <em>F. </em>is administratrix , and she, by her answer, claimed a preference over the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">The question was, whether the mortgage to the plaintiff had a priority of lien over the mortgage executed by the defendant <em>Bill </em>to the defendant Crane, upon the lot in <em>Vandewater </em>street.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-10\">The point was argued by <em>Dyckman, </em>for the plaintiff, and by <em>J. L. Riker, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The counsel for the plaintiff contended that the plaintiff had acquired an interest in the <em>Vandewaler </em>street iqt, by the mortgage from <em>Bill, </em>the owner of the equity, and was in a capacity to accept of a conditional release from <em>Crane </em>of his interest as mortgagee. He admitted, that so far as related to third persons, who had no interest in the pledge, the interest of the morgagee could not be sold or mortgaged separately from the bond or debt. A mortgagee may take a release of the lien of a judgment. It is every da^\u2019s practice; and why not take the release of the lien of a mortgage ? Might it not have been done by a formal instrument, reciting all the circumstances ? Here the mortgage deed has sufficient granting words. It releases all the <em>\u201c </em>Estate, right, interest, claim and demand whatsoever,\u201d of the two mortgagors to the lot in <em>Vandewater </em>street, as well as to the lot in <em>thejfifth </em>ward.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-8\">The counsel for the dependent <em>F. </em>insisted, that <em>Crane </em>had no interest in the lot in <em>Vandewater </em>street which he could sell or mortgage, as the mortgage was a mere security for the debt. (1 <em>Mad. Ch. Tr. </em>11 <em>John. Rep. </em>534. 4 <em>John. Rep. </em>43. 1 <em>P. Wm. </em>460. <em>Domat, </em>b. 3. tit. 1 <em>Art. </em>9.) A mortgage may be released, which is not here pretended ; but it cannot exist independent of the debt. Nothing passed by the mortgage from <em>Crane </em>but his interest in the land purchased Irom the plaintiff, and nothing more was intended to pass. There is no estoppel against him, because he had an interest, which passed by the mortgage. <em>(Co. Litt. </em>42. a. 327. b.) The plaintiff had no interest prior to the mortgage, on which the release could operate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b579-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AJd\">The interest of Crane, as mortgagee of the lot in <em>Vandewater </em>street was not, at the time of the execution of the mortgage to the plain tiff, an interest in the land, capable of being the subject of sale, either absolutely, or by way of mortgage, <em>distinct </em>irom the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>it was intended to secure. It does not appear from the case that the debt to <em>Crane </em>was even due, when the mortgage to the plaintiff was executed ; and it is clearly to be inferred, that the mortgage had not been foreclosed, or possession taken under it. Though such a mortgage interest may be, by way of extinguishment, absolutely <em>released </em>to the party, having the equity of redemption, yet it cannot be conveyed asa still subsisting interest, by way of mortgage, because \u00a1hat would separate she debt and the pledge, the latter to reside in one person, while the debt resided in anothen This cannot be done; and the case of Jack<em>son </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>(4 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>41.) is decisive on the point-It is evident, that no such absolute release was. intended in \u00a1his case; and the act of <em>Crm&amp; </em>in uniting in the mortgage with <em>Bill, </em>is rather to be referred to the legal estate which he derived from the plaintiff, than to his interest as such a mortgagee. He had an interest, which he was capable of mortgaging, and which he no doubt intended to mortgage, and the mortgage deed can have full operation by being applied to that interest. It cannot be applied to&gt; his interest as a mortgagee in the other lot, consistently with principles of law, because he had no interest, in that character, capable of alienation, so long as he retained the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">There must be a sale of the mortgaged premises including the lot in <em>Vandewater </em>street, but with a reservation of \u00a1he junior right of the defendant <em>F. </em>to the proceeds of that lot. '</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
