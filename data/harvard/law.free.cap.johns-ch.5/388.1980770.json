Van Horne </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife, and <em>Jellis H. </em>Fonda, stated, that the plaintiffs, <em>Jane </em>and <em>Jellis, </em>were the only children and heirs at law of <em>Henry V. Fonda, </em>late of <em>Caughnawaga, </em>in <em>Montgomery </em>county, deceased. That <em>Jellis </em>Fonda, father of <em>H. V. F., </em>on the 23d of <em>May, </em>1791, made his will, by which, after sundry legacies and bequests, he devised all the residue of his estate to his two sons, <em>Henry </em>and <em>Douw, </em>the de- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u25a0 ,'endant; and he nominated his son <em>Doma, </em>his son-in-law <em>John Yates, </em>his brother <em>A. Fonda, </em>and his friends <em>H. Fry </em>and <em>A. Van Vechten, </em>his executors. The testator died the 23d of <em>June, </em>1791, seised, &amp;c. of real and personal estate. The defendant, <em>John Yates, </em>and <em>A. Fonda, </em>proved the will, and qualified as executors, before the surrogate of <em>M., </em>the other two persons named having declined ; but the defendant was the sole acting executor, and took possession of all the real and personal estate of the testator, <em>J. F., </em>not specifically devised ; but he never filed any inventory of the personal estate. <em>Henry V. Fonda </em>having made his will, died the 23d of <em>April, </em>1799, leaving the plaintiffs, <em>Jane </em>and <em>Jellis, </em>his only children and heirs at law, and a widow. The plaintiff, <em>Jane, </em>was born the 6th of <em>November, </em>1792, and married the plaintiff, <em>Van Horne, </em>the 16th of <em>December, </em>1S10; the plaintiff, <em>Jellis Y. F., </em>was born the 12th of <em>March, </em>1795. <em>Henry V. F., </em>by his will, devised his farm, &amp;c. at C. to his wife, to hold the same until his son <em>Jellis </em>should arrive at the age of twenty-five years; and devised the one moiety of the same to the plaintiff <em>Jane, </em>and the other moiety to the plaintiff <em>Jellis ; </em>but his wife to hold, during her natural life, the moiety devised to his daughter <em>Jane. </em>He empowered his executors, or the major part of them, to sell and convey his real estate, or such part thereof as might be necessary, for the payment of his debts; and he made his two children, <em>Jane </em>and <em>Jellis, </em>his residuary devisees. He declared the bequest to his wife to be in lieu of dower; and appointed his brother <em>Doma, </em>the defendant, his uncle, <em>John F., </em>and <em>Evert Yales, </em>and <em>James Lansing, </em>his executors. The bill further stated, that, soon after the death of <em>Henry V. F., </em>the executors named in his will, met for the purpose of determining whether they would undertake the executor-ship; on which occasion, the defendant exhibited a statement of the debts owing by <em>H. V. F., </em>amounting to 1,528/. 8s., and of debts due to him, amounting to 222/. 15s., which he represented as correct. That at this meeting, the defendant proposed that a part of the old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Caughnawaga </em>farm should be sold, for the payme'nt of the debts of <em>Henry V. F.; </em>to which <em>John F. </em>objected, and stated, that the estate of <em>Henry V. F. </em>was entitled to one half of the moneys which the defendant had received, or was to receive, from the estate, as a compensation for lands in the <em>Royal Grant, </em>which <em>Jellis F., </em>deceased, had purchased from the <em>Indian </em>children of Sir <em>William Johnson. </em>That the defendant answered, that <em>Jellis Fonda\u2019s </em>title was deficient; and that he, the defendant, had been to <em>Upper Canada </em>to get a conveyance, and intimated that he should not pay over any of the moneys to the estate of <em>Henry V. F. </em>That <em>John F. </em>was so incensed at the conduct of the defendant, that he refused to prove or act under the will of <em>Henry V. F. ; </em>and the meeting was accordingly broken up, and neither he, nor <em>James Lansing, </em>nor <em>Evert Yales, </em>took upon themselves the execution of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\">That <em>Jellis F. </em>purchased 2,000 acres of land, in the <em>Royal Grant, </em>of <em>Brant Johnson, </em>(a natural son of Sir <em>William-</em>Johnson,) and who executed a deed in fee for the land, dated July.8, 1789. That on the 28th of December, 179\u00d3, <em>Jellis F. </em>and his wife conveyed the same land to <em>Abraham G. Lansing, </em>and his heirs, &amp;c. in trust, for <em>Jellis \\ F., </em>his heirs and assigns forever. That <em>A. G. Lansing, </em>on the 25th of <em>August, </em>1791, conveyed certain lots, parcel of the 2.000 acres, to <em>John Lansing, jun. </em>on the same trust, for the benefit of <em>Jellis F,., </em>&amp;c. That <em>John L., jun. </em>and his wife, and <em>Abraham G. L. </em>and his wife, on the 19th of December, 1793, released the whole 2,000 acres to <em>Henry V. F. </em>and <em>Domo F., </em>as tenants in common, and entitled thereto, under the will of their father <em>Jellis- 'F. </em>That, it being supposed that the land had been forfeited to the State, by the attainder of Sir <em>John Johnson, </em>the only son and heir at law of Sir <em>W. J., </em>or by the attainder of <em>William J. </em>and <em>Brant J., </em>the devisees thereof, and been .sold by the commissioners of forfeitures ; for the purpose of avoiding controversy, and with a view to facilitate an application to the Legislature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>by vesting the legal title in the defendant solely, and giving him a discretionary power as,to the terms of compromise with the State, it was agreed between H. <em>V. F. </em>and the defendant <em>D. F., </em>that <em>H. </em>should convey to the latter all his interest in the 2,000 acres; which was accordingly done, by a deed from <em>H. </em>and his wife, dated <em>May </em>3, 1794. That the commissioners, on behalf of the State, agreed with the defendant, to pay him, in extinguishment of their claim, three dollars and twenty-five cents an acre ; and the defendant and his wife, accordingly, on the 20th of <em>March, </em>1799, released the 2,000 acres to the State, and the defendant, afterwards, received the sum of six thousand five hundred dollars from the State, to the one half of which sum, <em>H. V. F. </em>was, and his legal representatives, since his death, were justly entitled. That <em>H. V. F. </em>and his wife, on the 13th of <em>May, </em>1794, executed a mortgage of the rents and reversions of certain lots in the <em>Royal Grant, </em>being part of the residue of the real estate of <em>Jellis F\u201e </em>devised to <em>Henry F. F. </em>and <em>D. F., </em>and assigned to <em>U. V. </em>in severalty, for securing the payment of 250 dollars and the interest. That in <em>February, </em>1800, the defendant procured an assignment of the mortgage to him from J. Y., and proceeded to sell the premises, under colour of a power contained in the mortgage, and purchased them himself; and has, thereby, possessed himself of the rents. That the pretended power was void, as <em>Henry V. </em>was, at the time of its execution, under the age of 25 years. That the defendant obtained an assignment of a judgment of <em>Mam Snell </em>against <em>Henry F. F., </em>under which, in 1814, he sold 100 acres of the land. That the payments made on the mortgage, and the rents received, or which might have been received by the defendant, far exceeded the principal and interest due on the mortgage. That in <em>March, </em>1803, <em>Worden Hammond </em>married the widow of <em>Henry </em>V. <em>F., </em>and died the 29 th <em>o\u00ed July, </em>1813. That <em>MyndertB. Wimple </em>recovered a judgment in 1806 or 1807, against <em>Hammond </em>and his wife, the plaintiffs, <em>Jane </em>and <em>Jellis H, F. </em>as heirs and devi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>sees of <em>Henry V. F. </em>on his bond for 50 pounds, dated <em>July </em>10th, 1792. That <em>Peter Putman </em>also recovered a judgment against the same persons, as heirs and devisees of <em>Henry V. F., </em>in 1806 or 1807, on his bond for 55 pounds, dated <em>September </em>19th, 1796. That execution, on these judgments, were\"issued in 1807, under which the <em>Caugknawaga </em>farm, or land devised by <em>Jellis II. F. </em>deceased, to <em>H. H. F., </em>amounting to above 339\" acres, was sold by the sheriff, and' the defendant- became the purchaser. That the defend-\" ant, at the time of sale, declared publicly, that he intended to purchase the land for the benefit of his brother\u2019s infant children, the plaintiffs <em>Jane </em>and <em>Jellis II.; </em>in consequence of which declaration there was no competition, and the land was struck off, in a few minutes, to the defendant, for' a nominal price. That the defendant since, and new pretends that he fairly purchased the lands at the sheriff\u2019s sale for his own benefit, and paid the sheriff 586 dollars and' <em>75 </em>cents for the same; and falsely and fraudulently sets up a mortgage in fee of the farm, by <em>Henry V. </em>dated 10th of <em>January, </em>1799, to <em>John Jacob Beekman, </em>his father-in-law, and to the defendant, for securing the payment of 157 pounds, according to the condition of a bond to <em>J. J. Bi. </em>and 380 pounds to the defendant, with interest, from' the date of the mortgage. That the defendant had the entire control of the executions and sales; and never paid any part of the money bid by him for the lands to the sheriff. That the farm so sold was under high improvement arid cultivation, and of great value; and that two acres of the' land would, at a fair sale, have sold for enough to have' satisfied the executions and costs. That he mortgage to1 J. <em>J. B. </em>and the defendant, was taken when <em>Henry V~. </em>was very ill; and that the sum of380 pounds, was included in the mortgage, under a promise of the defendant that he would advance the money to meet the w'ants of <em>Henry V., </em>but that\" none of it was paid; That the .defendant obtained from the widow of <em>Henry V.- </em>a release of her dower in the farm,- and in lieu thereof, assigned to her a part of the land for life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and afterwards procured from her a release of the part so assigned to her. That in 1816, the defendant attempted to extort from the plaintiff, <em>A. Wan Horne, </em>a recognition of the defendant\u2019s right to the farm; but having failed to obtain it, he brought an action of ejectment against <em>A. W. H. </em>and turned him out of possession. That the widow of <em>Jellis F. </em>continued in possession of the farm with the consent of the defendant, from the death of her husband until she died, in <em>February, </em>1804, when the defendant possessed himself of the stock, &amp;c. on the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">The bill <em>prayed </em>for a discovery and an account of the real and personal estate of <em>Jellis F., </em>not specifically devised, a moiety of which belonged to <em>Henry V. F, </em>and <em>of </em>the rents, profits, proceeds, Sic. and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">The defendant, in his answer, gave schedules of the real and personal estate of <em>Jellis F., </em>and of the personal estate of the widow. He stated that <em>Henry W. F. </em>lived with his mother, on the C. farm, until his death. He admitted, that lie was the active executor of <em>Jellis F., </em>and the receipt of the rents and profits of the real estate, and of the personal estate, as stated in the schedules. That he made no inventory of the personal estate; but he made a statement of the debts and credits, as set forth in schedules. That he received a letter, on the 16th of <em>March, </em>1799, from <em>Henry V, F., </em>a short time before his death; and that he promised <em>Henry V. F. </em>to take care of his children. That he made the statement to his co-executors of the debts of <em>Henry V. F., </em>as mentioned in the bill, and that he had paid the debts marked \u201c settled,\u201d out of his own moneys, and taken an assignment of the securities for them; and that the debts were marked \u201c settled,\u201d in the statement, after the same were paid and assigned to him, and after the statement had been exhibited at the meeting of the executors. He denied that he acted as executor of <em>Henry V. F-, </em>or that he received and paid debts as his executor. He admitted that Sir <em>William Johnson </em>died seised of the 2,000 acres in the <em>Royal </em>Grant, and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>devised 1,000 acres thereof, to his son <em>Brant, </em>and 1,000 acres to his son <em>William; </em>but ne denied that <em>William </em>ever sold and conveyed his i ,000 acres to <em>Brant. </em>He admitted the conveyance of the 2,000 by <em>Brant J. </em>to <em>Henry H. F. </em>and that the conveyance was delivered up to the State commissioners, on the 17th of March, 1799. He admitted that <em>Jellis F., </em>on the 28th of December, 1790, sold and conveyed the 2,000 acres of land to <em>Abraham G. </em>Lansing, for the consideration of one hundred pounds, in fee, with <em>warranty; </em>but he denied that it was upon any trust whatever, express or implied, for the benefit of <em>Jellis F. </em>That <em>Abraham G. Lansing </em>sold and conveyed the lots mentioned in the bill, to <em>John </em>Lansing, jun., but not upon any trust whatever. That <em>Abraham G. L. </em>and <em>John.

That on the 29th of <em>May, </em>1795, he purchased of <em>Moses Johnson, </em>son and heir at law of <em>William Johnson, </em>the devisee of Sir <em>William, J., </em>his right and title to 1,000 acres, for the consideration of 600 dollars. That the defendant, after-wards, released his right to the 2,009 acres, to the People of the State, for 6,250 dollars; but he denied that <em>Henry V. F. </em>was, in any way, concerned in this compromise with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Commissioners, or that he was entitled to any part of the money received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-3\">He denied all fraud or unfairness in the purchase of <em>Henry V.

That there was due on these three incumbrances, at the time the farm was sold, exclusive of the two executions, 2,937 dollars and 66 cents. The defendant alleged, that the purchase of the farm by him, at the sheriff\u2019s sale, was fair and bmutjide, and that he had no interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>judgments.

Fonda </em>deceased, and, generally, to make him account as trustee, acting for and on behalf of the plaintiffs, in the management and disposition of the estate, real and personal, of <em>Henry </em>FI <em>Fonda,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">The defendant admits himself to have been the acting executor of the estate of his father, <em>Jellis F. </em>and is ready to account for the personal estate, and the rents and profits of the real estate which he may have received. The great contest in the case is as to the character in which he acted, and the responsibilities which he has incurred, in respect to the estate, real and personal, of his brother <em>Henry V. F. </em>1. He is charged with acting as executor of <em>Henry, </em>and that charge he denies. But it appears to be sufficiently supported by the testimony. One witness, <em>Peter Fonda, </em>says, that he took possession and disposed of a great part of the personal estate of <em>Henry </em>F\". <em>F. </em>and offered to sell <em>\u00b0 </em>e to the witness several articles of farming utensils on the . farm of <em>Henry </em>V. <em>F, </em>and the witness purchased a wood , sleigh, and paid the defendant the price of it. So, it is in proof that he paid a debt due from <em>Henry </em>V. <em>F.&lt; </em>at his <em>* </em>death, to <em>John M'Carlhy, </em>and another debt due from <em>Henry V. F. </em>to <em>Marks Hockstader ; </em>and in the last case, the debt was frequently demanded of him, and he was threatened to be sued for it. He received payment of a debt due from S. <em>Kittle </em>to <em>Henry V. F.; </em>and, in another case, he demanded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>and received paj'ment, of a debt due from <em>M. </em>B. <em>Wemph </em>' to <em>Henry V. F. </em>These multiplied acts are decisive proof of his election to assume the trust and act as executor. They would have made him an executor <em>de son tort, </em>if he had not been named an executor in the will, and the same acts amount to an assumption of the office of a rightful executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\">I shall, therefore, consider all his acts, in relation to the estate of <em>Henry V. F. </em>as the acts of a person who was at the same time clothed with the office of executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><em>2. </em>The bill charges that the defendant received, in <em>March, </em>1799, from the government of this State, 6,500 dollars, as a compensation for the extinguishment of the right derived from <em>Jellis F. </em>to 2000 acres of land in the <em>Royal Grant, </em>and that the plaintiffs are entitled to a moiety of that sum, with interest. The defendant admits that the sum received was 6,250 dollars, but he claims title to the whole of it; and contends, in the first place, that his father, <em>Jellis F. </em>was only entitled, in his life time, to 1000 acres, inasmuch as <em>Brant Johnson, </em>who sold him the 2000 acres, owned only a moiety of it, and that the other moiety belonged to <em>William Johnson, </em>a brother of B. Johnson. He contends, in the second place, that his brother <em>Henry, </em>by his deed of the 3d of <em>May, </em>1794, conveyed to him in fee, and absolutely, without any reservation or trust, his interest in the 1000 acres, for the consideration of 100 pounds, and which consideration was paid by a deed from the defendant to <em>Henry, </em>of the date of the 24th of April, 1794, of two lots in the <em>\u25a0Royal Grant, </em>and containing the like consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">It is to be observed, as we proceed, that the defendant, and his brother <em>Henry </em>were joint and equal residuary devisees of their father, <em>Jellis Fonda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">There is reason to believe that the deed of the 24th of <em>April, </em>was not given as the consideration of the deed of the 3d of <em>May </em>following. The want of concurrence in dates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>raises that presumption, especially as that want of concurrence is left without any explanation. In the next place, it is m proof, by the testimony of <em>Simon Feeder, </em>who took the acknowledgment qf the deed of the 3d of <em>May, </em>and delivered the deed over to the defendant on the same day, that <em>Henry </em>observed, at the time, that <em>the deed to Jellis F. his father, was deficient. </em>The certificate of acknowledgment bears date the 31st day of <em>May, </em>1794, but the certificate of acknowledgment of the prior deed of the 24th of <em>April,r </em>bears date the 2d day of <em>August, </em>1794, and both the acknowledgments were made before the same judge. The defendant was present when the acknowledgment of the deed of the 3d of <em>May </em>was taken ; and when the deed was handed to him, he observed that the consideration mentioned in the deed <em>was not the value </em>of the property, <em>but he took the deed in order to save something for the children of his brother, as his brother was pretty much involved in </em>trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">These observations of the parties made at the time of the execution of the deed, are evidence that the deed was not taken as an absolute purchase of the right of <em>Henry </em>to the 1000 acres; and they are evidence that it was taken <em>in trust, </em>and, probably, with a view to facilitate a compromise with the State, according to the charge in the bill. The testimony of <em>Evert Yates, </em>and <em>James Lansing </em>shows that, the deed of the 3d of <em>May </em>was not considered by the defendant as an absolute purchase of the right of <em>Henry, </em>and paid for, by the prior deed of the 24th <em>o\u00ed April. </em>When the executors of <em>Henry </em>met, soon after his death, the defendant told <em>John Fonda, </em>who asserted <em>Henry\u2019s </em>interest in the money received upon the compromise, that <em>Henry </em>had no such interest, for his father\u2019s title was incomplete, and he had since purchased up the Indian title of <em>William Johnson, </em>and considered it a speculation of his own. Here was no suggestion that he had actually bought in the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of Henry,,a reply that would naturally have suggested itself^ if such had been the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Il is also admitted, by the answer, that the title of <em>Jellis F. </em>to the 2000 acres, had been conveyed by him, in his life time, to <em>Abraham, G. Lansing ; </em>and that as the title proved partly defective, the defendant and his brother <em>Henry, </em>as the representatives of their father, had conveyed to <em>Lapsing, </em>in 1793, other lands to the amount of 2650 acres, derived to them from their father, in lieu of the two thousand acres; and that <em>Lansing </em>had then released his right to the 2000 acres, to the defendant and <em>Henry. </em>The 2000 acres were thus received back into the funds of the estate, as a substitute for the 2650 acres which had been transferred ; a rid th e t wo bro th er s became equally e n tit led ,ast en an t s in common and residuan^devisees^f^Z|is^1Jo all thejight and interest, in law and equity, of their ancestor to the 2000 acres. The defendant, afterwards, on the 29th of <em>I May, </em>1795, purchased of <em>Moses Johnson, </em>the heir of <em>William Johnson, </em>for 600 dollars, his right and title to 1000 acres, being part and parcel of the 2000 acres originally purchased by <em>Jellis F. </em>from <em>Brant Johnson. </em>The question, then is, whether the defendant did not make that purchase for the joint benefit of himself and his brother if eran/. If the deed of the 3d <em>May </em>1794, was given to the defendant, in {trust for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition of a good 1 title, then the purchase from <em>Moses Johnson, </em>was in trust for their joint benefit. The defendant has not interposed and pleaded the statute of frauds against setting up a trust by parol, in opposition to the deed of the 3d of <em>May, </em>1794; and we are left at liberty to judge of the truth and effect of the parol proof. I am strongly inclined to believe, that the deed was taken in trust, and that the subsequent purchase from <em>Moses Johnson </em>was made in trust, and that <em>Henry </em>was equally interested in the settlement made with the State, in <em>March </em>1799 ; and that his representatives are entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>to a moiety of the payment received from the State, (which payment amounted to 6,500) after allowing to the defendant, the payment he made to <em>Moses J. </em>and a just indemnity for his expenses in procuring the satisfaction from the State.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b415-8\">Admitting that one tenant in common may, in some cases, purchase in an outstanding title, for his own benefit; yet where two de\u00bb visees are in fiossession of and, under an imperfect title, devised to them, by their com* mon ancestor, one of them cannot buy in an outstanding dabt, so as disseise or oust his co-tenant $ but such purl-chase will enure to their common bene* fit, subject to an equal contribution to the ex*1 pense\u00bb</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">, In some cases, says <em>Littleton, </em>(sec. 307) a release to one joint tenant shall aid the joint tenant to whom it was not made, as well as him to whom it was made. I will not say, however, that one tenant in common may not, in any case, purchase in an outstanding title for his exclusive benefit. ' But when two devisees are in possession, under an imperfect title, derived from their common ancestor, there would seem, naturally and equitably, to arise an obligation between them, resulting from their joint claim and community of interests, that one of them should not affect the claim, to the prejudice of the other.\" It is like an expense laid out upon a common subject, by one of the owners, in which case all are entitled to the common benefit, on hearing a due proportion of the expense.\u2019 It is not consistent with good faith, nor with the duty which the connexion of the parties, as claimants of a common subject, created, that one of them should be able, without the consent of the other, to buy in an outstanding title, and appropriate the whole subject to himself, and thus undermine, and oust his companion, It would be repugnant to a sense of refined and accurate justice. It would be immoral, because it would be agains t the reciprocal obligation to do nothing to the prejudice of each other\u2019s equal claim, which the relationship of the parties, as joint devisees created. Community of interest, produces a community of duty, and there is no real difference, on the ground of policy and justice, whether one co-tenant buys up an outstanding incumbrance, or an adverse title, to disseize and expel his co-tenant. It cannot he tolerated, when applied to a common subject, in which the parties had equal concern, and which created a mutual obligation, to deal can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>didiy and benevolently with each other, and to cause nb harm to their joint interest^/1 have no doubt, therefore, that in a case like the present, and assuming what the evidence warrants us to assume, that the deed of May, 1794, was taken by the defendant for trust purposes, that the purchase from <em>Moses Johnson </em>ought, in equity, to enure for the common benefit, subject to an equal contribution to the expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">3. The plaintiffs are entitled to redeem the lands mortgaged by <em>Henry F. Fonda </em>to <em>Joseph </em>Yates, and to make the defendant account for the proceeds of such parts of those lands as have been sold by the defendant, (which sale the plaintiffs are willing to confirm) and for the rents and profits which have been received, subject to whatever payments have been actually made by the defendant upon that mortgage. The lands included in the mortgage, purchased in by the defendant, and remaining unsold, ought to be conveyed to the plaintiffs, free from incumbrances.\"</p>\n<p id=\"A9c\">The defendant admits, that he purchased and took an assignment of this mortgage, on the 4th of <em>February, </em>1800, and proceeded to advertise and sell the mortgaged premises, under a power contained in the mortgage, in <em>August, </em>1800, and that he became the purchaser himself. The defendant, in his answer, denies that be ever said, or admitted, that he bought in and held the mortgaged premises for the benefit of the plaintiffs, but alleges that he meant to reimburse himself for the mortgage debt, and then pay the debts still owing by the estate of <em>Jellis Fonda, </em>deceased, and then appropriate the surplus, \u201c according to his own discretion,\u201d to assist the plaintiffs and their mother. He admits, however, that the sale under the power was void, owing to the minority of <em>Henry V. F. </em>when he gave the power; and in his letter to <em>W. </em>Hammond,' of the 1st of <em>May, </em>1804, he says, that he <em>always intended </em>to account for the mortgage fo the heirs, or executors, of his brother. Whatever his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>intentions on this subject might have been, (for the answer and this letter do not entirely agree,) yet <em>the </em>purchase under the sale, was in judgment of law, in trust for the plaintiffs. Being executor of <em>Hendry V. F., </em>he had no right or power, to extinguish the morfg\u00e1ge, or other debts, for his own benefit, or to traffick with the estate for his own emolument. If a trustee or executor compound debts or mortgages, or buy in for less than is due, he shall not take the benefit of it to himself, for when he takes a trust, he is to take it for the benefit of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>He cannot be permitted to raise in himself, an interest opposite to that of the party for whom he acts. This is a fundamental doctrine in equity. (2 <em>Fonb. </em>b. 2. c. 7. sec. 7.) The haste with which that purchase of the mortgage was made, and the sale under the power effected subsequent to his brother\u2019s death, affords a very unfavourable specimen of the spirit with which he dealt with his brother\u2019s estate.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"pAOv\">An executor or teustee cannot buy in a mortgage judgments, or other debts of the testator, or cestuique trust, for his own benefit; nor can be deal or traffic with the estate for his own emolument.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The defendant says, in his answer, that he purchased up a judgment of <em>Adam Snell </em>against <em>Henry V. F., </em>on the 4th of <em>September, </em>1800; that he revived the judgment in 1814, against the plaintiffs, and sold a lot of 100 acres in.the <em>Royal Grant </em>covered by <em>Yates\u2019s </em>mortgage, for 853 dollars and 97 cents, and purchased it in himself. He purchased in the judgment in 1800, for 445 dollars and 37 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Here was also a breach of trust; for an executor is not permitted to buy in a debt, and then, afterwards, make that debt the means to sell, and buy in the property for his own benefit. The defendant can only be allowed, in his account, for the payment of whatever was justly due to <em>Snell, </em>when he took the assignment of his judgment in 1800, and he must account for the price for which the lot was sold under his judgment, with interest. The judgment of <em>Snell </em>was satisfied, by his purchase of it, as executor, in 1800.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">4. Another charge in the bill, is, that the defendant, in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>October, ISO7, </em>fraudulently sold, and purchased in; on his . own account, a farm of 300 acres and upwards, at <em>Caughnawaga, </em>belonging to the plaintiffs, as children of <em>Henry V. F. </em>It is charged, that the defendant sold, under two small judgments, which had been obtained against the plaintiffs, as heirs and devisees of <em>Henry H. F., </em>and which judgments he then claimed by assignment, one entire farm, worth, at the time of the sale, upwards of 10,000 dollars ; and that the circumstances attending the sale denote premeditated fraud. This is the gravest charge in the bill, and one that is most satisfactorily supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">The answer admits the existence of a, judgment <em>of M. B. Wemple, </em>of the 7th of <em>August, </em>1807, for 321 dollars and 30 cents, and another judgment of <em>Peter Putnam, </em>of the 3d of <em>Avgust, </em>1807, for 265 dollars and 48 cents, and that the farm of 272, 1-2 acres, was Sold, by executions on those judgments, on the 28th of <em>October, </em>1807, and purchased by the defendant, for 520 dollars ; and he says, that he purchased fairly, on his own account, and without any trust in favour of the plaintiffs, and denies, that he had any interest in those judgments, or any control over the executions. He says, that the farm was, at the time, subject to a mortgage to <em>John J. BeeJcman </em>and himself, of the 10th of January, 1799, for 1,347 dollars, and toa judgment in favour of <em>John Davis, </em>for 250 dollars, and to the balance of a judgment in favour of <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Douw, </em>for 135 dollars and 32 cents. These two latter judgments, he says, had been assigned to him, in <em>September </em>and <em>November, </em>1799, and that there was due, at the time of the sale, on those three incumbrances, 2,937 dollars and 66 cents. He says, further, that he then owned <em>Beekman\u2019s </em>interest in the mortgage, in right of his wife, and that he purchased to secure his three incumbrances, and some other debts of his brother <em>Henry, </em>which had been assigned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">It is abundantly in proof, that the farm was worth about 10,500 dollars, at the time of the sale ; and that from two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>to eight or ten acres from th\u00e9 east side of it, would, upon a sale have satisfied the two executions. Let us now see how. far this answer is contradicted by the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The defendant, at the time of the sale, did own the judgment and execution of <em>Wemple. </em>It is proved by <em>Wemple </em>himself, that the defendant sent proposals, before the sale, to him, to buy his judgment, and take an assignment of it, and he said, he <em>intended to use it for the benefit of the plaintiffs^ W. </em>went to the house of the defendant, and agreed to sell and assign the judgment to him, who'paid fot it, 247 dollars and 71 cents. He then agreed to meet the defendant, near the place of sale, the evening before, to execute the assignment, and the defendant requested the witness to keep the meeting a secret, for fear the neighbours would get the land from him, <em>and the children would not be able to have it. </em>They met, accordingly, at the place appointed, and the witness executed the assignment, and when the defendant took it, he said, <em>he took it for the purpose of purchasing the lands for the benefit of the plaintiffs, the children of Henry. </em>The day after the sale, he told the witness, he had purchased the farm <em>for the children. </em>It is further proved, by <em>James M'Intyre, </em>the sheriff, that on the day of the sale, he received the assignment of <em>Wemple\u2019s </em>judgment, in satisfaction of the execution ; that the assignment bad been executed before the day of sale, and he received it, either from the defendant, or from <em>D. Cady, </em>the attorney to the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Here, then, the answer is falsified in one essential point. It is also contradicted by the proof, in respect to the circumstances of the sale, and the declared purposes under which the defendant became the purchaser. We have already observed, that he frequ\u00e9ntly declared to <em>Wemple, </em>that he took the assignment of his judgment, and made the purchase, for the benefit of the children-</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">The defendant, before the sale, declared to <em>Abraham Fan </em>Horne, that he would <em>be a father to the plaintiffs, and take. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>can of their property. </em>This led that witness to infer, that h\u00ae would purcliase in the farm for their benefit. He said to <em>Jacob Van Alstyne, </em>on the day of sale, that he gave for the farm 520 dollars, and <em>should not have got it so, but he bought for the children, </em>and that he told those who attended the sale, that he <em>intended to purchase, for the benefit of the children of Henry. Daniel Cady </em>was the attorney to the two executions, and he attended the sale, and bid up to the amount of them; he heard nothing about incumbrances, and was informed that the defendant had the charge of the plaintiffs, and was, in some measure, providing for them ; he says, that if he had not supposed <em>that, </em>he never would have suffered the farm to have been struck off for the amount of the executions.' <em>M\u2018Inlyre, </em>the sheriff, testifies, that at the sale, one <em>Rust </em>was present, and bid once or twice, and then asked, if the property' was to be bidden off for the benefit of the children of <em>Henry, </em>and that either the defendant, or the witness replied, that <em>it was, </em>and <em>Rust </em>then desisted from bidding. If the witness so replied, it was from express information received from the defendant; for, before the day of sale, and on the morning of the day' of sale, the defendant told the witness, that he intended to purchase in the premises for the benefit of the children of <em>Henry. </em>He says, that the farm was not declared to be sold, subject to any incumbrances. It appears, also, by the testimony of <em>Peter Putnam, </em>that on, and after the day of sale, the defendant declared, that <em>he meant the farm for the children. </em>The defendant made the same declaration to <em>Evert Yales, </em>and observed, that he had <em>purchased the farm for the benefit of the children, </em>and that they should have it, upon paying him back his money, with interest;, and it was for that reason that the witness sold him thirty acres adjoining the farm so purchased, and which thirty acres had been detached from the farm, by means of a sale under a loan office mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">These witnesses prove the answer to be false, in respec <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>in the character which he had assumed; and considering that he was the owner, at the time, of one of the judgments, and had the control of one of the executions, and that a large and valuable farm was sacrificed under false pretences, when only a very inconsiderable part of it would have satisfied the executions, we are required, by the most obvious principles of justice, to make the defendant account for that pur-, chase. And it is worthy of notice, that the defendant admits, in his answer, that he visited his brother a few weeks before his death, and that the latter expressed great solicitude about his children, when the defendant voluntarily told him, <em>he would lake care of his children. </em>He thus stood, in all his subsequent transactions, <em>in loco parentis, </em>and was under the most sacred obligations, to execute the trust with parental fidelity. to the avowed character in which the purchase was made, and the alleged fairness of the sale. It is satisfactorily shown, that the defendant did assume to buy, in the character of trustee, for the plaintiffs, who were, then infants, (the one being fifteen and the other twelve years of age,) and did, by that means, stifle competition, and was enabled to buy in the estate, for a comparatively nominal sum. To appropriate the whole purchase afterwards to himself, as a speculation, was a gross breach of. his duty, as a trustee. It necessarily follows, that he is answerable for that purchase,</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">5. The defendant sets up, as a debt against the estate, a mortgage executed by <em>II. V. F. </em>to <em>J. J. Beekman </em>and himself, on the 10th of <em>January, </em>1799, on the <em>Caughnawaga </em>farm, to secure the payment of 157/. to <em>Beekman, </em>with interest from the 21st <em>of June, </em>1797, and of 380/. to the defendant, with interest from the date. This mortgage debt was one of the incumbrances upon the farm, which the defendant says induced him to make the purchase; and he says, the mortgage debt to him was founded upon notes to that amount, which he previously held against <em>Henry, </em>and which notes were then delivered up.,</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>There is reason to believe, that this mortgage debt had been satisfied even prior to the death of <em>Henry ; </em>or that it was originally created either by imposition, or upon some secret trust not disclosed,, or to meet future responsibilities not incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">When the defendant met with the other executors of <em>Henry, </em>shortly after his death, he exhibited a statement of the debts due from the estate <em>o\u00ed Henry </em>; and he admits that it was a statement of debts owing by <em>Henry, </em>\u201cas far as the same had then been ascertained.\u201d In that statement, he entirely omits his demand under that mortgage, and there is no accounting for the omission. He mentioned the debt due under that mortgage to <em>Beeknian, </em>amounting, as he stated, to 160/., and his attention, therefore, must have been directed to that very mortgage. One of the witnesses who was present when the statement was produced, <em>(James Lansing,) </em>said, that the defendant was asked, if he had any claim, and he replied, that <em>was a matter of no consequence. </em>There is another document in proofj still more decisive; and that is the <em>book of accounts </em>of <em>Henry V. F., </em>containing entries in it, admitted to be in the handwriting of the defendant. In one place, the defendant writes against an account of <em>Henry </em>against him, \u201cBy cash in full, <em>September </em>1st, 1796*)\u201d and in another place, on the credit side, <em>by your note of let </em>and 2d <em>September, </em>60/. And this credit is given as of the date of <em>June </em>21, 1797. And in another place, of the date of <em>April </em>13th, 1799, the defendant adds, \u201c <em>by a settlement made, and lam due on this account to my brother a balance of All. </em>19s. <em>Id. To my note for the above, in full, </em>40/.\u201d And then he adds-below, \u201cTo an abatement,.....\u00a31 10 0</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\u201c To balance short, .....0 9 1</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">\u00a341 19 1\u201d-</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Could the mortgage debt be subsisting, after this settlement ? Can this note of 40/., which he thus applied, only thirteen days before his brother\u2019s death, as a set-off, be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>100 dollars, which he says he lent to his brother a few days before his death? Can that 100 dollars be still a subsisting debt ?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\">These entries, in his own hand, and the omission of either of those debts in the statement, are sufficient to put him upon the proof of any debt originally due to him, under that mortgage, or otherwise. The defendant ought, therefore, not to be allowed, in accounting before the master, for the mortgage debt of 380\u00cd., <em>on the foot of the mortgage, </em>and he ought not to be allowed any part of that debt, or any other debt of his own, against the estate of <em>Henry, </em>without satisfactory proof of its subsisting, at the death of <em>Henry. </em>He ought, also, to be decreed to convey the <em>Caughnawaga </em>farm to the plaintiffs, free from incumbrances, and he ought to be charged with the rents and profits, and credited with expenditures for actual repairs, and with moneys actually paid by him for, and in the purchase of debts really due by <em>Henry, </em>and also with the value of the dower of the widow of <em>Henry </em>in the farm, not, however, exceeding the sum paid by the defendant, upon the conveyance to him, by her and her husband. The defendant ought not to be absolutely precluded from showing the exis'ence of any debt due from <em>Henry to </em>him, provided, he can prove it to entire satisfaction, independent of the mortgage, or note, which he might produce. He ought to be put to show the circumstances, and how it arose, and when; and to reconcile its existence with the entries made by him in his brother\u2019s book. \u201c A bond or mortgage,\u201d says Lord <em>Talbot, </em>in <em>Piddock </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>(3 <em>P. Wms. </em>289.) \u201c is, <em>prima facie, </em>good evidence of a debt. But, whenever there are manifest signs of fraud in the obligee, he ought to be put to the proof of actual payment; and though he may happen thereby to lose some part of the money really due to him, for want of being able to make sufficient proof, this is but a just punishment of him for the fraud.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Nor do I think that the defendant ought to be allowed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>under the circumstances of this case, for what might, otherwise, be deemed beneficial improvements made by hi in on the <em>Caughnawaga </em>farm. He entered in his own wrong, and held under a claim of title, procured by fraud, and he is not entitled beyond the amount of his actual expenditures. Every thing beyond that was gratuitous. A fraudulent possessor is never allowed for beneficial improvements. (2 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The defendant ought, in addition to the <em>items </em>already noticed, to be directed to account, generally, relative to the real and personal estates of <em>Jellis F. </em>and of <em>Henry F. F., </em>deceased, and also of Jannetje, the widow of <em>Jellis F. </em>He oyght also to be examined, if required, upon oath, and to produce all papers, in his custody or power, relative to those estates; and to be allowed for actual expenditures, for board, clothing, and education of the plaintiffs, or either of them ; but all affirmative matters stated in the answer, and all matters set up by way of avoidance, or discharge, and which are competent, as a defence, must be satisfactorily proved. I shall direct a reference to a master, to take and state an account, upon the principles, and under the directions already -declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
