That <em>Alexander </em>Thompson, deceased, a brother of the plaintiff^ came to the <em>United States, </em>a?i alien, in 1803, and was naturalized in 1810. <em>That the plaintiff coxae </em>to the <em>United Stales </em>in 1804, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>an alien, and still remains an alien. That <em>William Thompson, </em>a brother of the plaintiff, came to the <em>United States, </em>an alien, in 1816, and is still an alien. That <em>Ann, </em>a sister of the plaintiff, came to the <em>United States </em>an alien, in 1818 and still remains an alien. That <em>J. </em>and <em>A. Thompson, </em>in 1813, entered into partnership, as distillers, in <em>New-York, </em>and continued partners until the death of <em>Alexander T. </em>on the 30th of <em>January, </em>1818. That while partners,they acquired a considerable estate, the greater part of which was vested in real property in their joint names. That they purchased in 1816, real property in <em>Cherry </em>and <em>Batavia </em>streets, including their distillery, and paid therefor 10,250, dollars, and took a deed in their joint names, and they borrowed from <em>John Pirnie, </em>money towards payment for the land in <em>Cherry </em>and <em>Batavia </em>streets, on their joint notes, and afterwards secured the payment thereof by a bond and mortgage. That in 1817, <em>J. </em>atid <em>A. T., </em>out of the profits of-their joint concern, purchased another real estate in fee, in <em>Orange </em>and <em>Cross </em>streets, for which they paid 8,000 dollars, and upwards, and took a deed to them jointly, in fee. That <em>A. T. </em>died <em>intestate, </em>the 30th of <em>January, </em>1818, leaving a wife still living, but no issue, and-three brothers, (one of whom was the plaintiff,) and a sister. That the <em>plaintiff </em>and <em>James T. </em>then entered into, and' continued their partnership, as distillers, until the death of <em>James T., </em>on the 12th of <em>July, </em>1818. That <em>James T. </em>died intestate, leaving <em>Sarah, </em>(defendant,) his widow, and leaving two children, and two brothers, (one of whom is the plaintiff,) and a sister. That administration of the goods of <em>Alexander T-, </em>was granted to his widow <em>and the plaintiff. </em>That the plaintiff acted faithfully as administrator, and also managed the estate of <em>James T., </em>after his death, with the approbation of <em>Sarah </em>his widow, who was his administratrix. That <em>James </em>and <em>Alexander T. </em>on the 22d of August, 1817, in order to take, up the notes given to <em>John </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>Pirnie, </em>for moneys to pay for the lands in <em>Cherry </em>and <em>Batavia </em>streets, and for some other small sums due to him, gave him jointly, a bond and mortgage of the ]anj3 jn <em>Orange </em>and <em>Cross </em>streets, to secure 4,500 dollars. That the plaintiff paid to <em>John P. </em>the interest of the mortgage. That the widow and children of <em>James Thompson, </em>claim not only their father\u2019s moiety, so purchased by <em>Alexander </em>and <em>James </em>21, in the said real estate, but also, the moiety of <em>Alexander T. </em>in the said real estate- (as the plaintiff and his brother and sister are aliens,) subject to his widow\u2019s dower. <em>That the plaintiff is obliged to acquiesce in that </em>claim. That the defendant <em>Sarah, </em>also, insists, that the personal estate of <em>Alexander T. </em>shall be taken, and applied towards satisfaction of the bond and mortgage, so as to disencumber <em>the real </em>estate of the said <em>Alexander T. </em>in which the plaintiff and his brother and sister have no interest, but are excluded, because they are aliens ; and which exclusion does not apply to the personal estate. That the plaintiff has adjusted the partnership concerns of <em>Alexander </em>and <em>James </em>71, so far as to ascertain that whatever sum remains <em>in the hands of the plaintiff, </em>it is not sufficient to pay to the plaintiff, <em>William T. </em>his brother, and <em>Ann </em>his sister, and the widow of <em>Alexander, T. </em>their distributive shares of the personal estate of <em>Alexander T., </em>after paying his debts, exclusive of the <em>bond and mortgage </em>debt aforesaid, which bond <em>ought to be paid by the persons entitled </em>to the <em>real estate of Alexander </em>21, from which the plaintiff, and his brother and sister, are excluded. That the defendant is attempting, by a suit at law, to force the balance of the moneys of <em>Alexander T. </em>out of the hands of the plaintiff, to be applied towards payment of that bond to <em>John Pirnie, </em>and thereby applying the personal estate of <em>Alexander </em>T\u201e, in which the plaintiff has an interest, to disencumber his real estate, in which the plaintiff has no interest; and the defendants have commenced an action against the plaintiff for such balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Prayer, for an injunction to stay the suit at law, and for general relief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-6\">Bogardus, for the plaintiff, now moved for the injunction.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-8\"><em>P.

The cases do not afford any such principle or precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
