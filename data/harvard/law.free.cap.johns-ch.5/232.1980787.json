(Beames\u2019 <em>Orders, p. </em>320.) That it appeared from these cases, to be the <em>English </em>practice, to allow the defendant his costs, when he prevailed by the allowance of the demurrer ; and that practice was followed in <em>Davoue </em>v. <em>Fanning. </em>(4 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>199.) The former decree was varied accordingly, in respect to costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
