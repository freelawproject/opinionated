THA challenges the procedures the NJRC employed in distributing the fund among the competing applicants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging violations of the \u201cSenator Byron M. Baer Open Public Meetings Act\u201d (OPMA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-6 to -21, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to -25, and due process. We conclude that the NJRC\u2019s action was inconsistent with the OPMA, the APA and the principles of administrative due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">The Special Fund at issue was established by the Casino Simulcasting Act (CSA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-191 to -210. The CSA authorizes casinos in Atlantic City to accept wagers on and receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>live transmissions of horse races conducted in this State and other jurisdictions. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-191 to -193. The CSA directs the NJRC to deposit into the Special Fund a specified portion of wagers made at casinos on races sent from racetracks \u201cout-of-State.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-203g(3); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205. The NJRC is responsible for administering the Special Fund and must disburse the entire amount annually. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205. Certain disbursements, which are mandated by subsections a through e of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205, are not at issue here. This dispute centers on the surplus remaining after those mandatory disbursements, which the NJRC must distribute to racetracks and horsemen\u2019s organizations in accordance with subsection d of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205. In 2005, a surplus of $1,820,669.42 was available for distribution pursuant to subsection d.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Subsection d provides for distribution of the surplus as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">From any amounts remaining after the payments required by subsections a., b. and c. of this section are made, the New Jersey Racing Commission shall compensate, in such amounts as that commission deems appropriate, the following entities in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">(1) any racetrack in this State which can demonstrate to the satisfaction of that commission that its financial well-being has been negatively affected by casino simulcasting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">(2) any racetrack in this State which that commission finds to be financially distressed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">(3) any horsemen\u2019s organization which will use the money to fund a project which that commission determines will be beneficial to the racing industry; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">(4) all racetracks located in this State on an equal basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">It is clear that subsection d allows racetracks and horsemen\u2019s organizations to compete for shares of the surplus in the Special Fund. Although the NJRC has broad discretion to set the amount of the awards, it must select the recipients in accordance with the statutory criteria. The NJRC cannot give a racetrack priority over a horsemen\u2019s organization unless the racetrack demonstrates that simulcasting has had a negative effect on its financial well-being or that it is \u201cfinancially distressed.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d(1)-(2). A horsemen\u2019s organization cannot obtain a share of the fund unless it proposes a project that the NJRC concludes \u201cwill be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>beneficial to the racing industry.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d(3). If the fund is not exhausted by awards to racetracks or organizations that meet the statutory criteria, the NJRC must divide the remaining surplus equally among the racetracks in this State. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Distribution of the 2005 Special Fund was an item on the agenda for a public meeting of the NJRC. Prior to that meeting, the NJRC received written requests for shares of the 2005 surplus from four racetracks and three horsemen\u2019s organizations. It is not clear how these applications were solicited. Neither the record provided on appeal nor the documents listed in the \u201cstatement of items comprising the record\u201d includes any communication from the NJRC to racetracks and horsemen\u2019s organizations describing the information interested applicants should submit. <em>See R. </em>2:5-4(b). The NJRC has not adopted a rule \u201cof practice\u201d explaining the application process. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA) requested $980,800, representing $490,400 for each of the tracks the NJSEA operates at the Meadowlands and Monmouth Park. Relying upon subsection d(l) and the NJRC\u2019s prior recognition of the negative impact of simulcasting on all New Jersey racetracks, the NJSEA requested money to defray the costs of major capital improvement programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Freehold Raceway requested $550,000. Relying upon a decline in \u201clive business\u201d from seventy-five million in 1993 at the \u201cinception of casino simulcasting\u201d to twenty-seven million in 2005, Freehold Raceway alleged \u201cfinancial distress due to an increasing need to reinvest monies into the facility in order to keep it competitive with other gaming in the State.\u201d Freehold sought the funds to \u201cincrease fits] ability to provide a quality product to fits] customers and horse owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The Atlantic City Race Course, without reference to a statutory standard, requested $250,000 for specific projects needed to upgrade, improve and repair its facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The Thoroughbred Breeders\u2019 Association requested $475,000 to help fund its current awards program. Noting a decline in the number of thoroughbred horses and horse farms in this State and its need for five million dollars to fund a competitive awards program, this horsemen\u2019s organization sought an amount adequate to fund the program at its current level.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Standardbred Breeders &amp; Owners Association requested $300,000. This horsemen\u2019s organization planned to use the money to \u201chelp fund the Health Benefit Trust that provides for health, prescription and dental benefits to approximately 1200 individuals working on the backstretch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">THA\u2019s submission, set forth in full, follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">Please consider this as a written submission setting forth the amount of funds the NJTHA, Inc. seeks and the purpose for said request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">We hereby request the amount of $364,139.88 (1/5 of the total fund) to cushion the direct benefit costs and welfare payments of this organization for the current year 2006 and to set up a reserve for the future for catastrophes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-13\">Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">THA\u2019s attorney received copies of the requests submitted by the other applicants prior to the public meeting. He also wrote to the Executive Director of the NJRC and inquired about the process the NJRC would employ to resolve the matter. The Executive Director told him \u201cthat any discussion, with respect to an item on the agenda, is at the discretion of the [NJRC].\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">When the NJRC commenced the public meeting on distribution, the Chairman immediately announced that a member of the commission would make a motion. The motion, which was in written form, was not read. The commissioner simply stated the amount of each of the seven shares he proposed and noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the reasons were stated in the written form of the motion, which would be \u201cmade available to the public at a later date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">THA\u2019s attorney asked the Chairman whether THA could have a hearing. The Chairman advised that the attorney would be permitted to speak \u201c[a]fter the vote [was] taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Without further discussion or explanation, the NJRC voted to distribute the surplus from the Special Fund as proposed in the motion: $455,167.35 each to the Meadowlands, Monmouth Park and Freehold tracks; $75,000 to the Atlantic City track; $190,083.68 for the standardbred organization; and, one-half that amount, $95,041.84, to each of the two thoroughbred organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">After the vote, THA\u2019s attorney contended that the vote violated the OPMA. He also argued that because the combined requests submitted by the competing applicants exceeded the amount available for distribution, the matter was contested and a hearing was required by the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The Chairman rejected the arguments. The Chairman explained that the NJRC used the procedures it employed in prior years and everyone involved was \u201c \u2018aware of the ground rules.\u201d He described that process: \u201c[E]veryone submitted their written information that was requested!,] and we reviewed it[,] and we discussed it[,] and we acted upon it[,] and we made a distribution.\u201d Expressing his willingness to entertain proposals for a better procedure in future years, the Chairman deemed it inappropriate for THA to suggest a different procedure on the day the NJRC was \u201csupposed to make the distribution.\u201d Noting that the NJRC had voted, the Chairman concluded the meeting. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">The CSA provides no guidance on procedures the NJRC should employ in gathering relevant information or selecting recipients from the group of applicants for funds distributed pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d. The CSA simply requires NJRC to \u201cpromulgate and adopt any rules ... necessary to effectuate the purposes of [the CSA],\u201d pursuant to the APA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-210.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Legislative deference to an administrative agency\u2019s selection of appropriate procedures is not unusual. Generally, \u201c[a]dministrative agencies have wide discretion in selecting the means to fulfill the duties that the Legislature delegated to them.\u201d <em>Texter v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., 88 N.J. </em>376, 383, 443 A.2d 178 (1982). Agencies may \u201cact informally, or formally through rule-making or adjudication in administrative hearings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 443 A.2d 178 (citations omitted); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3(2) (recognizing the propriety of \u201cinformal\u201d action by requiring each agency to \u201cadopt rules of practice setting forth the nature and requirements of all <em>formal and informal procedures </em>available.\u201d (emphasis added)). An agency\u2019s ability to select procedures it deems appropriate is limited by \u201cthe strictures of due process and of the [APA]----\u201d <em>In re Request for Solid Waste Utility Customer Lists, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>508, 519, 524 A.2d 386 (1987). If the agency complies with those strictures, courts generally \u201cdefer to the procedure chosen by the agency in discharging its statutory duty.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Where, as here, the administrative agency is a \u201ccommission ... organized under the laws of this State, and ... collectively authorized to spend public funds,\u201d and is acting by means other than formal rulemaking or adjudication pursuant to the APA, it must comply with the OPMA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-8a.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">THA contends that the NJRC\u2019s public vote, which was based on private discussions and deliberations, violates the OPMA. We agree. As the Chairman described the process, the applicants submitted information, the members of the NJRC <em>\u201creviewed it[,] </em>and [they] <em>discussed </em>it[,] and [they] acted upon it[,] and [they] made a distribution.\u201d (emphasis added). Only the voting was done in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The OPMA requires a different course of action. In adopting the OPMA, the Legislature recognized \u201cthat secrecy in public affairs undermines the faith of the public in government.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-7. And, the Legislature declared that \u201cthe right of the public ... to witness in full detail all phases of the deliberation, policy formulation, and decision making of public bodies[ ] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>vital to the ... proper functioning of the democratic process____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-7; see <em>generally Polillo v. Deane, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>562, 571, 379 A.2d 211 (1977) (discussing the importance of information to our form of government and the relationship between secrecy and public corruption). Accordingly, the OPMA requires the members of a public body to deliberate and vote at a public meeting held after giving adequate notice to the public. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-8; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-9; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-12a; <em>see S. Jersey Pub. Co., Inc. v. New Jersey Expressway Auth., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>478, 490, 591 A.2d 921 (1991) (noting that the OPMA provides greater access than prior law, which required disclosure of the official vote but not discussions leading to the vote). While the OPMA recognizes circumstances that authorize private deliberations to protect the public interest or personal rights, none of those circumstances were present here. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-12b; <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In this case, the NJRC disbursed nearly two million dollars without any public discussion or deliberation. The fact that the members of the NJRC voted at a public meeting and ultimately explained the result does not cure the problem of private deliberations. The Supreme Court has so held. <em>Polillo, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 379 A.2d 211. The Court reasoned that such an approach, contrary to the purpose of the OPMA, \u201cwould allow an agency to close its doors when conducting negotiations or hammering out policies, and then to put on an appearance of open government by allowing the public to witness the proceedings at which its action is formally adopted.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(noting also that an interpretation permitting cure by a final public vote \u201cwould conflict with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-15(a) which provides that \u2018a public body may take corrective or remedial action <em>by acting de novo </em>at a public meeting held in conformity with this act.\u2019 \u201d). By the Chairman\u2019s admission, the NJRC made its decision based on a discussion that did not take place at the public meeting. <em>See S. Harrison, Twp. Comm. v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 378-79, 510 A.2d 42 (App.Div.) (rejecting a claim that a final public vote could be considered de novo action at a public meeting curing past violations), <em>certif. denied, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>566, 523 A.2d 198 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The NJRC did not comply with the OPMA. For that reason, we void the action and remand to permit the NJRC to act de novo. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-15a.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">THA also contends that the NJRC failed to comply with the APA because it did not adopt a regulation describing the procedures governing submission and consideration of applications. Again, we agree. Indeed, based on the colloquy at the public meeting, we question whether the NJRC even considered the procedural questions in light of the APA and principles of administrative due process. While courts defer to procedures chosen by an administrative agency, we cannot defer unless it is clear that the agency made a selection and complied with the APA and principles of administrative due process. <em>Solid Waste, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 519, 524 A.2d 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Pursuant to the APA, each agency must \u201cadopt rules of practice setting forth the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available, including a description of all forms and instructions used by the agency, and ... a table of all ... deadlines, processing times and appeals proeedures[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3(2). The NJRC has not adopted a rule that describes the procedures for awarding shares of the Special Fund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rules describing agency procedures are important, because such rules \u201cprovide notice of the agency\u2019s procedures to interested parties and assure that proceedings before the agency are conducted uniformly and fairly.\u201d <em>New Jersey Racing Com\u2019n v. Silverman, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 305, 696 A.2d 771 (App.Div.1997). A description of the manner in which proceedings to resolve disputed matters will be conducted is a \u201cfundamental aspect[] of any procedural rules.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The record permits an inference that these applicants understood the need to file a written request and had the ability to obtain the requests submitted by other applicants. But the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>also demonstrates that there was no common understanding about whether or how one applicant could challenge, object to or present argument relevant to information provided by another applicant. Had the NJRC followed its obligation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-210 to adopt rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of the CSA and its obligation to promulgate \u201crules of practice\u201d required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-3(2), the applicants would have notice of their obligations and opportunities as competitors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Because the NJRC has not adopted a rule of practice incorporating procedures, the NJRC must comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52.14B-3(2) before it takes further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In exercising its discretion to select appropriate procedures for discharge of its statutory obligations, an administrative agency must consider the nature of the action it is required to take. Subsection d gives the NJRC broad discretion to exercise its expertise in distributing the surplus in the Special Fund in accordance with its assessment of the impact of casino simulcasting on the racetracks, the financial condition of the racetracks and projects that will be \u201cbeneficial to the racing industry.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d(1)-(3). Subsection d, however, also requires the NJRC to distribute this finite portion of the Special Fund among competing applicants who each must establish their eligibility under standards established by the Legislature. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The questions the NJRC must address in making the annual distribution, unlike the decision to select appropriate proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>dures for making the decision, do not require rulemaking in accordance with the APA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(e). Rulemaking is appropriate for decisions that have a \u201ccontinuing effect.\u201d <em>Ibid.; Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 328-29, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). As subsection d makes clear, the NJRC must make this decision annually in light of the amount available and the quality of the applications received.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The competition between applicants authorized by <em>N.J.S.A </em>5:12-205d is not a \u201ccontested case\u201d requiring a trial-like hearing pursuant to the APA. A proceeding qualifies as a \u201ccontested case\u201d only if there is a \u201cconstitutional\u201d or statutory right to an agency hearing. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B\u20142(b); <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Statewide Gen. Permits, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>452, 463-64, 888 A.2d 441 (2006) (noting a need for one who has no statutory right to a trial-like hearing in the Office of Administrative Law to demonstrate an interest sufficient to require a hearing on constitutional grounds). Although the racetracks and horsemen\u2019s organizations that meet the statutory standard for an award compete with each other for shares of this limited fund, we have held that one\u2019s position as a potential competitor is not a constitutionally protected \u201cproperty right\u201d sufficient to require a trial-type hearing. <em>See In re Valley Hosp., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 312, 573 A.2d 203 (App.Div.1990) (discussing the rights of an objector to an award of a certificate of need), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>318, 598 A.2d 879 (1991); <em>see also Elizabeth Fed.

The correspondence clearly ought to have been \"on file\" in the agency, and it is unquestionably relevant to the procedural issues raised before the agency and presented on this appeal. <em>R. </em>2:5-4(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"> The brief submitted on NJRC's behalf does not address THA's claim that the NJRC has failed to promulgate a relevant rule of procedure required by the APA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\"> The requests submitted by THA and other applicants provide little information relevant to the standard the applicants must meet to qualify for an award of a share of this fund, which should be distributed equally among \u201call racetracks located in this State\" if no applicant establishes its eligibility. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-205d(1)-(4). Clearly, THA\u2019s request, which is for an arbitrary fractional share of the available fund, is inconsistent with the statutory standard. A procedural rule detailing information applicants must submit likely would result in submission of applications more useful to the NJRC in the discharge of its obligation to distribute this fund as the Legislature intends. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4 (rulemaking).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\"> On appeal, the respondents rely nearly exclusively on this court's affirmance of a prior distribution of the Special Fund in an unpublished opinion that does not address the procedural arguments presented in this case. <em>In the Matter of: Consider Distribution of Casino Simulcasting Special Fund (Accumulated in 2003) Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 5:12-205(d), </em>No. A-6569-03, 2006 <em>WL </em>1479080 (App.Div. May 31, 2006). That argument was not helpful to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
