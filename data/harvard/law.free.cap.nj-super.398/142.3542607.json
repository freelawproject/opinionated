The officers activated their lights and sirens near East 30th Street and Tenth Avenue and followed the Jeep until Tenth Avenue and 33rd Street, at which point the Jeep pulled over and stopped in a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Arroyo, the driver of the unmarked police vehicle, approached the driver\u2019s side of the Jeep, and Rodriguez approached the passenger\u2019s side. When the driver of the Jeep, co-defendant Shariffe Parks, rolled down his window, Arroyo detected a strong odor of raw marijuana. Arroyo asked Parks for his driver\u2019s license, registration card, and insurance card. After Parks stated that he did not have a driver\u2019s license, Arroyo asked him to step out of the vehicle. Arroyo subsequently learned that Parks\u2019s mother was the registered owner of the Jeep Cherokee.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">While Arroyo was speaking with the driver of the Jeep, his partner, Sergeant Rodriguez, \u201cwas illuminating the inside of the car with his flashlight.\u201d Arroyo testified that as Parks exited the vehicle, his partner said something to him, and Arroyo \u201cthen observed in plain view a large plastic bag\u201d that he believed contained CDS. Subsequent testing revealed that the \u201clarge plastic bag\u201d on the floor of the Jeep contained nine clear bags of crack cocaine, twenty-one blue bags of crack cocaine, twenty-nine green bags of crack cocaine, and one plastic bag of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Parks and defendant Morgan Scott, who was a passenger in the front seat of the Jeep, were both arrested for possession of a controlled dangerous substance, and they were transported to police headquarters. During processing, it was learned that Parks, age 28, and defendant, age 43, were both residents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Paterson. Parks stated that he resided at 317 East 26th Street, and Scott stated that he resided at 379 East 29th Street. The police seized the sum of $299 in cash from Parks, but neither Parks nor defendant had any contraband on their person.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Arroyo told the jury that the bag containing the crack cocaine and marijuana was located in front of the driver\u2019s seat. During his direct testimony, Arroyo was asked to prepare \u201ca very basic diagram as to where you saw this bag of drugs in the car.\u201d After doing so, he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">Q. All right. And why don\u2019t you put a DR for driver\u2019s side of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">A. (Witness complies.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Q. Okay. And that dot that you drew on the diagram, what does that signify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">A. Where the bag was, laying on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">Q. Okay. So do you want to \u2014 were there seats in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">A. Yeah, this would be the driver\u2019s seat, and this is the passenger seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">Q. Okay. So how far from the driver\u2019s seat was the bag of drugs on the floor of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">A. It was protruding maybe ... 12 inches from the front of the seat sticking out just a little.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-14\">Q. Okay. So \u2014 you know, maybe it\u2019s easier to describe it visually. Why don\u2019t we \u2014 I\u2019m going to ask you to just come down to the center of the courtroom, and perhaps you can demonstrate \u2014 if this is the driver\u2019s seat, just demonstrate \u2014 put that where you saw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-15\">A. (Witness complies.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-16\">Q. Okay. So, for the record, it appears to be pretty much centered in the middle of the driver\u2019s seat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-17\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-18\">Q. And not covered by the driver\u2019s seat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-19\">A. No, it was in front of the driver\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-20\">Based on his training and experience, Arroyo, a nine-year veteran, testified that the twenty-one blue bags and the twenty-nine green bags, which were both smaller than the clear bags, had a street value of $10 each, and the nine clear bags had a street value of $20 each. During cross-examination, Arroyo was again asked about the location of the drugs in the Jeep, and he confirmed that the drugs were found in front of Shariffe Parks\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-21\">Detective Conyers also testified for the State. He told the jury that he had been involved in \u201canywhere between 12 and 15,000\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>narcoties-related arrests or investigations during the course of his seventeen years with the Paterson Police Department. When he was asked to describe the smell of marijuana, he stated: \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual smell. It smells kind of pungent. It doesn\u2019t smell like anything I\u2019ve ever smelled before so it has an unusual smell, but you would know the smell of it if you\u2019ve ever been exposed to it.\u201d Based on his training and experience, Conyers also testified that crack cocaine is commonly packaged to be sold on the street in small ten or twenty-dollar bags because most people who use crack can\u2019t afford to buy in bulk. He also told the jury that it\u2019s \u201cvery common\u201d for drug dealers to work together in teams \u201cfor a lot of reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Neither defendant nor co-defendant Parks testified at trial. After the State rested, defendant\u2019s attorney sought entry of a judgment of acquittal, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:18-1. Defense counsel also filed a motion for a new trial prior to sentencing. <em>R. </em>3:20-1. The standard for reviewing a claim that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict was articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">[Wjhether, viewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence direct or circumstantial, and giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all of the favorable inferences which reasonably could be drawn therefrom, a reasonable jury could find guilt of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case, the trial judge reasoned there were \u201cplenty of inferences\u201d that the drugs were possessed with an intent to distribute, and the court concluded that the State had satisfied the <em>Reyes </em>standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">[W]hat tips the scales in my view in this situation are the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">The fact that it was 12:20 a.m., the fact that the stash of the controlled dangerous substances as packaged |was] in plain view. Counsel made reference to them being under the seat of the driver, but the testimony of Officer ... <em>Arroyo ... </em>[ellearly showed and he physically demonstrated that it was not under the seat; it was directly in front of the seat and effectively between the driver\u2019s legs. It was in plain view. We don\u2019t know yet whether the passenger saw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">We may never know what he actually knew, but it was in plain view, and more significantly from the point of view of defendant Parks is the question which arises and the inference which can be drawn. What is the likelihood that if Mr. Scott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>were not his confederate that [Mr. Parks] would [have] allowed him into the car merely as a passenger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">When defendant\u2019s attorney renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the end of the entire case, the trial court supplemented its reasons for denying the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">[A]fter the motion was ruled on earlier ... it occurred to me there was something already in the evidence, which also I think is an additional factor for denial of the, motion, which is that the vehicle was coming from the direction of East 26th Street which is where defendant Parks lives. The vehicle turned at about East 28th Street and continued on down Tenth Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">Mr. Parks lives at 29th, continued past where it should have gone if ... Mr. Parks were simply giving Mr. Scott a ride home, and continued on down Tenth Avenue ultimately into Dunkin Donuts, but that fact is suggestive of something other than just a ride home from one friend\u2019s house to another or from somebody finding someone near their house and giving a ride to his home, and it was again, as I pointed out, 12:20 a.m.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The record clearly supports the trial court\u2019s analysis. In addition, the court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal was also supported by the strong odor of raw marijuana coming from the Jeep; the testimony that it is very common for drug dealers to work together in teams; and the permissible inference that the occupants of the Jeep were trying to figure out where they could hide the drugs when they proceeded for several blocks to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts parking lot after being signaled by the police to pull over.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">We recognize, of course, that \u201cpossession cannot be based on mere presence at the place where contraband is located. There must be other circumstances or statements of defendant permitting the inference of defendant\u2019s control of the contraband.\u201d <em>State v. Whyte, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 523, 628 A.2d 340 (App.Div.1992), aff<em>'d, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>481, 628 A.2d 287 (1993). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a) provides that it is \u201cunlawful for any person, knowingly or purposely ... to possess, actually or constructively, a controlled dangerous substance____\u201d Possession requires that \u201cthe possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-1(c). Thus, criminal possession signifies \u201cintentional control and dominion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ability to affect physically and care for the item during a span of time, accompanied by knowledge of its character.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 597, 404 A.2d 1111 (1979) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cPhysical or manual control of the proscribed item is not required as long as there is an intention to exercise control over it manifested in circumstances where it is reasonable to infer that the capacity to do so exists.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cOwnership in conjunction with possession is not a required element of the possessory crime; one can knowingly control something without owning it and be guilty of unlawful possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 404 A.2d 1111. \u201cProof of possession may be by circumstantial evidence as well as direct evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Rajnai, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 536, 334 A.2d 364 (App.Div.1975); <em>accord State v. Foreshaw, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166, 186, 584 A.2d 832 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>327, 598 A.2d 886 (1991). Possession need not be actual but may be constructive, and \u201cneed not be exclusive but may be jointly exercised by two or more persons.\u201d <em>Rajnai, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 536, 334 A.2d 364; <em>accord Foreshaw, supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 186, 584 A.2d 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Our review of the record convinces us that the State presented ample evidence from which both physical and constructive possession of the cocaine could be inferred. According to the State\u2019s proofs, the plastic bag containing the cocaine and marijuana was located in plain view on the floor of the Jeep, in an area that was readily accessible to defendant. We conclude from the location of the cocaine, together with the additional proofs and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, that the State presented sufficient proof to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the drugs with intent to distribute them. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal and his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Defendant also contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to conduct a preliminary hearing to determine the voluntariness and admissibility of incriminating statements he allegedly made denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>him his right to a fair trial. This issue arose in connection with the testimony of Sergeant Rodriguez, who was called as a witness by co-defendant Parks. During direct examination of Rodriguez by Parks\u2019s attorney, Rodriguez provided the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiT\">Q. Was there any conversation \u2014 did you have any conversation with either one of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">A. I believe Mr. Scott.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Q. Did he say anything to you about the drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">A. No, no. I was just asking him routine booking questions when we got to headquarters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">Q. Like what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">A. His name, where he lived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The State followed up on this during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">Q. Now Mr. Rosenfelt brought up the fact that you had a conversation with Mr. Scott.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">Q. Isn\u2019t it a fact that he gave you a bit of attitude?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">MR. KEYS [Defendant\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object here under <em>Rule </em>104.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-15\">MS. KANE [Assistant Prosecutor]: Judge, the door was opened by Mi-. Rosenfelt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-16\">MR. KEYS: Not me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-17\">THE COURT: The door was opened, the door was opened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-18\">MR. KEYS: Not by me, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-19\">THE COURT: I understand, but it\u2019s been opened in this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-20\">MR. KEYS: Pine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-21\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-22\">BY MS. KANE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-23\">Q. You can go ahead and answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-24\">A. Yes, he did, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-25\">Q. And what \u2014 how would you describe what he gave you a little bit of an attitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-26\">A. He was [of] a very combative nature, stating it wasn\u2019t his, this and that, the narcotics weren\u2019t his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-27\">Q. Okay. And did he say something to you to the effect that you got nothing on me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-28\">A. Yes, he did, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-29\">During summations, the State repeatedly argued to the jury that the alleged statement \u201cyou\u2019ve got nothing on me\u201d was an admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>sion by defendant that he was aware that there were drugs in the Jeep:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">But just remember, you\u2019ve got nothing on me. You\u2019ve got nothing on me is a little different than saying, oh, oh, I had no idea, I had no idea, I\u2019m not involved in this. You\u2019ve got nothing on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">It\u2019s for you to decide. He had no obligation to say anything but he chose to say to the police officer, you\u2019ve got nothing on me. That\u2019s the circumstance to consider. Does that sound right, if he\u2019s so innocent as Mr. Keys portrays him? Or does he sound [like] someone who thinks he knows the law because the drug ended up by Mr. Parks, he\u2019s free and clear, Mr. Parks has to take the weight for their mutual crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">[I]f in fact the drugs were really on the floor in front of Mr____Parks that whole time and the car smelled like marijuana, you don\u2019t think he\u2019s aware of that?____ [A]nd if he wasn\u2019t aware, if ... he is not involved and he smells the marijuana and knew it was marijuana and found out there was drugs in the car don\u2019t you think he\u2019d say, you know what, this is my street, just drop me off here or anywhere along the way, just let me out. Just let me out, I want nothing to do with this. No, he stays in the car and he said to the police when they finally arrest him, hey, you got nothing on me. Not, like, what\u2019s this about? You got nothing on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">Again, I\u2019ve mentioned this repeatedly, you\u2019ve got nothing on me, more circumstantial evidence that he was not an innocent passenger who had no idea what was going on. Sounds more, ladies and gentlemen, to me like someone who says, all right, the cops are behind us, I\u2019m looking out for myself. I\u2019m going to throw the drugs over by Parks and he\u2019s got the money, the car\u2019s registered to his mother, I\u2019m clear, and the cop comes up and he gives Officer Rodriguez a bit of an attitude, you\u2019ve got nothing on me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">\u201cVoluntariness of a confession or other inculpatory statement by an accused must always be established at a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(c) hearing before it can be introduced into evidence at trial.\u201d Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 6 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 (2006) (citing <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>392, 404-05, 388 A.2d 218 (1978)). The State contends that defendant\u2019s alleged statements \u201cappear to have been spontaneously made ... Under these circumstances, the admission of the statements without an <em>Evid. R. </em>104 hearing was not harmful error.\u201d We reject this argument, however, because the State\u2019s proofs were less than overwhelming, and, as noted by the trial court, it would not have been surprising \u201cto see the jury go the other way.\u201d We conclude that the trial court erred in failing to conduct the preliminary hearing requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>by defense counsel, and we also conclude that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. McCloskey, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>18, 30, 446 A.2d 1201 (1982) (noting that \u201cerrors which impact substantially and directly on fundamental procedural safeguards ... are not amenable to harmless error rehabilitation\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We therefore remand this issue for a voluntariness hearing. <em>State v. Kelly, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>283, 294-95, 294 A.2d 41 (1972); <em>State v. Marczak, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 398, 782 A.2d 440 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>44, 791 A.2d 222 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">If defendant\u2019s alleged statement was not voluntary and admissible, then he will receive a new trial. As the Court stated in <em>Kelly:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">We believe that the interests of justice will best be served by now having the trial judge conduct the hearing on voluntariness. If at the hearing the State fails to establish voluntariness beyond reasonable doubt the defendant will be entitled to a new trial at which the statements will be excluded. If, however, the State does establish beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were voluntary, and the trial judge so determines, then the defendant\u2019s conviction may stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\"><em>[Kelly, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 294 A.2d 41 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Defendant also challenges his sentence. At sentencing, on March 19, 2004, the trial court acknowledged that defendant did not have an extensive prior criminal record, and it gave the following reasons for defendant\u2019s sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">THE COURT: His prior record is not a hugely aggravating factor, but it\u2019s an aggravating factor.

There\u2019s no question that he only did about a week in the county jail there, and then the rest of it was served as probationary time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">And that\u2019s about it----[T]here [were] a few DP\u2019s [sic] for which mere fines were imposed on three occasions on domestic violence cases. One of them was criminal mischief as well. All between '95 and '99, it seems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">... [OJther aggravating factors are the risk that Mr. Scott would have been involved in this sort of activity ...

He\u2019s to serve three years of that time before being eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Because defendant does not have an extensive criminal record, and neither the judge\u2019s findings nor the record justify imposition of a five-year maximum term for a third-degree offense, we remand for resentencing. In addition, we agree that defendant\u2019s term violates the sentencing principles announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>296, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 878 A.2d 724 (2005). In <em>Natale, </em>the Court held that \u201ca sentence above the presumptive statutory term based solely on a judicial finding of aggravating factors other than a prior criminal conviction, violates a defendant\u2019s Six Amendment jury trial guarantee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 878 A.2d 724. Here, it is clear that the aggravating factors cited by the trial court were not based solely on defendant\u2019s prior criminal record. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to be resentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 878 A.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">We have determined that defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2). Consequently, the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. If the remand proceedings result in a determination that the statements attributed to defendant were voluntary and admissible, then a new trial is not warranted. But defendant shall be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">The matter is remanded for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b183-11\">FUENTES, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUq\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">My colleagues in the majority have concluded that the State presented sufficient evidence to establish that defendant actually or constructively possessed the cocaine found in the vehicle in which he was a passenger. I disagree and therefore dissent. In my view, the State failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the three essential elements of possession; namely that defendant (1) was aware of the presence of the package in which the cocaine was found in the car; (2) had knowledge of its character, that is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the package contained cocaine; and (3) intended or had the capacity to exercise control or dominion over the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The State\u2019s evidence as to possession consisted entirely of the testimony of the two arresting officers. From the moment the officers first observed Parks driving the Jeep Cherokee in an erratic fashion and without headlights, there was no indication that defendant, as the front-seat passenger, acted in a suspicious manner. When the two officers approached the vehicle, Officer Arroyo from the driver\u2019s side, and Officer Rodriguez from the passenger\u2019s side, they did not see defendant engage in any action or movement that led them to conclude or even suspect that defendant was aware of the existence of any contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In this context, the majority found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">[T]he court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal was also supported by the strong odor of raw marijuana coming from the Jeep; the testimony that it is very common for drug dealers to work together in teams; and the permissible inference that the occupants of the Jeep were trying to figure out where they could hide the drugs when they proceeded for several blocks to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts parking lot after being signaled by the police to pull over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">[398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 150, 940 A.2d at 304]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The record does not support these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">First, it is undisputed that both arresting officers testified to detecting the strong odor of \u201craw\u201d marijuana when Parks rolled down the car-window. As the following excerpts from Arroyo\u2019s direct testimony illustrate, however, the police were able to recognize this particular scent only because of their specialized training and experience.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">Q. And the driver, also Mr. \u2014 known as Mr. Parks, then did he roll down the window?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">Officer Arroyo: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">Q. What, if anything, caught your attention next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\">Officer Arroyo: I detected a strong odor of raw marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-15\">Q. Okay. Now \u2014 and how did you recognize it to be the odor of raw marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">Officer Arroyo: Past training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-16\">Q. Now you\u2019re saying \u2018raw marijuana,\u2019 \u2014 you\u2019re specifying \u2018raw marijuana.\u2019 What \u2014 is there a significance to the smell of raw marijuana as opposed to some other kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Officer Arroyo: Well, it\u2019s not like \u2014 it\u2019s not burnt. Not somebody that was just smoking mai-ijuana, a different smell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">Q. Okay. So are you, based on your experience, familiar with how raw marijuana smells versus how burnt marijuana smells?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">Officer Arroyo: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Because defendant did not testify, there is no evidence from which a rational factfinder can conclude that defendant had the necessary training or experiences to have detected the distinct odor of raw marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Second, the drugs were found in a plastic package, beneath the driver\u2019s seat. Even the officer who first discovered the package admitted that he noticed it only after pointing his flashlight directly at the location where it was hidden. Once detected, the officer was able to identify the package\u2019s illicit nature only because of his training and experience as a veteran police officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">Q. When you first flashed your light down there and you saw something down there, did you know in a split second that it was drugs or did it take you a couple of seconds to figure out what\u2019s that shining between Mr. Parks\u2019 feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">A. It took me a little bit to actually focus on what it exactly was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">Q. So you couldn\u2019t immediately identify it as CDS?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">A. No, I couldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">Q. Even though in your experience you\u2019ve seen CDS a lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-15\">A. Yes, I have, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">Q. I think you\u2019ve testified fifty to 100 different arrests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-17\">A. About 100,150.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-18\">Q. And you\u2019ve gone through the DEA training that we\u2019ve talked about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-19\">A. Yes, I have, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-20\">There is no evidence that defendant had the necessary training or experiences to have detected the illicit nature of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">Finally, the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cit is very common for drug dealers to work together in teams\u201d and that a permissible inference can be drawn that \u201cthe occupants of the Jeep were trying to figure out where they could hide the drugs when they proceeded for several blocks to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts parking lot after being signaled by the police to pull over,\u201d is based on nothing more than rank speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>There is absolutely no evidence in the record to indicate that defendant and Parks were acting as \u201ca team.\u201d The police did not observe the two men engaged in any kind of furtive movements before the vehicle came to a stop, or at any time thereafter. The evidence before the jury can only suggest that defendant was nothing more than a mere passenger in a car driven by Parks. Further, no rational inference can be draw against defendant from Parks\u2019 failure to pull over immediately in response to the police\u2019s direction to do so. Defendant was not in control of the vehicle, and there is no evidence to indicate that he exerted any influence over its driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">As we noted in <em>State v. Whyte, </em>and as my colleagues in the majority pointed out, \u201c[i]t is clear that constructive possession cannot be based on mere presence at the place where contraband is located. There must be other circumstances or statements of defendant permitting the inference of defendant\u2019s control of the contraband.\u201d 265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 523, 628 A.2d 340 (App.Div.1992), aff<em>'d o.b., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>481, 628 A.2d 287 (1993). The factual circumstances in <em>Whyte </em>are remarkably similar to those presented here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">The contraband here did not have a value of anything like the magnitude which apparently influenced the Court in <em>Palacio</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>None of the passengers aeted in any way furtively or suspiciously. If we assume that the trip originated either in the Bronx or in Brooklyn, it was relatively brief in both distance and duration. We certainly could not, nor could a jury, speculate on its destination. There is no other fact here indicating the passengers\u2019 knowledge that the van contained contraband, no less that they were co-possessors of it____ There is a world of difference between speculation and legitimate inference, and we conclude that the convictions here rested on speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 525, 628 A.2d 340.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Here, defendant and the driver were apprehended while traveling through the streets of the City of Paterson. There is no indication that the trip originated from a long distance. As discussed, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>evidence exists that would allow a rational jury to infer that defendant had knowledge of the contents of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In this light, the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe State presented ample evidence from which both physical and constructive possession of the cocaine could be inferred,\u201d is not supported by the evidence presented, and is erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\"> In <em>Palacio, </em>the illicit drugs found in the vehicle had an estimated value of just under one million dollars. <em>State v. Palacio, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>543, 545-46, 545 A.2d 764 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
