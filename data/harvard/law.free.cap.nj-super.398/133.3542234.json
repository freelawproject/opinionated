Heath, Sr. to appeal from a March 22, 2007, order dismissing the fourth count of defendants\u2019 counterclaim, which asserted a violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -20, by plaintiff Czar, Inc. At issue is whether defendants\u2019 claim against plaintiff for violations of the Act is legally viable. Because we find, in these circumstances, that plaintiff is a \u201cseller\u201d of a \u201chome improvement\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1A, we reverse and remand the matter for trial. The pertinent facts and procedural history are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Sometime prior to 2005, defendants engaged a general contractor to construct a new home for them. They contracted directly, however, with plaintiff for the installation of custom kitchen cabinets, interior doors, a front door, and certain moldings. Plaintiff was not the general contractor, nor a subcontractor, and its name does not appear on the building permit for the new home. Eventually, a dispute between plaintiff and defendants arose over payment and timing of work. In June 2005, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Law Division, Essex County, for moneys owed to it. In July 2005, defendants filed a complaint in the Law Division, Morris County, seeking damages and alleging a violation of the Act. On September 16, 2005, a consent order was entered which consolidated both matters in the Law Division, Essex County.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">On March 21, 2007, on the morning of trial, the judge entertained in limine motions, one of which is at issue here. Plaintiff argued that the Act was inapplicable to plaintiff in this case and sought dismissal of count four of defendants\u2019 counterclaim alleging a violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The judge heard argument and took testimony. The trial judge found that the new home was a \u201cnew residence\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1A, and that plaintiff and defendants had entered into a contract and, therefore, were in direct privity with one another. The trial judge found that the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>contract was for plaintiff to install custom kitchen cabinets, chair rails, doors, and certain molding.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">After making the findings set forth above, the trial judge concluded that plaintiff was \u201cintimately involved with the construction of the new residence, at least as to the kitchen,\u201d although the judge found that the only construction plaintiff undertook in the home was with respect to the installation of kitchen cabinets, certain doors, and chair rails. The judge made it clear that plaintiff was not involved in any plumbing, electrical work, or any structural work on the new residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The trial judge, though, concluded that the home improvement practice regulations found in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1 to 16.2 were not applicable to plaintiff and, therefore, dismissed the fourth count of defendants\u2019 counterclaim. We granted leave to appeal from the trial judge\u2019s March 22, 2007, interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We begin by reviewing certain applicable legal principles. As we often recognize, a trial judge\u2019s factual findings in a non-jury matter \u201care considered binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). Therefore, we do not disturb the factual findings of a trial judge unless they are \u201cso manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interest of justice____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Fagliarone v. Twp. of N. Bergen, </em>78 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154, 155, 188 A.2d 43 (App.Div), <em>certif. denied, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>221, 191 A.2d 61 (1963)). However, a trial judge\u2019s legal interpretations are not entitled to the same level of deference. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). We undertake an independent \u201cinterpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts____\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">\u201cThroughout its history, the Act has protected consumers from deception and fraud, even when committed in good faith.\u201d <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>582, 604, 691 A.2d 350 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>(1997). \u201c|I]n 1975, the Legislature further amended the Act to include unlawful practices in the sale or advertisement of real estate.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2 contains the operative language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate, or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The Supreme Court has outlined the Act\u2019s provisions saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">An offense arises under the Act from an affirmative act, an omission, or a violation of an administrative regulation. <em>Straun v. Canuso, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>43, 60, 657 A.2d 420 (1995); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>2, 19, 647 A.2d 454 (1994). One who makes an affirmative misrepresentation is liable even in the absence of knowledge of the falsity of the misrepresentation, negligence, or the intent to deceive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aef\"><em>[Gennari, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 691 A.2d 350.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The Department of Law and Public Safety has adopted administrative regulations to ensure compliance with the Act. <em>Messeka Sheet Metal v. Hodder, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>116, 121, 845 A.2d 646 (App.Div.2004). One section of these regulations, quoted in pertinent part below, \u201cis devoted to home improvement practices.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1 to 16.2. The regulations define \u201chome improvement\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\"><em>\u201cHome improvement\u201d means </em>the remodeling, altering, painting, repairing, renovating, restoring, moving, demolishing, or modernizing of residential or noncommercial property or the making of additions thereto, and includes, but is not limited to, the <em>construction, installation, </em>replacement, improvement, or repair <em>of </em>driveways, sidewalks, swimming pools, terraces, patios, landscaping, fences, porches, windows, <em>doors, cabinets, </em>kitchens, bathrooms, garages, basements and basement waterproofing, fire protection devices, security protection devices, central heating and air conditioning equipment, water softeners, heaters, and purifiers, solar heating or water systems, insulation installation, siding, wall-to-wall carpeting or attached or inlaid floor coverings, and other changes, repairs, or improvements made in or on, attached to or fanning a part of the residential or noncommercial property, <em>but does not include the construction of a new residence. </em>The term extends to the conversion of existing commercial structures into residential or noncommercial property and includes any of the above activities performed under emergency conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16A (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The trial judge found that plaintiff\u2019s work for defendants was not a \u201chome improvement\u201d within the meaning of the regulation because the construction and installation of the doors, cabinets, and moldings were part of the construction of a new residence and, therefore, excluded from the definition of \u201chome improvement.\u201d Consequently, the trial judge found plaintiffs actions were not unlawful practices as defined by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2 and dismissed defendants\u2019 counterclaim asserting violations of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We disagree with the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of \u201chome improvement\u201d under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1A in these factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">As we said in <em>Medford Convalescent v. Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 526 A.2d 1087 (App.Div.1985),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">Regulations are subject to the same rules of construction as a statute. <em>See Essex County Welfare v. Klein, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 247, 373 A.2d 691 (App.Div.1977). The regulation should be construed in accordance with the plain meaning of its language, <em>see Serv. Armament Co. v. Hyland, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>550, 556, 362 A.2d 13 (1976), and in a manner that makes sense when read in the context of the entire regulation. <em>See Houman v. Mayor &amp; Council of Pompton Lakes, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 169, 382 A.2d 413 (Law Div.1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">While the language of the regulation provides that home improvement \u201cdoes not include the construction of a new residence,\u201d plaintiff did not and was not hired to construct a new residence. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1A. In this case, plaintiff was not the general contractor hired to construct a new residence, did not install or build any structural improvements in the home, but rather contracted directly with defendants for the installation of custom kitchen cabinets, a front door, interior doors, and certain moldings.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">If plaintiff\u2019s interpretation were adopted, an owner of a new residence under construction, who contracts directly with a retail carpeting seller for all-wool carpeting and who later determines that the retail carpeting seller provided nylon instead, would have no remedy under the Act simply because the carpeting was placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>in a newly constructed home. That does not comport with a plain reading of the regulation or with the intent of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Moreover, we note that this regulation must be read <em>in pari, materia </em>with \u201cThe New Home Warranty and Builders\u2019 Registration Act\u201d (the New Home Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:3B-1 to -20. \u201cStatutes and regulations <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed together when helpful in resolving doubts or uncertainties in the ascertainment of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Porch, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>167, 174, 249 A.2d 388 (1969). Moreover, \u201cregulations within the same regulatory scheme should, where feasible, be read as consistent with each other.\u201d <em>Van Orman v. Am. Ins. Co., </em>608 <em>F.Supp. </em>13 (D.N.J.1984). The regulations issued under the New Home Act require a new home builder to register with the Department of Community Affairs. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:25-2.1(a). A \u201cnew home builder\u201d is defined to mean \u201cany individual, corporation, partnership or other business organization engaged in the construction of new homes.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:25-1.3. The home improvement practices regulations exempt from registration as a home improvement \u201cseller\u201d new home builders registered under the New Home Act. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-17.4(a)(1). Consequently, reading the two statutes and the accompanying regulations <em>in pari, materia </em>results in a harmonious and effective remedy for homeowners. If a home improvement \u201cseller\u201d violates the Act, there is a remedy available under the home improvement practices regulations, as well as the Act. If, however, a builder who is constructing a new residence commits an act which would be an unlawful home improvement practice under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2, the remedy is not set forth in that regulation, but in the New Home Act and its regulations. However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-9 provides that nothing contained in the New Home Act shall affect other rights or remedies available to an owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>In addition, we note that, while a new home builder\u2019s acts may not be within the definition of \u201chome improvement\u201d and, therefore, not within the unlawful practices set forth in the home improvement practices regulations, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2, a builder of a new home may still be subject to the Act. Our courts have held that the Act is applicable to the sale of newly constructed homes. <em>Gennari, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 613, 691 A.2d 350; <em>DiIorio v. Structural Stone &amp; Brick, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>134, 143, 845 A.2d 658 (App.Div.2004); <em>New Mea Constr. Corp. v. Harper, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 501, 497 A.2d 534 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Therefore, even if we were to conclude that plaintiff was a new home builder and excluded from the definition of home improvement in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1A, and consequently did not fall within the unlawful practices set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2, that would not exempt the builder of a new home from being subject to the provisions of the Act. It would only exempt it from falling within the definition of unlawful practices in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2. That regulation specifically points out that it does not limit \u201cany other practices which may be unlawful\u201d under the Act. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We note that the trial judge and plaintiffs counsel relied on two cases to support the dismissal of the counterclaim for violations of the Act against plaintiff, <em>Messeka Sheet Metal Co. v. Hodder, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>116, 845 A.2d 646 (App.Div.2004), and <em>Splash of Tile, Inc. v. Moss, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>143, 814 A.2d 648 (App.Div.), <em>certif. den., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>430, 824 A.2d 159 (2003). Those cases are distinguishable from the facts here. In <em>Splash of Tile, </em>the court affirmed a finding that defendant failed to establish a claim under the Act on the merits. The court, in dictum, said that the home improvement in that case, a new ceramic tile floor in a kitchen, was not covered by the home improvement practices regulations because the regulation did not include \u201cthe construction of a new residence,\u201d the factual circumstances present in that case. <em>Splash of Tile, supra, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 154, 814 A.2d 648. To the extent <em>Splash of Tile </em>is read to hold that any \u201chome improvement\u201d done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>on new construction is exempt from the Act, we respectfully disagree. Moreover, as the statement was not necessary to the decision made, it is dictum, and while \u201centitled to due consideration[, it] does not invoke the principle of stare decisis.\u201d <em>Jamouneau v. Div. of Tax Appeals, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>325, 332, 66 A.2d 534 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In the <em>Messeka </em>case, our court made it clear that it was not resting its decision on the \u201cnew residence\u201d exception to the home improvement definition in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1A, but rather that it was \u201cpersuaded that this case falls beyond the purpose of the regulations because the owner hired his own general contractor and architect to run the job,\u201d and this was a direct claim by the owner against a subcontractor, with whom the owner was not in privity. <em>Messeka, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 125, 845 A.2d 646. In this case, while defendants had a general contractor, plaintiff was not a subcontractor. Rather, plaintiff directly contracted with defendants in this case and the danger which concerned us in <em>Messeka, </em>that the regulatory requirements under the Act would have to apply to each individual subcontractor and would be inefficient and duplicative, is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Accordingly, we hold that under the factual construct in this case, where the owner dealt directly with a custom cabinet maker, and contracted directly for the installation and construction of cabinets, doors, and certain woodwork, and where the contractor did not construct the new home, the contractor\u2019s services fall within the definition of \u201chome improvement\u201d contained within <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-16.1A. We, therefore, reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> We note that the record does not reveal whether plaintiff was registered as a new home builder pursuant to the New Home Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
