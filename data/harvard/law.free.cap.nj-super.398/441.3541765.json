We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Scott is one of ten salaried, undercover loss-prevention officers for Foodarama. He and the other officers are required to work at least forty-eight hours per week and are not paid any additional compensation for work in excess of forty-eight hours. His time is clocked from check-in to departure. Foodarama is a chain of twenty-four supermarkets throughout central New Jersey and Scott was assigned to stores on a rotating basis so that he would not become familiar to shoppers. Scott is reimbursed for gasoline, tolls and out-of-pocket expenses. He also receives $200 a month for wear and tear on his ear and that amount is included in his salary. He is entitled to reimbursement for gasoline for his entire round trip from home to work and back as well as trips between stores during his workday. Scott testified that \u201cwhen I leave my house I\u2019m technically working.\u201d No one testified on behalf of Foodarama.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">On the night of November 11, 2005, Scott was traveling home from work and was involved in an accident. He injured his right knee and lower back, fractured his nose, and lacerated his spleen, requiring surgical removal. He moved for temporary disability and medical benefits and the judge conducted a plenary hearing at which the judge determined that Scott was acting in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>his employment at the time of the accident because he was paid by the mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Foodarama contends on appeal that Scott was not paid wages for his travel time but only expenses and thus was not within the course of his employment traveling to and from work. It asserts that the judge of workers\u2019 compensation incorrectly applied <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36 to the facts of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The standard for appellate review of a determination of a judge of compensation is equivalent to that used for review of any nonjury case. <em>Brock v. Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>378, 383, 693 A.2d 894 (1997) (citations omitted). We may not substitute our own fact-finding for that of the judge of compensation, even if we are inclined to do so. <em>Lombardo v. Revlon, Inc., </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 488, 746 A.2d 475 (App.Div.2000). Rather, we will only decide \u201c \u2018whether the findings made could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record,\u2019 considering \u2018the proofs as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965) (citation omitted). This court must give \u201cdue regard to the opportunity of the one who heard the witnesses to judge of their credibility!,]\u201d and, where an agency\u2019s expertise is a factor, give due regard to that expertise. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In <em>De Angelo v. Alsan Masons, Inc., </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 89-90, 299 A.2d 90 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>581, 303 A.2d 883 (1973), we recognized that appellate review is limited \u201cto a determination of whether the findings of the judge of compensation could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the whole record, after giving due weight to his expertise in the field and his opportunity of hearing and seeing the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to -128 defines \u201ccourse of employment\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">Employment shall be deemed to commence when an employee arrives at the employee\u2019s place of employment to report to work and shall terminate when the employee leaves the employer\u2019s place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer; provided, however, when the employee is required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the employer to be away from the employer\u2019s place of employment, the employee shall be deemed to be in the course of employment when the employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned or directed by the employer; <em>but the employment of employee paid travel time by the employer for time spent traveling to and from a job site ... shall commence and terminate with the time spent traveling to and from a job </em>site____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The statute recognizes two types of employment. \u201cOn-premises employment (as its terminology directly implies) begins when the employee gets to the place where he or she works (to the premises), and ends when the employee leaves that place; off-premises employment, however, relates to the doing of the work \u2018assigned or directed by the employer.\u2019\u201d <em>Jumpp v. City of Ventnor, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>470, 480, 828 A.2d 905 (2003). Both types of employees are treated the same.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">Simply put, on-premises employees are not within the scope of employment until they arrive at the employer\u2019s place of business, and they shed that status when they depart. Because off-premises employees may not report to a single \u201cpremises,\u201d the statute provides that they are to be compensated only for accidents occurring in the direct performance of their duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 483, 828 A.2d 905.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Generally, accidents occurring while an employee is traveling to and from work are not considered within the course of employment unless \u201cthe employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned or directed by the employer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u2014 36. This general rule has long been known as the \u201cgoing and coming rule.\u201d <em>Cressey v. Campus Chefs, Div. of CVI Serv., Inc., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 342, 498 A.2d 1274 (App.Div.1985) (\u201cThe \u2018going and coming rule\u2019 is a rule of workers\u2019 compensation which denies compensation for injuries incurred while traveling to and from work.\u201d) (citing <em>Hammond v. The Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>7, 11, 264 A.2d 204 (1970); 1 Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 15.11 (1985)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rule limits re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>covery to those injured on the employer\u2019s premises. This has become known as the \u201cpremises rule.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 15.12a); <em>see also Novis v. Rosenbluth Travel, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>92, 96, 649 A.2d 69 (1994); <em>Zelasko v. Refrigerated Food Express, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>329, 336, 608 A.2d 231 (1992); <em>Manzo v. Amalgamated Indus. Union Local 76B, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>604, 613-14, 575 A.2d 903 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>372, 585 A.2d 379 (1990); <em>Plodzien v. Twp. of Edison Police Dep\u2019t, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 134, 549 A.2d 59 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>655, 552 A.2d 177 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">There is, however, an exception to this rule. The \u201ctravel-time\u201d exception provides workers\u2019 compensation coverage to employees who are paid for their travel time to and from distant work sites even though they may not be in the direct performance of their duties. <em>Brown v. Am. Red Cross, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173, 179, 639 A.2d 407 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">This exception affords portal-to-porlal coverage for employees \u201cpaid for travel time to and from a distant job site.\u201d <em>Zelasko, [supra,], </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 336[, 608 <em>A.2d </em>231]. It is rooted in the concept that the paid-for journey itself is part of the services provided by the employee. 1 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 16.21 (1990). \u201cWhen the employee is paid an identifiable amount as compensation for time spent in a going or coming trip, the trip is within the course of employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also, Nebesne lv. Crocetti, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super.218,] </em>281[, 476 A.2d 858 (App.Div.1984) ] (\u201ca traveling employee is not in the course of his employment and any accident does not arise out of that employment <em>unless the employee is receiving employment wages for the time thus spent traveling\u201d). </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">[<em>Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">We further held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">when an employee has no conventional \u201cplace of employment,\u201d the Legislature intended to cover an employee when the parlies\u2019 contract of employment provides, as an inducement for employment, for the payment of wages for travel to and from the employee\u2019s residence and the employer\u2019s job site. To hold otherwise would render a body of employees, paid for their travel time, without coverage simply because the nature of their work does not contemplate such a conventional place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>employment. So long as the added remuneration is \u201cidentifiable\" as travel time, Larson, \u00a7 16.21, the travel directly benefits the employer and the employee is traveling directly to or from his or her home and the designated job site, coverage should be afforded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">[Id. at 181, 639 A.2d 407.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Applying these principles, we found that a traveling phlebotomist who was paid for her travel time in excess of thirty minutes was engaged in the course of her employment when she was involved in an accident while traveling to a job site. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">However, Scott was not paid for his travel time. He was only reimbursed for his actual gasoline consumption plus tolls and wear and tear on his vehicle. This case is factually very similar to the facts in <em>Nebesne v. Crocetti, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 476 A.2d 858 (App.Div.1984). There, Nebesne, like Scott, was a salaried employee, who received $50 per week for travel expenses, which the judge of compensation concluded was sufficient to cover all of his travel expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 476 A.2d 858. In doing so, the judge relied on <em>Ricciardi, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 62, 312 A.2d 139, which allowed compensation for accidents occurring during travel where the employee was wholly reimbursed. <em>Nebesne, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 280, 476 A.2d 858. However, we found that the rule of <em>Ricciardi </em>was an anachronism in light of the 1979 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36, confining the exception to the going-and-coming rule to employees who were paid wages for their travel time. 64 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 315 A.2d 25.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">Regardless of make-whole reimbursement for expenses, a traveling employee is not in the course of his employment and any accident does not arise out of that employment unless the employee is receiving employment wages for the time thus spent traveling. For us to impute any other meaning to these unambiguous words under the guise of \u201cliberal construction\u201d would constitute judicial legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFx\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Since we decided <em>Nebesne, </em>the Legislature has revised <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:15-36 on five occasions without reinstating the <em>Ricciardi </em>exception to the going-and-coming rule. <em>P.L. </em>1981, c. 413, \u00a7 6; <em>P.L. </em>1986, c. 35; <em>P.L. </em>1989, c. 227; <em>P.L. </em>1994, c. 74; <em>P.L. </em>1999, c. 383. \u201cThe construction of a statute by the courts, supported by long acquiescence on the part of the Legislature, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>by continued use of the same language or failure to amend the statute, is evidence that such construction is in accordance with the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Lemke v. Bailey, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>295, 301, 196 A.2d 523 (1963). Thus, we conclude that our interpretation of the statute in <em>Nebesne </em>is consistent with the legislative intent. We see no reason to now depart from this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We are not persuaded by Scott\u2019s claim that he was paid wages for his travel time. He clearly testified that the $200 monthly payment was for wear and tear on his vehicle and even though it was included in his paycheck, he admitted that it was not for his time in traveling to and from work. He was, however, paid for his travel time between stores because he was entitled to count that time toward his minimum forty-eight hour workweek.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We are also unpersuaded by his effort to claim that he was using \u201can employer-authorized vehicle.\u201d This argument does not appear to have been advanced before the judge of compensation. Furthermore, the Supreme Court in <em>Zelasko, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 339-40, 608 A.2d 231, rejected just such a claim, holding that an employee-owned vehicle was not \u201can authorized vehicle\u201d when it was being used on business authorized by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\"> Prior to the 1979 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36, which defined \"employment\u201d for the first time in the Workers' Compensation Act, a judicially created exception to the common-law going-and-coming rule permitted benefits for accidents occurring during travel to and from work if the employer reimbursed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the employee for all or substantially all of the employee\u2019s travel expenses. <em>Ricciardi v. Aniero Concrete Co., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>60, 62, 312 A.2d 139 (1973). This exception was eliminated by the language of the 1979 amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
