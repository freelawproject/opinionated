REISNER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Defendant Hapag-Lloyd AG (H-L) appeals from a trial court order dated September 16, 2005, applying New York law to defendant\u2019s potential liability in this personal injury case; an order dated September 28, 2006, entering judgment on a jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs Paul Dolan and his wife Kathleen Dolan; and an October 18, 2006 order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">This case concerns a January 2,2004 accident which occurred on Route 46 in Palisades Park, New Jersey, between a car driven by plaintiff Paul Dolan (Dolan) and a container that fell off a tractor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>trailer. The tractor-trailer (truck) was composed of a chassis and an intermodal container belonging to H-L, an ocean carrier, and a cab belonging to Sea Transfer Corp., a motor carrier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Sea Transfer truck was transporting H-L\u2019s cargo from the Howland Hook terminal in Staten Island to H-L\u2019s customer in the Bronx.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The most direct delivery route would have been to drive entirely through New York. However, at the direction of his employer Sea Transfer, the driver Jose Gonzalez drove a portion of the trip through New Jersey in order to avoid New York City traffic. His prescribed route involved taking the Goethals Bridge to the New Jersey Turnpike, to Route 46, to the George Washington Bridge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In granting a motion for summary judgment on the issue of the driver\u2019s negligence, the trial judge concluded that the accident occurred because Gonzalez failed to properly secure the container to the truck chassis before he left the Staten Island terminal. Instead, knowing that the two front locking pins on the chassis were not properly inserted in the container, Gonzalez chose to drive the truck anyway, skipping the optional \u201croadability\u201d inspection on his way out of the terminal. Roadability inspections are done to \u201censure that the unit is roadworthy to be taken out on public streets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">As he was driving east on Route 46, a divided highway with two lanes in each direction, Gonzalez moved his truck so that it occupied both northbound lanes, to anticipate the possibility of drivers merging onto Route 46 from the side. According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>judge\u2019s written opinion, Gonzalez \u201cproceeded around a curve in the road, and as he started to move back into the right lane, the container became dislodged from the chassis and fell over the divider into the Westbound lane of traffic of Route 46.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the chassis itself separated from the truck cab and slid over the divider.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Dolan, a plumber employed by the City University of New York (CCNY) at 138th Street in Manhattan, was on his way home from work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He followed his usual route across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey, and then onto Route 46, heading for the New Jersey Turnpike. However, as Dolan\u2019s minivan was proceeding westbound on Route 46, it collided head-on with the container that had fallen off Gonzalez\u2019s truck. The front of Dolan\u2019s vehicle was virtually destroyed. The investigating officer on the scene testified that he had \u201cnever seen damage like that to a vehicle and somebody surviving.\u201d Dolan sustained massive injuries which, according to his expert witnesses, resulted in his total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Plaintiffs first filed suit in New York. However, the New York judge dismissed the action solely on forum non conveniens grounds. The judge declined to decide whether New York or New Jersey law would apply to the underlying controversy, and in fact noted that \u201cany New Jersey Court may apply New York law where warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to apply New York law to the issue of H-L\u2019s liability, the New Jersey trial judge reasoned that the negligent act which was at the root of the accident occurred in New York, when Gonzalez, a New York resident and employee, operating a truck based in New York, failed to properly attach the container to the chassis. That the accident occurred in New Jersey was a fortuitous circumstance. (\u201cEverything that occurred here occurred in New York but the happening of the accident itself.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The jury returned the following verdict for Paul Dolan: $8 million for pain and suffering, $150,000 for past medical expenses, $138,000 for past lost wages, and $914,000 for future lost wages. The jury awarded Kathleen Dolan $2 million for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge reasoned that the verdict was not a miscarriage of justice. \u201cThe injuries which this gentleman suffered were unimaginable____ [T]he medical testimony was overwhelming that this gentleman, but for the grace of God, probably should be dead and not alive. There wasn\u2019t any doubt in my mind, and obviously there was no doubt in the jury\u2019s mind that this gentleman is totally disabled, and that he is going to suffer because of these enormous injuries for the rest of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The case presents two issues. The first is the applicability, under choice-of-law principles, of New York law, which imposes vicarious liability on the owner of a motor vehicle for the negligence of a permissive user of the vehicle. <em>See N.Y. Vehicle and Traffic Law </em>\u00a7 388(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no issue in this case that in New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>York, an entity such as H-L that requires a driver to use its chassis and other motor vehicle equipment is subject to \u00a7 388. At oral argument, defendant\u2019s counsel agreed that if this accident had occurred in New York (i.e., if it were an undisputed \u201cNew York accident\u201d), H-L would be vicariously liable for the negligence of the driver. New Jersey law, on the other hand, does not impose liability on the owner of a motor vehicle for the negligence of a permissive user who is not the owner\u2019s agent. <em>See Fu v. Fu, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>108, 118, 733 A.2d 1133 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The second issue is whether the trial judge should have granted H-L a new trial based on an improper comment by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel about H-L\u2019s \u201cnegligence,\u201d and certain inappropriate references to specific amounts of money to be used in calculating damages for pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">A. The Choice~of-Law Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the choice-of-law issue is de novo. <em>Mastondrea v. Occidental Hotels Management, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 283, 918 A.2d 27 (App.Div.2007). We thus turn to the applicable law on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">As our Supreme Court most recently confirmed in <em>Rowe v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>615, 917 A.2d 767 (2007), in deciding choice-of-law issues in tort cases, our courts apply a governmental interest test, rather than simply considering the location of the injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>When law suits are filed in New Jersey, we apply our choice-of-law rules. In tort suits, such as this one, we no longer mechanistically apply the law of the place of wrong. Instead, we currently subscribe to the more flexible governmental-interests analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">In applying the governmental-interests analysis, two steps are involved. \u201cThe first step in the analysis is to determine whether a conflict exists between the laws of the interested states. Any such conflict is to be determined on an issue-by-issue basis.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">If there is an actual conflict, the second step \u201cseeks to determine the interest that each state has in resolving the specific issue in dispute.\u201d The Court must \u201cidentify the governmental policies underlying the law of each state\u201d and determine whether \u201cthose policies are affected by each state\u2019s contacts to the litigation and to the parties.\u201d We must apply the law of \u201cthe state with the greatest interest in governing the particular issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 621-22, 917 A.2d 767 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Looking to this well-established precedent, we readily conclude that there is a conflict between New York law and New Jersey law, on the issue of a vehicle owner\u2019s vicarious liability for the negligence of a permissive user. Thus, we consider the purposes behind the laws of the two states.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In <em>Fu v. Fu, supra, </em>a case involving New Jersey residents who were injured when their rented car went off the road in New York, our Court considered the purposes of the two States\u2019 laws. Although the accident involved a car rented in New Jersey by New Jersey residents, the court concluded that New York\u2019s policy interest predominated. After reviewing the history of \u00a7 388, the Court concluded that its purpose was not only to ensure sufficient insurance coverage for injured accident victims, but also to influence the behavior of vehicle owners based in New York or whose cars are brought into New York:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">New York has a well-articulated, twofold policy underlying Section 388. First, the statute was designed to \u201censure access by injured persons to a financially responsible insured person against whom to recover for injuiies.\u201d Section 388 achieves that compensatory purpose by \u201cremov[ing] the hai\u2019dship which the common-law rule visited upon innocent persons by pi\u2019eventing an owner from escaping liability\u201d because of the lack of an employment or agency relationship with the driver. Although New Yox-k\u2019s compensatory pui-pose is especially strong when the victim is a New Yorkei\u2019, the \u201cinnocent victim class has not been limited to New Yorkers.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">In enacting Section 388 New York also intended to regulate the conduct of automobile owners by \u201cdiscoux-ag[ing] ownei's from lending their vehicles to incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>petent or irresponsible drivers____ Section 388 was intended to operate \u201cas an incentive to lessors of motor vehicles to lease only to competent individuals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac6\"><em>[Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 119-120, 733 A.2d 1133 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The Court emphasized the New York Legislature\u2019s interest in promoting safety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">We also reject the lower courts\u2019 characterization of Section 388 as a \u201closs-allocating\u201d rule with no deterrent purpose. Although vicarious liability rules, broadly defined, serve a loss-allocating function, there is no question that from its inception Section 388 also was intended to regulate irresponsible car lending practices, and it is that underlying governmental purpose that guides our inquiry. That the rule regulates highway safety indirectly, by providing an incentive for responsible business practices, rather than directly by stating a \u201crule of the road\u201d is irrelevant to the strength of New York\u2019s policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">[<em>Id. </em>at 138, 733 A.2d 1133.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">On the other hand, New Jersey\u2019s common law policy was designed to protect vehicle owners from liability without fault. Quoting <em>Haggerty v. Cedeno, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>607, 653 A.2d 1166 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>98, 660 A.2d 1197 (1995), the <em>Fu </em>Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">The policy supporting New Jersey\u2019s common-law vicarious liability law was described in <em>Haggerty, supra, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 611-12, 653 A.2d 1166:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">New Jersey\u2019s common law rule regarding owner liability is not designed to protect the injured party ... or to protect the driver. It is designed to shield an owner from liability in cases in which the owner has not been negligent and in which the culpable driver is not related to the owner in a way that will justify the imposition of vicarious liability under traditional principles of the law of agency or master servant. That shield is consistent with the principle that tort liability in the context of automobile-related personal injuries is based on fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">New Jersey's rule selves neither a deterrent nor a compensatory purpose. Rather, it simply adheres to the well-established, common-law principle that liability for automobile negligence should be allocated solely on the basis of fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3-\"><em>[Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 120-21, 733 A.2d 1133.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">The Court noted, however, that the purpose of New Jersey\u2019s law had been ameliorated somewhat by the passage of the \u201cNo-Fault\u201d insurance law, adopted to provide medical benefits to injured accident victims regardless of fault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-15\">... <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1, the mandatory insurance law, requires this State\u2019s individual automobile owners to carry insurance coverage consistent with requirements imposed by the Commissioner of Insurance that includes the obligation to provide coverage for liability arising out of the permissive use of their vehicles. That requirement obviously reflects a legislative purpose to ameliorate the effect of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Jersey\u2019s common-law rule against vicarious liability by requiring car owners to pay the cost of liability coverage for permissive users to assure that compensation is available for their injured victims. Insofar as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1 aims to effectuate the overriding legislative policy of assuring financial protection for the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents, in part by requiring coverage for injuries arising out of permissive automobile use, <em>that policy would appear to be congruent with New York\u2019s direct imposition of vicarious liability on automobile owners arising out of the negligent pemmissive use of their vehicles.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 121-22, 733 A.2d 1133 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">After determining each state\u2019s policy interest, the <em>Fu </em>Court next considered whether those policy concerns would be furthered by applying that state\u2019s law in the multi-state context. <em>Id. </em>at 122, 733 A.2d 1133. In a tort case, the relevant factors to be considered are \u201c(1) the interests of interstate comity; (2) the interests of the parties; (3) the interests underlying the field of tort law; (4) the interests of judicial administration; and (5) the competing interests of the states.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">With respect to comity, we must consider whether applying New Jersey law would frustrate the policies of New York and <em>vice versa. Ibid. </em>\u201cIf a strong state policy or interest will be neither fostered by applying that state\u2019s law, nor frustrated by the failure to apply it, it is highly unlikely that that state has any interest whatsoever in blanketing that particular issue with its law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>These principles must be applied on a case-by-case basis. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">In considering the states\u2019 competing interests, the court must also consider how the policy of each state\u2019s laws relate to the parties\u2019 contacts with that state. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133. Thus, we consider the quality and quantity of the contacts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">Section 145(2) of the <em>Restatement [(Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>(1971) ] specifies the contacts that are most significant to that analysis: the place where the injury occurred; the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred; the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties; and the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered. Those contacts-are \u201cconsidered, however, only to the extent that they are relevant to the purposes of the particular laws in conflict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">In personal injury cases, \u201cthe place where the injury occurred is a contact that, as to most issues, plays an important role in the selection of the state of the applicable law.\u201d When both conduct and injury occur in a single jurisdiction, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>only \u201crare exceptions, the local law of the state where conduct and injury occurred will be applied\u201d to determine an actor\u2019s liability. That is so because \u201ca state has an obvious interest in regulating the conduct of persons within its territory and in providing redress for injuries that occurred there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 125-26, 733 A.2d 1133 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>Fu, </em>the Court concluded that New York had the dominant interest in the application of its law to the liability issue, because the act of negligence and the injury occurred in New York, the rental car company could have foreseen and insured against the car being driven in New York, and applying New York\u2019s law would \u201cfurther the goals of deterrence and compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136-37, 733 <em>A.2d </em>1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We next consider <em>Haggerty v. Cedeno, supra, </em>a case cited with approval in <em>Fu. </em>In <em>Haggerty, </em>we applied New York law to an accident that occurred in New Jersey, when a New Jersey resident was struck by a car that had been leased in New Jersey but was registered in New York and owned by a New York corporation. Noting the purpose of \u00a7 388 to promote safety as well as to ensure recovery for accident victims, we reviewed the history of the law\u2019s extraterritorial application. We concluded that the car owner could have anticipated, and insured against, the application of New York law and that it was merely fortuitous that the accident had occurred in New Jersey; moreover, this State had no strong interest in applying its law to the detriment of its resident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEm\">New Jersey\u2019s interest in adhering to fault-based owner\u2019s liability is substantially diluted where, as in the present, case, the owner is not a New Jersey resident, has its principal place of business in New York, the vehicle is registered in New York, and New York has determined that its vehicle owners shall be liable for the negligence of persons operating their automobiles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">Expressed in terms of the governmental interest analysis ... New Jersey\u2019s contact with the vehicle and its owners was fortuitous and, therefore, New Jersey has, at best, a weak interest in providing the protection of its rule to Dollar [the defendant car rental company]. On the other hand, New York\u2019s contacts with the owner and the vehicle are substantial and directly related to the purpose of \u00a7 388, as recognized ... in New York\u2019s legislative history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">An owner registering a vehicle in New York is on notice regarding its liability exposure for the torts of persons who are permitted to operate the vehicle and is required to insure the vehicle consonant with that exposure. Thus, New York, as the vehicle\u2019s home state, occupies a unique and critical position for the regulation of the owner\u2019s legal obligations arising out of the ownership and use of the vehicle.... New Jersey\u2019s contact with the vehicle and its ownership was fleeting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tenuous compared with New York\u2019s contacts. New Jersey, therefore, has little interest in protecting Dollar when New York withholds that protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">[Id. at 612, 653 A.2d 1166 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In <em>Erny v. Estate of Merola, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>86, 792 A.2d 1208 (2002), the Court likewise applied New York law to determine the issue of joint and several liability where the accident occurred in New Jersey, but the two defendant drivers were New York residents driving vehicles insured in New York. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 792 A.2d 1208. The defendant with the higher insurance limit was found forty percent liable and under New Jersey law would pay only forty percent of the badly-injured plaintiffs damages. Applying New Jersey law would have prevented the plaintiff from recovering fully for her injuries, while applying New York law would have required the defendant with the higher policy limit to pay the entire verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93, 792 A.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The Court recognized New York\u2019s legislative policies to ensure full recovery for injured accident victims and to encourage safe driving, as opposed to New Jersey\u2019s policy of limiting the liability of defendants in order to keep insurance premiums down. <em>Id. </em>at 106-07, 792 A.2d 1208. Since both drivers were from New York and were driving cars insured in New York, the Court concluded that New York had the stronger policy interest in applying its law, and that New Jersey had little or no interest in applying its law. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 792 A.2d 1208. Consequently, although the locations of the injury and the negligent conduct are frequently the controlling factors for choice-of-law purposes, the <em>Erny </em>Court concluded they were not controlling under the factual circumstances of that case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Because the policy underlying New Jersey\u2019s law is not thwarted by application of New York joint and several liability laws to this case, and because the compensation and deterrence policies underlying New York\u2019s law are advanced, the Restatement\u2019s presumption in favor of the law of the situs of the conduct and injury is overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 108, 792 A.2d 1208 (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7\u00a7 145 and 146 (1971)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Applying the well-established law we have described, we agree with the trial judge\u2019s decision to apply New York law to this accident. In this case, the primary act of negligence occurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>New York, when Gonzalez knowingly failed to ensure that the container was properly attached to the chassis and intentionally evaded the optional roadability inspection at the Staten Island terminal. Once he left the terminal with the improperly-secured container, his tractor-trailer was an accident waiting to happen. Further, he was engaged in a New York transaction, in which ILL\u2019S container was unloaded in New York, and was placed on H-L\u2019s chassis in New York, to be transported to another location in New York. Thus, \u201cthere is a reasonable relationship between [H-L]\u201d and the state whose vicarious liability law is to be applied. <em>Fu v. Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 127, 733 A.2d 1133 (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 174 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">All of the activity within New York strongly implicated New York\u2019s legislative policy to encourage vehicle owners to do more to ensure safety on the road. In that connection, we note that \u00a7 388 specifically applies vicarious liability to the owner of a container, chassis or other equipment that is part of a tractor-trailer. Thus, we may fairly infer a legislative intent to encourage such owners to guard against the very type of accident that occurred here. For example, while we imply no negligence on H-L\u2019s part, H-L had a well-organized ongoing contractual relationship with Sea Transfer and might have required that its vehicles be subjected to mandatory roadability inspections before leaving the terminal. Moreover, because H-L\u2019s containers were offloaded in New York and placed on H-L\u2019s chassis, and thus would necessarily be driven in New York, H-L was on notice that it was subject to New York\u2019s vicarious liability law, \u00a7 388, and hence it could insure against that potential liability. <em>See Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 135-36, 733 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We also conclude that the accident\u2019s occurrence in New Jersey was fortuitous. While Gonzalez, a New York resident and employee, detoured through New Jersey to avoid New York City traffic, he was headed for the Bronx. The accident could as easily have occurred in New York as in New Jersey. Although Dolan was a New Jersey resident, he had been employed at CCNY in New York for many years. He was on his way home from New York at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the time of the accident, taking the reverse route that Gonzalez was following. Not only could the accident have happened in New York, but it could well have happened in New York between these same two parties. As a New York employee, Dolan was well within the universe of persons whose safety the New York law was aimed at protecting. Further, the accident had some impact in New York, as, according to his testimony, Dolan received some sick-leave pay from CCNY, and his devastating injuries deprived CCNY of a long-term employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">While we cannot make a choice-of-law determination simply to ensure a recovery for the plaintiff, <em>Haggerty, supra, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 612, 653 A.2d 1166, in this case applying New York law serves that State\u2019s legislative purpose to ensure a sufficient recovery of damages for a badly injured accident victim. New Jersey\u2019s interest in applying its policy of equating liability with fault, does not outweigh New York\u2019s policy to encourage traffic safety and ensure an adequate recovery for accident victims. <em>See Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 136-137, 733 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Nor does the fact that H-L has its principal offices in New Jersey change the result. H-L has not \u201cjustifiably relied on the shelter afforded by New Jersey law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 123, 733 A.2d 1133, with respect to this accident. We find much more significance in H-L\u2019s ongoing business which was being carried out on a daily basis in New York, albeit with equipment registered in Maine and insured elsewhere. Gonzalez\u2019s negligence in failing to properly attach the container, which negligence occurred in New York, arose in the context of H-L\u2019s business relationships with Sea Transfer and the Howland Hook terminal in New York. That is where the H-L containers and the motor vehicle equipment were located, and that is where H-L could be influenced to cooperate with New York\u2019s strong policy to ensure safety on its roads.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly applied New York law to determine H-L\u2019s liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the accident. To the extent it might be relevant, we would reach the same conclusion with respect to New York\u2019s law on joint and several liability. Imposing liability on H-L will have no effect on New Jersey insurance rates, and it will further the policy of New York\u2019s tort laws to protect innocent accident victims and encourage traffic safety. <em>See Erny, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 104-07, 792 A.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">B. Claimed Trial Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying H-L\u2019s motion for a new trial. Such a motion is not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>granted unless the trial judge determines, after giving due regard to the jury\u2019s opportunity to judge witness credibility, that the verdict represents a miscarriage of justice. <em>R. </em>4:49-1(a). <em>See Caldwell v. Haynes, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>422, 431, 643 A.2d 564 (1994). We apply a deferential standard on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">A trial court\u2019s ruling denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial will not be disturbed unless it clearly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law. Where the issue does not involve the trial court\u2019s fact-finding role, but rather its exercise of discretion, the appellate court will not interfere unless the trial judge has \"pursue[d] a manifestly unjust course.\u201d So, too, a decision to grant or deny a motion for a mistrial will not be reversed unless there is a showing of a mistaken exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac1\"><em>[Diakamopoulos v. Monmouth Med. Ctr., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>20, 36-37, 711 A.2d 321 (App.Div.1998) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s decision to deny H-L\u2019s motion for a new trial. During his opening statement, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made a brief reference to the value of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries: \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, you will need to determine, what is that pain worth? Would you take $20 an hour for that pain? Is that worth $500 a day for the rest of one\u2019s life?\u201d At this point defense counsel objected that \u201c[ijt\u2019s getting argumentative\u201d and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel withdrew his remark. In his opening remarks, defense counsel told the jury that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had \u201csuggested some numbers. That was improper, and he withdrew his suggestion of numbers. You can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s your decision as to what the numbers are.\u201d He later stated that \u201cwe can\u2019t tell you a number. We can\u2019t suggest a number to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">After the openings, defense counsel did not request a mistrial based on plaintiff counsel\u2019s remark. Instead he noted to the trial judge that what he wanted \u201cmostly is an instruction that [counsel] won\u2019t do that again.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel apologized and promised not to repeat the error. With the agreement of both counsel, the trial judge reminded the jury that they should ignore any arguments made in either counsel\u2019s opening statements, because those statements were only intended to \u201cgive you an overview of what the case is all about.\u201d The judge had previously instructed the jurors that the attorneys\u2019 opening statements were not evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Further, because of plaintiff counsel\u2019s inappropriate remarks in his opening statement, the judge precluded him from referring to the time-unit rule in his closing argument. <em>See R. </em>1:7-1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Throughout the trial, the judge maintained strict control over the proceedings to avoid error. For example, after the jury heard emotional testimony from a witness to the accident, who was clearly shaken by what he had seen, the judge strongly admonished the jury not to decide the case based on sympathy or emotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In the beginning of his summation, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that H-L \u201cis being asked to pay damages for issues involving their negligence.\u201d The trial judge sustained defense counsel\u2019s immediate objection and directed the jury to \u201cdisregard the last comment by the plaintiffs[\u2019] attorney.\u201d When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded that \u201c[tjhey have been found liable by the court, as a matter of law,\u201d the judge sustained another defense objection and directed that \u201c[t]he jury will disregard that comment as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Later in the summation, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that \u201cif you take the 1.4 million that Marcus [plaintiffs economic loss expert] put down, then I suggest to you that the amount of pain and damages is \u2014 is significantly more. That is just one piece of it.\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected and suggested that he was \u201ctempted to ask for a mistrial.\u201d However, he did not ask for a mistrial or request a curative instruction. The judge \u201creserved,\u201d noting that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel may not have realized what he was saying. In charging the jury, the trial judge reminded them that \u201c[t]he law does not provide you with any table, with any schedule, with any formula by which a person\u2019s pain and suffering ... may be measured in terms of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">We have read the entire record, which fairly depicts plaintiffs extensive injuries, his terrible physical suffering, which was continuing as of the trial in 2006 and was projected to continue indefinitely, his permanent physical impairment, his past and future surgeries, and his psychiatric damage. Dolan and his wife painted a compelling picture of the accident\u2019s disastrous conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>quenees to their everyday lives. Yet, none of the testimony was over-dramatized or sensationalized, and the defense did not even cross-examine the witnesses on these issues. The jury evidently found plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses credible. Moreover, the fact that the jury awarded Dolan less in economic damages than plaintiffs\u2019 expert recommended, suggests to us that the jury viewed the evidence objectively and was not unduly influenced by counsel\u2019s improper comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The verdict is not excessive or shocking to the conscience. <em>See Baxter v. Fairmont Food, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 603-04, 379 A.2d 225 (1977). We cannot conclude that the verdict resulted from plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s fleeting albeit highly improper attempts to quantify Dolan\u2019s pain and suffering damages, or his equally brief reference to H-L\u2019s negligence. This case in no way resembles <em>Geler v. Akawie, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 465-72, 818 A.2d 402 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>223, 827 A.2d 290 (2003), where significant improprieties by plaintiffs counsel warranted a new trial, or <em>Henker v. Preybylowski, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 520, 524 A.2d 455 (App.Div.1987), where the jury returned ah excessive verdict, probably attributable to counsel\u2019s improper comments as to which the court issued no limiting instructions. Defense counsel here did not request a mistrial and was satisfied with the judge\u2019s curative instructions. <em>See R. </em>1:7-2. Defendant cannot now seek to upset an otherwise fair verdict absent plain error, which is not present in this record. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Pursuant to a Uniform Intermodal Interchange and Facilities Access Agreement, Sea Transfer agreed to provide insurance coverage and to indemnify H-L against claims for bodily injury arising out of its use of H-L\u2019s equipment. Sea Transfer had $1 million in coverage. There are no documents in the record concerning H-L\u2019s insurance coverage, but counsel indicated on the record in the trial court that H-L had $25 million in coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> In the record presented to us, Gonzalez did not specifically testify that he took the George Washington Bridge, although counsel represented that he did. However, we take judicial notice that there is no other Hudson River crossing he would have taken to reach the Bronx from Route 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> The record includes photographs of the accident scene. It is clear from the photos that even if the track driver\u2019s action in occupying both lanes was negligent with respect to other eastbound drivers, it had nothing to do with this accident. There is no evidence that he changed lanes precipitously or that trucks were not allowed in the left lane. Dolan\u2019s car was on the other side of the divided highway. The record supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the accident was caused by Gonzalez\u2019s failure to secure the H-L container to the HL chassis before he left New York, which in turn allowed the container to fall off the truck into Dolan\u2019s lane of travel. H-L has not appealed from the November 10, 2005 order granting summary judgment on the issue of the truck driver\u2019s negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\"><em> </em>Dolan worked at CCNY from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The accident occurred at or slighlly before 4:00 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\"> This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">Every owner of a vehicle used or operated in this state shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries to person or properly resulting from negligence in the use or operation of such vehicle, in the business of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>owner or otherwise, by any person using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of such owner. <em>Whenever any vehicles as hereinafter defined shall he used in combination with one another, by attachment or tow, the person using or operating any one vehicle shall, for the purposes of thus section, be deemed to be using or operating each vehicle in the combination, and the owners thereof shall be jointly and severally liable hereunder.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> These facts distinguish this case from <em>Kim v.

In <em>Kim, </em>the defendant driver's negligence occurred entirely within New Jersey, and we were not able to identify any way in which applying New York law would further that State\u2019s legislative policies. <em>Id. </em>at 150-51, 896 A.2d 489. Likewise, unlike <em>Arias v. Figueroa, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>623, 631, 930 A.2d 472 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. denied, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>223, 936 A.2d 969 (2007), the accident here arose, to a substantial extent, from negligence in \"the use and operation\u201d of the tractor trailer in New York, <em>see </em>\u00a7 388, although the crash itself happened in New Jersey. While we disagree with <em>Arias </em>that New York\u2019s law was not intended to have extraterritorial application, <em>see Haggerty, supra, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 610, 653 A.2d 1166, we need not pursue that issue in detail here due to the significant differences in the facts between this case and <em>Arias.

Chappell, </em>407 F.3d 166, 170-71 (3rd Cir.2005)(\"It is beyond dispute that \u00a7 388(1) has extraterritorial scope, that is, it can apply to accidents occurring beyond New York\u2019s borders.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 <em>U.S. </em>978, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>567, 163 L.Ed.2d 463 (2005); <em>King v.
