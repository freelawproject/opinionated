L. REISNER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Defendant Seaview Lincoln Mercury appeals from a March 27, 2007 order of the trial court awarding plaintiff Thomas Maliek $224,552 in prejudgment interest under the offer of judgment rule, <em>R. </em>4:58-2. We reverse and remand for a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The central issue in this personal injury case is whether the parties\u2019 high-low agreement, reached in the middle of the trial, precluded an award of interest under the offer of judgment rule, <em>R. </em>4:58-2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff filed a complaint on May 10, 2004, alleging that he was injured on defendant\u2019s premises. Plaintiff served defendant with a timely offer of judgment for $650,000 on August 4,2006, but defendant did not accept the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">In the middle of the trial, plaintiffs attorney R.C. Westmoreland negotiated a high-low agreement with William Davis, a senior litigation manager for defendant\u2019s insurer Zurich Insurance Company (Zurich), located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The only evidence of the negotiations in this record consists of two e-mails and one letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">On January 18, 2007, Westmoreland sent Davis an e-mail confirming \u201cwhat I believe we agreed to for the Hi Lo. The high is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>$1,000,000 and the low is $175,000.\u201d Westmoreland then offered the following caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">These numbers apply to the verdict and prejudgment interest ONLY. They do not apply to legal fees and litigation costs that may be awarded in the event that Plaintiffs Offer of Judgment is successful and the court awards such fees and costs. For instance, if Plaintiff gets a $1,400,000 verdict and the court then awards Plaintiffs counsel fees and costs under <em>R. </em>4:58 of $150,000. You pay only $1,000,000 of the verdict but the entire $150,000 of the fees/costs awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In reply, Davis sent Westmoreland an e-mail accepting \u201cthe terms of this high/low agreement.\u201d Davis further indicated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_u\">I do not think the legal fees issue is going to be an issue because we do not think the offer of judgment will be met by the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzZ\">Rather than walk away from the agreement, I will add this marginal risk factor to the deal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Finally, on January 19, 2007, Westmoreland faxed Davis a confirming letter reciting that \u201c[m]y January 18 e-mail at 12:17 p.m. set forth our agreed high low and preserving [sic] our offer of judgment remedies.\u201d The letter recounted that Davis had first rejected the offer by e-mail and later accepted it by e-mail. The letter then recited verbatim Westmoreland\u2019s January 18 e-mail (quoted above) \u201csetting forth the deal.\u201d In other words, the letter confirmed that the agreement was as Westmoreland had stated it in his January 18 e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">When the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in excess of $5 million, plaintiff was entitled to $1 million under the high-low agreement. Additionally, invoking the offer of judgment, plaintiff filed a motion for \u201cinterest, costs and attorneys fees pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:58-2.\u201d The motion was accompanied by a brief supporting the claim for interest under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2, and an affidavit supporting the claim for counsel fees. Defendant filed a brief opposing the award of interest on the grounds that the high-low agreement waived plaintiffs right to prejudgment interest. Plaintiff filed a reply brief, contending that the interest allowed by <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 was a sanction, was fundamentally distinct from ordinary prejudgment interest, and was not waived in the high-low agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Other than the e-mails and the letter, neither party submitted any legally competent evidence concerning their negotiation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>high-low agreement or their respective understanding of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The trial judge issued a written opinion on March 14, 2007. Relying on <em>Wiese v. Dedhia, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>587, 911 A.2d 479 (2006), which clarified that the award of fees and costs under the offer of judgment rule is mandatory, the trial judge reasoned that the prejudgment interest excluded by the high-low agreement was distinct from the \u201csanction interest\u201d mandated by <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. The judge interpreted \u201cthe high/low agreement\u2019s mention of pre-judgment interest as a reference to traditional pre-judgment interest under <em>R. </em>4:42-11 only and not to \u2018sanction interest\u2019 under <em>R. </em>4:58-2.\u201d In his opinion, the judge recited that \u201cPlaintiff attested the parties verbally agreed that they would reserve the right to contest any awards issued under <em>R. </em>4:58.\u201d However, no one \u201cattested\u201d to that agreement or to any other relevant facts, because neither party submitted any certifications or affidavits as to their negotiations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">On this appeal we review <em>de novo </em>the trial judge\u2019s factual and legal conclusions reached after a summary proceeding, including his construction of <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. <em>See Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. 162, </em>167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>608, 713 A.2d 499 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">We begin by observing that the high-low agreement was a contract and was thus subject to traditional rules of contract interpretation. <em>See Elliott-Marine v. Campenella, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super </em>135, 141-42, 797 A.2d 201 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>365, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>807 A.2d 196 (2002); <em>Shafer v. Cronk, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 521-22, 532 A.2d 1131 (Law Div.1987). If the terms of a contract are clear, they are to be enforced as written. <em>County of Morris v. Fauver, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>80, 103, 707 A.2d 958 (1998). On the other hand, ambiguous terms are generally construed against the drafter of the contract. <em>See Driscoll Constr. Co., Inc. v. State, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 318, 853 A.2d 270 (App.Div.2004). However, the parties may introduce parol evidence concerning their negotiations and their respective understandings of the agreement, in order to assist the court in construing an ambiguous term. <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 853 A.2d 270. If the evidence creates a material dispute of fact, the court should resolve the dispute by holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 314, 853 A.2d 270; <em>Deerhurst Estates v. Meadow Homes, Inc., </em>64 <em>N.J.Super. </em>134, 152-53, 165 A.2d 543 (App.Div.1960), <em>certif. denied, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>66, 167 A.2d 55 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We have no hesitation in concluding that the high-low agreement was ambiguous. Ordinarily, where the parties make a high-low agreement, a plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest if the jury\u2019s verdict is somewhere in between the high and low limits, but not if the verdict is higher than the amount set as the \u201cceiling;\u201d a plaintiff cannot recover more than the amount agreed to as the \u201chigh\u201d limit. <em>Benz v. Pires, supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 580, 636 A.2d 101. However, \u201c[tjhere is nothing to prevent the parties from making a different high-low agreement. They can agree, for instance, that prejudgment interest should be applied to the stipulated limits.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, absent an agreement otherwise, plaintiff would not be entitled to prejudgment interest on the $1 million recovery, because that was the ceiling set by the high-low agreement. Defendant claims that the parties made no such agreement and that plaintiff explicitly waived prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On the other hand, plaintiff contends that although Westmoreland\u2019s letter waived prejudgment interest on an award under the high-low agreement, he implicitly reserved plaintiffs right to interest under the offer of judgment rule. However, Westmore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>land\u2019s correspondence did not specifically say that. It referred only to his client\u2019s reservation of the right to claim attorneys fees and \u201ccosts\u201d under <em>Buie </em>4:58-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Plaintiff further argues that \u201cinterest\u201d is subsumed in the term \u201ccosts\u201d and that the interest allowed by <em>Rule </em>4:58 is distinct from \u201cprejudgment interest\u201d as attorneys understand the term, because interest under <em>Rule 4:58 </em>is a sanction rather than a make-whole remedy. This argument necessarily assumes that Davis, Zurich\u2019s litigation manager in Pittsburgh, was an attorney or that he otherwise had sufficient familiarity with New Jersey law that he would understand the distinction between <em>Rule </em>4:42-11 and <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. <em>See Deerhurst, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 153, 165 A.2d 543. There is no record evidence on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Plaintiffs brief acknowledges that prior to a 2004 amendment, <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 referred to an award of \u201ceight percent interest on the amount\u201d to which plaintiff was entitled. In 2004, the rule was amended to refer to <em>\u201cprejudgment interest </em>of eight percent on the amount\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See </em>Pressler Comment 1 to <em>Rule 4:58 </em>at 1675-76 (2008). The <em>Rule </em>now reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">If the offer of a claimant is not accepted and the claimant obtains a money judgment, in an amount that is 120% of the offer or more, <em>excluding allowable prejudgment interest </em>and counsel fees, the claimant shall be allowed, in addition to costs of suit: (1) all reasonable litigation expenses incurred following non-acceptance; (2) <em>prejudgment interest of eight percent on the amount of any money recovery from the date of the offer </em>or the date of completion of discovery, whichever is later, <em>but only to the extent that suck prejudgment interest exceeds the interest prescribed by R. 4,:42-11(b), which also shall be allowable; </em>and (3) a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\"><em>[R. </em>4:58\u20142(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The <em>Rule </em>by its terms clearly conveys that there are two different forms of prejudgment interest \u2014 the 8% allowed by <em>Rule </em>4:58 and the ordinary interest allowed by <em>Rule </em>4:42-11 \u2014 and it provides that a plaintiff is not entitled to a double recovery of interest. We have no doubt that the two forms of interest serve different purposes, because the rate of interest allowed under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 is higher than the rate historically provided under <em>Rule </em>4:42-11, and it runs from the date of the offer of judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>rather than from the filing of the complaint. We also recognize that <em>Wiese v. Dedhia, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 592-93, 911 A.2d 479, held that an award of \u201cattorneys fees and cost of suit\u201d is mandatory under the offer of judgment rule, although <em>Wiese </em>did not hold that a party cannot waive that right by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">However, while the foregoing analysis persuades us that plaintiffs construction of the high-low agreement is plausible, it does not obviate the ambiguity in the agreement. Because, at the time the high-low agreement was negotiated, the term \u201cprejudgment interest\u201d appeared in both <em>Rule </em>4:42-11 and <em>Rule </em>4:58-2, an offer to waive \u201cprejudgment interest\u201d on a verdict, but to retain the right to counsel fees and \u201ccosts\u201d under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2, could have been understood as a waiver of prejudgment interest under either rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The issue is not how we parse the question plaintiff poses concerning the relative purposes of the two rules, nor whether our courts sometimes refer to the sanctions allowed by <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 as \u201ccosts,\u201d nor, as plaintiff urges, whether reasonable attorneys might sometimes use the term \u201ccosts\u201d to refer to all of the non-counsel fee sanctions allowed by <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. <em>See Gonzalez v. Safe &amp; Sound Security, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>100, 123-24, 881 A.2d 719 (2005). The question is how a reasonable person in Davis\u2019 position might have understood the offer and, if there were evidence on the issue, how Davis in fact understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The evidence before the trial court established that the agreement was ambiguous. Plaintiff' did not produce any legally competent evidence to assist the court in resolving the ambiguity, and neither did defendant. At most, the language in Westmoreland\u2019s January 19 letter, that plaintiff was \u201cpreserving our remedies\u201d under the offer of judgment rule, and Davis\u2019 statement in his email, that defendant would risk having to pay \u201cattorneys fees\u201d with no mention of \u201ccosts,\u201d raises a fact question as to what the two negotiators understood Westmoreland\u2019s offer to mean. While we appreciate that the trial judge had just concluded a trial on the personal injury issue and may have been understandably reluctant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to conduct another trial on the construction of the high-low agreement, a plenary hearing should have been held on that issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Driscoll, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 314, 853 A.2d 270. We therefore remand this matter for a hearing at which the parties may present testimony from Westmoreland and Davis concerning their negotiation of, and their understanding of, the high-low agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Because we are remanding the matter, we also address the parties\u2019 dispute over the calculation of the interest. While the parties agreed at oral argument that their dispute over post-judgment interest was moot, defendant pressed its contention that, if interest was legally appropriate, it should have been based on the $1 million judgment and not on the jury verdict which was in excess of $5 million. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">As we recognized in <em>Benz v. Pires, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>574, 578-79, 636 A.2d 101 (App.Div.1994), a high-low agreement is a type of settlement. <em>See also Shafer v. Cronk, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 521-22, 532 A.2d 1131. By entering into the agreement, plaintiff agreed to accept no more than a $1 million judgment regardless of the jury\u2019s verdict. Pursuant to the current version of <em>Rule </em>4:58-2(a), the benefits of the <em>Rule </em>accrue to a plaintiff who \u201cobtains a <em>money judgment, </em>in an amount that is 120% of the offer or more\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, the parties reached a pre-verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>settlement in which they agreed to substitute their high number for the verdict if it was over $1 million. Hence, the verdict was molded to a $1 million judgment. That is the amount on which the <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 interest, if any is found to be owing, is to be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-13\"> \"A high-low agreement is a device used in negligence cases in which a defendant agrees to pay plaintiff a minimum recovery in return for plaintiff's agreement to accept a maximum sum regardless of the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Benz v.

It is clear from <em>Gonzalez, </em>however, that even under the prior version of the <em>Rule, </em>\"verdict\u201d meant the resulting judgment after the verdict was molded by the trial court. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>for example, the verdict was molded to reflect the jury's finding that defendant was 70% liable, and the trial court \"measured that amount against plaintiff\u2019s $800,000 [offer of judgment]\" for purposes of <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. <em>Ibid. </em>Based on that measure, the Court agreed that \"the <em>verdict </em>in favor of plaintiff far exceeded 120% of plaintiff\u2019s offer.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
