We conclude that here, where the cross-examination on the timing of the alibi notice served to demonstrate the unlikelihood that defendant\u2019s recollection of the facts supporting his alibi defense would change so significantly in a two-day period, the State\u2019s cross-examination did not constitute a prohibited evisceration of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">Defendant Douglas Noble appeals from his conviction on a charge of first-degree attempted murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>2C.11-3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge sentenced him to a sixteen-year term of imprisonment, of which eighty-five percent was ordered to be served without eligibility for parole in accordance with the provisions of the No Early Release Act (NERA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2. Appropriate fines and penalties were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On appeal, defendant presents the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">I. NOBLE\u2019S CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE PERVASIVE PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT RENDERED HIS TRIAL FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. (NOT RAISED BELOW)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">A.

NOBLE\u2019S SENTENCE MUST BE VACATED BECAUSE THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO ESTABLISH ITS BASIS IN APPLYING AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR AND DID NOT APPLY SEVERAL MITIGATING FACTORS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD. (RAISED BELOW)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">These were the facts presented at trial. The victim, Paul Smith, married defendant\u2019s sister, Yakisha Noble, in the spring of 2003. At the time of their marriage, Yakisha already had an eleven-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. In April 2003, shortly after the marriage, Yakisha\u2019s daughter accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Smith of sexually assaulting her. In response to her allegations, the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office began an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On April 30, 2003, Smith went to the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office because he was \u201cscared for his life\u201d as a result of threats that had been made by defendant, defendant\u2019s brother Dante Noble and an individual named Aaron. The prosecutor\u2019s office advised Smith that he should inform the Paterson police of his fears because the prosecutor\u2019s office was dealing only with the child abuse allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">One month later, on May 29, 2003, defendant\u2019s brother Dante forcibly took Smith to the Nobles\u2019 mother\u2019s house where Dante confronted Smith about the sexual abuse allegations that Yakisha\u2019s daughter had made. Smith testified that defendant was in the backyard of the house and he heard defendant say to Dante, \u201cYou should have come and got me, I would have killed him.\u201d After that incident, Smith went to the police and filed charges against Dante, who was arrested and charged with kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On Wednesday, June 4, 2003, six days after Dante was arrested for kidnapping Smith, Smith left his apartment in Paterson shortly after 8:00 p.m. It was dusk, but the area was illuminated by a street lamp. As Smith was walking, a red car pulled up along aside him. Smith heard someone shout out his name, \u201cPaul.\u201d When Smith turned around, he saw defendant get out of the passenger seat of the vehicle and walk toward him. Smith saw defendant carrying an object \u201clike a bat or a pipe.\u201d According to Smith, defendant said \u201cYou pressed charges on my brother. Either you drop them or you go to the morgue.\u201d Defendant then swung \u201cthe bat\u201d and smashed Smith on the left side of his head, causing him to lose consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">At approximately 8:51 p.m. that night, two Paterson police officers were dispatched to a call regarding an injured man. Officer Steven Leishman testified that when he arrived at the scene of the incident, he saw a man who was badly beaten and bleeding profusely from his head. The man was subsequently identified as Paul Smith. Covered in blood, Smith kept repeating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201cI can\u2019t see.\u201d Leishman testified that Smith was not in any condition to give a detailed statement. Leishman did, however, ask Smith who attacked him. Smith\u2019s reply sounded to Leishman like, \u201cDon Mobley.\u201d Leishman described Smith as \u201cvery incoherent\u201d and \u201cpretty much mumbling.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s office conducted an investigation and ascertained that there was no one named Don Mobley in the county or surrounding area. At trial, Smith testified that he told Leishman that his assailant was Doug Noble and that he never said Don Mobley.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Detective Steven Sela of the Paterson police department testified that he and another detective spoke with Smith at the hospital on June 9, 2003. Based upon Smith\u2019s statement that he was assaulted by his brother-in-law Douglas Noble, Sela prepared a complaint charging Noble with attempted murder. According to Sela\u2019s testimony, there was \u201cno hesitation, equivocation, uncertainty or doubt voiced by Smith\u201d when he told Sela that it was defendant who assaulted him. Sela canvassed the neighborhood where the attack took place, but was unable to find any witnesses. Defendant was not apprehended and arrested on the attempted murder complaint until July 29, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The State also presented the testimony of Dr. John A. Schultz, the surgeon who operated on Smith the night of the assault. Schultz testified that as a result of the attack, Smith suffered nine different fractures to his head, including fractures to the bones around both eyes, his nose, and his jawbone. The attack left Smith blind in both eyes, partially deaf, and without a sense of taste or smell.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Trial was scheduled to begin on May 17, 2005. At a pretrial conference on May 16, defendant stated for the first time that his wife Chenita Noble would be presented as an alibi witness. The judge directed defense counsel to prepare an alibi notice, have defendant sign it and provide it to the State. The alibi notice that was filed on May 17, the day the trial began, stated that defendant was talking with his sister on the telephone from his home in East Orange between 8:00 and 8:20 p.m. on the night in question. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>notice also specified that after the phone call ended, defendant drove his wife to her Bible study class in East Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Defendant testified at trial. On direct examination, he denied that he had beaten Smith and maintained that he was not in Paterson on the night in question. He also testified that on Wednesday nights, his wife attended Bible study classes and she liked to be punctual. According to defendant\u2019s initial version at trial, at approximately 8:00 p.m. on June 4, 2003, his sister Shirley Noble called and he and his wife both spoke with her. The telephone conversation lasted for twenty to forty-five minutes. After the phone call concluded, he drove Chenita from their home in East Orange to her Bible study session, which was also located in East Orange approximately ten to fifteen minutes away. They arrived at the study session at 8:38 p.m. According to defendant\u2019s testimony, he returned home after dropping her off and did not leave the house again until he went to pick her up shortly before 9:30. According to defendant, he did not stop anywhere either on the way to Bible study or on the way back.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The prosecutor began his cross-examination by asking defendant a series of questions about when defendant furnished his alibi notice to the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">Q. The second page indicates when it was dated, which would be the day it was prepared, the day it was signed and it was given to the State. What was the day that this alibi notice was given?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">A. It says May 17, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">Q. Okay. Now today is the 19th, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">Q. So the 17th would have been Tuesday, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-14\">Q. Does that sound right to you, that it was Tuesday morning that you had signed it and we had gotten it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-16\">Q. Okay. That was the day we actually started jury selection and gave our opening statements in this case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-18\">Q. The day before that, Monday, Monday afternoon is when we started doing the pretrials, discussing this case before we sent for a jury panel, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">Q. <em>And that was when you first gave information that you had alibi witnesses, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">A. <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">Q. <em>You had given that previous ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">A. <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">Q. <em>Not to Mr. Uhlik, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">A. <em>To Mr. Fusco.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">Q. <em>Okay. Not to Mr. Uhlik, is that correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\">A. <em>Not to Mr. Uhlik, you are right.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-13\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question, defendant agreed that his alibi notice stated he was at home until 8:20 p.m., at which time he left the house to drive his wife to her Bible study class. He also acknowledged that because his wife never wanted to be late for Bible study, which began at 7:30 p.m., they needed to leave the house no later than 7:15 p.m. For that reason, he stated that his alibi notice may have been incorrect, and that the phone call had probably started at 7:30 p.m. Next, the prosecutor questioned him concerning his insistence at an earlier point in cross-examination that the phone call started at 8:00 p.m. The cross-examination continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-15\">Q. So if you got off [the phone] about 8:20, if it was a minimum of twenty minutes, the phone rang at 8:00, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-16\">A. Minimum, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-17\">Q. And that couldn\u2019t be the case because your wife would have been at Bible study a half hour before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-19\">Q. If [the conversation lasted] the forty-five minutes on the outside, that phone call came in at about quarter of eight, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-20\">A. It could have. It could have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-21\">Q. But the problem with that, your wife would have already been at Bible study for fifteen minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-22\">A. That\u2019s true. So maybe it came before then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-23\">Q. Why would she say, Oh, in case the phone rings tonight, I\u2019ll just stay and miss Bible study because maybe the phone is going to ring? Is that what you\u2019re telling us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-24\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Q. So she wouldn\u2019t know the phone was going to ring that particular evening, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">A. Okay, you are probably right. You are probably right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">With that, the cross-examination of defendant concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Defendant\u2019s wife also testified as an alibi witness. Her testimony on cross-examination about when the call from Shirley started contradicted her testimony on direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Of even greater significance, she insisted during her testimony that the phone call occurred on June 4, 2003, but also acknowledged that two days earlier, when she was interviewed by Detective Woods and the prosecutor about her alibi testimony, she had told them that the phone call from Shirley took place at \u201cthe end of June, beginning of July.\u201d She explained that the reason she believed it was the end of June was because her children never left New Jersey to visit their father in Bermuda until the school year was over at the end of June. She added that the children usually went to Bible study with her, \u201c[b]ut this particular night, there\u2019s no question the children did not go with me.\u201d She agreed that the reason the children had not gone with her to Bible study that night was \u201cbecause they were already in Bermuda.\u201d The prosecutor then pressed her further about her conversation with him and Woods two days earlier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">Q. Okay. Now, that was just two days ago, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-12\">Q. Now Ms. Noble, two days ago, you told Detective Woods and I that you were sure it was either the end of June or more likely early July. Now you are telling the ladies and gentlemen June 4. Do I have that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-14\">Q. That\u2019s off by about a month, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-15\">A. A month, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-16\">Q. Ms. Noble, in the last forty-eight hours, what caused you to change from late June or early July to specifically June 4?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-17\">A. The date, it didn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-18\">I had the wrong date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-19\">Q. You had the wrong month, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-20\">A. The wrong \u2014 yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Shirley Noble also testified as a defense witness. She maintained that she telephoned her brother at his home in East Orange on June 4, 2003. On cross-examination, she acknowledged that when she had spoken to the assistant prosecutor and the detective two days earlier, she was unable to remember whether the phone conversation had occurred at the beginning, middle or end of June, yet \u201ctoday [she was] certain it was June 4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">During his summation, the prosecutor provided numerous reasons why the alibi testimony of both Shirley Noble and Chenita Noble should be disbelieved, commenting upon the testimony that we have described. He then turned to a discussion of defendant\u2019s testimony and stated, \u201cThen there is the defendant\u2019s testimony. He stated \u2014 we went through his alibi notice which was signed the day after we started the case.\u201d The prosecutor argued at considerable length why defendant\u2019s alibi testimony was not believable, but he never again referred to the late furnishing of the alibi notice, nor did he ever ask the jury to draw any inferences from that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">During the charge conference, the judge expressed his intention to charge the jury on alibi, but with one modification. He read the proposed charge to both parties, and both expressed approval. When the judge charged the jury, he gave the alibi charge that he had discussed during the charge conference. In relevant part, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">The defendant, Douglas Noble, and a defense witness, Chenita Noble, testified to the defendant\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the alleged crime, placing him at someplace other than the scene of the crime. <em>You may consider evidence concerning when the defendant, Douglas Noble, or the Defense witness, with information as to the defendant\u2019s whereabouts at some place other than the scene of the crime, came forward and why he or she did so at that particular time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">However, this is another place where evidence is allowed only for a limited purpose. When you are considering this evidence with regard to the timing of when a person came forward with this information, this evidence is allowed only for the limited purpose of affecting the credibility of that particular person\u2019s testimony. So, that\u2019s the limited purpose for which it is allowed and it must not be used for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>You may not use the evidence to conclude that the defendant, Douglas Noble, or the witness, violated some obligation to come forward, because neither the defendant nor the witness had any duty to speak on the subject with anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">If after a consideration of all the evidence, including the evidence of defendant\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the offense, you have a reasonable doubt as to whether he committed the crime, you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">If, however, after considering all of the evidence, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the crime and have concluded that the State has proved each element of the offense charged in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_E\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Defendant did not object to any portion of the alibi charge. The jury deliberated and reached the verdict we have described.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">In Point 1(A) of his brief, defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated references to the timing of his alibi notice \u201ceviscerated\u201d his right to remain silent and denied him a fair trial. Because defendant did not object to this testimony at trial, his claim on appeal must be evaluated under the plain error standard of review. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. We may reverse on the basis of unchallenged error only if we find the error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s explicit reference to the date on which he signed the alibi notice and its proximity to the beginning of the trial \u201cleave no doubt as to [the prosecutor\u2019s] motive: to penalize [defendant] for exercising his right to remain silent by improperly casting doubt upon the credibility of his alibi testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">In particular, defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s references to the timing of his alibi notice violate <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 358 A.2d 163 (1976). There, the Court held that it was error for a prosecutor to elicit testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to provide alibi information to the police \u201cat the first opportunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 358 A.2d 163. The Court held that because a defendant has a right to remain silent at the time of arrest, his silence and failure to supply an alibi at that time is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>protected. <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, the Court held, questions directed to the failure to furnish the alibi to police at the time of arrest impermissibly erode a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 117, 358 A.2d 163.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant also relies upon our decisions in <em>State v. Sutton, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 567 A.2d 272 (App.Div.1989) and <em>State v. Aceta, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 537 A.2d 1317 (App.Div. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The State, in turn, argues that \u201cwhen a defendant makes the voluntary decision to assert an alibi defense and files a notice of alibi, the information contained in that notice [is] subject to cross-examination.\u201d The State maintains that when a defendant chooses to testify regarding his alibi defense, the State is entitled to cross-examine him on the inconsistencies between his trial testimony and the contents of his alibi notice in order to demonstrate that his trial testimony is not worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Specifically, the State argues that because a mere two days elapsed between the time defendant furnished the alibi notice and the time he testified at trial, such a brief period of time becomes highly relevant to a jury\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of a defendant\u2019s alibi trial testimony. This is so, the State maintains, because of the unlikelihood that a defendant\u2019s recollection of his whereabouts at the time of the crime would change significantly in a two-day period. Relying on <em>State v. Irving, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>427, 440-41, 555 A.2d 575 (1989), the State argues that such an approach constitutes a \u201clitigational\u201d use of a late alibi notice and does not constitute an attack on a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent that the Court prohibited in <em>Deatore. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In <em>Irving, </em>the Court held that the State is permitted to cross-examine a defendant about the content of his alibi notice without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>violating a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 440-41, 555 A.2d 575. As the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdF\">ri]f an alibi should tend to incriminate an accused, it must be because of its inherent infirmity. The Constitution does not protect a defendant from the consequences of a defense he makes, nor assure him a right so to defend as to deny the State a chance to cheek the truth of his position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">[Id. at 434, 555 A.2d 575 (quoting <em>State v. Angeleri, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>382, 385, 241 A.2d 3 (1968)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In <em>State v. Sutton, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 225, 567 A.2d 272 (App.Div.1989), the State sought to rely on the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Irving. </em>Specifically, the State asserted that the judge\u2019s charge on the lateness of defendant\u2019s alibi notice did not constitute a \u201cdirect\u201d attack on defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, but was instead a \u201clitigational\u201d use of the notice of alibi \u201ccountenanced\u201d in <em>State v. Irving. Ibid. </em>We rejected the State\u2019s argument and agreed with the defendant that the jury charge in <em>Sutton </em>did not constitute the \u201clitigational\u201d use of the notice that the Court approved in <em>Irving </em>because the State never cross-examined the defendant about the \u201ccontents\u201d of his alibi notice, and instead only addressed its \u201clateness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 567 A.2d 272. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">This was a flat comment on the failure of defendant to name [his alibi witness] earlier and is entirely different from a case like <em>Irving </em>in which the information contained in the notice is the subject of the comment or examination. The reason there was no such comment here is that [the witness\u2019s] evidence was not different from that of [defendant] whereas in <em>Irving </em>the late alibi notice contained substantively distinct information. This kind of comment by the judge was specifically identified in <em>Aceta </em>as falling within the scope of its prohibition. There we noted that \u201cthe violation [of defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination] was compounded by the questioning of the trial judge ... as to defendant\u2019s failure to have disclosed his alibi defense during any of his pretrial court appearances.\u201d In short, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury was an improper comment on defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent under <em>Aceta, </em>as a result of which a reversal is warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Our careful review of the record demonstrates that defendant\u2019s right to remain silent was not violated here because the prosecutor did not use the timing of the alibi notice to suggest defendant had fabricated it. We agree with the State\u2019s contention that the prosecutor used the timing of the defendant\u2019s alibi notice to highlight the obvious fact that the factual assertions contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the notice were inconsistent with defendant\u2019s trial testimony that took place just two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The prosecutor did not suggest in his cross-examination that defendant had an obligation to come forward with exculpatory information, but instead, as the State argues, \u201cfocused on the importance of the timeline in the notice as it pertained to defendant\u2019s trial testimony.\u201d During cross-examination, the prosecutor\u2019s questions forced defendant to agree that critical information contained in his notice of alibi, namely what time it was when he was at home on the phone with his sister, was incorrect. Therefore, the prosecutor properly used the timing of defendant\u2019s alibi notice to lay the foundation for cross-examining defendant about the inconsistencies between his trial testimony \u2014 that the phone call started before 8:00 p.m. \u2014 and the alibi notice furnished two days earlier in which he claimed the phone call did not begin until 8:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Our conclusion that the cross-examination concerning the timing of defendant\u2019s notice of alibi was used \u201clitigationally,\u201d as permitted by <em>Irving, </em>and did not constitute an impermissible comment on defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent, is strengthened by a comparison of the facts here with those of <em>Aceta, </em>on which defendant relies. There, we concluded that the State\u2019s attack upon the defendant\u2019s failure to have previously disclosed his exculpatory alibi defense \u201cwas so flagrant a violation of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent\u201d that his conviction could not stand. <em>Aceta, supra, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 537 A.2d 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In <em>Aceta, </em>the defendant did not submit his alibi defense until three days before trial began, <em>id. </em>at 27, 537 A.2d 1317, which was seventeen months after his arrest for shooting two police officers. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the defendant whether \u201cfor a year and a half [he] just sat on this alibi.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 537 A.2d 1317. During his summation, the prosecutor commented that the defendant\u2019s defense was \u201cthe eleventh hour alibi defense.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>He went on to argue that the situation was similar to \u201ca baseball game, [where] it is now the bottom of the ninth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>There is two outs and he is way behind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 537 A.2d 1317. The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">[If] he is going to beat this charge, he\u2019d better get to the plate and start hitting a lot of homeruns because he got a lot of crown [sic], lot of runs to make up in this ease, so now he is going to get up ... to tell you ... his side of the story ... which he forgot or neglected or somehow was unable to tell the State for the seventeen months he has had these various serious charges over his head----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The State in <em>Aceta </em>did not seek to defend its cross-examination of the defendant by arguing that such testimony established inconsistencies or other reasons why his trial testimony was not true. Instead, the State defended its cross-examination of defendant by arguing that defendant\u2019s right to remain silent was not violated by the prosecutor\u2019s trial tactics. <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, when the facts here are compared to the facts of <em>Aceta, </em>it becomes clear that the cross-examination of defendant here about the late furnishing of his alibi notice suffered from none of the infirmities presented there. Here, the prosecutor never argued that defendant\u2019s alibi was untrue because he waited so long to furnish it. The \u201cflagrant\u201d violation that we found in <em>Aceta </em>is plainly absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Our conclusion that the State\u2019s cross-examination of defendant did not violate his right to remain silent, and did not constitute a <em>Deatore </em>violation, is consistent with the Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>551, 868 A.2d 302 (2005). There, the Court held that the State is entitled to let the jury know of the \u201cstark contrast\u201d between the defendant\u2019s first account of the alleged incident and the way the defense describes that incident at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 868 A.2d 302. What is not permissible, however, is suggesting that the jury should reject the proffered defense because the defendant \u201cremained silent when he had the opportunity to present it to the police.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court reasoned, \u201cIn other words, the prosecutor impaled defendant on his silence, intimating that an innocent man would not have stopped speaking to the police officers, but would have revealed to them the defense offered as truth at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 868 A.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Here, the State\u2019s cross-examination of defendant demonstrated the \u201cstark contrast\u201d between the version of the alibi defense defendant presented in his alibi notice and the version he presented two days later in his trial testimony. The timing of defendant\u2019s alibi notice was used by the State here only to discredit defendant\u2019s trial testimony by highlighting that \u201cstark contrast\u201d in so short an interval. Unlike in <em>Muhammad, </em>the State never \u201cimpaled\u201d defendant on his failure to furnish the notice at an earlier opportunity. Thus, the <em>Deatore </em>violation that the Court identified in <em>Muhammad, id. </em>at 565-66, 868 A.2d 302, is absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We accordingly conclude that neither the cross-examination of defendant about the timing of his alibi defense nor the prosecutor\u2019s comment in his summation concerning that same subject eroded defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. This is especially so in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on the limited use of the evidence concerning the timing of defendant\u2019s alibi notice. Even if, for the sake of argument, we were to conclude that such comments were error, we would nonetheless conclude that they were not clearly capable of producing an unjust result. Our review of the record causes us to conclude that the jury\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s alibi resulted not from his delay in asserting it, but from the numerous inconsistencies in the testimony he, his wife and his sister provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">As we have described, his sister Shirley Noble testified that the phone call could have been made as early as 5:30 p.m., whereas the alibi notice stated that the conversation did not begin until 8:00 p.m. In his testimony, defendant contradicted his own alibi notice when he insisted that the call had probably been made much earlier than 7:30 p.m. because if it had come after 7:30 p.m., he and his wife would already have left for her Bible study session. Additionally, defendant\u2019s sister acknowledged that when she had spoken to an investigator two days before she testified at trial, she had told the investigator that she was unsure whether the phone call was in June or July. Yet in her trial testimony, she was certain the phone call took place on June 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Moreover, defendant\u2019s wife told an investigator two days before the trial that she believed the phone call was in late June or early July because she was certain that her children were already in Bermuda at the time the phone call was made, yet at trial she insisted that the phone call had occurred on June 4. These overwhelming inconsistencies were no doubt fatal to the credibility of defendant\u2019s alibi. We thus conclude that the jury likely rejected the alibi defense because the details surrounding it were simply not credible, and not because of defendant\u2019s delay in asserting that defense. This being so, any error, if there was one, was not clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In Point 1(A) of his brief, defendant also argues that the prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s questioning about the timing of his alibi notice was compounded by the erroneous jury instruction the judge gave on that subject. In particular-, he points to the portion of the instruction where the judge told the jury that it was entitled to consider evidence concerning when defendant came forward with an alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We note that the judge also instructed the jury that such evidence could be used only for the \u201climited purpose\u201d of evaluating the credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony and could not be used for any other purpose. The judge specifically prohibited the jury from using the evidence of any such delay to conclude that defendant violated some obligation to come forward because the defendant had no duty \u201cto speak on the subject with anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Because defendant did not object to the charge at trial, we consider it under the plain error standard of review. \u201cPlain error in the context of a jury charge is \u2018[Ijegal impropriety in the charge prejudicially affecting the substantial rights of the defendant sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>144, 160, 919 A.2d 107 (2007) (quoting <em>State v. Torres, </em>183 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>N.J. </em>554, 564, 874 A.2d 1084 (2005)). We must read the charge \u201cas a whole in determining whether there was\u201d plain error. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Reviewing the charge as a whole, we find no plain error. Although we agree that the judge inadvertently misspoke<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when he instructed the jury that it was free to consider the timing of defendant\u2019s assertion of an alibi defense, the charge as a whole did not have a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result. This is so for two reasons. First, the judge instructed the jury that: the State bore the burden of proving that defendant committed the offense and was present at the time and place the crime was committed; the lateness of defendant\u2019s alibi notice could only be used for a \u201climited purpose\u201d; defendant had no burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>with respect to his alibi defense; and defendant had \u201cno duty to speak on the subject with anyone.\u201d Considering the charge in its entirety, as we are required to do, <em>ibid., </em>we conclude that the jury was not misled by this isolated mistake on the judge\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Second, for the reasons we discussed in Part III, we conclude that the jury\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s alibi defense likely had nothing to do with defendant\u2019s delay in asserting it, but instead resulted from the implausibility of the defense itself in light of the actual testimony provided by defendant, his wife and sister on that subject. Thus, the error by the judge did not lead the jury to a result it would not otherwise have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In Point 1(B) of his brief, defendant argues that the prosecutor engaged in numerous additional instances of misconduct which, when viewed cumulatively and in combination with the improper use of the timing of defendant\u2019s alibi notice, require reversal. We have considered defendant\u2019s arguments in light of the record and applicable law, and conclude they lack sufficient merit to warrant extended discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">In Point II of his brief, defendant argues that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to sua sponte charge passion/provocation attempted manslaughter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">We note that in his point heading, defendant argues that this error was raised below. He is mistaken because, as we have already discussed, defendant did not object to any portions of the judge\u2019s charge at the time it was given. His arguments respecting the failure to give such a charge have been raised for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Because defendant did not object to the jury charge before the jury retired to deliberate, we will reverse only if the failure to charge the jury on passion/provocation attempted manslaughter was plain error \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Not any possibility of an unjust result will suffice. The possibility must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In support of his argument, defendant contends that \u201cif he was responsible for Smith\u2019s assault, he was responding to his recent discovery of a continuing and horrific pattern of sexual abuse perpetrated upon a close family member, which might continue if left unchecked.\u201d Thus, defendant argues, there was sufficient evidence in the record that the judge was required to charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of passion/provocation attempted manslaughter even though he failed to make such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"> The judge is not required to provide the jury with an instruction on a lesser-included offense sua sponte unless \u201cthe facts clearly indicate the appropriateness of that charge.\u201d <em>State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 299, 486 A.2d 833 (1985). There is no onus placed upon the trial court to \u201con its own meticulously ... sift through the entire record in every murder trial to see if some combination of facts and inferences might rationally sustain\u201d a murder charge. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The offense in question is a lesser-included offense of attempted murder. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>476, 489, 643 A.2d 591 (1994). Passion/provocation manslaughter has four elements: \u201cthe provocation must be adequate; the defendant must not have had time to cool off between the provocation and the slaying; the provocation must have actually impassioned the defendant; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the defendant must not have actually cooled off before the slaying.\u201d <em>State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 411, 568 A.2d 879 (1990). The first two elements are objective, and the last two are subjective. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In determining whether to give a passion/provocation instruction, a trial court should look at the evidence in a light most favorable to defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 412, 568 A.2d 879. The first element <em>of </em>adequate provocation addresses \u201cwhether [or not] loss of self-control is a reasonable reaction.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIf no jury could rationally conclude that the State had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the asserted provocation was insufficient to inflame the passions of a reasonable person, the trial court should withhold the charge.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The second element looks at the cooling off period. Despite the existence of adequate provocation, \u201ca charge of passion/provocation manslaughter is not available if [defendant] should have cooled off before the killing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 568 A.2d 879. The Court declined in <em>Mauricio </em>to specify particular temporal guidelines, and chose instead to permit the trial judge to develop a \u201csense of the situation as disclosed by the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 568 A.2d 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">As we have observed, the third element is whether the perpetrator\u2019s passions were inflamed, and the fourth looks at whether his or her passions actually did cool. <em>Ibid. </em>Both of these elements are subjective and should be left to the discretion <em>of </em>the jury. <em>Ibid..</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Here, even if we were to assume that Smith\u2019s assault upon defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter outside of defendant\u2019s presence can be considered an adequate provocation, we agree with the State that defendant\u2019s argument still must fail because there was more than an adequate cooling-off period based upon the undisputed facts in the record. The sexual assault upon defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter took place more than a month before defendant\u2019s attack upon Smith. During that month, the sexual assault was reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>to the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office opened an investigation. Even if we were to assume that defendant was unaware of the allegations against Smith until the kidnapping incident on May 29, 2003, he still waited six days before he drove to the victim\u2019s home and struck him in the head with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Furthermore, we agree with the State\u2019s contention that \u201cdefendant\u2019s statements at the scene and his subsequent trial testimony contradict his belated assertion that the motivation for the assault was the sexual assault upon his niece.\u201d Smith testified that moments before he was attacked, defendant said \u201cyou pressed charges on my brother, either you drop them or you go to the morgue.\u201d We agree with the State that this threat clearly suggests that the assault on Smith was retribution for Smith having pressed charges against defendant\u2019s brother Dante, and not an impassioned response to the sexual assault upon a family member. Thus, the record does not support defendant\u2019s contention that the provocation was Smith\u2019s sexual assault on defendant\u2019s niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Moreover, during defendant\u2019s own trial testimony, he maintained that he never struck Smith and that he was not even in Paterson the night of the attack. Thus, the State is correct when it argues that regardless of whether the trial judge credited either the victim\u2019s account of the facts or the defendant\u2019s, neither version supported the elements of passion/provocation attempted manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Accordingly, we are not satisfied that the omission of such a charge led the jury to a result it would not otherwise have reached. Accordingly, there was no error, much less plain error. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Defendant\u2019s final argument concerns the sentence the judge imposed and whether the judge erred in his application of aggravating and mitigating factors. Our review of the sentence is deferential.' We will only disturb a sentence if a defendant demonstrates \u201csuch a clear error of judgment that it shocks the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>judicial conscience.\u201d <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 364, 471 A.2d 370 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Defendant argues that his sentence must be vacated because the judge failed to articulate the reasons why he found the existence of aggravating factor nine, the need for deterrence, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(9). Unquestionably, there is a need to deter not only this defendant, but others as well, from engaging in the type of brutal assault that defendant engaged in here. The record plainly supports the finding of aggravating factor nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The judge found the existence of mitigating factor eleven, undue hardship on defendant\u2019s dependents if he were to be incarcerated, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(b)(11). Defendant argues that additional factors were presented to the trial judge and the trial judge declined to find them. Defendant is incorrect. Defendant did not urge these additional mitigating factors until the March 17, 2006 motion for reconsideration of sentence, which occurred seven months after the sentence was imposed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Furthermore, the sentence that was imposed was only one year more than the midpoint of the sentencing range. In light of the vicious attack that has left Paul Smith blind and without a sense of smell or taste, unable to work, and unable to function without the assistance of a medical aide, the sentence imposed by the trial judge does not shock the judicial conscience. We also recognize that a conviction for attempted murder does not require as one of its elements that any injury be inflicted. Accordingly, the extent of injury inflicted, as the trial judge properly found, is a substantial aggravating factor. <em>See State v. Mara, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>204, 214, 601 A.2d 718 (App.Div.1992). Under all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the circumstances, the sentence imposed does not shock the judicial conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-14\"> Defendant was also convicted of second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(d), but that conviction was merged with the attempted murder conviction at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\"> The Supreme Court reached a similar result in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elkwisni, </em>190 <em>N.J. 169, </em>181, 919 A.2d 122 (2007), when it held that the State is prohibited from using a defendant's delay in furnishing exculpatory information to suggest that he fabricated it. The Court held that such a suggestion impermissibly erodes a defendant's right to remain silent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\"> We can understand why the trial judge may have been confused by the language in the model charge on Alibi. The charge might benefit from some revision. Specifically, the charge states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">(CHARGE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH ONLY WHERE APPROPRIATE:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">You have heard testimony about when (insert name of defendant or alibi witness) first came forward with (his/her) account of what happened.

In contrast, a portion of the second paragraph applies only to a witness and not to a defendant: \u201cYou may consider the evidence when (he/she) came forward, and why (he/she) did so at that time, only for the limited purpose of deciding whether it affects the credibility of (his/her) account.\u201d The sentence that follows applies to both a witness and a defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">The charge would benefit from an instruction to judges that the sentence we have quoted applies only to witnesses. Also, the words \"(he/she)\" should be changed to \"(name of witness)\u201d in order to avoid confusion to the jurors.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b623-12\"> Defendant's belated effort to raise that issue on motion for a new trial does not entitle him to avoid the plain error standard of review. An objection to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>jury charge must be voiced when the charge is given. <em>R. </em>1:7-2. <em>See also State v.
