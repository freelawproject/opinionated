Defendant Terrance Echols (defendant) and co-defendant Joseph Brown were indicted and charged with numerous offenses in connection with that occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The thrust of the State\u2019s case was that Franklin Powell was shot as part of a turf war among competing drug dealers. In affirming, we synopsized the evidence adduced at trial in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">On September 3, 1994, the victim was living with his sister, Lisa Lucas, at 279C Broadway in Newark. About 10:25 p.m. that evening, the victim, who sold \u201cclips\u201d (ten vials) of cocaine for $35, was in the first floor apartment. His sister was upstairs, doing laundry. Defendants, who were members of a drug-dealing group called the Hit Squad, approached the apartment with white sheets over their faces. [Defendant] went to the back door with a gun while Brown went to the victim\u2019s front door with an automatic weapon. Earlier in the evening, [defendant] had instructed his girlfriend to summon and hold a cab, because defendants were planning to go to her house to spend the night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">Brown kicked in the front door, and [defendant] entered the apartment through the rear door, causing the victim, also known as \u201cQuill,\u201d to try and run to the second floor. A few minutes later, gunfire was heard. Although the victim was fatally struck in the back and right leg, he managed to reach the second floor and shield his sister with a broken door before collapsing. Lisa Lucas ... ran for help, but her brother died from the bullet wounds that penetrated his lung, liver, diaphragm, and stomach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">Defendants, meanwhile, ran from the apartment, through the building\u2019s backyard, and onto Broad Street, where [defendant] was seen holding something at his side. [Defendant] returned to the scene wearing different clothes and left in the waiting cab.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">The police investigated the murder. At the crime scene, they discovered empty nine-millimeter Luger shell casings and a nine-millimeter slug, which could have been fired from an IM; a boot print on the apartment\u2019s front door; and blood on the apartment\u2019s first and second floors. They also inter-viewed numerous witnesses to the killing who gave them statements concerning what they had seen, identified defendants as the shooters, and explained that the Hit Squad had killed the victim because he was cutting into their drug operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">On September 7, 1994, arrest warrants were issued for defendants, and the police arrested both on the following day. After receiving his <em>Miranda </em>[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>warnings, [defendant] waived them and gave a sworn statement on September 9, 1994, claiming that \u201cI didn\u2019t shoot nobody.\u201d According to [defendant], Keith Eutsey ... had gone to the victim\u2019s apartment, and other individuals were present. On the strength of these statements, [defendant] was released on bail and Keith Eutsey was arrested on September 15, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">Upon his release, [defendant] and others began a campaign of intimidating witnesses, many of whom changed their original statements implicating [defendant] and Brown. Echols told Ada Dansby ... that he would kill their son Shaquill like he killed Powell because the boy\u2019s name included the victim\u2019s nickname, \u201cQuill,\u201d causing Dansby to file a terroristic threats complaint against him. [Defendant] also threatened Trade Irvin ..., the mother of the victim\u2019s child, telling her to \u201cshut the fuck up, you stupid bitch, or I\u2019ll fuck you up[,]\u201d and to stop talking about the murder or he would kill her. On October 26, 1994, [defendant] gave a statement to a private detective, employed by Eutse/s attorney, admitting that he had falsely accused Eutsey of Powell\u2019s killing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">On November 10, 1994, [defendant] went to the apartment of Shalika Thomason ..., a former girlfriend, with two guns and a knife. He stuck Thomason with the knife as he attempted to force her to accompany him from the apartment. [Defendant] complained that he would be jailed the next day and \u201cdo about 25 years\u201d because of statements Thomason had made to the police. When Thomason\u2019s friend attempted to intervene, [defendant] told her \u201cBitch, mind your own business or I kill all of you,\u201d and he threatened to put a \u201chit\u201d out on her. Thomason told her friend to call the police, which her friend did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In 1996, at the conclusion of an eighteen-day jury trial, defendant was acquitted of conspiracy to commit murder and acquitted of purposeful or knowing murder, but he was convicted of felony murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3(a), burglary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2, aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3(a), possession of a dangerous weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:39-5, possession of a dangerous weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:39-4, making a false report to a police officer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3(b), false swearing, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:18-2, and hindering apprehension, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:29-3. After all appropriate mergers, defendant was sentenced to: a term of life imprisonment, with a thirty-year period of parole ineligibility, on the first-degree felony murder conviction; concurrent five-year terms on the merged weapons convictions and the hindering apprehension conviction; a concurrent eighteen-month term on the false report conviction; and an eighteen-month term, with a nine-month period of parole ineligibility, for false swearing, which was ordered to run consecutively to the life term.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Defendant argued in his direct appeal that he was entitled to reversal because: (1) the felony murder jury charge was erroneous with respect to the predicate crime of burglary; (2) the jury was not instructed that its members must be unanimous as to the underlying crime that formed the basis for the felony murder conviction; (3) he was prejudiced by the admission of Ada Dansb/s testimony that someone pointed a gun at her face the morning she testified; (4) he was prejudiced by the admission of Ada Dansby\u2019s testimony that \u201ceveryone is scared of the defendant\u201d; (5) the prosecutor argued to the jury that the defendants \u201cdid everything they could to prevent witnesses from testifying\u201d; (6) members of the jury observed defendant in handcuffs; (7) defendant\u2019s other crimes and bad acts were erroneously admitted into evidence; (8) the trial judge\u2019s charge regarding the use of defendant\u2019s other crimes and bad acts was erroneous; and (9) the accumulation of errors deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In 2000, we rejected these arguments and affirmed the judgment of conviction, with one minor exception regarding the sentence, by way of a 105-page unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Defendant filed a PCR petition in 200]. According to the trial judge, this petition was apparently \u201clost, misfiled, misplaced, or otherwise procedurally mishandled by either the office of the Essex Vicinage Criminal Division manager or the Office of the Public Defender ..., or both,\u201d and, as a result, co-defendant Brown\u2019s PCR petition was \u201cready to be heard before the Public Defender even assigned PCR counsel\u201d to defendant. As a result, Brown\u2019s PCR petition was heard before defendant\u2019s petition was perfected. Brown\u2019s petition was denied, and then was affirmed by way of our unpublished opinion of November 14, 2005. Docket No. A-5806-03T4.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">An evidentiary hearing was conducted regarding defendant\u2019s PCR petition in August and September 2005. On November 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>2005, the trial judge denied the PCR petition for the reasons thoroughly elucidated in a 50-page written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Defendant has now appealed the denial of his PCR petition, presenting the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">I. TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO FILE A TIMELY NOTICE OF ALIBI AND IN FAILING TO ELICIT A COMPLETE ALIBI, AND APPELLATE COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO ARGUE THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO CHARGE THE JURORS REGARDING AN ALIBI DEFENSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">II. TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO INVESTIGATE THE CRIME SCENE, AS SUCH AN INVESTIGATION WOULD HAVE REVEALED THAT TWO STATE\u2019S WITNESSES WERE LYING WHEN THEY CLAIMED TO OBSERVE [DEFENDANT] IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SHOOTING. COUNSEL WAS ALSO INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO INFORM THE JURORS, BY MEANS OF CROSS-EXAMINATION AND ARGUMENT IN SUMMATION, OF CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES IN THE STORIES OF THE STATE\u2019S FOUR KEY WITNESSES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">A. Trial Counsel Was Ineffective in His Failure to Investigate the Crime Scene, as He Could Have Demonstrated that Irvin and Dansby Were Lying When They Claimed that [Defendant] Fled the Crime Scene in a \u201cGetaway\u201d Taxi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">B. Trial Counsel Was Ineffective When he Failed to Utilize the Discovery to Demonstrate the Significant Inconsistencies in the Witnesses\u2019 Statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">III. TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO LIMIT THE JURYS EXPOSURE TO OTHER-CRIMES EVIDENCE AND IN ALLOWING THE STATE TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE THAT \u201cEVERYONE WAS AFRAID OF [DEFENDANT].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">IV. BECAUSE [DEFENDANT\u2019S] STATEMENT TO THE POLICE COULD NOT BE EFFECTIVELY REDACTED, IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEVER THE TRIALS OF THE CO-DEFENDANTS, AND TRIAL OR APPELLATE COUNSEL OR BOTH WERE INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO RAISE THE ISSUE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">V. THE PROSECUTOR COMMITTED MISCONDUCT WHEN HE CHARACTERIZED [DEFENDANT] AS ENGAGING IN THE \u201cVIOLENT CRIMINAL BUSINESS\u201d OF DRUG SALES AND WHEN HE STATED THAT [DEFENDANT] AND HIS FELLOW GANG MEMBERS POSED A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE JURORS. APPELLATE COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO RAISE THIS ISSUE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">VI. BECAUSE THE STATE\u2019S POLYGRAPH EXAMINER TOLD [DEFENDANT] THAT HE WOULD BE AN EXPERT WITNESS EITHER FOR OR AGAINST HIM, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE TEST, THERE WAS AN ORAL STIPULATION THAT THE EXAMINATION, WHICH [DEFENDANT] PASSED, WOULD BE ADMISSIBLE AT TRIAL. APPELLATE COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO RAISE THIS ISSUE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>VII. THE COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO INSTRUCT JURORS THAT THE FACT THAT POLICE POSSESSED [DEFENDANT\u2019S] PHOTOGRAPH WAS NOT TO BE USED TO SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD PRIOR CONVICTIONS, AND TRIAL AND APPELLATE COUNSEL WERE INEFFECTIVE IN NOT ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">VIII. THE COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING A STATE\u2019S WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN HANDCUFFS AND IN PERMITTING TWO STATE\u2019S WITNESSES AND DEFENDANT\u2019S ALIBI WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN PRISON GARB. TRIAL AND APPELLATE COUNSEL WERE INEFFECTIVE IN FAILING TO RAISE THE ISSUE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">IX. [DEFENDANT\u2019S] CONVICTION FOR FELONY MURDER MUST BE VACATED BECAUSE THE PREDICATE FELONY, BURGLARY, WAS COMPLETE <em>BEFORE </em>THE SHOOTING OCCURRED. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, [DEFENDANT] WAS ENTITLED TO HAVE JURORS DETERMINE, PURSUANT TO APPROPRIATE INSTRUCTIONS, WHETHER THE BURGLARY HAD BEEN COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE SHOOTING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">X. THIS COURT SHOULD GRANT [DEFENDANT] RELIEF ON THE BASIS OF CUMULATIVE ERROR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">After carefully examining the record, we find insufficient merit in Points II, III, IV, VII and IX to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2). We also find no merit in VI for the reasons briefly discussed toward the end of this opinion. And we conclude that the argument contained in Point VIII cannot be a cause for a reversal of the order under review, but it does provide additional support for our disposition of other issues, as more fully discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">After considering the arguments in Points I, V and X, and after a careful review of the record, we are convinced that defendant should have been granted post-conviction relief. We hold that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to fully elicit testimony from defendant\u2019s alibi witness, and appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise on direct appeal the trial judge\u2019s failure to give an alibi instruction at the close of the trial. We are also satisfied that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object when the prosecutor, in his opening statement, argued that witnesses had been intimidated and inappropriately asserted or suggested that the jurors would be in danger merely by sitting in the courtroom but for the presence of sheriffs officers, and appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue that issue on appeal. We hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>either of these matters, standing alone, support defendant\u2019s right to a new trial, but we additionally hold, as urged by defendant in Point X, that their confluence also militates in favor of post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In determining whether an accused has been deprived of the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, we apply the two-part test formulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). This test was also adopted as the means for determining when the performance of counsel offends our state constitution. <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The <em>Strickland/Fritz </em>test requires that the court determine whether \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 688, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693, and, if so, whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d 466 <em>U.S. </em>at 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698. The \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement of the second aspect of this test \u201cwas based on our conclusion that \u2018[a]n error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 <em>U.S. 52, </em>57, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>366, 369, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>203, 209 (1985) (quoting <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 691, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2066, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 696).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process\u201d that it cannot be relied on as \u201chaving produced a just result.\u201d \u25a0 <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 686, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 692-93. In holding that a PCR applicant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d the Court defined \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>probability\u201d as \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698; <em>see also State v. Fritz, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 52, 519 A.2d 336. In short, a defendant is not required to show with mathematical precision that he would have been acquitted instead of convicted but for trial counsel\u2019s mistakes, but is required to show only that his attorney\u2019s errors and omissions were of such significance as to undermine confidence in the outcome. In examining the parties\u2019 contentions, we must remain mindful that \u201c[p]ost-eonvietion relief is a defendant\u2019s last opportunity to raise a constitutional challenge to the fairness and reliability of a criminal verdict in our state system.\u201d <em>State v. Feaster, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>235, 249, 877 A.2d 229 (2005) (citing <em>State v. Rue, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18, 811 A.2d 425 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Defendant\u2019s arguments regarding his alleged alibi require our consideration of whether counsel sufficiently pursued the issue at trial and whether appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue, on direct appeal, the trial judge\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s request for an alibi instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The record reveals that defense counsel indicated during the course of the trial a desire to call Eashine Smallwood as an alibi witness despite defendant\u2019s failure to give notice of an alibi pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:12-2(a). Counsel argued that confusion about the identity of this witness prevented him from informing the prosecutor until the trial had already begun. The trial judge conducted a hearing, pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104, during which Smallwood was examined outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">At the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing, Smallwood testified that he was in a parking lot outside the building that housed the victim\u2019s apartment when he heard gunshots, and that he and others, including defendant, ran together from the area as a result. He was specifically asked by defendant\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">Q. Well, was there anybody else that you could see when you heard the gunshots?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>A. Oh, yes. When I ran we got down the end of Broad Street, it was me, Jamine, Raymond and [defendant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In light of this and other testimony, trial counsel sought to call Smallwood as an alibi witness in order to demonstrate that defendant was in the parking lot when Powell was shot and killed in his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The prosecutor objected, but the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in allowing the witness to testify about what he observed when the shots were fired. In the presence of the jury, Smallwood gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">Q. I\u2019m going to ask you to remember back to Saturday evening, September 3rd, 1994,10:00, 10:30 in the evening. Remember that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">Q. And where were you at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">A. In the parking lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">Q. Parking lot where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">A. Of Broad Street and Broadway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">Q. Is that in the area of 279C Broadway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-15\">Q. And do you know who lives there or do you know now who lived there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">A. Now I do, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-17\">Q. Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-18\">A. Franklin Powell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-19\">Q. Now, were you with anybody in the parking lot that evening at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARk\">A. I was with a girl at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-20\">Q. Okay. With anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-21\">A. I was around Jamine Nelson, Raymond George and [defendant],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-22\">Q. Okay. And did something happen then, did you hear anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-23\">A. Yes, I heard shots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-24\">Q. Do you know how many you heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-25\">A. Can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-26\">Q. And what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-27\">A. I ran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-28\">Q. Did you see \u2014 did anybody else run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-29\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-30\">Q. Did you run together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-31\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-32\">Q. And who is it, tell the jury who is it who ran with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>A. Raymond George, Jamine Nelson and [defendant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">Q. Okay. At any time did you see any gun in the hands of [defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">During the charge conference, defense counsel requested that the judge instruct the jury about his alibi. The judge initially responded that defendant had not given notice pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:12-2(a), and concluded, in ruling against defendant, that the Smallwood testimony \u201cwasn\u2019t an alibi.\u201d He summarized his reasons for refusing to give an alibi instruction in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">I\u2019m not go[ing][to] give an alibi charge. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate in this case. I mean, it\u2019s clear on the facts and I don\u2019t consider that an alibi. It\u2019s clear where he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">Was he there \u2014 if this is an alibi case then every case in which identity is at issue, every case in which the question of whether or not the defendant is the one who committed the crime is in issue is an alibi case. Because everybody, as a matter\u2014 if somebody wasn\u2019t at the scene and they deny being at the scene at the time, then by definition they were somewhere else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">In ruling upon defendant\u2019s PCR petition, the trial judge further amplified his thoughts on the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">[T]he trial court refused [defendant\u2019s] request for an alibi charge to the jury ... based on the determination that Smallwood\u2019s testimony was not actually an alibi. Smallwood\u2019s testimony only established that he saw [defendant] in the parking lot at the time gunshots were fired, a location that was not \u201celsewhere\u201d or \u201canother place.\u201d He was merely fifty feet from the murder scene. If Smallwood was not an alibi witness, then it was sensible for trial counsel not to file a notice of alibi, it was proper for the trial court to refuse an alibi charge, and it was wise for appellate counsel to focus on other more meritorious issues in its direct appeal. As the trial court pointed out, the issue was not alibi but rather one of identification. Here, [defendant] claimed to [be] at the scene in the parking lot fifty feet away from the murder site. If an alibi charge were proper in this case, then an alibi charge would be necessary in almost every ease where identification was in issue because if the defendant were not the culprit, the defendant had to be somewhere else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">After carefully reviewing the matter, we agree with defendant\u2019s contention that (a) trial counsel failed to adequately elicit Small-wood\u2019s testimony that defendant was not present in Powell\u2019s apartment during the shooting, (b) defendant was entitled to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>alibi instruction, and (c) appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue this issue on appeal. This combination of circumstances casts a reasonable doubt over the reliability of the outcome of the proceedings and entitles defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We agree with defendant\u2019s contention that the substance of Smallwood\u2019s testimony should have been more clearly elicited. As quoted above, Smallwood testified <em>out of the presence of the jury </em>that he was in the parking lot outside Powell\u2019s apartment, that defendant was also standing in the parking lot, and that he and defendant, among others, ran from the parking lot when gunshots were heard; he further stated that he did not see a weapon in defendant\u2019s hand at that time. <em>When the jury was present, </em>defense counsel established through Smallwood\u2019s testimony that he and defendant, among others, were in the parking lot, that Smallwood heard gunshots, and that he and others, including defendant, ran from the scene. Defense counsel, however, never firmly established from the witness, while the jury was present, that defendant was in the parking lot \u2014 and therefore not in the victim\u2019s apartment \u2014 at the moment the shots rang out. As a result, as defendant now persuasively argues, the jury \u201cmay have concluded that Smallwood observed [defendant] before the shooting and they ran away together after the shooting, yet [defendant] may have been inside Powell\u2019s apartment when the shots were fired.\u201d We agree that the testimony Smallwood gave while the jury was present does not preclude this possible, and perhaps likely, interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Considering the significance of evidence that defendant was elsewhere when the shooting occurred \u2014 even if only fifty feet away \u2014 we agree that counsel should have more clearly elicited from Smallwood that defendant was in the parking lot and not in Powell\u2019s apartment when Powell was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Through Smallwood\u2019s testimony, defendant was attempting to convince the jury that he was not present in Powell\u2019s apartment at the time of the shooting. As we have observed, trial counsel\u2019s examination of Smallwood failed to fully educe the factual basis for that contention. Notwithstanding, the trial judge assumed that the point had been conveyed through Smallwood\u2019s testimony, yet refused to provide an alibi instruction to the jury during his charge. This determination was mistaken because it too narrowly viewed what constitutes an alibi and deprived the jury of a guide for considering defendant\u2019s theoiy of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The term \u201calibi\u201d literally means \u201celsewhere; in another place,\u201d and has \u201cits evidential efficacy in the physical impossibility of the accused\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Mucci, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>423, 431, 136 A.2d 761 (1957) (citations omitted). The trial judge opined that because there was no dispute that defendant was at least in the neighborhood, this was not \u201can alibi case,\u201d and distinguished this case from <em>State v. Peetros, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>540, 214 A.2d 2 (1965), where the crime occurred in Camden when defendant claimed he was in Philadelphia, and other similar cases. <em>See State v. Garvin, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>268, 208 A.2d 402 (1965) (where defendant claimed he was in Philadelphia and not in Newark, where the crime occurred); <em>State v. Swint, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 835 A.2d 323 (App.Div.2003) (where defendant\u2019s wife testified that he was asleep at home and not outside a distant nightclub where the crime was committed); <em>State v. Searles, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 197 A.2d 384 (App.Div.1964) (where the murder was committed in Camden while defendant claimed he was in Philadelphia). We reject the notion that a defendant\u2019s claim of an alibi is only cognizable when based on defendant\u2019s presence in another municipality when the crime was committed and reject the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant was not sufficiently distant from the murder scene to give rise to a legitimate alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">An alibi is asserted whenever there is evidence that would suggest the accused was in some other location and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>could not possibly have committed the crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although such a claim certainly requires consideration of the distance of the accused from the crime scene, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s evidence that he was outside in a parking lot, and without a gun, when the gunshots that killed Powell rang out inside the apartment building, formed the factual basis for an alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">During the trial, the judge\u2019s mistaken view that there was an insufficient physical distance between the defendant and the crime carried two potential consequences for defendant. The first was the possibility that the trial judge would not permit Smallwood\u2019s testimony because defense counsel failed to serve notice upon the prosecutor pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:12-2(a), and the second was the possibility that the trial judge would not give the jury an alibi instruction at the conclusion of the case. As we have already observed, the judge permitted Smallwood\u2019s testimony, so that counsel\u2019s failure to serve a notice of an alibi had no consequence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the judge also rejected defendant\u2019s request for an alibi instruction, a determination that was erroneous in light of our description of what constitutes an alibi. Although trial counsel was not ineffective, in the constitutional sense, in that regard\u2014 because he did request such an instruction \u2014 we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>appellate counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the matter on appeal deprived defendant of the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In considering this latter point, the trial judge concluded in his PCR opinion that his identification instruction<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was not greatly distinguishable from the model alibi instruction<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, thus, the absence of the latter from his charge could not have affected the outcome of the trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The focus of the two instructions is similar but not entirely the same. The identification instruction guides the jury as to how to consider evidence that defendant was seen committing the crime, whereas the alibi instruction informs the jury how to consider evidence that suggests it was not possible for the defendant to have committed the crime because he was not at the crime scene. The difference was explained by one court in the following persuasive manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>An alibi defense differs from other mistaken identity defenses in an important respect: A defendant might win based on an alibi defense even if she does nothing at all to dispute the government\u2019s proof, because the alibi itself can create reasonable doubt. Without an alibi, the defendant would have to work much harder to disprove identity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\"><em>[United States v. Zuniga, </em>6 F.3d 569, 571 (9th Cir.1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Moreover, the absence of an instruction about alibi evidence might permit the jury to assume that it was defendant\u2019s burden to prove the alibi. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 197 A.2d 384. Accordingly, the court in <em>Zuniga </em>held that the failure to give the jury an alibi instruction when there is evidence to support it \u201cis reversible per se and can never be considered harmless error.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also United States v. Burse, </em>531 A.2d 1151, 1153 (2d Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Megna, </em>450 F.2d 511, 513 (5th Cir.1971); <em>Pulley v. Maryland, </em>38 <em>Md.App. </em>682, 382 A.2d 621, 625 (1978). We agree with <em>Zuniga\u2019s </em>analysis, and the approach taken by the other federal circuits referred to above, and conclude that prejudice accrues when, as here, a judge fails to provide an alibi instruction when applicable. <em>State v. Driver, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>255, 290-91, 183 A.2d 655 (1962); <em>Searles, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 214, 197 A.2d 384; <em>see also Peetros, supra, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 554, 214 A.2d 2 (Francis, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Indeed, the alibi instruction should have been given if for no other reason than defendant was entitled to an instruction that would guide the jury in its consideration of his theory of the ease. <em>Mathews v. United States, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>58, 63, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>883, 887, 99 L.Ed.2d 54, 61 (1988); <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. 2, </em>16, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990); <em>State v. Sloane, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>293, 303, 544 A.2d 826 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>(1988); <em>State v. Moultrie, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 556, 816 A.2d 180 (App.Div.2003); <em>State v. Freeman, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 469-70, 735 A.2d 1195 (App.Div.1999); <em>State v. Merola, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 224, 838 A.2d 543 (Law Div.2002). This is so even when the defendant\u2019s theory is supported by \u201c[v]ery slight evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 317, 419 A.2d 406 (1980); <em>Moultrie, supra, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 556, 816 A.2d 180. A failure to so instruct a jury has a tendency to minimize the significance or worth of the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. Certainly the State\u2019s theory was well represented in the judge\u2019s charge; defendant\u2019s theory, which found support in the factual record, was entitled to no less respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We conclude that, although impeccable, the judge\u2019s identification instruction could not serve as a fair substitute for an alibi instruction. This is particularly true when it is considered that the identification instruction referred to both defendants whereas the alibi instruction, if given, would have referred only to defendant. The charge that was given neither highlighted defendant\u2019s alleged alibi nor isolated it from those instructions that applied to both defendants. We conclude that in this circumstance the failure to give the instruction prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The reasons we have just provided as to why the judge erred in failing to give the alibi instruction sought by trial counsel demonstrate that defendant\u2019s appellate counsel failed to conform to the standard constitutionally imposed in the direct appeal. Because we have concluded that the lack of an alibi instruction prejudiced defendant and had a probability of succeeding on direct appeal, we are satisfied that the omission of that viable argument on appeal violated the standard constitutionally imposed on appellate counsel by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Coupling the failure of trial counsel to more thoroughly elicit Smallwood\u2019s testimony with the trial judge\u2019s refusal to provide an alibi instruction and with appellate counsel\u2019s failure to seek our review of the lack of an alibi instruction on direct appeal, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>conclude that defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel and must be given a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Although the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s alleged alibi alone are sufficient to warrant the ordering of a new trial, we are also satisfied that certain of the prosecutor\u2019s comments, which were not objected to at trial and were not raised on direct appeal, prejudiced defendant and generated a reasonable doubt about the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor informed the jurors that defendant was a member of the \u201cHit Squad\u201d gang, which like \u201cthe Mafia,\u201d is a \u201cform of organized crime\u201d involved in the \u201cviolent criminal business\u201d of illegal drug sales. He then argued to the jury that this gang, of which defendant was a member, posed a danger to the community, as revealed by their alleged intimidation of witnesses in the case. Because the prosecutor intended to prove this, we may assume, for present purposes, that those comments constituted a fair argument. But the prosecutor then stepped beyond the proper bounds of advocacy by informing the jury that defendant and the other gang members who would be in court during the trial posed a danger not only to the community <em>but to the jurors themselves:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">Listen to everything with an open mind. [The witnesses who had allegedly been intimidated] are not people who like you are able to sit in a fairly nice courtroom in Essex County. <em>The sheriff officers are here, so that you can feel safe and comfortable. You know that nothing is going to happen to you. </em>You are just hearing evidence. Think about people who are living in the community and why they might say, Well, my son is more important. My life is more important. I never saw nothing. I don\u2019t want to be involved anymore. Get me out of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALu\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The parameters that govern the arguments of prosecutors are well known. Prosecutors are permitted to \u201cstrike hard blows,\u201d but are \u201cnot at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 <em>U.S. </em>78, 88, 55 <em>S.Ct. </em>629, 633, 79 <em>L.Ed. </em>1314, 1321 (1935); <em>accord State v.

Siciliano, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>249, 262, 121 A.2d 490 (1956) (holding that \u201c[a] prosecutor may be zealous in enforcing the law but he must nevertheless refrain from any conduct lacking in the essentials of fair play\u201d). These limits emanate from the prosecutor\u2019s overriding obligation \u201cnot to obtain convictions, but to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 320, 524 A.2d 188 (1987). Prosecutors are the representatives \u201cnot of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as the obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\u201d <em>Berger, supra, </em>295 <em>U.S. </em>at 88, 55 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 633, 79 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1321. As a result, \u201c[i]t is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less[er] degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, a breach of these standards by a prosecutor tends to have a greater impact because of the unique position the prosecutor holds in the jury\u2019s eyes. Accordingly, when a prosecutor \u201chas crossed the line and resulted in foul play, the reversal of the judgment below will be ordered.\u201d <em>Siciliano, supra, 21 N.J. </em>at 262, 121 A.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment during his opening statement that the jury was safe in the courtroom from defendant and others only because the sheriffs officers were present far exceeded these principles. Notwithstanding this \u201cfoul blow,\u201d trial counsel did not object.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Arguments or suggestions that the jury should convict to protect society from particular types of criminals are improper. <em>See, e.g., Ramseur, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 321, 524 A.2d 188 (finding improper a summation that \u201c[t]he laws are made for our protection and in this case, ladies and gentlemen, we must realize that it is our responsibility to protect everybody here who has no interest in this ease and to protect everybody out there in the culture of Essex County from the cruel, horrible, inhumane acts of murder\u201d); <em>State v. Tilghman, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 577-78, 786 A.2d 128 (App.Div.2001) (criticizing comments in the prosecutor\u2019s opening and summation that \u201cdiscussed the social problem posed by the vulnerability of elderly victims who are preyed upon by the young and strong\u201d); <em>State v. Acker, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 356, 627 A.2d 170 (App.Div.1993) (finding \u201cegregious ... the prosecutor\u2019s argument that it was the function of the jury to protect young victims of alleged sexual offenses as a group\u201d). Here, not only did the prosecutor argue that the jury should act to protect the community from gang members involved in the violent business of dealing illegal drugs but that he also suggested the jury should act out of self-preservation because defendant posed a danger even to them. These comments far exceeded the bounds of proper advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We further consider, in this regard, the argument presently made by defendant that the trial court erred in requiring Darnell Jones and Rashine Donaldson, who were members of the \u201cHit Squad,\u201d to testify in handcuffs and Smallwood, whose testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>was critical to defendant\u2019s theory of the case, to testify in prison garb. We recognize that these contentions alone cannot be the basis for relief because the supporting case law did not fully develop until after the trial in this case. <em>See State v. Artwell, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>526, 536-39, 832 A.2d 295 (2003); <em>State v. Russell, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 895 A.2d 1163 (App.Div.2006). And it is readily apparent that these new parameters on the appearances of defendants and witnesses during trial were intended to have only prospective effect. <em>See, e.g., Artwell, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 539, 832 A.2d 295. This does not mean, however, that we must be blind to the fact that the jury heard the testimony of witnesses who were handcuffed and dressed in prison garb. This acutely interfered with defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial because the appearances of these witnesses served to reinforce the prosecutor\u2019s egregious suggestion that defendants and other members of the \u201cHit Squad\u201d posed a danger to the jury. <em>See State v. King, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 363, 915 A.2d 587 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>394, 921 A.2d 448 (2007). And, although Smallwood was not handcuffed during his testimony, he was dressed in prison garb. Since it was critical to defendant\u2019s theory of the case that the jury believe Smallwood\u2019s testimony, his appearance in court so attired had a tendency to diminish his credibility. <em>Artwell, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 539, 832 A.2d 295; <em>King, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 363, 915 A.2d 587. These additional circumstances provide further support for the prejudicial impact generated by the prosecutor\u2019s improper opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We are satisfied that the first prong of the <em>Strickland/Fritz </em>test was met because trial counsel failed to object when he had an obligation to object to the prosecutor\u2019s opening and because appellate counsel failed to raise this meritorious issue on appeal. And we are convinced that the second prong of the test of ineffectiveness is present as well. The jury heard about the danger the prosecutor believed was posed by defendant\u2019s presence without a discouraging word from defense counsel or the trial judge. Counsel\u2019s failure to object or to seek a cautionary instruction from the trial judge, which would no doubt have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>forthcoming, allowed this improper consideration to brood over the jury\u2019s consideration of the issues posed and undoubtedly impacted upon the fairness of the trial and the reliability of its outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">As the Court stated in <em>Strickland, </em>\u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a fair result.\u201d 466 <em>U.S. </em>at 686, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 692-93. The Supreme Court held that a PCR applicant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d; it defined \u201creasonable probability\u201d as \u201ca probability sufficient <em>to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. </em>at 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698 (emphasis added). We conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to seek relief in the trial court regarding the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments about the danger defendant posed, and the failure of appellate counsel to pursue the matter on direct appeal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> undermines confidence in the result and deprived defendant of the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Our Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized, as recently as last month, that even when \u201can individual error or series of errors does not rise to reversible error, when considered in combination, their cumulative effect can cast sufficient doubt on a verdict to require reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Jenewicz, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>440, 473, 940 A.2d 269 (2008). <em>See also State v. Koskovich, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>448, 540, 776 A.2d 144 (2001); <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>125, 129, 106 A.2d 541 (1954). We find that the omissions of counsel diminished defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>dant\u2019s theory of the case and cast doubt over the reliability of the outcome achieved in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u201cOur obligation is to ensure that defendant had a fair trial.\u201d <em>Jenewicz, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 473, 940 A.2d 269. That admonition applies whether we review a matter on direct appeal or by way of an appeal from the disposition of a PCR petition. As Justice Jacobs said in <em>Orecchio, </em>\u201c[t]he sound administration of criminal justice in our democracy requires that both the end and the means be just.\u201d 16 <em>N.J. </em>at 129, 106 A.2d 541. Thus, \u201cno matter how abhorrent the offense charged nor how seemingly evident the guilt\u201d an accused is entitled to a fair trial \u201csurrounded by the substantive and procedural safeguards which have stood for centuries as bulwarks of liberty.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThis, of course, does not mean that the incidental legal errors, which creep into the trial but do not prejudice the rights of the accused or make the proceedings unfair, may be invoked to upset an otherwise valid conviction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But, where \u201cthe legal errors are of such magnitude as to prejudice the defendant\u2019s rights or, in their aggregate have rendered the trial unfair, our fundamental constitutional concepts dictate the granting of a new trial before an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We have already demonstrated that defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was prejudiced by the handling of the alibi testimony and related jury instructions, as well as the absence of an argument regarding the alibi on direct appeal, and, also, by the failure of counsel to object or attack on appeal the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments about the jury\u2019s need for protection in the courtroom. Although we view these issues as independently militating in favor of post-conviction relief, we conclude as well that their confluence, and the fact that Smallwood testified in prison garb and others testified in handcuffs,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> all dovetailed to severely hamstring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>presentation of defendant\u2019s theory of the ease and to unfairly skew the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We also reject the argument that relief should not be accorded defendant because- of other evidence of guilt. In this regard, the Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he quality of counsel\u2019s performance cannot be fairly assessed by focusing on a handful of issues while ignoring the totality of counsel\u2019s performance in the context of the State\u2019s evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Castagna, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>293, 314, 901 A.2d 363 (2006). Here, there was no overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt that might ameliorate the consequences of counsel\u2019s performance. Evidence that suggested defendant\u2019s guilt was based largely on the testimony of witnesses who provided conflicting statements about what occurred. That evidence was by no means overwhelming; indeed, the jury acquitted defendant on some of the serious charges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Ultimately, we resist the invitation to draw any firm conclusions about the weight of the evidence heard by the jury. As Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Black said for the unanimous Court in <em>Weiler v. United States, </em>323 <em>U.S. </em>606, 611, 65 <em>S.Ct. </em>548, 551, 89 <em>L.Ed. </em>495, 499 (1945), \u201c|w]e are not authorized to look at the printed record, resolve conflicting evidence, and reach the conclusion that the error was harmless because we think the defendant was guilty\u201d because \u201c[tjhat would be to substitute our judgment for that of the jury and, under our system of justice, juries alone have been entrusted with that responsibility.\u201d After canvassing the record, we find ourselves incapable of stating with any confidence whether defendant is guilty of the offenses charged; instead, we are capable of holding only that: counsel failed to fully elicit Smallwood\u2019s alibi testimony and failed to pursue the matter on appeal; that counsel failed to object or pursue on appeal the prosecutor\u2019s improper opening statement; and that viewed separately or collectively these failures and omissions, viewed in the context of other relevant circumstances,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> deprived defendant of his constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial. Had Small-wood\u2019s testimony been more clearly elicited and had the alibi instruction been given, the jury may have more favorably viewed defendant\u2019s argument that he was not involved in the shooting. Since we were not present when the witnesses testified, and can only appreciate what the jury saw and heard by reference to a cold transcript, we cannot otherwise gauge the impact of counsel\u2019s errors. But we may confidently conclude that counsel\u2019s omissions had a reasonable probability of affecting the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The order denying post-conviction relief is reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\"> <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> The opinion disposed not only of defendant's appeal, but also co-defendant Brown's appeal.

For example, an alibi instruction would not be necessary when the defendant entered into a conspiracy to commit a crime that was physically performed by others. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Agofsky, </em>20 F.3d 866, 871-72 (8th Cir.1994). This is not the circumstance here. With the exception of the conspiracy charge, as to which defendant was acquitted, defendant\u2019s actual presence and participation in the conduct that generated Powell\u2019s death was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> Had counsel's failure to serve the notice of alibi led the judge to refuse to give an alibi instruction, then we would have to adjudge the ineffective assistance of counsel argument by considering whether the failure to serve the notice fell below the professional standards imposed by the Sixth Amendment. But we interpret the judge\u2019s holdings during the trial, as amplified by his PCR decision, that his ruling was based on his conclusion that defendant's evidence did not support the claim of an alibi and not because of the failure to serve a notice of alibi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> \u201c[Defendants] as part of their general denial of guilt contend that the State has not presented sufficient reliable evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that they are the persons who committed the alleged offense. Where the identity of the person who committed the crime is in issue, the burden of proving that identity is upon the State. The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendants] are the persons who committed the crime. The defendants have neither the burden nor the duty to show that the crime, if committed, was committed by someone else or to prove the identity of that other person. You must decide, therefore, not only whether the State has proven each and every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt, but also that they are the persons who committed it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\"> \u201cThe defendant as a part of [his] denial of guilt contends that [he] was not present at the time and place that the crime was allegedly committed, but was somewhere else and therefore could not possibly have committed or participated in the crime. Where a person must be present at the scene of the crime to commit it, the burden of proving the defendant's presence beyond a reasonable doubt is upon the State. The defendant has neither the burden nor the duty to show that [he] was elsewhere at the time and so could not have committed the offense. You must determine, therefore, whether the State has proved each and every element of the offense charged, including that of the defendant's presence at the scene of the crime and [his] participation in it.\u201d <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cAlibi\u201d (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> In urging a different result, the State relies upon <em>State v. Edge, </em>57 <em>N.J. 580, </em>591, 274 A.2d 42 (1971). Although there the Court concluded that the absence of an alibi instruction was not reversible error, it also held that \"it would have been wiser for the trial judge to have honored the request.\" Moreover, the Court made no attempt in <em>Edge </em>to announce a rule to be applied in all cases, or to overrule the rule of law established in earlier cases, such as <em>Driver, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 290-91, 183 A.2d 655, <em>State v. Tanzarello, </em>1 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>375, 376 (Sup.Ct.1923), and <em>State v. De Geralmo, </em>83 <em>N.J.L. </em>135, 137, 83 A. 643 (Sup.Ct.1912), which we discussed in the text above. Accordingly, we see no reason to conclude that the Court\u2019s comments regarding the specific jury charge in <em>Edge </em>should bind our consideration of the charge in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\"> We observe that defendant's trial counsel attempted to object earlier in the prosecutor's opening but was instructed that he could not then be heard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>THE PROSECUTOR: Witnesses start saying it didn\u2019t happen. Terrence Echols gives that statement to get himself out of trouble, get himself out of jail and witnesses start saying it didn\u2019t happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Q\">[DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL]: Judge, may I be heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">THE COURT: No, continue on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsJ\">This exchange suggests that the judge was forbidding any interruptions of the opening statements, which may have justified defense counsel's failure to interrupt later in the opening when the prosecutor made the statements now in question. To that degree, we cannot entirely fault trial counsel for failing to again interrupt the prosecutor\u2019s opening, although we note that when the prosecutor had concluded defense counsel did not then present any objections or ask to be heard on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> Appellate counsel did argue to no avail in the direct appeal that prosecutorial misconduct had occurred because, in his summation, the prosecutor asserted that defendants did \u201ceverything they could to prevent witnesses from testifying.\" The focus in the PCR and now, however, is not on that discrete point, which we rejected on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> We previously indicated that defendant\u2019s argument regarding handcuffed and prison-garbed witnesses cannot constitute a basis for relief because the legal support for that argument was rendered after this case was tried. We do not now suggest otherwise, but instead find that this is a factor relevant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>consideration of whether other errors had a prejudicial impact on defendant's right to a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> It is of passing interest that a polygraph examination, which was conducted by the police, indicated that defendant was truthful in denying involvement in the shooting of Powell. This evidence, however, was not admissible. The record reveals that Lieutenant Alamo provided defendant with a form indicating his waiver of his right not to take a polygraph exam and other <em>Miranda </em>rights. Even though unrepresented by counsel, defendant signed the waiver form. At the PCR hearing, defendant and Lieutenant Alamo provided contradictory versions of what was discussed. Lieutenant Alamo testified that he told defendant he \"would either be an expert witness for him or against him, depending on the outcome of the examination ... [i]f it goes to court.\" On the other hand, defendant testified that he believed from their conversation that the polygraph's results would be admitted at trial. In Point VI of this appeal, defendant argues that there was an oral stipulation and that counsel should have argued on appeal that the results of the polygraph were admissible, as his counsel had argued at trial. Because the trial judge found from this competing testimony during the PCR hearing that no agreement about the use of this evidence at trial was ever reached, <em>see State v. McDavitt, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>36, 46, 297 A.2d 849 (1972), we find no substance in the current argument that appellate counsel was ineffective in the constitutional sense in failing to pursue the matter on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> We are also mindful that although we affirmed the conviction on direct appeal, we found, as revealed by our lengthy opinion, other trial errors, which would also have some bearing on any assessment of the impact on the outcome caused by appellate counsel's performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
