Lowden, Jr. Both men were employed by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (the Authority) and Lowden also served as first vice-president of the New Jersey Turnpike Employees Union Local 194 (the Union). On the date of the accident, Lowden was on \u201cunion release time,\u201d had spent a majority of the day in the Union\u2019s East Brunswick office, and was proceeding to the Authority\u2019s southern division maintenance yard in Moorestown. Petitioner meanwhile had completed working the day shift at that facility and was going home in his ear. At approximately 4:30 p.m., or shortly thereafter, the parties\u2019 vehicles collided on a bridge on an access road near the maintenance facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">On November 7, 2002, petitioner filed a Law Division complaint against Lowden asserting general claims of negligence in the operation of his vehicle and seeking damages. Lowden answered the complaint and asserted the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 as an affirmative defense to the tort action, claiming both he and petitioner were in the course of their employment at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">On April 27, 2003, petitioner also filed a claim petition against the Authority in the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation (the Division). Subsequently, Lowden successfully moved to intervene in that action. The Authority intervened in the Law Division suit and subsequently successfully moved to stay that litigation and transfer the matter to the Division. The Law Division judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>order of August 9, 2005, provided for the transfer of \u201cjurisdiction to [the Division],\u201d \u201cto determine the application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8,\u201d to determine \u201cwhether [petitioner\u2019s] motor vehicle accident ... was compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,\u201d and to determine \u201cwhether ... Lowden was a co-employee under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On January 31, 2006, and April 3, 2006, the compensation judge conducted a trial limited to the issues of compensability under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 and the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. In a written opinion dated October 26, 2006, he determined that neither petitioner nor Lowden were in the course of their employment at the time of the accident, that therefore <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 did not apply, and that petitioner\u2019s accident was not compensable. In an order dated November 17, 2006, the judge dismissed the claim petition and relinquished jurisdiction of the tort action to the Law Division. Lowden then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Lowden argues that the workers\u2019 compensation judge erred in determining that petitioner was not in the course of his employment at the time of the accident \u201cbecause ... when the accident occurred [petitioner] was still at the [Authority\u2019s] place of employment within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s (sic) compensation act.\u201d Lowden further contends that the compensation judge erred in determining that he was not in the course of his employment when the accident occurred because the \u201caccident occurred at the employer\u2019s place of employment,\u201d he was there to \u201cpick up his paycheck,\u201d or, alternatively, he was \u201cengaged in union business sanctioned by and approved by his employer\u201d at the time. We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">As a general rule, our review of an administrative agency\u2019s fact-finding determinations is limited in scope. <em>Lombardo v.

BASF Corp., </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 340, 702 A.2d 519 (App.Div.1997). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>is particularly applicable to appeals involving determinations and orders made by a workers\u2019 compensation judge. <em>Close v.

Only where the findings are not supported by the record may an appellate court \u201cappraise the record as if [it] were deciding the matter at inception and make [its] own findings and conclusions.\u201d <em>Pioneer Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co. v. Lucas, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 338, 382 A.2d 933 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>320, 394 A.2d 360 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The testimony at trial revealed that the accident took place on an overpass located above the travel lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike on an access road that led to and from the Authority\u2019s maintenance yard, part of a complex the Authority shared with the New Jersey State Police. The Authority\u2019s maintenance yard is comprised of administrative buildings, garages, and a fuel pump and its employees park their vehicles in a designated parking area of the complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The State Police have barracks on the site and they investigated the accident and filed a report. That portion of the complex dedicated to use by the State Police is clearly delineated and the police employees have their own dedicated parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Access to the complex is possible through four separate points, including one off a public road. While the access roads and ramps do not have barriers preventing public access, posted signs located at the overpass and ramps indicate the roadways are for official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>use only. However, petitioner testified that he had personal knowledge that members of the general public use the overpass.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The Authority\u2019s assistant traffic engineer and acting director of its Operations Department, Solomon Caviness, testified that the overpass was used by service type vehicles, such as UPS, by the State Police, and by the Authority\u2019s employees as a means of ingress and egress to the complex. He acknowledged that this employee practice was not prohibited or discouraged by the Authority. Caviness testified that petitioner had traveled \u201csome distance\u201d from the site of the Authority\u2019s portion of the complex before impacting Lowden\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Petitioner was employed in the Authority\u2019s maintenance department and performed traffic protection work such as roadway closures, debris cleanup, and grass cutting. On the day of the accident, he reported for work at 8:00 a.m. and worked his usual shift until 4:30 p.m. After punching out, he proceeded to his car, spoke to a co-employee in the designated parking area for a few minutes, and drove out of the complex and onto the access overpass. He was going home.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Lowden was employed as a toll technician and normally worked out of the Authority\u2019s southern division. He was released from his toll technician duties on those days he performed union activities. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Authority, \u201cunion release time\u201d was considered as an \u201cexcused absence with pay.\u201d The typical hours for release time was from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., though Lowden testified that he would sometimes end his union duties before 5:00 p.m. On the day of the accident, Lowden began his union release time at 9:00 a.m. and worked out of the Union\u2019s offices in East Brunswick, New Jersey. He left at 3:30 p.m. to go to the southern division maintenance complex for three reasons: 1) to pick up his paycheck as it was payday; 2) to see petitioner about becoming a full-time union member; and 3) to engage in general union politicking with other employees. Lowden drove to the maintenance yard utilizing the southbound lanes of the Turnpike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and used an employee courtesy pass so that he did not have to pay the toll. Franceline Ehret, president of the Union at the time of the accident, testified that she specifically asked Lowden to provide petitioner with a union membership application on the day of the accident. Donna Boda, secretary of the Union, testified that when she learned of Lowden\u2019s intention to travel to the maintenance yard, she personally gave him an application for petitioner to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">However, Lowden acknowledged that if he was unable to meet with petitioner that day, he otherwise intended to seek him out on Monday. Thus, the meeting with petitioner was not an urgent necessity. Neither Lowden, nor Boda, nor Ehret called to notify petitioner of the Union\u2019s intention to have anyone meet with him on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The time of the accident was disputed at trial. Although the police report listed it as 4:30 p.m., petitioner testified that he left the Authority\u2019s administration building and headed to his vehicle when the 4:30 p.m. buzzer sounded signaling the end of the day shift. He testified that he started out of the parking lot between approximately 4:35 and 4:40 p.m. Petitioner drove over the overpass with the intent of accessing the southbound Turnpike lanes and collided with Lowden, who was driving the wrong way in petitioner\u2019s lane of travel, at the end of the overpass. Lowden testified the accident occurred at approximately 4:20 p.m., or approximately forty-five minutes after he left East Brunswick.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The compensation judge resolved these various factual disputes in the following fashion. He determined that the accident occurred \u201cbetween 4:45 [p.m.] and 5:00 [p.m.]\u201d based upon petitioner\u2019s testimony that he \u201cpunched out at 4:30,\u201d then walked to the parking lot, spoke to some co-workers, and drove off. The judge also determined that Lowden\u2019s \u201csole purpose\u201d in traveling to the maintenance yard \u201cwas to pick up his pay check.\u201d He concluded that Lowden\u2019s explanation that the travel was also related to union business \u201cd[id] not ring true.\u201d The judge reasoned that if indeed that was the purpose for Lowden\u2019s trip to the complex, \u201cit would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>be logical to arrive before the end of the shift to insure seeing [petitioner] as he came off duty or at least call to advise [petitioner] that he wished to see him at the end of his shift.\u201d The judge determined that Ehret\u2019s and Boda\u2019s testimony \u201cappeared scripted to benefit [ ] Lowden and [was] not believable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The judge also reasoned that Lowden\u2019s use of the turnpike to go from East Brunswick to Moorestown was based upon \u201cconvenience and not for the benefit of the employer, [the Authority].\u201d Thus, while Lowden was in the course of his employment while on union release time, his travel to and from the sites \u201cmust be treated in the same manner as if he was going to or coming from a regular shift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that all of these factual determinations made by the workers\u2019 compensation judge were supported by substantial credible evidence in the record \u201cand [were] not so wide <em>off the mark </em>as to be manifestly mistaken.\u201d <em>Tlumac v. High Bridge Stone, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>567, 573, 902 A.2d 222 (2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 through -142 (the Act), an employee is entitled to recover for injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1; <em>Jumpp v. City of Ventnor, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>470, 476, 828 A.2d 905 (2003). The \u201carising out of\u2019 portion of the statute refers to the causal origin of the accident, and the \u2018\u201ccourse of employment\u2019 portion refers to the time, place, and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment.\u201d <em>Valdez v. Tri-State Furniture, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223, 232, 863 A.2d 1123 (App.Div.2005). To prove compensability under the Act, a petitioner must establish that the accident arose out of his employment by demonstrating a causal connection between the employment and the accident. <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 290, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986); <em>Stroka v. United Airlines, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 339, 835 A.2d 1247 (App.Div.2003), <em>certif. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>313, <em>845 </em>A.2d 138 (2004). Second, he must also show a time and place nexus between the employment and the accident to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the injury occurred in the course of employment. <em>Stroka, supra, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 339, 835 A.2d 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Because of the Act\u2019s definition of employment, \u201c[t]he line between compensability and noneompensability ... is very strict.\u201d <em>Cressey v. Campus Chefs, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 344, 498 A.2d 1274 (App.Div.1985). Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36, employment commences \u201cwhen an employee arrives at the employer\u2019s place of employment to report for work and shall terminate when the employee leaves the employer\u2019s place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Commonly referred to as the premises rule, this provision distinguishes between accidents that occur on the employer\u2019s premises from those that do not. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 591, 713 A.2d 486. Thus, an employee may be found to have been in the course of employment and entitled to compensation even when he was not currently engaged in work duties, <em>if </em>the accident occurred on the employer\u2019s premises. <em>Valdez, supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 232-33, 863 A.2d 1123 (noting that New Jersey takes a \u201cflexible\u201d approach in resolving \u201cin the course of employment\u201d issues and that an employee need not actually be working in order to meet this test). That the injured employee may have been \u201coff the clock\u201d does not automatically preclude compensability because the situs of the accident is a dispositive factor. <em>Ibid.; Brower v. ICT Group, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>367, 372, 753 A.2d 1045 (2000); <em>see also Kristiansen v. Morgan, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>298, 317, 708 A.2d 1173 (1998), <em>modified, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>681, 730 A.2d 1289 (1999) (holding \u201can employee who punches out on the time clock at the [employer\u2019s] front entrance and is injured while walking through the plant to reach his or her car parked in a rear parking lot\u201d sustains a compensable accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Generally, however, absent one of the statutory exceptions not at issue in this ease, an employee who is not physically on the employer\u2019s premises is not in the course of the employment. <em>Kristiansen, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 316, 708 A.2d 1173. \u201cThe pivotal questions under the premises rule are (1) where was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>situs of the accident, and (2) did the employer have control of the property on which the accident occurred?\u201d <em>Zahner v. Pathmark Stores, Inc., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 478, 729 A.2d 478, (App.Div.1999). <em>Kristiansen, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 316-17, 708 A.2d 1173; <em>Cannuscio v. Claridge Hotel and Casino, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 350, 725 A.2d 135 (App.Div.1999). For purposes of the Act, control exists \u201cwhen the employer owns, maintains, or has exclusive use of the property.\u201d <em>Kristiansen, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 316-17, 708 A.2d 1173; <em>see Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>89, 104, 543 A.2d 45 (1988)(holding that these factors, while not dispositive, are indicative of whether employer control is present).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Defendant argues that since the overpass where the accident occurred is owned and maintained by the Authority, the compensation judge erred in determining both petitioner and Lowden were no longer \u201cin the course of [their] employment\u201d at the time of the accident. He argues that this case presents a situation similar to that presented by the petitioner in <em>Ramos, </em>who was injured in an elevator shaft that, although accessible to others, was regularly used by his employer. Here, Lowden argues that even though the access overpass was also accessible to others such as deliverymen and the State Police, the Authority specifically permitted its employees to use the overpass in going and coming to the complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">However, in concluding petitioner was not in the course of his employment, the compensation judge noted petitioner had left the Authority\u2019s portion of the complex and the employee parking area. He also noted that the access road was only one of several means of ingress and egress to the maintenance yard, including one point of access that adjoined a public road. The judge determined that the Authority \u201cneither encouraged nor discouraged the use of the roadway\u201d leading to the access overpass where the accident occurred. He concluded that \u201conce [petitioner] left the designated parking [area] it became part of his normal commute,\u201d and the accident did not occur on the employer\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>We would generally agree with this analysis. First, control of the overpass cannot be based upon the Authority\u2019s exclusive use of the property since it was in fact utilized by not only defendant\u2019s employees, but by the State Police, various business invitees, and the general public. Furthermore, as the compensation judge noted, to conclude the Authority \u201ccontrolled\u201d the overpass because it owned and maintained it would essentially abrogate the premises rule because the Authority owns and maintains the entire New Jersey turnpike system. Clearly, the mere fact that an Authority employee was involved in an accident on a road owned and maintained by the Authority cannot serve as a sufficient basis to conclude the accident occurred in the course of petitioner\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We conclude, as did the compensation judge, that the facts at hand are much closer to those presented in our decisions in <em>N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>116, 560 A.2d 117 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>178, 570 A.2d 948 (1989) and <em>Manole v. Carvellas, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 550 A.2d 1278 (App.Div.1988), than to those presented in <em>Ramos. </em>In <em>N.J. Mfrs., </em>we concluded that a petitioner injured in an auto accident while driving to work on a road owned by his employer, maintained by a third-party, patrolled by the local police, and used on occasion by the public, 234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 117, 560 A.2d 117, was not injured at a place \u201cunder the control of his employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 560 A.2d 117 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36). Although we took note that the distance between the plant where the petitioner worked and the site of the accident was two miles, we also observed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASj\">[T]here is no indication that [petitioner] was exposed to any added hazard, created to enhance the business interests of [defendant], while traveling on the access road. The risk from driving on this roadway was no different than the risk from driving on any public roadway. And although [defendant] owned the roadway, there is no indication that it exercised any control over its use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 119, 560 A.2d 117.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Although in this case it would appear the distance between the site of the accident and the Authority\u2019s employee parking area was less than two miles, in all other respects, the facts of this case bear striking similarity to those set forth above. Petitioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>free to leave the complex, and Lowden was free to access the complex in any number of ways. The Authority did not dictate the particular method either man chose and the risk occasioned by the use of the overpass both decided to employ was \u201cno different than the risk from driving on any public roadway.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Man\u00f3le, </em>the defendant, arriving for the start of his work shift, drove his car to a designated parking area along a private road inside the shopping mall where he was employed. The plaintiff, employed by the same department store and leaving for the day, was a passenger in a van supplied by her employer to shuttle employees from the store to the designated parking area about one mile away. The vehicles collided and the plaintiff was injured. Although we determined \u201cthere [was] no question that at the time of the accident plaintiff had not yet left her employer\u2019s premises,\u201d we nonetheless concluded \u201cthat it [was] not her status ... which [was] critical but rather that of [defendant]. If he was not yet within the scope of his employment when the vehicles collided, the fact that he was [a co-employee of plaintiff] would be a mere coincidence without legal significance____\u201d <em>Manole, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 142-43, 550 A.2d 1278. We determined the defendant was in fact \u201ca half mile away from the designated lot,\u201d \u201cin the process of leaving a public street and entering a service road, which itself was not within [his employer\u2019s] \u2018control,\u2019 \u201d when the collision occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 550 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Thus, assuming arguendo that petitioner\u2019s status as an employee of the Authority continued as he left the complex and utilized the overpass, we are convinced that the compensation judge correctly determined Lowden was not petitioner\u2019s \u201cfellow servant\u201d at the time of the accident, and therefore the Law Division action was not barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">That portion of the Act provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">If an injury ... is compensable under this article, a person shall not be liable to anyone at common law or otherwise on account of such injury or death for any act or omission occurring while such person was in the same employ as the person injured or killed, except for intentional wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The statute is only applicable, however, if the two-prong test of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 is satisfied as to both employees. <em>Mule v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>389, 394, 812 A.2d 1128 (App.Div.2003). The compensation judge determined Lowden was returning to the maintenance complex for the sole purpose of picking up his paycheck. Even if this conduct was considered to have arisen from his employment, it is clear that he was not yet in the scope of his employment, having just turned off the access road and unto the overpass. In short, Lowden chose to return to Moorestown from East Brunswick even though he was not required to do so by his employer. Having left the union offices, he was no longer in the course of his employment as he drove south on the Turnpike.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Thereafter, he chose the manner and method by which to proceed, and he decided to access the maintenance complex in a manner not required by his employer, utilizing an overpass that presented only one of several ways to enter the actual premises. Under these peculiar facts, which are similar to those presented in <em>Man\u00f3le, </em>Lowden was not in the scope of his employment as he drove over the overpass and collided with petitioner\u2019s vehicle. Therefore, the bar contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
