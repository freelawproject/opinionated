We conclude that, in the circumstances presented, the Director mistakenly failed to immediately discontinue the license holders\u2019 unlawful conduct and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Certain facts are undisputed. In 2005, the Township Committee of the Township of Middletown, acting as the local Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (Middletown), considered applications for the annual renewal of three liquor licenses: 1331-32-005-003 and 1331-44-033-006, which were held by Circus Liquors, Inc. (Circus), and 1331-44-028-005, which was held by Food Circus Supermarkets of Middletown, Inc. (Food Circus). The stockholders of Circus and Food Circus were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31 prohibits any person from \u201cacquir[ing] a beneficial interest in more than a total of two alcoholic beverage retail licenses.\u201d Notwithstanding that ownership by Circus and Food Circus of the three liquor licenses violated this statutory prohibition, Middletown renewed all three licenses from 1998, the time of Circus\u2019s acquisition of 1331-44-033-006 (the third license), through 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">As a result, Circus filed a verified petition seeking relief from the Director. Acknowledging that it and Food Circus could not lawfully own the three liquor licenses simultaneously, Circus nevertheless sought a stay of the denial of renewal in order to allow the third license to be transferred to some other unrelated person. The matter was transferred to the Office of Administrative Law and assigned to an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The ALJ observed that the facts he deemed relevant were not in dispute and granted Middletown\u2019s motion for a summary decision. He concluded that Circus had no right to the third license, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>and that the estoppel theory offered as a means of alleviating the consequences of that illegality was without merit. In rejecting this equitable estoppel theory, the AL J correctly recognized that a party seeking its application is required to show that it has relied \u201cwith good reason and in good faith\u201d on the other\u2019s conduct. <em>Summer Cottagers Assoc. v. City of Cape May, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>498, 503-04, 117 A.2d 585 (1955). The ALJ concluded that there could be no reasonable reliance upon the prior renewals of the third license because there could be no reasonable expectation that Middletown would continue to permit this violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31, regardless of the allegation that Middletown had apparently overlooked, or chosen not to observe, repeated violations of this statute since 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Exceptions were filed, and the Director issued a written decision on November 21, 2006, in which he agreed with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">The renewal of the license here at issue, as requested at the time by [Circus], would have facilitated the violation of State law. The decision of the local licensing body to deny renewal in the face of such facts cannot be considered arbitrary or unreasonable or by any stretch of the imagination an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We agree with this analysis as well. Although inexplicably slow to realize or acknowledge the continuing breach of the statutory prohibition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Middletown\u2019s denial of the application for renewal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the third license was mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31, as the Director correctly held. <em>See Grand Union Co. v. Sills, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>390, 404, 204 A.2d 853 (1964) (holding the two-license limitation constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The Director also rejected Circus\u2019s estoppel theory, correctly holding that equitable estoppel may be invoked against a governmental entity but only in exceptional circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">Courts are generally reluctant to apply estoppel theories against governmental agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">As the court said in <em>Keenan v. Essex Cty. Freeholders Bd., </em>106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 316, 255 A.2d 786 (App.Div.1969), \u201c[a] governmental body cannot ordinarily be estopped by prior acts that were in violation of law.\u201d Where the act in question is utterly beyond the jurisdiction of a public entity and is ultra vires, the doctrine of estoppel in the interest of equity and essential justice has no direct application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7a\"><em>[Cipriano v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 91, 376 A.2d 571 (App.Div.1977) (some citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">This approach has remained unchanged. <em>See Middletown Twp. Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Assoc. v. Twp. of Middletown, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>361, 367-68, 744 A.2d 649 (2000). Circus could not, with reason and in good faith, assume that Middletown would continue to permit the unlawful renewals of the third license. <em>See, e.g., In re Estate of Shinn, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 69-70, 925 A.2d 88 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>595, 934 A.2d 637 (2007). The Director\u2019s holding in this regard was legally sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Based upon those determinations, the Director concluded there was no lawful impediment to Middletown\u2019s denial of Circus\u2019s application to renew the third license. The Director, however, found it appropriate to \u201cfacilitate an orderly transition for both the municipality and the licensee while still ensuring compliance with Title 33____\u201d As a result, he ordered a stay of the denial of renewal to permit Circus \u201cto fully divest itself of any and all legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>and beneficial interest in the license by selling the license to an unrelated bona fide third party in an appropriate arms-length transaction.\u201d The Director also ordered that, during the stay period, the third license would be \u201cindefinitely suspended\u201d and barred its use by Circus. In support of his authority to issue such a remedy, the Director relied exclusively on an unpublished opinion issued by this court in 1981,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on Bulletin 2478, which the Director issued in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Director\u2019s stay of the denial of renewal lies at the heart of this appeal. Circus and the Attorney General contend that we should defer to the Director\u2019s decision to craft such a remedy; Middletown argues that any delay in the operative effect of non-renewal perpetuates the license holders\u2019 continued violation of N.J.S.A. 33:1-12.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">We agree with Middletown that the Director\u2019s delay of non-renewal is not consistent with the purposes of Title 33 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>cannot stand. <em>See Grand Union Co., supra, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>at 402-04, 204 A.2d 853 (explaining at length the history behind and the rationale underlying the two-license limitation). By issuing this relief, the Director mistakenly created a circumstance by which the license holders here could continue to profit from their unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In support of his determination to provide Circus with the opportunity to sell the third license, the Director relied upon the Legislature\u2019s expression of a liberal intent and its declaration that Title 33 is remedial in nature. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-73. However, the Legislature there declared that Title 33 was intended to be <em>\u201cremedial of abuses </em>inherent in liquor traffic\u201d and, in <em>that </em>regard, should its further statement that Title 33 \u201cshall be liberally construed\u201d be understood. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). One of those abuses referred to in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-73 is ownership of more than two liquor licenses, as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31 makes abundantly clear. <em>See Grand Union, supra, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>at 402-04, 204 A.2d 853. Although we need not presently question the Director\u2019s authority to briefly permit ownership of a third license in the circumstances described in the Director\u2019s 1998 bulletin, invocation here of the liberality described in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-73 mistakenly formed the basis for a perpetuation of the very abuse that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31 was intended to preclude. A seven-year ownership of a third license is not a mere technical violation, but rather, a long-term, persistent violation of one of the chief evils the Legislature intended to prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In asserting his power to permit ownership of more than two liquor licenses, the Director referred to Bulletin 2478 and indicated it was permissible for a person to obtain a third liquor license so long as it was acquired to replace one of his or her other two licenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If Bulletin 2478 correctly describes an instance in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the Director may permit brief ownership of a third license \u2014 a question we need not decide \u2014 that power was inapplicable here. Circus obtained the third license apparently without declaring an intent to transfer one of its other licenses, which would then be replaced by the third. Instead, the license holders here retained all three licenses for seven years and sought to continue to perpetuate this situation when renewal was finally denied in 2005. We conclude that the license holders were not in technical violation, as was the license holder in Bulletin 2478, but were, instead, engaged in a stark and lengthy violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31. Because the remedy crafted by the Director serves no purpose other than to allow the license holders here to profit irom their admitted wrongful conduct, we reverse that part of his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We turn to one final matter that we sua sponte raised after hearing oral argument. The Director suggested in his final decision that both Middletown and Circus acted wrongfully with regard to the third license when he stated that \u201cthe municipality did not have the statutory authority to grant a license in violation of N.J.S.A 33:1-12.31, nor did the licensee have the right to accept a third license under these conditions.\u201d That Middletown could reap a benefit from this asserted wrongful conduct was suggested by the Attorney General\u2019s belief as to what might follow if the Director\u2019s decision to delay non-renewal and permit Circus the opportunity to transfer the third license is not upheld:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>If the license is not renewed, <em>Middletown mil be able to issue and sell a new license to the highest bidder, </em>because Middletown is below the population cap on retail distribution licenses. It appears that Middletown intends to take such action, since it has never asserted that it has too many licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In light of this contention about the pecuniary benefit Middletown may obtain from a favorable ruling, we asked the parties to provide supplemental briefs addressing whether we should \u201cremand the matter to the Director to determine whether Middle-town was eomplicit and, if so, [whether] the Director [could] also sanction or discipline Middletown in some manner for its alleged conduct in permitting the alleged violation of the two license limitation contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31.\u201d In its supplemental brief, the Attorney General bluntly acknowledged that Title 33 does not imbue the Director with \u201cthe authority to sanction or discipline a municipality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We have long deferred to the Director\u2019s expertise in his vindication of Title 33\u2019s requirements and limitations on the liquor industry. <em>See Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Maynards, Inc., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>158, 183-84, 927 A.2d 525 (2007); <em>R &amp; R Marketing, L.L.C. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>170, 175-76, 729 A.2d 1 (1999). We have also held that \u201c[although an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers is not binding upon us, the agency\u2019s interpretation is entitled to \u2018substantial deference\u2019 \u2018provided it is not plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. State, Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 216-17, 915 A.2d 48 (App.Div.2007). On its face, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-3 broadly empowers the Director to enforce Title 33 but it is silent on the issue we have posed and, in light of the Director\u2019s concession as to the limits of his authority, which has not been persuasively challenged by Circus,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we need not further consider whether the Director is authorized to sanction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>or impose limits on a municipality that may have been complicit in a license holder\u2019s violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, we will presently defer to the Director\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">To summarize, we affirm the Director\u2019s determination insofar as it concluded that Circus held a third liquor license in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31 and insofar as it rejected the estoppel theory offered as a basis for continued ownership of the third license, or in mitigation. However, we reverse that part of the final agency decision that permitted a delay of non-renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> Circus argues in its appeal brief that Middletown permitted the unlawful renewal of all three licenses from 1998 through 2004 for political reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">[T]he governing body (acting on the advice of its attorney, Bernard M. Reilly, Esq.) expressly approved each license in the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">Middletown claims that it \"discovered\" the violation in June 2005. Actually, Middletown's \"discovery\" resulted from a political falling-out. Joseph Azzolina, a principal in Circus, was a member o\u00ed the New Jersey General Assembly; at or about the time of this license renewal, he publicly opposed the reappointment of William F. Dowd (Mr. Reilly's law partner), as county Republican chairman. During the period when Azzolina and Dowd were political allies, the Township assured Circus that its license applications were in proper form. Once Dowd was ousted from his political post, Reilly renounced his earlier advice, and prepared the Township Committee's harsh resolution denying the license renewal. Thus, although cloaked in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>rubric of the \"public interest,\" the Township Committee has used that argument to mask its actual motivation, a petty, partisan feud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGM\">These allegations are not in the record other than through the argument of counsel. However, Circus never had the opportunity to present this evidence since the ALJ granted Middletown's motion for a summary decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> This unpublished decision contains no information regarding the circumstances that prompted the court\u2019s authorization of a holder\u2019s brief possession of a third liquor license. The entirety of that decision, brief enough to be quoted here, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">A review of the entire record satisfies us that the findings and conclusions of the Director are supported by adequate evidence in the record, and so are hereby sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">In our view, however, the order of the Director mandating the divestiture by [the license holder] of his complete legal and beneficial interest in this license, should be modified by directing that [he] shall fully divest himself of any and all legal and beneficial interest in and to any of the three plenary retail distribution licenses presently held by him, including but not limited to the instant license, within 120 days from the date of this decision (or within such further time as may be granted by the Director); and that upon proof being presented to the Director within said period confirming such divestiture and transfer of one of such licenses (other than the license involved in this proceeding), the suspension of the operation of the license involved in this proceeding shall be terminated forthwith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">As so modified, the determination of the Director is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-12\"><em>[Million Bucks, Inc. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>Docket No. A-2096-80T3 (June 10, 1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:36-3, the Attorney General has advised us that she is not aware of any other relevant or adverse unpublished opinions on this subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> In Bulletin 2478, which was issued on February 5, 1998, the Director considered whether the holder of both a retail consumption license in Old Bridge and a plenary retail consumption license with broad package privilege in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Franklin could at the same time acquire a plenary retail distribution license in Old Bridge to replace the plenary retail consumption license then held in Old Bridge. The Director stated in this bulletin that because the owner \"intendfed] to acquire a type of license more suitable for his business enterprise and to quickly sell the license that it currently holds,\u201d there would be no violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>33:1-12.31 so long as the consumption license in Old Bridge was placed in inactive status once the distribution license was acquired. In addition, the Director then stated in this bulletin that \"to prevent even the appearance of speculating on the acquisition of multiple licenses for profit purposes or stifling competition, the inactive retail consumption license shall be subject to the condition that it must be sold to an unrelated bona fide third party or activated at a qualifying premises within one year of the date of activation of the distribution license.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> In its supplemental brief, Circus acknowledged that \"no statute authorizes a sanction\u201d for Middletown's alleged misconduct, and argued only, without citation, that \"it would be inequitable to reward the municipality, or to allow it to use the vehicle of a liquor license renewal as a sword to punish a political opponent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b257-13\"> Although Circus argues that the facts demonstrate Middletown's complicity, we hasten to add that we are in no position to opine on that question because there has never been an analysis of those allegations at the agency level. Now that the Director has determined there is no available remedy even if Middle-town was complicit, we need not further consider the factual events that resulted in the seven-year renewal of this unlawful liquor license, nor will we remand for the development of those facts by the ALJ or Director despite our concerns about Circus\u2019s allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
