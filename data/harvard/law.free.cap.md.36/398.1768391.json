Por each lot deposited, the appellants received from the Warehouse Company a receipt, warrant or certificate which specified the number of bales, and the date of the deposit, and also the mark on the bales, the letters X. Q. being marked on each bale so deposited. These receipts or certificates were all numbered. On the 20th of June, 1870, the appellants deposited fifteen bales and took a receipt therefor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>numbered 1221, and on the following day a policy of insurance was taken out to cover the particular number of bales thus deposited. On the 27th of June, the appellants deposited thirteen bales, and took a like receipt therefor, numbered 1238, and on the same day effected an insurance for the particular number of bales thus deposited. On the face of each policy the loss, if any, was made payable to the Warehouse Company; and the policies and receipts were delivered to the Warehouse Company, to secure advances made by it. On the policy on the fifteen bales there was endorsed in pencil in figures the number 1221, corresponding with the number of the warehouse receipt given therefor; and on the policy on the thirteen bales there was endorsed also in pencil 1238, corresponding with the number of the receipt for the cotton. At the time of each deposit, the depositor reserved a sample of the particular lot deposited.

The warehouse containing the cotton of II, with that of others, was destroyed by fire. A portion of the cotton was saved and sold at auction by instructioni of a committee of the insurance companies interested. The net proceeds of sale were distributed under the direction of the committee among the assured. In an action by H, to recover on his two policies, it was Held : ,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-7\">That in ascertaining the amount of loss or damage which the plaintiff should recover, the jury ought to deduct such sum as they might find from the evidence was the proportion due to twenty-eight bales, in the distribution of the proceeds of sale of the cotton saved.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-8\">The Baltimore Warehouse Company, which received goods on storage, and issued receipts or certificates therefor to the depositors, effected an insurance in the Associated Fireman\u2019s Company for $10,000, against loss by fire for one year, \u201con merchandize generally, hazardous or extra hazardous, held by them, or in trust, contained\u201d in a particular warehouse ; they also took out a policy in the Home Insurance Company, to the amount of $20,000, \u201c on merchandise, hazardous or extra hazardous, their own, or held by them in trust, or in which they had an interest or liability, \u2019 \u2019 contained in the same warehouse. The appellants, on the 20th of June, 1870, deposited fifteen bales of cotton in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>same warehouse, and received a receipt or certificate therefor from the \u201cWarehouse Company, and on the same day procured a policy of insurance on the cotton so deposited from the appellee. On the 27th of June they deposited thirteen bales, for which a like receipt was given, and on the same day they effected an insurance for the cotton with the appellee. Under the policies issued to the appellants, the loss, if any, was payable to the Baltimore Warehouse Company. The appellants had other cotton to a large amount stored with the Warehouse Company. The Warehouse Company advanced to the appellants over $48,000 upon the cotton belonging to them, and stored in the warehouse. In the policies to the appellants, as well as in those to the Warehouse Company, it was stipulated that in case of loss the assured should not be entitled to recover on such policy any greater proportion of the loss or damage sustained to the subject insured, than the amount thereby insured should bear to the whole amount of the several insurances thereon. On the 18th of July, 1870, the warehouse was burned, and of the cotton stored therein, some of the bales were saved, some wore partially destroyed, and others totally destroyed. In an action by the appellants, for the use of the Warehouse Company, on the policies of insurance issued by the appellee, it was Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-5\">That the policies sued on having been made payable to the Warehouse Company, inured to the benefit of the company, and may be considered as in favor of the same assured, on the samejnterest, in the same subject, and against the same risks as the policies which were issued directly to the Warehouse Company; and with the latter policies constituted a double insurance; and the companies therefore issuing the policies were bound to contribute their respective proportions of the loss.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-6\">A person having goods in his possession as consignee, or on commission, may insure them in his own name, and, in the 'event of loss, recover the full amount of the insurance, and, after satisfying his own claim, hold the balance as trustee for the owner.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-7\">The words <em>\u201cheld in </em>trust,\u201d applied to goods insured, mean goods with which the assured is intrusted; not goods held in trust in the strict technical sense, so hold that there is only an equitable obligation in the assured, enforciblo by <em>subpoena </em>in chancery, but goods with which they are intrusted in the ordinary sense of the word.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b412-8\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Baltimore City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">Two actions of <em>covenant, </em>consolidated by consent, were instituted by tho appellants, Hough, Clendening &amp; Co., for the use of their assignee, the Baltimore Warehouse Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>against the appellees: the first to recover on a policy issued by the appellees, dated the 21st of June, 1870, whereby the company insured Hough, Clendening &amp; Co., during thirty-five days, from the date of the policy, against loss or damage by fire to the amount of $1,400, on fifteen bales of cotton stored in Tobacco Warehouse Ho. 2, O\u2019Donnell\u2019s wharf, then occupied by the Baltimore Warehouse Company; the second to recover on a policy dated the 27th of June, 1870, whereby the appellees insured the appellants in exactly similar words of description, during thirty-four days, to the amount of $1,100 on thirteen bales of cotton.

the business of the plaintiffs was that of cotton factors chiefly; that the cotton sent to them was from a large number of different persons, and in lots of various sizes, from one bale upwards, and was to be sold at a time limited, or at the discretion of the factors, or at such time as should be afterwards directed by the shipper, as the instructions happened to be; that the cotton market was declining in the summer of 1870; that the plaintiffs had six hundred and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>seventy-five bales of cotton in the warehouse described in the policies sued on \u2014 which warehouse was destroyed by fire on July 18th, 1870;'none of it was returned to them after the fire; that Albert Rhett had weighed the cotton, lot by lot, before it was stored; that samples of each lot had been taken out and retained in the office of the plaintiffs; at the time of the fire there was there a sample of each bale that was in the warehouse; that the plaintiffs had, at the time of the fire, insurance on six hundred and seventy-six bales of cotton in this\"warehouse \u2014 one more than the number in store, there; that in each of the policies held by them the insurance was on a specific number of bales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">On cross-examination, the witness said: He spoke from the books of the house, not from his own knowledge, as to the number of bales; he saw the fire and knew that the cotton of the plaintiffs was there; the doss on this was not total; some bales were burned, some saved; how many were saved witness does not know, nor how many absolutely lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">The plaintiffs further proved by William B. Hooper: That he was the storekeeper of the Baltimore Warehouse Company in July, 1870; that this warehouse was burned on the 18th July, 1870; the plaintiffs had therein six hundred and seventy-five bales of cotton; there were in all, 1,452 bales of cotton in the warehouse at the time of the fire; also some tobacco arid b\u00e1rk; the other cotton belonged to different parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">They further proved by Albert Rhett, that he was a public weigher; that he weighed .nearly all Hough, Clendening &amp; Co/s cotton; was under the impression he weighed every bale of their cotton that went into this warehouse; he gave certificates of these weights; identified certificates shown to him as his, from which it appeared that the fifteen bales of the plaintiffs, embraced in the policy of the 21st of June, weighed six thousand two hundred and sixty-one pounds, and the thirteen bales, covered by the policy of the 27th of June, weighed five thousand four hundred and eighty-two pounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The plaintiffs further proved by Charles Rhett, that he was' a cotton-broker in 1870; it was very often part of his business to determine the grade of cotton; was called upon by Hough, Clendening &amp; Co. after this fire; went to their office, examined a number of bundles of samples; there were six hundred and seventy-five samples; his partner, Mr. Smith, assisted him; examined them minutely; graded from \u201c good middling\u201d to \u201clow middling\u201d and \u201cordinary;\u201d made an average of the various bundles; the whole averaged a fail-class of \u201c low- middling \u201d cotton; estimated its value, at the time of the fire, at 18\u00a3 cents per pound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">They proved further by James Hooper, that he was President of \u201cThe Baltimore Warehouse Company;\u201d gave receipts for cotton deposited on storage; for this purpose a printed blank was used \u2014 -the date, subject matter and particular place of deposit, and the name of the depositor being filled in, and the mark inserted in an appropriate place in the margin, in manuscript. In every instance of deposit by the plaintiffs, between the 5th of February, 1870, and the 15th of July, 1870, the <em>mark </em>in the margin of the corresponding certificate was X. Q. The witness produced the receipts given to the plaintiffs for cotton stored, which were put in evidence. The receipt issued to the plaintiffs on each deposit of cotton contained the printed notice that \u201cthe property mentioned therein was held by the corporation as bailees only, and was not insured by the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">They further proved by this witness, that the cotton that w-as saved from the fire was sold at auction, by instruction of a committee of the insurance companies; Hough, Clendening <em>&amp; </em>Co. had insurance on six hundred and seventy-five bales of cotton in this warehouse, to the amount of about $60,000. The -warehouse company had advanced Hough, Clendening <em>&amp; </em>Co., on the whole number of bales, to about $48,720.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">On cross-examination this witness said, the warehouse company did not insure all the cotton in their warehouse; kept $30,000 insurance to cover, in case insurance by the depositors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>was not sufficient; did not insure except where advances had been made. It was the course of business of the warehouse company, on receiving cotton, to give a warehouse receipt, such as those already introduced in evidence; and if advances were asked, one of the conditions of the advance was, that the depositor should insure in the form adopted in the policy sued on, and deliver such policy to the company, together with the warehouse receipt; the insurance to be for an amount sufficient to cover the advance. The defendant proved by this witness, and put in evidence two policies of insurance held by \u201cthe Baltimore Warehouse Company,\u201d and outstanding at the time of the fire, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">1st.

He produced \u00edavo papers containing the results of his adjustment, and said the general policies were divided up into contributing insurances, in the ratio of the sound value of the property covered by specific insurances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>to that covered by general policies; the general insurance should have contributed at the rate of $17.50 per bale to specific insurance. On twenty-eight bales the general insurance would contribute $490; the result would be affected by insurance on the tobacco which was in the warehouse; the salvage is to be credited to the defendant; its proportion of saved cotton \u2014 some $400 \u2014 to be credited. Witness first applied the general insurance to the cotton not insured; amount of this application, $2,183.32.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">On cross-examination the witness said the right of contribution arose from the fact that the Warehouse Company had made advances on lots of cotton covered by the specific policies, and by assignment of specific policies to the Warehouse Company had made the general insurance contributory; if there were cotton there not advanced on, it was not included in the assignment; $8,536.71 were allowed to Hough, Clendening &amp; Co. for difference of insurance, to cover one hundred and nine bales not considered as specifically insured. There was cotton not covered, but no claim was made by any company or person. If general policies contribute to pay Warehouse Company\u2019s advances, they would be entitled, in witness\u2019 view, to subrogation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">The plaintiffs thereupon submitted to the Court the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">1. If the jury shall find that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then, in ascertaining the amount which the plaintiffs are to recover, the jury are not to make any abatement therefrom on account of the two policies of insurance issued by \u201cThe Home Insurance Company\u201d and \u201cThe Associated Eiremen\u2019s Insurance Company\u201d to the Baltimore'Warehouse Company, and offered in evidence by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\">2. That by the true construction of the policy of insurance isssued by the defendant to the plaintiffs, bearing date the 27th of June, 1870, and offered in evidence by the plaintiffs, it covered not thirteen specific bales of cotton, but any thirteen bales of cotton which were stored by the plaintiffs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Tobacco Warehouse No. <em>2, </em>on O\u2019Donnell\u2019s wharf, and were there remaining on the 18th July, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">4. If the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then, in ascertaining the amount of loss or damage which the plaintiffs are to recover, the jury ought to deduct such sum as from the evidence in the cause they may find is the proportion due to twenty-eight bales of cotton, in the distribution of the proceeds of sale of the- rescued and saved cotton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">The defendant prayed the Court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">That the plaintiffs have offered no proof upon which the jury can allow damages for any injury by fire to the cotton insured by either of the policies of the defendant which are in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">The Court (Dobbin, J.) refused the prayers of the plaintiffs and granted ^the prayer of the defendant.

Nevett Steele, for the appellants.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-11\">I. The policies sued on may be taken in combination, as constituting a promise of the appellee, to make good to the appellants any loss by fire that should happen during a period of time, embracing the 18th of July, 1870, (the day of the fire,) to <em>any cotton in bales </em>of the appellants, stored as in these policies is described \u2014 the pecuniary extent of the risk being, however, <em>not absolute </em>to make good the loss, whatever that may be, but <em>restrained by two limitations </em>\u2014 -first: a specified sum of money, say $2,500; and, <em>second, </em>the value of a specified number of bales, say twenty-eight. The liability of the. appellee can never, in any event, exceed whichever of these two sums shall, in the event, prove to be the smaller. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The same was true of all the other policies held by the appellants on cotton in bales so stored and outstanding at the lire. And all these policies together, covering a number of bales, in the aggregate exactly corresponding to the whole number in store at the time of the fire, there was in the actual event, <em>as among them, </em>no double insurance, and the appellants are entitled to recover from the appellee in this action, <em>prima facie, </em>the market value on the day of the fire, as proved, of twenty-eight bales. The ratable proportion of the \u201csalvage,\u201d or proceeds of the cotton rescued and sold, apportioned to the appellee\u2019s credit, being already in the hands of the assignee of the policies, operates as a payment, <em>pro tanto, </em>towards the satisfaction of the appellee\u2019s liability as thus ascertained, and to that extent should reduce the recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-5\">If this view of the proper construction of the contract he correct, there was in the evidence abundant proof of loss to the appellants within the risk assumed by the appellee in the contracts sued on, upon which the jury could and ought to have allowed damages \u2014 and the instructions asked for by the appellants in their second, third and fourth prayers, ought to have been <em>granted, </em>and that asked by the defendant ought to have been <em>refused.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">Was the contract, for the insurance of twenty-eight specific bales of cotton, distinguished from all others, or of any bales not exceeding twenty-eight in number?

An <em>indefinite </em>expression shall be understood universally, unless there be some reason to restrain it. <em>Chitty\u2019s Contr., </em>83. <em>Specification, </em>if intended, would have been very easy of accomplishment.

Evidence of them was introduced on both sides, and relied upon as aiding in the interpretation of the language \u2014 the <em>pencil </em>marks on the policies; the nature of the appellants\u2019 business as factors. And if this aid be needed, the evidence of such circumstances ought to be passed upon by the jury. They were presented to, and may have influenced the judgment of the Court below. <em>Neilson vs. Harford, 8 M. &amp; W., </em>806; <em>Shore vs. Wilson, </em>9 <em>Clarke &amp; Fin., </em>355; <em>Goldshede vs. Swan, 1 Exchq. </em>154; <em>Simpson vs. Margitson, </em>11 <em>Q. B. </em>23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">The appellants\u2019 third exception does not claim that the witness, Hough, could testify to his <em>intention </em>in making the contract, \u2014 as a fact, independent of the 'writing, but that he was entitled to explain the language on this point brought out from him on his cross-examination according to the fact, and prevent a wrong effect being given to that language. <em>Schwarz vs. Yearly, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>275.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-8\">II. Even if the contracts are to be construed as the Court below has construed them, as constituting only an insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>on <em>certain specific bales of cotton, twenty-eight in number, </em>stored as described, distinguished from all others so stored, still there is <em>evidence </em>of loss to the appellants, within the risk assumed by the appellee, on the force and effect of which the jury ought to have been allowed to pass their judgment, and the prayer of the appellee ought not to have been granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-5\">All the lots of cotton stored by the appellants in this warehouse, and remaining there at the fire, were marked in the same way: the mark, therefore, furnished no means of distinguishing any particular lot from all the others, or any particular bales as belonging to any distinct lot, or of identifying it even as deposited on a particular day. There was nothing in the description in the policy that could aid the identification of any specific cotton as intended to be covered by the insurance therein. It was not possible, therefore, to distinguish any particular bales of those saved, as belonging to any particular or distinct lot, or embraced within the risk of any particular insurer. Under such circumstances, inasmuch as of six hundred and seventy-five bales of cotton all insured in like manner as in the present case, all were destroyed but seventy-five, the jury had a right to pass on the probabilities arising out of the facts proved, aided by the concessions which the appellee\u2019s subsequent conduct might seem to them to imply, as to whether the particular cotton intended to be covered by the appellee\u2019s contract, or any part of it, was saved or lost, and apportion to the appellee its ratable share of the loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">III. If, upon a proper construction of the contract, there was evidence of a loss to the appellants, within the risk assumed by the appellee, the proper measure of the appellee\u2019s .liability, and of the appellants\u2019 recovery in the action, is the market value, on the day of the fire, as this appeared in proof, of twenty-eight bales of cotton of the average weight and quality as proved, reduced by the application, as a payment <em>pro tanto </em>thereon, of the ratable proportion of the \u201csalvage,\u201d or proceeds of the cotton saved and sold which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>had been apportioned to the appellee or its credit, in the distribution thereof, and retained by the assignee of the policies, not subject to any abatement or reduction, on the ground of any liability of \u201cThe Home Insurance Company of New York,\u201d and \u201c The Associated Firemen\u2019s Insurance Company of Baltimore,\u201d or either of them, by reason of the policy' issued by each to the Baltimore Warehouse Company, and outstanding at the time of the fire, to contribute to the appellants\u2019 indemnification against the loss of the said cotton or otherwise, and the prayer of the appellants, for instruction to this effect, ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">A liability among several insurers to contribute, exists only where they have insured the <em>same subject-matter </em>against the <em>same rish, </em>\u2014 and the loss has happened to this <em>common subject-matter </em>and within <em>this common rish.

That the party effecting the insurance W'as his agent to <em>effect </em>insurance for him. 2. That he was executing his agency in the fact \u2022of insuring; and 3. That, by <em>apt words </em>for the purpose, he advertised the insurer that other interests besides his own were intended to be protected, such as \u201c for self and others,\u201d \u201cfor whom it may concern,\u201d <em>&amp;c.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>That the Baltimore Warehouse Company had an interest in the \u201cmerchandise,\u201d described as the subject of insurance in the two policies of \u201c The Home,\u201d and \u201c The Associated,\u201d has been seen.

Y., </em>401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-8\">The point raised by the first bill of exceptions is one well settled by the law of evidence. The written portion of the policies, effected by the Warehouse Company in the \u201cHome\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>and the \u201cAssociated Firemen\u2019s,\u201d are direct and explicit. The \u201c Home \u201d policy, says \u201c the said Company do insure the Baltimore Warehouse Company against loss or damage by fire to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, on merchandize, their own, or held by them in trust, or in which they have an interest or liability.\u201d And the policy of the \u201cAssociated \u201d is in like terms. The appellants sought to show by parol testimony that the policies did not cover \u201c merchandize their own, <em>&amp;c.,\u201d </em>as therein stated; but was intended to cover the merchandize only under certain circumstances; and, if the said merchandize was insured by the owners thereof in other companies, that the interest of the Warehouse Company in these policies was not insured at all. This is a plain violation of the well established principle of the law of evidence \u201c that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove the intention of a contract under seal,\u201d and \u201cthat it is inadmissible to charge or contradict the terms of a written instrument.\u201d And especially as against strangers to the instrument. <em>Young vs. Frost, </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>287; <em>Henderson vs. Mayhew, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>393; <em>McElroy vs. Shipley, et al., 2 Md., </em>25; <em>Hamilton\u2019s Lessee vs. Cawood, </em>3 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>437; <em>Helm\u2019s Lessee vs. Howard, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">The same principle precisely, is involved in the second bill of exceptions. The appellants there sought in effect to show by parol testimony that the floating policies of the \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cAssociated \u201d were intended to cover the merchandise therein mentioned only under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-6\">If such is not the effect of the evidence sought to be introduced, how can it be material to the question of contribution, whether or not the Warehouse Company notified the appellants, they would not insure their cotton ? The fact is they did so insure, and this fact is established by the policies themselves. Could parol evidence be introduced to show that more was intended to be covered by the policy of insurance than was therein expressed? Clearly not. <em>Helm\u2019s Lessee vs. Howard, 2 H. &amp; McH., </em>57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Does not the same principle prevent parol evidence from showing that less was intended to be insured, than the policies called for ? and that too, as against third parties whose rights depend upon the policy thus sought to be varied ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-5\">Another point strongly relied upon by the appellants, is that the warehouse receipts themselves contained a notice to the effect that the Warehouse Company did not insure goods stored with them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">This is in accordance with the charter of the Warehouse Company, section 10, ch. 268 of the laws of 1867, which says, every receipt shall contain on its face a notice that the property mentioned therein, is held by this corporation as bailees only, and is not insured by this corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">The construction sought to be placed by the appellants upon this section is erroneous. It w'as intended to prohibit the Warehouse Company from becoming an insurance company itself, and to protect them from liability as such, but was no restraint upon their power to insure for themselves or their bailees in other companies. It was a prohibition suggested by wise legislation in the interest of the bailees.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b438-8\">Grason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AaP\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">At the trial of this qause in tlie Court below, the appellants, for the purpose of showing what goods and merchandize w'ere intended to be covered by the pplicies issued to the'Warehouse Company by the Associated Firemen\u2019s Insurance Company and the Home Insurance Company, offered to prove by the president of the Warehouse Company that, at the time he applied for the insurances, he informed the agents of the insurance companies that he desired to obtain insurance to protect his company from loss or damage, not covered by-policies taken out by those who had deposited cotton or other merchandize in the warehouse, and in which the Warehouse Company had an interest. Upon objection made by the appellees, the evidence was ruled to be inadmissible, and to this ruling the first exception was. taken. When a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>is reduced to writing and is couched in plain and unambiguous language, Courts must look to it alone to find the intention and meaning of the parties, and parol proof is inadmissible. <em>Balto. Fire Ins. Co. vs. Loney, </em>20 <em>Md., </em>36; <em>Henderson vs. Mayhew, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>409. There was therefore no error in the ruling of the Court below in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The appellants then offered to prove, that before the issuing of the policies sued on in this case, and before the deposit of their cotton in the warehouse, they were informed by the Warehouse Company that the latter would not insure the cotton so deposited, but that the appellants must insure for themselves, and that said notice was acquiesced in and not objected to by them, and that they did, thereupon, insure for themselves. This proof was objected to and ruled out by the Court, and this forms the ground of the second exception. We concur in this ruling as the evidence offered was totally irrelevant. Notice from the Warehouse Company that it would not insure cotton, stored in its warehouse and belonging to the appellants, was unnecessary, and could not, in any manner, affect the rights or liabilities of the parties to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The third exception was taken to the rejection of evidence offered for the purpose of showing what was meant by the insurances of the respective lots of cotton procured by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Bernard Hough had testified that it was the habit of the appellants to take out policies on each additional lot of cotton as it came in. He was then asked to explain whether he meant to say that it was the habit of the appellants to effect insurance on each specific lot of cotton, or to effect insurance generally on an additional number of bales equal to the lot deposited. The evidence, sought to be elicited by this question, was intended to show what was the intention and purpose of the appellants in taking insurance, and the effect of the policies taken out by them; and, as we have already stated in considering the first exception, this could only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>shown by the terms of the policies which were issued. They constituted the contracts between the parties, and being free from ambiguity, parol evidence was not admissible to explain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The appellees\u2019 prayer, which was granted, instructed the jury that there was no proof upon which they could allow damages for any injury by fire to the cotton insured by either of the policies sued on. This prayer assumed that the policies sued on were specific as to the fifteen and thirteen bales respectively, as well as an absence of evidence to show whether the two specific lots so insured were included in the seventy-five 'bales, which sustained partial injury only, and were identified as belonging to the appellants, or whether they were included in the mass which was destroyed. We have no doubt that the policies are specific and not general. The appellants began to deposit cotton in the warehouse mentioned, on the 5th day of February, and continued to deposit, at intervals, until the 15th of July, 1870, only three .days before the fire occurred, and for each lot deposited, received from the Warehouse Company a receijjt, warrant or certificate therefor, which specified the number of bales and the date of the deposit, and also the mark on the bales, the letters X. Q. being marked on each bale deposited by the appellants. These receipts or certificates were all numbered, and that for the fifteen bales deposited on the 20th of June was numbered \u201c1221\u201d and the one for the thirteen bales deposited on the 27th June, was numbered \u201c1238.\u201d Policies of'insurance were at once taken out to cover the particular number of bales deposited, and on their face the loss, if any, is made payable to the Warehouse Company, and the policies and \u25a0warehouse receipts were delivered to the Warehouse Company to secure advances made by it. On the policy on the fifteen bales, dated 21st of June, there is endorsed in pencil the number in figures, \u201c1221,\u201d and on that on the thirteen bales dated 27th of June, also in pencil, \u201c 1238.\u201d It does not appear in proof by whom these'numbers on the-policies were en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>dorsed, but it seems clear that they were endorsed thereon for the purpose of corresponding with the number of the Warehouse receipts given for the particular cotton insured, so that the same might be more readily identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">It is also shown that at the time of each deposit, the depositor reserved a sample of the particular lot deposited. All these facts go to show that the intention of the contracting parties was to effect a specific insurance on each particular lot of cotton as it was deposited in the warehouse. But independently of these facts, and looking to the terms of the policies alone, it is manifest that each policy is specific and covers no cotton but the specific bales to which it refers. The amount of the liability of the insurance company is limited in each policy to a specific sum, and the policies bear date on the day, or the day after, the cotton is deposited. Gan it be pretended that a policy issued on the 27th of June, to cover thirteen bales deposited on that day, is to be held to cover thirteen other bales deposited long before, and which had been previously insured, or that the policy issued the 5th of February on thirty-eight bales can be said to apply to the same number of bales deposited in July thereafter, when, for aught we know to the contrary, the appellants had not on the 5th of February a bale beyond the thirty-eight bales first deposited? The true construction of each policy issued is that it covers, and was intended to cover only the specific number of bales in each deposit, and the insurance on which was effected at the time of the deposit; the policy of the 21st of June, 1870, covering only the fifteen bales deposited on the 20th of June, and the policy of the 27th of June the thirteen bales deposited on that day. But while we are of opinion that the policies sued on are specific and not general, we think that there was evidence in the cause to show damage to the cotton deposited in the warehouse on the 20th and 27th of June respectively, and covered by the policies sued on. It is true there is no evidence to show whether this particular cotton was among the seventy-five bales which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>identified after the fire, as belonging to the appellants, or was among that which was destroyed;' but the proof leaves no room, for doubt that it was included in one or the other class, and was damaged, if not destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">It was incumbent upon the appellants, in order to recover for a total loss, to show that the cotton insured was wholly destroyed, and having failed to show this, it must be assumed, that it was only partially damaged. Proof was offered that these two lots of cotton were weighed at the \u2018time they were stored in the warehouse, the fifteen bales weighing six thousand two hundred and sixty-one pounds, and the thirteen bales five thousand four hundred and eighty-two pounds, making in the aggregate eleven thousand seven hundred and forty-three pounds, and that a fair class of \u201c low middling \u201d cotton was worth in the market eighteen and three-quarter cents per pound. It was also proved by Mr. Rhett, that he had examined the several samples of the cotton stored by the appellants in the warehouse, and that they graded from \u201c good middling\u201d to.\u201clow middling\u201d and \u201cordinary,\u201d the whole averaging a fair class of \u201c low middling,\u201d thus showing that the market value of the cotton insured, and injured by the fire, was eighteen and three-quarter cents per pound. Proof of the extent of the damage was also furnished by the list of the sales of the cotton which was partially damaged and identified, so that the extent of the loss of the appellants could have been easily ascertained by the jury. It was therefore error to grant the prayer of the appellees and thus to take the case wholly from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">As we have shown that the policies sued on were specific and not general, it follows that the second and third prayers of the appellants were erroneous, and were properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The Court below, having granted the appellees\u2019 prayer, refused the fourth prayer of the appellants as unnecessary. But as we have shown that the appellees\u2019 prayer ought not to have been granted, because there was evidence of loss upon which the jury should have been permitted to pass, the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>lants\u2019 fourth prayer ought to have been granted, as it states the correct measure of damages to be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The appellants\u2019 first prayer asked an instruction that the jury are not to make any abatement from the damages, (if the verdict should be for the plaintiffs) on account of the two policies of insurance by the Home Insurance Company, and the Associated Firemens\u2019 Insurance Company, to the Baltimore Warehouse Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The policies in the \u201c Home \u201d and \u201cAssociated Firemen\u2019s \u201d companies were taken out by the Baltimore Warehouse Company, while the policies in the company of the appellees were issued to Hough, deadening &amp; Co., loss, if any, payable to the Baltimore Warehouse Company. In the case of <em>The Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. vs. Crane, </em>16 <em>Md., </em>293, a policy had been issued to James L. Gray <em>&amp; </em>Bro. against damage by fire to property in Baltimore city, \u201c the loss, if any, payable to William Crane <em>&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d and the Court of Appeals held that this language was an admission that Crane &amp; Co. had an interest in the contract and were to receive the benefit of it, and that the policy might be regarded as having been, at its inception, assigned to them with the assent of the company. See also <em>Brown vs. The Roger Williams Ins. Co., </em>5 <em>Rho. Isl. R., </em>394. In the case before us, the proof shows that the Warehouse Company had advanced to Hough, Clendening <em>&amp; </em>Co. over forty-eight thousand dollars upon the cotton belonging to them and stored in the warehouse, and the Warehouse Company had therefore a lien upon it for such advances, as well as for storage, which constituted an insurable interest in the cotton. The policy in the Associated Firemen\u2019s Company was for ten thousand dollars, and insured the Warehouse Company against loss by fire for one year \u201c on merchandize generally, hazardous or extra-hazardous, held by them or in trust, contained in that part of <em>No. </em>2 Warehouse, used by them, &amp;c., to cover whilst on the street\u00a1or pavement around said warehouse.\u201d The policy in the \u201cHome\u201d Company is nearly in the same language, but is for twenty thousand dollars, and \u201c on merchandize, hazardous or extra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>hazardous, their own, held by them in trust, or in which they have an interest or liability.\u201d In the policies to the appellants, as well as to the Warehouse Company, are stipulations that, in case of loss, the insured shall not recover any greater proportion of the loss or damage sustained to the subject insured, than the amount thereby insured shall bear to the whole amount insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The law seems to be well settled that a person having goods in his possession as consignee, or on commission, may insure them in his own name, and, in the event of loss, recover the full amount of the insurance, and, after satisfying his own claim, hold the balance as trustee for the owner. <em>Story on Ag., sec. </em>111; <em>\u00c6tna Insur.

By goods \u201c held in trust \u201d are meant goods with which the assured is intrusted; \u201c not goods held in trust in the strict technical sense \u2014 so held that there was only an equitable obligation in the assured, enforcible by a <em>subpoena </em>in chancery \u2014 but goods with which they were intrusted, in the ordinary sense of the word.\u201d <em>Waters vs. Assur. Co., </em>85 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>879, It seems clear therefore that the cotton of the appellants was insured by the two policies issued to the Warehouse Company, and that it can recover not only to the extent of its interest in the property insured, but to the extent of the loss, unless the right of recovery to that extent is limited by some provision or condition of the policies. The policies sued on having on their face been made payable to the Ware<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>house Company, they inured to the benefit of that company, and may be considered as in favor of the same assured, on the same interest in the same subject, and against the same risks, as the policies which were issued directly to the Warehouse Company by the \u201c Home \u201d and \u201cAssociated Firemen\u2019s \u201d companies. They are therefore what are termed double policies, <em>(Sloat vs. Royal Ins. Co., </em>49 <em>Penna. State Rep., </em>18,) and the insurance companies issuing them ar\u00e9 bound to contribute their respective proportions of the loss. <em>Merrick vs. Germania Fire Insurance Company, </em>54 <em>Penna.
