They may be found in 29 <em>Md., </em>1-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">By the first rule, specially applicable to writs of error, and simplifying the form of proceeding, it is required in such cases, that in the petition for the removal of the record, the points or questions of law, in the decision of which, by the Court below, error is alleged, shall be plainly designated, and no point or question not so presented shall be heard or determined by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In the application for the wi*it of error in this case, the alleged errors have been specifically assigned as required by this rule; but upon an inspection of the record, it does not appear that the points or questions alleged in the application were made or decided at the trial below.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Under the Act' of 1825, chap. 117, they are not open for examination in this Court. This Act is embodied in the fourth rule, which declares that <em>\u201c </em>in no case shall the Court of Appeals decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the Court below.\u201d Whilst this is a tribunal to review the proceedings of inferior Courts, the law, as well as these rules having the force of law, confines its adjudication to questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>determined by such Courts. See <em>Bridendolph vs. Zeller\u2019s Ex\u2019rs., </em>5 <em>Md., </em>58.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Al\">(Decided 16th May, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">No question or point having been made, according to the record in the Court below, in conformity with the mandate of the law, we have no authority to disturb the judgment complained of; on the contrary, every legal intendment is to be made in its favor. The writ of error must therefore be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\n<em>Writ of Error quashed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
