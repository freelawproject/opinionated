At the trial below, the plaintiffs gave in evidence the certificate of incorporation of the company, and the record thereof; which certificate was filed some time in May, 1867; and proved that the defendant was one of the parties who acknowledged said certificate to be their act and deed. They then gave in evidence three notes, each for the sum of $3,000, payable to the plaintiffs, executed by the president of the manufacturing company in the year 1868, and also\u00bb an account or accounts due by the company to the plaintiffs; and also gave in evidence the minutes of proceedings of the company, showing its admission of indebtedness to the plaintiffs and authority for executing the notes; and further gave in evidence a mortgage or deed of trust by the company to William T. Hamilton and others; and further gave in evidence by the treasurer of said company, that the amount of capital stock subscribed to the Company was $92,600, of which the sum of $67,000 was paid in, and that $66,000 of this sum was so paid in before the 5th day of February, 1869; that the defendant was a director in the company up to the time ho transferred his stock, which was on or about the 10th of February, 1869; that the defendant paid up the whole of his stock, amounting to $5,000, as it was called; that the company had a settlement with the plaintiffs and gave notes for the amount due, and that the present indebtedness of the company to them was about $10,000. The plaintiffs then rested their ease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">The defendant then gave in evidence certain minutes and proceedings of the company; and further proved that the capital stock was originally fixed at $50,000, and that he was a subscriber for fifty shares, $5,000; that when he signed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>certificate of incorporation the capital stock was fixed at $50,000; that he paid up his stock in full, and that on the 10th day of February, 1869, lie transferred it to his son, Jonathan H. Hager, upon the transfer book of the company before the institution of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">The plaintiffs then for the purpose of rebutting the testimony of the defendant, proved by a, witness that he copied from a paper furnished him by his brother, the certificate of incorporation of the company, and when it was written and read to his brother* he said there was a mistake in it; the capital was to be $150,000, and not $50,000; and that he, the witness, then corrected the mistake by interlining the words \u201cone hundred and,\u201d and neglected to make the corresponding correction in the number of shares; that the certificate of incorporation offered in evidence, was the identical paper he so copied and interlined; that the interlineation was made before any name had been subscribed to it; thought that no name was subscribed to the paper from which he made the copy, but was not certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">Upon all the evidence the plaintiffs submitted the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\">1. If the jury believe that the paper-writing given in evidence as a subscription of stock to the Antietam Manufacturing Company of Washington county, .was signed by the parties whose names appear thereto, or any five of them, and that they, or said five of them were, at the time, free white persons, and that they, or said five persons acknowledged the same before John Cook, and that said Cook was at the time a justice ,of the peace of the State of Maryland, in and for Washington county, and that the said paper was then recorded in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court for Washington county; and if they shall further believe from the evidence that the defendant was a stockholder in said company, specified in said paper, to the amount of $5,000, or for fifty shares at $100 each, and that, whilst the defendant was such stockholder, the said Antietam Manufacturing Com-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>pany of Washington county became indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of $10,000 or thereabouts, and that the entire amount of said indebtedness was contracted whilst said defendant remained such stockholder, and said debt still continues due and unpaid; and if the jury shall believe from the evidence that the capital stock of said company was not taken or paid up to the full amount specified in said paper-writing, at the time of bringing the plaintiffs\u2019 suit or since, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendant the said sum of $5,000, the amount of his subscription, and the verdict should be for the plaintiffs for that amount, notwithstanding the jury may believe from the evidence that the defendant transferred his stock before or since the bringing of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">2.

If the jury shall believe, front the evidence, the facts stated in the first and third prayers of the plaintiffs, and made part of this, that the said paper-writing, with the interlineation therein, was delivered to the clerk of said Circuit Court to be recorded, by the president and directors of said company, or that the same was so delivered with their autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>rity, then the defendant is not discharged from, his liability to the plaintiffs in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The defendant then offered the following- prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">1.

That the certificate of incorporation of said company, and the record thereof given in evidence, by the legal construction thereof, fixes and limits the capital stock of said company at fifty thousand dollars, and that if the jury believe the same was fully paid in before the institution of this suit, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">8. If the jury find that the interlineation \u201cone hundred and,\u201d in the certificate of incorporation given in evidence, w'as made after the signing and acknowledging of the same by the defendant, and without his consent, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover with this qualification, without his consent, either before or since said interlineation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\">9. That the signing or subscription by the defendant to the original certificate of incorporation given in evidence to the jury, and as thereunto signed or subscribed with the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>of shares and amount of stock extended to his name, is not a subscription to the capital stock of said company, and does not constitute the defendant a stockholder therein, but that such signing or subscription is wholly for the purposes of incorporation, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">The Court (Motter and Perry, J.) granted all the prayers of the plaintiffs and rejected all those of the defendant, except the fourth and eighth; but granted the fourth with the following qualification:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Unless they shall further find <em>that at the time of </em>such withdrawal, if they should find it was withdrawn, and for the purpose aforesaid, the said Hager ivas one of the directors of said corporation, and was acting and consenting to said' withdrawal for the purpose aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">The defendant excepted to the granting of-the prayers of the plaintiffs and to the rejection of his prayers, as also to the qualification attached to his fourth prayer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-8\">Three exceptions were taken to th\u00e9 admissibility of evidence; two by the plaintiffs and one by the defendant.

Unless the stock is taken as fixed by the articles, there is no corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>in being able to do anything. It is an inanimate thing until the breath of life is breathed into it. The stock is the life. Any act, involving responsibility, done by anybody connected with the corporation before it has its legal being perfected by the subscription of stock, is the act of an individual, and as such only can be held responsible, or hold others responsible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">Unless it is otherwise provided in the articles under this law, the amount of stock fixed in the articles must be fully taken or subscribed before the corporation has this perfect legal being or organic life. <em>Hughes vs. Antietam Manuf. Co., </em>34 <em>Md., </em>316; 1 <em>Redfield on Railways, Chapt. </em>4, sec. 1, <em>page </em>63, <em>top </em>64; <em>Hudson vs. </em>Carman, 41 <em>Maine, </em>84; <em>Franklin Fire Ins. Co. vs. Hart, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">Section 52 is the one imposing personal liability upon the stockholders in certain cases. This section enlarges to some extent the responsibility of stockholders. Under this section, in order to make a stockholder liable, he must be a stockholder in the full sense of that term \u2014 invested with all the powers, and liable to all the responsibilities of a stockholder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">The section says: <em>\u201cAll the stockholders of any such corporation </em>shall be, &amp;c.\u201d \u201c <em>Any such </em>corporationIt must therefore be a corporation having organic, life, for it is so provided by the Act that it should have such organic life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-9\">He is only liable to an amount equal to the amount of' stock held by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-10\">He is only liable until all the stock be paid in, within the time limited; or, in other words, he is not liable for anything if the stock is all paid in, as it should be; and this being so, it is the end of that section and of this liability clause, and the stockholder stands, in this respect, upon the old law</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-11\">The prayers of the appellees put this fact to be found by the jury, as one of the series of facts entitling the appellees to recover, namely: That if the jury believe from the evidence (among other things) that the capital stock of said company <em>was not taken, &amp;c., </em>their so finding, the appellees are entitled to recover. Here the very fact which denies to the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>organic life, is the fact relied on to recover against a subscriber for stock. The evidence shows that the capital stock was never taken \u2014 only $92,600 being taken of the $150,000 fixed by the articles. It being proven, admitted and urged by the appellees that the capital stock was not taken, and at the same time relied upon as one of the facts in their prayers to entitle them to recover, in what way, and how can this fact impose liability upon the appellant? It is well settled that, unless otherwise provided, either in the law or the articles, the whole stock must be subscribed before any subscriber of stock can be held liable to the company. By the articles of this company, and under the law, the whol\u00e9 of the capital stock must be subscribed before any subscriber for stock can be held liable to the company. <em>Hughes vs. Antietam Manf. Co., </em>34 <em>Md., </em>316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIn\">And further, the capital stock of such a corporation must all be subscribed to give to it organic life. 1 <em>Redfield on Railways, ch. </em>4, <em>p. </em>63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-6\">The relation of the appellant to this company is fixed by adjudication: \u2014 if he had not paid his subscription for stock, he would not be liable to- pay it \u2014 he is entirely free from all liability as a stockholder to the company. Then what is his relation to the creditors of this company as a stockholder, for in that character alone is he sued in this action? His relation is not different, ncr is his liability extended as a stockholder in respect to the creditors of this corporation, or pretended corporation, and for the reason: First. That the creditor can only claim through the corporation from a stockholder. The first step in his cause against a stockholder is to show a corporation legally organized, having, in fact, organic life,' a perfect legal entity \u2014 the formal organization, with the requisite subscrib,ers for all the stock fixed by the articles\u2014 stockholders subject to all the responsibilities of the corporation and of the law, and possessing all the powers and rights of stockholders, for they are as material as in other obligations where mutality is required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Section 52, only provides for the responsibility of stockholders until all the stock is paid in, or until it is dissolved, and if paid in within the time limited, or dissolved, the creditor is left to his only other recourse \u2014 the capital. The credit in fact is given to the company, and to the capital of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-5\">This section assumes, when it undertakes to impose liabilities upon individual stockholders, that <em>all the stock was taken, </em>and that thereby it is a perfect corporation. It does not state that a subscriber for stock shall be liable <em>if the stock be not taken, </em>but only liable <em>\u201cif not paid in\u201d </em>\u2014 assuming of course that it is all taken, and very properly so assuming, for the Legislature may well be presumed to have meant that a corporation ought only to have organic life when all the stock was subscribed, as it most certainly intended that it should all be paid in, by fixing individual liability until it was done. Before any liability can attach to a subscriber for stock as a stockholder \u2014 by reason of a contract with this company \u2014 the whole stock must have been taken; this not having been done, the prayers of the appellees are erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">Again, this section declares that \u201call the stockholders of any such corporation shall be,\u201d &amp;c., until the whole amount of the capital stock be paid in, &amp;c. Here the most important question arises, who is a stockholder under this subscription and corporation ? This section is emphatic \u2014 the stockholder, not a subscriber merely, but the stockholder\u2019, pure, simple and perfect, is only liable to the creditor. Who then is a stockholder ? He must be one who is in full relation to the company, invested with all the rights and powers of the stockholders, and subject to all the liabilities, responsibilities and remedies as such, under the law and the articles; then is he such a person as contemplated by the Act for liability. Nothing less will do. The whole Act deals with a stockholder \u2014 -nothing less, not a mere subscriber\u2014 an inchoate stockholder, but with one that is perfect under the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The appellees\u2019 first and second prayers put. the proposition, \u201cThat if the jury find, among other things necessary for a recovery, that the debt sued for was contracted whilst the appellant was a stockholder, the verdict must be against him, <em>although </em>the jury should further find that he had transferred his stock before the bringing of this suit.\u201d And the appellant\u2019s fifth prayer puts the .proposition as follows: \u201c That if the jury find that the appellant, before the bringing of this suit, in good fath, transferred the stock held by him, and that at the time this suit was brought, he was not a stockholder, then the appellees are not entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-5\">Tn these prayers is raised the question of the right to transfer stock free from any liability for a debt contracted by the corporation at the time it was held. Assuming that the corporation was in full life and legal vigor, and that the party was a stockholder in fact and in law, what was his right to transfer and thus cease to be a stockholder and a member of the company; and what, if any, liabilities may follow him?</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWx\">Section 50, provides the absolute right to transfer, and limits it only in one respect, and that is, that before transfer be made, all previous calls shall have been paid. This is the only limitation upon this absolute right. About this right of transfer there is no question; it is one of the very elements of corporations, and without it.they could not exist. No personal liability follows the stockholder under section fifty. Does it attach to him and follow him under the 52d section? These sections are to be construed together and full effect given to both, if possible. The 52d section provides that \u201c <em>All the stockholders of any such corporation </em>shall be severally and individually liable,\u201d &amp;c. The true construction of this language is that all stockholders. being so when the suit is brought, are only liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-7\">If the appellant transferred his stock, in good faith, before suit brought, he is not liable in this suit, and the Court below was in error in granting the first and second prayers of the appellees and rejecting the fifth prayer of the appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>Curtis vs. Harlow, </em>12 <em>Metcalf, </em>3, 4; <em>Bond vs. Appleton, </em>8 <em>Mass., </em>474; <em>Middletown Bank vs. Magill, </em>5 <em>Conn., </em>28, 63, 71; 17 <em>Mass., </em>64; 17 <em>Mass., </em>330; <em>Moss vs. Oakley, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>268.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-5\"><em>Attorney General Syester, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-6\">The mode pointed, out in the statute, by which the corporation is to obtain organic life, has been pursued; every condition precedent has been fairly complied with, so far as to enajole it to deal with third parties, and to bind itself by its own contracts; and it is a corporation so far as third parties are concerned. <em>Corning vs. </em>McCullough, 1 <em>Comst., </em>47; <em>Abbott vs. Aspinmall, </em>26 <em>Barb., </em>202, 206; <em>Palmer vs. Lawrence, </em>3 <em>Sandf., (S.

If the subscriber has knowledge of such things, and remains silent, and thereby acquiesces therein, he will be regarded as having <em>waived his right to such a defence, </em>even in an action against him for an unpaid subscription. <em>Contoocook V.

That the amount of capital stock fixed by the articles of association and recorded certificate not being taken, the company never was incorporated, and therefore had no power to create debts, binding on the subscribers; and 2dly. That the appellant had transferred his stock prior to the institution of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The 40th section of Article 26, of the Code, prescribes all the <em>requirements </em>necessary to the incorporation of manufacturing companies, and when these are fully complied with, and the certificate recorded, the associates become a <em>corporate body, </em>entitled to and possessed of the franchises of a corporation, as effectually as if the same had been by'a direct grant from the State. <em>Sec. </em>41, <em>Art. </em>26. In <em>Hughes vs. The Antietam Manuf. Co., </em>34 <em>Md., </em>316, it was decided that these requirements had been complied with, and the corporate existence of the company is therefore no longer an open question. There is a wide difference between the existence of the company as a <em>corporate body, </em>and the <em>liability of parties </em>for their subscription to its capital stock. As a general rule, where the capital stock and number of shares are fixed in the recorded certificate, no valid assessments or calls can be made on subscribers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>until the whole capital stock is taken, unless there be a provision to that effect, either in the recorded certificate, or general law under which the company is incorporated; and in such a case, the subscription may be considered to that extent as conditional. It is a condition, however, which the subscribers may waive, and with their assent the company cannot only organize, but do all other things incident to, and necessary for the prosecution of the particular business for which it was incorporated. This waiver may be either <em>express </em>or <em>implied </em>from the acts and declarations of the subscribers. If knowing the whole capital stock has not been taken, they attend the meetings of the company, cooperate in the votes for the expenditure of money \u2014 for the purchase of property-\u2014 for the making of contracts, and other acts which could only be properly done upon the assumption that the subscribers intended to proceed with the stock partially taken up, they would be estopped from setting up such a defence. <em>Cabot and West Springfield Bridge Co. vs. Chapin, and others, </em>6 <em>Cushing, </em>50.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In the case before us, then, if the appell\u00e1nt, knowing that the whole capital stock had not been subscribed, participated in the organization of the company, attended its meetings, was one of the directors, and privy to the purchase of the machinery, for the payment of which this suit was brought, he will not be heard now to deny the regularity of the organization, or to set up as a defence a partial subscription of the capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">This brings us to the second ground of defence: whether the transfer of stock by the appellant, exonerates him from personal liability for a debt contracted when he was a stockholder, and before the whole capital stock was paid in ?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The language of the 52d section, it must be admitted, is general in its terms, and does not in words declare whether the individual liability shall attach to such as are stockholders at the time the debt is contracted, or to those holding stock at the time the suit is brought. It is obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>however that the protection of the creditor was the paramount object the Legislature had in view, and the section in question, ought to receive such a construction as will best accomplish this object. In conferring the rights and franchises of a corporation upon companies incorporated under Article 26, the Legislature has affixed as a condition precedent to the exercise thereof, that the stockholders shall be individually liable for the debts of the company until the whole capital stock is fully paid in. The original stockholders, by their acceptance of the charter, and subsequent purchasers in becoming members, must be considered as assenting to the terms and conditions thus imposed, and it is upon the faith of these terms and conditions that the public are invited to give credit to the company. Parties therefore dealing with the corporation, rely upon this individual responsibility of shareholders, who are personally known to them, as well as upon the responsibility of the company itself. And at a time when these corporations are multiplied to an almost indefinite extent, embracing every department of trade and business in which the most sanguine can hope for success, parties dealing with the corporation may rely with much more confidence upon the personal liability of stockholders, than upon the property and assets of the company. Accordingly in <em>Norris vs. </em>Wrenschatt, 34 <em>Md., </em>492, this liability of the stockholder and its corresponding obligation to pay the debts of the company was held to be in the nature of a <em>contract. </em>The Court say: \u201c It is a debt under the statute, due from the stockholder to the creditor, springing out of and coexistent with the contract between the corporation and the creditor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">If so, if it be a debt due from the stockholder to the creditor, coexistent with the contract by the company, it Is clear that no act by the stockholder, without the consent of the creditor, can exonorate him from the liability thus incurred. The relation of stockholder creates a perfect legal obligation to pay the debts contracted by the company, until the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>capital shall have been paid, and it is upon the faith of this perfect legal obligation, that parties deal with the company. The liability of a stockholder, being therefore in the nature of a contract made between the company, the creditor and himself, we are of opinion that it continues, and is in no manner affected by the mere transfer of his stock. This construction is fully warranted by the language of the statute, and best accomplishes the purpose of the Legislature, namely, the protection and security of creditors. If the construction contended for by the appellant be correct, then the liability imposed by the section in question would necessarily be conditional ; that is, provided the creditor commenced his suit prior to the transfer of the stock. We find nothing in the language of the statute, nor in the purposes for which it was passed, to warrant such a construction. Moreover it denies to creditors the right to look for payment to such stockholders as were alone known to them at the time the debt was contracted, and compels them to seek payment of persons whom they could by no possibility know, and whom if known, they might have refused credit to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The construction we have adopted is also just and equitable as between stockholders themselves. If personal liability is to rest anywhere, it surely ought to be with those who were stockholders at the time the debt was contracted; who had the means of knowing the extent and magnitude of the same, and who could have exercised an influence in the management of the affairs of the company, rather than upon those who became shareholders subsequent to the creation of the debt, and who are in no maimer responsible for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The prayers offered by the plaintiffs are erroneous, because they assume the liability of the defendant for his subscription, without regard to whether the whole capital stock of the company was taken, or whether he had waived his right to rely upon a partial subscription as a defence to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The defendant\u2019s prayers were properly rejected. We fully concur in the modification of the fourth prayer. It certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>presented the law in as favorable light as. the defendant had any right to expect. If he consented to the withdrawal and alteration of the certificate, it is hardly necessary to say that he will be estopped from relying on such withdrawal or alteration, as a defence to an action brought by a creditor for machinery sold to the company.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Ain\">(Decided 20th June, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We are also of opinion that the Court erred in admitting the corporation' books in evidence. In some instances, it is true, they may be offered in evidence either for or against the corporation, where the acts recorded are of a public nature, and when the entries have been made by a proper officer. But when they relate to the private transactions of the company, they are, as a general rule, inadmissible, except perhaps in actions between the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">For these reasons the judgment below will be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
