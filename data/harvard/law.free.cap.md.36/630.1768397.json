Biddle, at the time of her death, exceeded $500 in value. It was also proved that Laura L. Biddle died of consumption ; that she had been sick of that disease since April preceding her death, and since some time in June of the same year, had been attended and constantly visited by Dr. Wallace; that for about a month she was confined to the house, but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>passing from one room to another until near the time of her death, and before her death had been confined to her bed; but that the doctor had never told her, nor did it appear that any person had ever told hex', until the morning of the day of her death, that she was about to die, or that her case was hopeless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\">It was further proved that in the afternoon of the day preceding her death, she talked about what she would do when she got well; that afterwards, about midnight of the same day, she was taken much worse, and her friends were very much alarmed on her account, and thought she was about to die, and sent for her physician, Dr. Wallace, and she herself appeared to be alarmed, and her voice was changed; that about four o\u2019clock in the morning she became very restless and uneasy, and apparently excited, and tried to talk, but had much difficulty in utterance; that she raised her head from her pillow and looked around the room, her eyes following the plaintiff, whom she always called \u201cAunty,\u201d xvho was passing about the room, and spoke with difficulty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">Dr. Wallace testified that when he was sent for on the morning of the day of her death, he was told by the messenger who came for him that she wanted to make a will, and he took with him pen, ink and paper for the purpose of writing a will for her if she desired it; that he arrived at the house after daylight, but took no note of the hour, and could not pretend to fix the exact time- \u2014 -it was shortly after the alleged nuncupation ; that he told the persons present to leave the room, which they did, and he said to her, \u201c Laura, I have come prepared to write your will, and will do so if you wish it,\u201d or words to that effect; she made no answer whatever; he repeated it in the same or similar words, and instead of x-eplying to xvhat he had said, she said, \u201c Doctor, do you think I will die?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cYes, Laura, I think you will;\u201d to which she made no reply, but turned over in her bed and commenced to cry; these were the only words she uttered during the whole of that visit or ever afterwards, to witness\u2019 knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>At the trial two exceptions were taken \u2014 one to the refusal of the Court to allow the plaintiff to testify in her own behalf, the other to the ruling of the Court on the prayers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\"><em>First Exception: </em>Is sufficiently stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\"><em>Second Exception: </em>The plaintiff offered the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-7\">1st. If the jury believe from the evidence that Laura L. Biddle died on the 23d of August, 1870, and that upon that day, in the pi resen ce of three or four creditable witnesses, did pronounce the words, \u201c doctor,\u201d and \u201c money,\u201d and \u201c aunty,\u201d and that thereupon Cena B. Hayes, one of the witnesses, asked her if she wanted her aunty to have her money, and that she replied, \u201cYes, all my money,\u201d in the manner and under the circumstances as testified to by said witnesses, and stated in the alleged nuncupative will propounded to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Cecil county, on the 10th of January, 1871, and that at the time of said speaking the said Laura intended thereby to make her last will and testament, and that she W'as of sound and disposing mind and capable of executing a valid deed or contract; and shall further believe, that at the time of pronouncing the said will she did bid the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was her will, or to that effect, and shall also believe that the said alleged nuncupative will was made at the time of the last sickness of the said Laura, when she was under the immediate apprehension of death and unable to execute a formal will, and at the house of her habitation, where she had resided for more than ten days, then their verdict must be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\">2d. In making a will there is no magic in words, and the disposition of a testator\u2019s effects may be as valid when expressed in the form of a wish, or desire, or request, as when in the most impressive words of command.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-9\">3d. That in order to satisfy that paortion of the law which requires that a testator, in making a nuncupative or verbal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>will, \u201cshall bid the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was his will, or to that effect,\u201d it is sufficient, if the jury believe from the evidence that the said Laura L. Biddle meant to direct the disposition she wished to be made of her money after her death, and did, by intelligent act and language, invoke the special attention and attestation of the persons present, or some of them, to what she was going to say, or had said, in constituting such disposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-4\">4th. That the bidding of the witnesses \u201c to bear witness that such was her will,\u201d required by the statute, may be expressed by any words or acts which, in connection with the surrounding circumstances, the jury may fmd did clearly and intelligently indicate to the witnesses, or some of them, that such was her wish and intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\">5th. Thai although it is necessary that the said Laura, in speaking the words contained in the alleged nuncupative will, intended them to operate as, and express the disposition she wished to be made of her effects after death, yet it is not necessary that she should tell the witnesses, or any of them, <em>in words, </em>that she wished to make a <em>will; </em>but such intention may be implied from facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\">6th. If the jury believe the said Laura uttered the words contained in the alleged nuncupative will, then, in ascertaining whether she intended them to operate as, and express the disposition she wished to be made of her money after her death, the jury may consider whether she was conscious of extreme illness, or whether she apprehended the probability of the near approach of death. They may also consider the signification, in ordinary parlance, of the words she used, and in connection with the circumstances under which they were uttered, and her previously expressed wish to make a will, in connection with the words addressed to her. They may consider said words also in connection with her physical inability to be more explicit, if they believe such physical inability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>They may consider whether said words were uttered in serious earnest, or as loose, casual conversation. If they believe the said words were uttered seriously, and imparted in themselves a gift, then they may consider whether said words imported a present gift of her money to her aunty, to take effect immediately, or whether they imported a gift to her said aunt, to take effect at the time, and only in the event of her death. They may consider whether the conversation in which said words were uttered originated with her. They may consider also, whether the words, under the circumstances, are capable of any other rational explanation than that she desired by them to express her wishes as to the future disposition of her money in the event of her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">The defendants asked the Court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\">That under the evidence in this case, they must find that the alleged nuncupative will of Laura L. Biddle, propounded to the Orphans\u2019 Court on the 10th of January, 1871, as the last will and testament of said Laura, was not in fact and in law her last will and testament.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-7\">The Court (Wickes and Stump, J.) rejected the prayers of the plaintiff, and granted the prayer of the defendants. The verdict and judgment being for the defendants, the -plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b648-8\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C. J., Stewart, Bowie and Alvey, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-9\"><em>Albert Constable </em>and <em>Henry W. Archer, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-10\">The third and fourth prayers of , the appellant correctly announced the law as to the <em>\u201c rogatio testium </em>\u201d by the testator in making her will, to bear witness that such was her will. 1 <em>Redfield on Wills, </em>201, <em>sec. </em>37, <em>(last ed.;) Parsons vs. Parsons, </em>2 <em>Greenleaf, </em>298; <em>Hatcher vs. Millard, </em>2 <em>Coldwell, </em>30; <em>Baker, et al. vs. Dodson, </em>4 <em>Humphreys, </em>342; <em>Winn vs. Bob, et al., </em>3 <em>Leigh., </em>145.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>In each and all of these cases the <em>rogatio testium </em>was shown by the mode and manner and circumstances under which the testamentary words were addressed to the witnesses. In none of them were there any words <em>exclusively </em>appropriated to the object of \u201c bidding the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was his will, or to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-5\">At common law it was necessary to have the <em>factum </em>of the will and the <em>animus testandi. </em>This testamentary intent might be shown by any evidence whatever, as for example, that the testator was sick. 7 <em>Bacon\u2019s Abridgt., </em>303; <em>Swinburne on Wills, Part 1st, sec. </em>3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-6\">The additional security afforded by the Statute of Frauds, was that this testamentary intent must, in nuncupative wills, be evidenced by calling on the witnesses \u2014 \u2022\u201c bidding them to hear witness.\u201d But it need not be by words alone. Words and acts may be together used for this purpose, if they be equivalent to calling of attention on acts alone, indicating plainly that the words spoken were designed to be testamentary. Thus understood, the concluding words of the provision (\u201cor to that effect\u201d) become operative. Under this Statute, the testator must not only have the intention to make his will, but he must <em>indicate </em>that intention. If he does, under such circumstances that the witnesses understand themselves to be called on specially to notice the <em>factum </em>of the will, it is \u201c <em>to that effect.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-7\">The <em>animus testandi, </em>and the \u201cbidding of the persons present to hear witness,\u201d are not two separate, distinct, substantive elements in the constitution of a nuncupative will. The <em>factum </em>of the nuncupation, and the <em>animus testandi, </em>are the essential elements of the will. The calling of the witnesses is but <em>evidence </em>of the <em>animus testandi.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-8\">A testator may feel the importance of impressing upon the minds of the persons present that he is doing a testamentary act \u2014 that he is making his will. But after he has done so\u2014 after they fully understand from his language, his manner, the impending dissolution, the symptoms of alarm visible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>upon his countenance, the changed voice, the speech obscured and blurred, but still earnest in its efforts articulately, and in spite of death, to impress upon them his dying requests, it is trifling to insist that all the objects proposed by the Statute have not been attained, and that he must still go through a prescribed formula, and by <em>other </em>and <em>additional </em>evidence, <em>separate from all this, </em>and as a sort of <em>collateral matter, </em>call their attention by certain <em>words, </em>equivalent to those used in the Statute, to bear witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-5\">All the circumstances above enumerated, springing out of and forming part of the transaction, were present in this case; and the Court ought to have permitted the jury, under the third and fourth prayers, to have passed on them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">The first bill of exceptions raises but one question \u2014 the competency of Miss Ann Biddle. Upon this exception, see <em>Cooke vs. Cooke, Ex\u2019r, </em>29 <em>Md., </em>550; <em>Schull vs. Murray, </em>32 <em>Md., </em>17; <em>Cannon vs. Crook and wife, </em>32 <em>Md., </em>486; <em>Johnson and wife vs. Heald, Ex\u2019r, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>352.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">The Act of 1864, ch. 109, removes the objection of interest, save as excepted by the Act of 1868, ch. 116. That this witness is not within the spirit, design and scope of this exception, even if she be within its letter, is clear. Admit, for sake of the argument, that she is within the letter. The rule of interpretation, as approved by this Court in 33 Md., 372, will take her out. This exception contemplates an <em>adversary </em>proceeding, where the deceased is represented by the executor or administrator. It can have no application to a proceeding, the object of which goes to question his right to represent the estate. It is not a collateral proceeding, where the question comes up incidentally after its direct determination by the grant of letters in a Court of exclusive jurisdiction This is a direct proceeding in that exclusive jurisdiction \u2014 the Probate Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-8\">The real and just extent of the exception is to cases where <em>\u201c </em>an original party to a <em>contract </em>or <em>cause of action </em>is dead or shown to be a lunatic or insane,\u201d and the cause of- action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>antedates the death or lunacy. If the will propounded in this case is to be considered the cause of action or contract, the right to institute proceedings never arose until the death of the testatrix. That this is the true construction, would appear from what the Court say in <em>Cannon vs. </em>Crook, 32 <em>Md., </em>486.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-5\">At Laura L. Biddle\u2019s death, Miss Ann Biddle was a competent witness. What has occurred that ought in equity and justice to deprive her of her testimony? In a case of adversary proceeding, on a <em>contract, </em>the rule is not impaired, because until an administrator or executor is appointed, there can be no proceeding. Had the nuncupative will been propounded at once, the witness would have been competent, because she has waited, but before it is possible to say that she is guilty of laches, she loses her testimony.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-6\"><em>Alexander Evans, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">Every requisite of a valid nuncupative will is wanting in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-8\">1st. There was not a due \u201c <em>rogatio tedium.\u201d Code of Pub. Gen. Laws, Art. </em>93, <em>sec. </em>306. The deceased himself is required by the Statute of Frauds, to bid the persons bear witness. <em>Bennett vs. Jackson, 2 Phillimore, </em>190, (1 <em>Eng. Eccl.

The will was made on interrogation, and the responses were thoroughly vague: <em>\u201c </em>Money;\u201d \u201c All my money;\u201d what does such a bequest mean, even if it were one? Wills made on interrogation are viewed with great suspicion ; and to the latest interrogation by one of the witnesses to the nuncupation, Mrs. Hayes: \u201c Laura, <em>don\u2019t </em>you want your aunt Kancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to have your money ? \u201d (A <em>suggestive </em>interrogatory.) Laura, though then fit to make a written will, who -till that minute had not thought she was going to die, did not make any response. <em>Dorsey vs. Shepherd, </em>12 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John., </em>192, 201.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-5\">4th. With regard to the exception taken to the rejection of the testimony of Miss Nancy Biddle, it will be sufficient to say that she could not, after six months, <em>vary </em>her testimony in proof of tlie will as given before the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>Code, Art. </em>93, <em>sec. </em>307; <em>and Welling vs. Owens, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-6\">And if her testimony was to be to the <em>same </em>effect as that given in the Orphans\u2019 Court, she suffered no injury. But it was not competent testimony, under the Act of 1864, ch. 109, or the Act of 1868, ch. 116. <em>Johnson and Wife vs. Heald, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>368.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b652-7\">Bowie, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Agvt\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The appellees having obtained letters of administration on the personal estate of Laura L.

Hayes and Ann Biddle, and prayed the same might be admitted to probate; to which petition the appellees were made parties and summoned to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The respondents having answered, denying that the said Laura ever made any will, the Orphans\u2019 Court, at the instance of the petitioner and appellant, transmitted to the Circuit Court for Cecil county the following issue for trial, via: \u201cWas the alleged nuncupative will of Laura L.

Biddle, deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The second exception is founded on the rejection of a series of pirayers offered by the plaintiff, and the granting of one submitted by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The latter being the converse of the propositions contained in the plaintiff\u2019s series, it will be unnecessary to examine these in detail, since it follows, necessarily, that if the defendants\u2019 prayer was properly granted, those of the plaintiff were properly refused. Th.e defendants\u2019 prayer is equivalent to a demurrer to the evidence. It affirms that, <em>under the evidence in the ease, </em>the jury must find <em>\u201c </em>the alleged nuncupative will of Laura L. Biddle, propounded to the Orphans\u2019 Court, etc., as her last will and testament,\u201d was not in fact and in law her last will.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">It is based upon the principle, that where there is a total defect of evidence, in any particular, essential to the issue which it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove, the verdict must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">It strikes at the theory of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers, on the ground that there is neither fact nor law to sustain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The appellant insists that every preliminary prescribed by the Statute of Frauds and the Code, to establish a nuncupative will, has been expressly or impliedly complied with; that the jury might find from the evidence the testatrix did bid the persons present, or some of them, bear witness that such was her will, or to that effect; or, it might be inferred from acts, such as the nuncupation itself, or circumstances and facts surrounding the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">In the zeal of argument, we are warned by the appellant\u2019s; counsel not to deny the privilege designed to be secured by the statute, by requiring too rigid compliance with certain formula by persons <em>\u201cin extremis.\u201d </em>They argue that the <em>\u201canimus testandi </em>\u201d and the \u201c <em>rogatio testium </em>\u201d are not two distinct,, separate elements in the constitution of a nuncupative will. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u201c The <em>factum </em>of the nuncupation and the <em>\u2018animus testandi\u2019 </em>are the essential elements of the will.\u201d The calling of the witnesses is but the evidence of the <em>\u201canimus testandi.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">However the interpretation of the Statute of Frauds as to nuncupative wills may have been relaxed in other States, we do not feel at liberty to depart from the policy adopted in the Ecclesiastical Courts of England, and reiterated by our earliest and latest decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Nuncupative wills originated in the tender regard of the law, for cases of extreme necessity, in which, to meet sudden exigencies, it permits them'under certain qualified conditions. Conscious of the liability of sick persons to be imposed on in their last moments, the law surrounds them with such guards as it deemed necessary for their protection. They are watched with great vigilance.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\u2022 The text writers, judicial decisions, and statutes, from the earliest times, indicate great jealousy as to the exercise of the power. They require evidence of a sound and disposing mind, a present intention to dispose, apt words of disposition, and three witnesses called, or bidden by the testator to bear witness to the will, or to that effect; all of which must concur in the last sickness of the deceased. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">That distinguished jurist, Chancellor Kent, in the case of <em>Prince, vs. </em>Hazleton, after citing numerous authorities, showing the legal restraints imposed upon the exercise of the power of nuncupation, concludes with these impressive remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">\u201cThere, is one other consideration which imparts to this subject of nuncupative wills, a momentous character, and ought to incline us to give to them as. little countenance as possible. As soon as a nuncupative will is made, it becomes the interest of the legatee that the party\u2019s sickness should prove to be his <em>last </em>sickness, for if he recovers, the will of course falls to the ground. Not so with a written will. That remains good until revoked, and it cannot be revoked but by writing. Let us, for one moment, pause over this consequence of nuncupative wills and observe with what a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>deleterious influence they must suddenly act upon the heart, and what a powerful appeal they at once make to the selfish and dark passions of the human mind.\u201d 20 <em>Johns. Rep., </em>516.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In the ease of <em>Dorsey vs. Sheppard, et al., </em>decided in 1841, this Court said: \u201c Nuncupative wills, though tolerated, are by no means favorites of the law. Independent of the Scatute of Frauds altogether, the <em>factum </em>of a nuncupative will requires to be proved by evidence more strict and stringent than that of a written one in every particular. This is requisite in consideration of the facilities with which frauds in sitting up nuncupative wills are obviously attended. Facilities which absolutely require to be counteracted, by Courts insisting on the strictest proof as to the <em>facta </em>of such alleged wills. Hence the testamentary capacity of the deceased, and the \u2018 <em>animus tesiandi \u2019 </em>at the time of the alleged nuncupation, must appear, in the case of a nuncupative will, by the clearest and most indisputable testimony.\u201d <em>Vide Demann vs. Bonsall, </em>2 <em>Eng. Eccl. Rep., </em>147; 1 <em>Williams on Ex\u2019rs, </em>101; <em>Priscilla Yarnall's Will, </em>4 <em>Rawle Rep., </em>62; 12 <em>Gill &amp; Johnson, </em>198. The same principles are announced in the late case of <em>O\u2019Neill vs. Smith, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>573.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">It is entirely inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Statute and Code, to supply by inference, the <em>\u201crogatio testium,\u201d </em>the most significant and important of all the precautions imposed by them, involving both the publication and attestation of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The language of the Code is: \u201c No nuncupative will shall be good, etc., that is not proved by the oaths of three witnesses at least, Avho were present at the making thereof, nor unless it be proved that the testator, at the time of pronouncing the same, did bid the persons present, or some of them, bear Avitness that such was his will, or to that effect.\u201d The most imperative form of language is used. \u201c Negative Avords <em>will </em>make a statute imperative, and it is apprehended affirmative may, if they are absolute, explicit, and peremptory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>and show that no discretion is intended to be given. And with regard to a form prescribed by the Act, it should be observed, that where a remedial statute gives a form, it must be observed.\u201d <em>Dwarris on Statutes, </em>9 <em>Law Lib., </em>55.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The words \u201c to that effect,\u201d do not qualify the whole section or all its preceding provisions, but only the last clause of the sentence to which they are annexed, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cto bear witness that such was his will.\u201d This may be done in the language of the Code, or by equivalent words, but to supply the <em>\u201cro~ gatio testium\u201d </em>by inference from the nuncupation itself, would render the most essential pi'ovision of the Code nugatory, and reduce the measure of proof to the standard of the common law, prior to the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The language used by the supposed testatrix, before being interrogated by Mrs. Hayes, were\u00b0mero disjointed words, incoherent, disconnected and unmeaning. They required the suggestion of the interrogator to give them sense. Hence, the words in reply, if a will, was a will by interrogation, which of all others, is least favored in law. <em>Dorsey vs. Sheppard, et al., </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>198.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Such a will especially, required full proof of a \u201c <em>rogatio testium\u201d </em>to give it validity. Yet all the witnesses who speak to that point, concur in declaring there was no request to bear \u2022witness that such was her will. Three witnesses depose \u201cshe did not say she wished them to remember these words as her will.\u201d Mrs. Hayes, the interrogator, says, \u201c she did not say that she wished us to remember it, or that she wished us to be witnesses to her will,\u201d and they proved no other words equivalent, or \u201cto that effect.\u201d But Mrs. Hayes \u201cunderstood,\u201d \u201c was of the opinion, based upon all that occurred,\u201d \u201cthat Laura intended by what she said, to make her will and wanted her to remember it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">This understanding of the witness, or opinion, does not in our judgment, qualify the provisions of the Code. There must be a request to bear witness or something equivalent thereto.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A3j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>(Decided 21st November, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">It follows, from what has been said, that in our opinion, there was a fatal hiatus in the testimony offered by the plaintiff to prove a nuncupative will, and therefore the prayers of the plaintiff were properly refused, because there was no evidence of a <em>\u201crogatio testium\u201d </em>in fact, or \u201cin effect,\u201d and it would have been error to infer the same, from the acts and circumstances referred to in the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">For the same reasons, the defendants\u2019 prayer was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">It is unnecessary to inquire whether the ruling of the Court below upon the question raised by the first exception was correct or not, as, in the opinion of a majority of the Court, the plaintiff could not have been prejudiced by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Her evidence was already before the Conrt in the form of her deposition, and she could not be permitted to supplement it, by proving facts contrary to what was proved by three other witnesses, sworn in her behalf, and without such proof the result must have been the same. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Finding no error in the several exceptions taken below, the rulings of the Court are affirmed and cause remanded, that the Circuit Court may certify to the Orphans\u2019 Court the finding on the issues, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">\n<em>Judgment a firmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
