The conveyance of the property of the bankrupt to his assignee, was made on the 15th of June, 1869.

Clerk.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-17\">The defendant objected to the admissibility and competency in evidence of the said paper for said purpose, and to its being read to the jury; but the Court overruled the objection, and permitted it to be read to the jury as evidence for the purpose aforesaid, whereupon the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The appellant\u2019s counsel in his brief, contends that the evidence being offered for the purpose of maintaining the issue generally on the part of the plaintiff and to prove the assignment, it should have been rejected if inadmissible for either purpose, and insists it was not admissible generally on the third count, because the assignment if valid as such, was prior to the date of the judgment as described in the third count, the former being made on the 15th of June, 1869, and the judgment on the 22d of April, 1870, the latter being subsequent, was not conveyed by the assignment, but was the property of Deyerle.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The transcript of the record shows that the suit in which the judgment was entered, was commenced on the 18th of Sept., 1861, on a promissory note of the appellant to the bankrupt, dated the 2d of April, 1861, for $153.78, on which the original judgment for $103.78, was entered on the 8th of July, 1867, and afterwards by order of the Court, passed the 22d of April, 1870, the judgment was amended and entered for,the sum of $153.78, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The cause of action and original judgment were clearly antecedent to the\u2019application in bankruptcy and assignment, and as such passed by operation of law to the assignee, subject to all the rights of the bankrupt to have it altered and corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The subsequent action of the Court increasing the amount of the judgment, did not in any manner impair the right or obligation of the assignee to sue for and recover the amount as finally ascertained. The second point of objection, that the paper excepted to was not admissible as evidence, because the 14th section of the Bankrupt Law, requires the judge or register \u201c by an instrument under his hand \u201d to convey, etc., is not in our opinion more tenable than the first. Although the Act of Congress prescribes that as soon as the assignee is appointed and qualified, the judge or register shall by an instrument <em>under his hand </em>assign and convey to the assignee all the estate,, real and personal, of the bankrupt, yet this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>provision must be regarded as directory and not essential to the assignment, where some equally formal mode has been adopted, sanctioned by the seal of the Court, which imports \u25a0verity, and gives authenticity to all the judicial acts of -the judge.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AA\">(Decided 10th May, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The right of the appellee to maintain his action, did not depend on the instrument of assignment. The bankrupt A-ct expressly enacts that all <em>ohoses in action, </em>all debts due the bankrupt, all causes of action \u201c with like right, title, power and authority to sell, manage, dispose of, sue for, and recover the same as the bankrupt might or could have had, if no assignment had been made, <em>shall in virtue of the adjudication of bankruptcy and the appointment of his assignee be at onee vested </em>in such assignee.\u201d <em>Bankrupt Law, sec. </em>14, <em>Bump\u2019s Law and Practice of Bankruptcy, </em>37.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">It is also enacted <em>that </em>in suits prosecuted by the assignee, a certified copy of the assignment made to him by the judge or register, shall be conclusive evidence of his authority to sue.\u201d <em>Bankrupt Act, sec. </em>16, <em>Bump\u2019s Law and Practice of Bankruptcy, </em>42.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The instrument of the assignment offered in evidence, being certified by the Clerk of the District Court, under the seal of his Court, to be a true copy of the original assignment on file in his office, the same is sufficient to show the assignee\u2019s right to sue. Independently of these provisions, the right of the assignee to sue was not put in issue by any of the \u2018pleas, but on the contrary the bankruptcy was expressly admitted, and it was not incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove the assignment, so that the admission of the paper, if erroneous, did not injure the appellant. The judgment below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
