While granting to the corporation a special, qualified corporate capacity, with plenary powers for the purposes \u25a0of its institution, it expressly continues for a definite period, and limits, as to amount, the personal liability, at common law, of the stockholders, for debts the company may contract. <em>Corning vs. McCullough, </em>1 <em>Comstock, </em>47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">The individual members of a company, organized under the \u2022provisions of the Code, stand, therefore, as to creditors, and as to each other, in the relation of co-partners with their several liabilities limited by the statute.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>terras of the statute leave but the happening 'of this particular event (the non-payment of capital stock) to be found, to entitle any one \u2014 creditor or stockholder \u2014 to any one or all of the consequences of a dissolution; and the obligation is devolved upon the Court, (the truth of the allegations of the bill, touching this matter, being admitted by the demurrer,) of judicially declaring the virtual relinquishment of the corporate rights and franchises, and the consequent dissolution of the corporation <em>for the sake of the remedies, existing at common law, against the individual members, and in favor of creditors.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-5\">But as this liability is a several liability for a ratable and equal share of the debts, in proportion to the whole debts and the whole capital stock, and not a liability to each creditor until he is paid, limited only by the amount of stock held by the stockholder who may chance to be sued, or of whom the demand is made; (Matter of <em>Hollister Bank of Buffalo, </em>27 <em>N.

There are no rights or property of the company apart from its members, which are sought to be effected by these proceedings, no dissolution being asked. The bill seeks the payment of balances due on stock, not toward the maintenance of a capital, or the exclusive use of the company, but toward the payment of debts for which the members are individually liable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-6\"><em>Henry Kyd Douglas, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-7\">The proceedings in this case is not a creditors\u2019 bill for the purpose of securing a debt under sec. 52 of Article 26 of the Code, and not such as was contemplated by the section in question. It is an anomally, and the cases referred to by the appellants are not applicable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-8\">The \u201cAntietam Manufacturing Company \u201d is a corporation under the laws of Maryland, and the individual liability of the stockholders is definitely prescribed and limited by the provisions of the Code. The subscribers are not co-partners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-9\">The company, as designated in the bill of complaint, is an incorporation under the laws of Maryland. If the defendants are liable in this proceeding at all, they are liable as stockholders in a corporation, and not as partners or <em>quasi </em>partners. Their personal liability depends solely on the pro- - visions of positive law, which are to be construed strictly. <em>Fay vs. Noble, </em>7 <em>Cushing, </em>191; <em>Gray vs. Coffin, et al., </em>9 <em>Cush., </em>192; <em>Cochran vs. Arnold, </em>58 <em>Penn., </em>404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The bill is defective because the corporation is not made a party. Whether this is regarded as- chiefly a suit to compel the payment of unpaid subscriptions, or to enforce contribution toward the payment of debts contracted by the company in its corporate capacity, the corporation itself should be made a party to the proceeding. The corporation should be made a party, because it only can answer and say what amount of stock has been paid up, whose subscriptions are yet unpaid, and what is the amount of indebtedness, and to whom. <em>Abbott\u2019s Digest, title, \"Individual Liability,\u201d secs. </em>321, 323; <em>Maun vs. Pentz, </em>3 <em>Comst., </em>415; <em>Bogardus vs. The Rosendale Manufacturing Co., </em>3 <em>Selden, </em>147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-5\">The bill is multifarious. This is evident from the synopsis bf the number of things it pi;ays for. <em>Barroll\u2019s Ch. Pr., </em>112; <em>Adams\u2019 Equity, </em>309, (margin;) <em>Ohio Life Ins. Co. vs. Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>11 <em>Humph., </em>1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-6\">Stockholders cannot, either at law or in equity, sue their co-stockholders in their own name for unpaid subscriptions. The remedy of the corporation itself is simply at law to enforce payment by delinquent subscribers. Creditors, by sec. 22, Article 16 of the Code, are specially empowered to call a Court of Equity to their relief, when the unpaid subscriptions may pay their claims. But where does a stockholder derive his authority? If he enforced payment, would that be protection against a suit brought by the company? In the numerous cases referred to by the counsel for the appellants, the actions were instituted by creditors of the corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-7\">The case of <em>Walworth vs. Holt, </em>4 <em>Mylne &amp; Craig, </em>634, relied on by the complainants, arose out of a partnership. There was no incorporation, and some of the partners brought the other into Court to bring about a dissolution of the partnership, and to settle up the business of the firm. <em>Abbott, et al. vs. Merriam, et al., </em>8 <em>Cush., </em>588; <em>Gravenstine\u2019s Appeal, </em>49 <em>Penn., </em>310.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-8\">The bill, so far as it seeks contribution, was filed too soon ; before the complainants had been damnified. The simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>fact that they had been sued did not justify them in rushing into a Court of Equity to sue all their co-subscribers. They were yet under no clear legal liability to pay, for the creditors who sued them might not be able to establish their claims or recover judgment. 1 <em>Parsons on Cont., </em>32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-5\">Even if they had voluntarily paid the claims upon which they were sued, they would not have been entitled to contribution. <em>Cary vs. Holmes, et al., </em>2 <em>Allen, </em>498; <em>Andrews vs. Callender, </em>13 <em>Pick., </em>484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">The bill does not pray a dissolution of the corporation, nor charge that it has been dissolved. And yet the complainants ask for the appointment of a receiver. Surely it is the right of the defendants, and all parties concerned, to have the business of the company legally wound up, and its debts and assets ascertained; and this can only be done upon a dissolution of the corporation. In all the cases cited by the appellants, the complainants either declared the several corporations dissolved in law or in fact, or they prayed for a dissolution. <em>Briggs vs. Penniman, 8 Cowen, </em>387; <em>Mickles vs. The Rochester City Bank, </em>11 <em>Paige, </em>118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">It will not do to say that the corporation was insolvent and in fact dissolved. It can only be dissolved by judicial sentence or by a surrender of its charter to the State. <em>Ches. &amp; Ohio C. Co. vs. Balt. &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., </em>4 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>1; <em>New York Marbled, Iron Works vs. Smith, </em>4 <em>Duer, </em>362; <em>Rollins vs. Clay, </em>33 <em>Maine, </em>132.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">Moreover, if this corporation was dissolved in fact, then the bill of the stockholders would not lie against their costockhohlcrs, either for unpaid subscriptions or for contribution. Creditors might have a remedy, and they only.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b483-9\">Robinson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqR\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">This bill alleges that the Antictam Manufacturing Company was duly incorporated under the provisions of Article 26 of the Code, with a fixed capital stock of \u00a7150,000, of Avhicli about $91,000 \\\\ras duly taken; that Avith this subscrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tion the company organized and incurred large debts for the purchase of real property, and the erection of buildings, necessary for the purposes of the company; that being so indebted, and for the purpose of securing the payment of the same, the company conveyed by deed of trust all of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The bill further charges that the company is also largely indebted for labor done and machinery furnished; that the creditors, or some of them at least, have brought suits against the complainants, under sec. 52, of Article 26, to enforce the payment of the same; that the debts and liabilities of the company are largely in excess of its assets and property; and that other creditors will seek redress against the complainants and other stockholders, and prays for the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">1. To compel stockholders to pay their subscriptions to the capital stock of the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">2. To enforce contributions from all of the stockholders to the extent of the several claims, for the payment of which suits have been instituted against the complainants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">3. To ascertain the entire indebtedness by the company, and the apportionment of liability among the stockholders on account of the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">4. For the appointment of a receiver, &amp;c.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">To this bill the defendants filed a general demurrer, and it is from the decree of the 'Court sustaining the demurrer that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">In support of the demurrer, it is contended, in the first ' place, that the bill is <em>multifarious. </em>It may not be easy to lay down a rule of universal application, as to what constitutes <em>multifariousness. </em>It is a question resting somewhat in the discretion of the Court, under the circumstances of each case, in the exercise of which they will be careful to guard against a multiplicity of suits on the one hand, and the imposition of needless and oppressive costs on the other. As a general rule, however, we may say, that in order to sustain a demurrer to a bill on this ground, it must appear that several matters perfectly distinct and independent are joined in the bill against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the same defendant, thus compelling him to unite in his answer and defend different matters wholly unconnected with each other; or the bill must contain the demand of several matters of a distinct and independent nature against several defendants, thus imposing upon each defendant the costs incident to the trial of several claims against the other defendants, with which he has no connection, and in which he has no interest. <em>Story\u2019s Equity Plead., </em>271, 280, 533; <em>Adam\u2019s Eq., </em>310. The objection must therefore be confined to cases where the demand against each particular defendant, is entirely distinct and separate in its subject matter from that in which other defendants are interested, and does not apply where there is a <em>common liability </em>in the defendants, and a <em>common, </em>although not <em>co-extensive interest </em>in the complainants. Here the bill is filed by shareholders in a manufacturing company, incorporated under the general corporation law, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of capital subscribed, by whom subscribed, the amounts paid thereon and by whom paid; to enforce the payment of the same; to ascertain the debts of the company, for the payment of which the stockholders are liable, under the Act of incorporation, to the amount of capital stock subscribed by them respectively, and on account of which suits have already been instituted against the complainants \u2014 and to compel a ratable contribution by all of the stockholders towards the payment of the same. In regard to the several matters thus charged in the bill, the complainants and defendants have a common interest and a common liability, to the extent of their individual subscriptions, and we are of opinion, therefore, that the objection of multifariousness cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In further support of the demurrer, it is insisted that the complainants have no right to invoke the aid of a Court of Equity for the purpose of compelling the payment of unpaid subscriptions. Ordinarily it is true, that the corporation is the proper party to enforce the payment of subscriptions to its capital stock, but it is equally true that the capital stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of these manufacturing companies constitutes, in equity, a trust fund for the payment of creditors, and no one doubts the power of a Court of Equity to subject the entire property of the company to the payment of the claims of creditors. If, however, the property has been assigned, and creditors are seeking their statutory remedy against the stockholders, thus compelling them to pay the debts due by and contracted by the company, there is no good reason why a Court of Equity should not, at the instance of such stockholders, compel subscribers to pay the amounts of their several subscriptions, in order that the common assets of the company may be realized and applied to their legitimate purposes, and the stockholders relieved to that extent from a liability to which they are exposed, and which every principle of justice requires should be borne alike by each; and further, in order that there may be a <em>pro rata </em>apportionment of liability and contribution on \u25a0account thereof, in proportion to the capital stock held by them respectively. Under such circumstances, stockholders are not obliged to wait until judgments are recovered against them and payment of the same enforced. To require this, would not only be oppressive, but in many cases might prove ruinous to parties. Their liability as shareholders to creditors of the company is an original liability, and their right to an apportionment of the same, under the averments in this bill, and under a proper state of pleadings, and to a ratable contribution on account thereof by all other stockholders, stands upon different grounds from those of a surety against a co-surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">There is a defect, however, fatal to the bill in its present shape. It alleges that the capital stock of the company was fixed at $150,000, of which only about $91,000 was subscribed. Under such a charter we have heretofore decided that the liability of a subscriber for his subscription depended upon the whole capital stock being taken, unless by his acts or declarations, before or subsequent to the organization of the company, he has waived the right to set up this defence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Hughes vs. Antietam Man. Co., </em>34 <em>Md., </em>316. The bill ought to have charged that the several stockholders, defendants, had, by their participation in the organization of the company, or by other acts, waived their right to rely upon a partial subscription of the capital stock.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AXn\">(Decided 20th June, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The corporation ought also to have been made a party to the suit. The bill does not allege that it has been dissolved, nor does it pray for a dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">How far a company, by suffering acts to bo done, totally destructive of the end and object for which it was incorporated, may he treated as having virtually surrendered its charter, or its dissolved, is 2 {question not to ho dooidod in this ease. It is 'well settled, that so long as a corporation has the power to increase its subscription \u2014 to call in more capital and resume its business, the mere allegation that its debts are largely in excess of its assets, and that it has conveyed its property in trust to pay the same, does not warrant a Court of Equity in treating it as <em>ipso facto </em>dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Eor these reasons the decree below must be affirmed, hut we will remand the cause in order that the bill may be amended in conformity with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed and cause remanded for f urther proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
