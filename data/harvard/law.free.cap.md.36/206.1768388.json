Berry and others against Rachel M. Berry and others, a decree was passed on the 9th of November, 1865, for the sale of the real estate of John E. Berry, Sr., deceased, and Daniel Clarke and Alonzo Berry were appointed trustees to make sale of the same. On the 9th of November, 1867, certain portions of this estate \u2022were sold by the trustees. On the 27th of May, 1868, an order of ratification <em>nisi </em>was passed; exceptions were filed to the ratification of the sale, and on the 30th of April, 1869, the Court (Ford and Magruder, J.) passed an order referring the cause to the auditor to make a statement of the claims of the complainants and of the other creditors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>deceased John E. Berry,'Sr., with their relative and positive liens, upon pleadings and proof then in the cause, and such further proofs as might be produced before him upon the usual notice to the respective parties. Pending these proceedings, and while the case was before the auditor, Nathan Masters, a collector of State and county taxes for- the second collection district of Prince George\u2019s county, for the years 1866 and 1867, made sale of a portion of said real estate, and on the 27th of October\u2019, 1870, filed in the Circuit Court of said county a report showing that as such collector he left .at the dwelling house on \u201cIndependence,\u201d a part of the real estate of John E. Berry, Sr., deceased, and the place of abode of Rachel M. Berry, one of the executors of John E. Berry, Sr., a statement showing the aggregate amount of taxes of every description, with which the said John E. Berry, Sr., was assessed, with a notice annexed thereto, that unless the taxes so due were paid within thirty days thereafter, he would proceed, by way of distress or execution, to collect the same; that the said taxes so due not having been paid as required, and finding no personal property of any kind out of which to make the same,- he returned to the county commissioners of said county, among others, the said tract of land, containing two hundred and fifty acres, on which the State and county taxes for the years 1866 and 1867 had not been paid, and the amounts due thereon, together with the name of John E. Berry, Srv the person in whose name the sa\u00edne was assessed and chargeable with the payment of the same, and certified to the said commissioners that he could find no personal property in the said county liable for or chargeable with the payment of the said taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">That- thereupon the said county commissioners caused an advertisement, expressing the name of said tract or parcel of land, so far as could be ascertained, and the location thereof, and the amount of taxes due thereon, together with the name of the person chargeable with the payment of the same, to be inserted in the \u201c Marlboro\u2019 Gazette,\u201d a newspaper published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>in Upper Marlboro\u2019, in the said county, for thirty days \u2014 the first publication having been on the 21st day of February, 1869 \u2014 and giving notice, that unless the taxes due on the said land or real estate should be paid to the said collector within the space of thirty days after the completion of the publication of said notice, the land so charged, or such part thereof as might be necessary to raise the sum due thereon, should he sold to the highest bidder for the payment of the same. The report further showed that the time mentioned in the said advertisement having expired, and the said taxes not having been paid, the said county commissioners did direct the collector as aforesaid, after twenty days previous notice, at the Court House door, and at three other most public places in said county, and by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in said county, to sell to the highest bidder the said tract of land, or such part thereof as might be necessary to pay the said taxes so as aforesaid due; and in pursuance of said direction and authority, the collector as aforesaid, having previously given the legal notice, did cause the said land to he advertised for sale for more than twenty days, in the \u201c Marlboro\u2019 Gazette,\u201d a newspaper published in Upper Marlboro\u2019, in said county, and having general circulation therein, and by notice set up at the Court House door of said county, and at three other of the most public places in said county \u2014 the first notice having been on the 9th day of June, 1869, and continued to the 1st day of July, 1869, the day of sale \u2014 on which 1st day of July, 1869, at the time and place named in said notice, he offered the said land for sale to the highest bidder, for cash, but receiving no bid for the same, withdrew the said land and postponed the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">The report further stated that Alonzo Berry, one of the executors of the said John E. Berry, Sr., paid to the aforesaid collector, as such, a portion of the taxes due for the year 1866, leaving a balance due for said year of $46.47; which amount, together with the whole tax for 1867, not having been paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>he, as such collector, left at the dwelling house on said land, the usual place of abode of Rachel M. Perry, one of the executors of the said John E. Berry, Sr., notice of the amount of taxes due on said land, and stating that unless the same were paid within thirty days, with interest, the same would be collected according to.law; which said time having expired, and the taxes not having been paid, the collector as aforesaid proceeded to lay off so much and such part of the land as would be adequate and sufficient to pay the taxes due as aforesaid, and laid off and surveyed forty acres and twenty-eight perches of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">The collector further reported that he then proceeded to advertise the said land, or so much thereof as would be necessary to pay the taxes due, in lots or parcels, on Thursday, the 29th day of September, 1870, at the hour of 12 o\u2019clock, M., (having previously given the legal notice in writing to the owners thereof, by leaving the same at the dwelling house on the premises,) in the <em>\u201c </em>Marlboro\u2019 Gazette,\u201d and by advertisements set up at the Court House door of said county, and at three other most public places in said county \u2014 the first notice of sale having been on the 7th day' of September, 1870, and continued to the 29th day of September, 1870, the day of sale \u2014 on which 29th day of September, 1870, at the time and place named in said notices and advertisements, he offered a portion of said land at public sale, for cash, to the highest bidder; he first offered a portion of said lot so laid off as aforesaid, but receiving no bid for the same, he then offered the whole of said lot, containing forty acres and twenty-eight perches, when the same as offered was sold to Luna Alden McCullough, wife of George McCullough, Esq., of Prince George\u2019s county, Maryland, she being then and there the highest bidder for, the same and purchaser of said lot of land, at and for the sum of $360; the said amount being the amount of taxes and interest, and the costs and expenses of sale; and that the said sum of $360, the purchase money for the said land, was paid in cash by the said purchaser to the collector aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Accompanying ting report were the printed notice of the county commissioners, the surveyor\u2019s certificate, the advertisements of sale of the property, and the certificate of the printer, in which he stated that the notice by the county commissioners of taxes due by the estate of John E. Berry, Sr., deceased, for the years 1866 and 1867, was published in the \u201cMarlborough Gazette\u201d for thirty days, beginning the 21sp of February, 1869; that the annexed notice of the sale of land of the estate of John E. Berry, Sr., deceased, was published for three successive weeks in the \u201c Marlborough Gazette,\u201d beginning the 9th of June, 1869; and also for three successive weeks, beginning the 7th of September, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">On the report of sale the Court, (Magrudeb, J.,) on the 27th day of October, 1870, passed an order of ratification <em>nisi. </em>Exceptions were filed to the ratification of the sale by Laura L. Stewart, a creditor of the estate of John E. Berry, Sr., and a purchaser of a portion of the real estate from the trustees Clarke and Berry, who likewise objected to the ratification of the sale for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\"><em>1st. </em>Because the said real estate was decreed to be sold by an order of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s county, sitting in Equity, passed in the cause of <em>Paulina A.

Berry, and others, </em>on the 9th day of November, 1865, and the collector had no right or authority to sell the same or any part thereof, the said real estate being under the control and jurisdiction of the said Court or its officers, but the taxes due on the said real estate were a lien on the said real estate, to be first paid and satisfied by the trustees when the sale of the said real estate should be made by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">2d.

And the collector had mo right to interfere with the jurisdiction of the said Circuit Court over the real estate, pending, the proceedings for the ratification of the said sale, and while the rights of parties to the said real estate were suspended by the order of the said Court, passed in the said cause, bearing date the 30th day of April, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">3d. Because the statement and notice left at the dwelling house of Rachel M. Berry, on\u2019e of the executors of John E. Berry, Sr., showing the aggregate amount of taxes with which the said John E. Berry, Sr., was assessed, was improperly left at the residence of the said Rachel M.

B.erry, Sr., and not during his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">4th. Because the notice required to be given by the county commissioners by Article 81, section 56, of the Code of Public General Laws, does not appear to have been given according to laAAr, it not appearing that the notice Avas inserted once a Aveek for four AAreeks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">5th.

Because the survey was not made by the county surveyor, nor by a person authorized by order of Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-13\">The Court (Magruder, J.) sustained the first, second, third, fourth and eighth objections and overruled ihe others; and on the 28th of June, 1871, passed an order vacating and setting aside the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-14\">From this order the county commissioners and the purchaser at the collector\u2019s sale appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b225-15\">The cause was argued before Bartol, <em>Q. </em>J., Bowie, Brent, Grasos, Miller and Alvey, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-16\"><em>Joseph X. Roberts, Jr., </em>and <em>William II. Tuelc, </em>for the appellants, argued</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-17\">That real estate in charge of trustees is equally liable with all other property for the payment of the taxes assessed and levied upon it; and that where trustees, or other parties inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ested in said property, fail or neglect to pay the taxes when due, and there is no personal property liable for the same, then the real estate becomes liable and can be sold, although at the time under the charge of a trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-5\">The revenue derived from taxation is essential to the support of the government of the State, and the collection of taxes ought not to be impeded or indefinitely postponed, and the finances of the State embarrassed, because taxable -property may happen to be under the control of a Court of Equity. It is true that the law provides that in all cases of sales of property the taxes shall be first paid and satisfied, but the law does not say that the collection of taxes shall be delayed until such sales are made. <em>Code, Art. </em>81, <em>sec </em>71.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">A tax is a lien upon real estate as much so as a judgment or mortgage. <em>Eschbach vs. </em>Pitts, 6 <em>Md., </em>71. Indeed it is a preferred lien to either, and yet a mortgage or judgment creditor, not a party to the decree, is not estopped from selling for his debt. Why then should a collector of State taxes be prevented from collecting a debt due the State, which has, as in this case, been due for more than three years?</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-7\">All taxes, upon assessed property, ought to be equally collectable, whether that property be held by the individual owners or by trustees \u2014 the tax being imposed upon the <em>property </em>and not upon the <em>owner. Fulton, et al. vs. Nicholson, et al., </em>7 <em>Md., </em>104.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-8\">But if property in the hands of trustees be not equally liable to execution and sale with other property, for the payment of taxes, the appellees cannot avail themselves of the right which the law might otherwise give them, by exceptions to the sale, after the sale has been made by the collector. Their proper remedy would have been by bill or petition for an injunction restraining the collector from making such sale. After the sale has been made, and the property purchased by a third party at public sale made by the officer of the State or county, without objection, it is then too late for the trustees to set up their claim to the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The exceptions properly go only to the regularity of the sale, and are not to determine the right of the collector to sell or the title to the property sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-5\">The third exception, and which is sustained by the Court below is, that the preliminary statement of the taxes and notice was improperly left at the residence of Rachel M. Berry, one of the executors of John E. Berry, Sr., &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akg\">The collector reports, under oath, that he left said statement and notice at the <em>\u201cdwelling house on Independence, the tract of land hereinafter referred to, </em>and the place of abode of Rachel M. Berry, executor,\u201d &amp;c. It is true there is no proof that any of the heirs-at-law of John E. Berry, Sr., resided there at the time, nor did the collector suppose that such proof would be required, further than what is stated in his report, but it can be fairly presumed that some of the heirs did reside there. The Code, Article 81, section 49, says, the collector shall first leave with the party (meaning some one or other of the parties) by whom the taxes are to be paid, <em>or at his usual place of abode. </em>And the Court below say that a notice left with an heir-at-law, or <em>at his abode, </em>is sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">By his will, John E. Berry, Sr., directed that his wife, Rachel M. Berry, and his then unmarried daughters, should have a homo at Independence during her life \u2014 the place to be w'orked by his executors, and the proceeds to be applied to their support, &amp;c.; and the proof shows, that some of his heirs-at-law did reside at Independence. The collector then gave sufficient notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-8\">The fourth exception and which is sustained by the Court below is, that the notice required to be given by the county commissioners does not appear to have been published once a week for four weeks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-9\">The editor of the Marlboro\u2019 Gazette certifies that <em>\u201c </em>the annexed notice of taxes was published for thirty days in the Marlboro\u2019 Gazette, beginning the 21st of February, 1869, and that the advertisement of sale was published for three successive weeks, beginning the 7th of September, 1870.\u201d When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>therefore he certifies that it was published for thirty days, he must mean that it was <em>published in every paper that was issued during those thirty days. </em>Had it been otherwise, he would have said that thirty days\u2019 notice was given by publication for one week or two weeks, as the case might be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-5\">The eighth exception is as to the sufficiency of the notice of sale. The Court below decided that the advertisement of sale in the Marlboro\u2019 Gazette was sufficient \u2014 the only defect being in the statement of the collector that the notice Avas set up at <em>three </em>of the most public places in the countjq instead of <em>at the most public places. </em>The laAV <em>{Code, Art. </em>81, <em>see. </em>59,) certainly does not require that notices shall be posted at <em>all </em>of the most public places in the county, for such a construction Avould require almost an impossibility. When therefore the collector reports that he has given notice at three of the most public places, he has to all intents and purposes complied sufficiently Avith the requirement of the laAV.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-6\"><em>Daniel Clarice </em>and <em>Samuel H. Berry, </em>for the appellees, contended</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-7\">That after a decree has been passed for the sale of real estate, and trustees have been appointed to make such sale by a Court of Equity of this State, the property passes under the control and custody of the Court, and neither a collector of taxes has the right to sell the same for taxes becoming due after the date of the decree, nor has a Court of Common LaAV, under the statutory jurisdiction conferred by the Act of 1867, ch. 186, the right to confirm a sale made by the collector pending the proceedings in the Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-8\">Where a Court of Equity, with <em>competent </em>authority, and Avith poAver to <em>grant adequate </em>relief, has first entertained jurisdiction of any subject-matter, its control over that subject-matter, pending the proceedings, is exclusive, and ousts the jurisdiction of a Court of Law, and of the county commissioners acting in the exercise of the poAvers conferred upon them. <em>Brooks vs. Delaplaine, </em>1 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>351; <em>Snyder </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>vs. Snyder, </em>1 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>295; <em>Winn &amp; Ross vs. Albert, </em>2 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., 53, 54; Brown vs. Wallace, 4 G. &amp; J., </em>479; <em>Albert vs. </em>Winn, 7 <em>Gill, </em>446, 482, 484, 487; <em>Withers, et al. vs. Denmead, </em>22 <em>Md., </em>146.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-5\">By the 71st section of Article 81 of the Codo, a Court of Equity possesses full power to secure the payment of the taxes due to the State and county. <em>Fulton vs. Nicholson, </em>7 <em>Md., </em>104; <em>Boligiano vs. Cooke, </em>19 <em>Md., 375; Tuck vs. Calvert, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>209.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\">The simple question which the first and second exceptions raise, is the <em>quo modo </em>in which this liability for taxes is enforced against the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">It is to be done under and through the jurisdiction which the Court of Equity exercises over the property, and not by ousting this jurisdiction and rendering the decree a nullity.

Several exceptions have been filed as reasons why the sale should not be ratified, but it is only with the first, second, third, fourth and eighth that we have to deal, as the rulings of the Court below upon the other exceptions were not adverse to, the appellants, and are therefore not before us upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The first and second exceptions are substantially the same. They present the question whether, after a decree has been passed by a Court of Equity for the sale of real estate and trustees have been appointed to make such sale, a collector of taxes has the power to seize and sell the same, or any part thereof, for taxes due. The decree was passed the 9th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>November, 1865. The taxes for which the land was sold were assessed for the years 1866 and 1867, and the collector\u2019s sale took place the 29th of September, 1870. The land in the meantime had been sold by the trustees, under the decree in the equity case, but exceptions having been filed to the sale, the question of its ratification was still pending. So that both at the time of the imposition of the taxes and at the time of the collector\u2019s sale, the land in question was under the control and jurisdiction of a Court of Equity. Under these circumstances it was not admissible for a collector to step in, and by a summary distress and sale divest the Court of its jurisdiction, and transfer the question of title to another tribunal. His plain and obvious duty was to apply to the Court for the payment of the taxes due, and as they had full power, the presumption is, that they would have directed their payment through their agents, the trustees, in a manner that would have occasioned no unnecessary delay, while at the same time the rights of all interested would have been properly protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The third exception is to the notice, upon the ground that it was not left with the party by whom the taxes were to be paid, or at his place of abode, as required by section 49 of Article 81 of the Code. The notice was left with Rachel M. Berry, one of the executors of John E. Berry, Sr. The taxes were not due during his lifetime, and were therefore not properly chargeable to his executors. The land upon which they were assessed had been devised by the will of John E. Berry, Sr., and his devisees, or some one of them having a present interest, would have been the proper parties upon whom the notice should have been served, if their title and possession had remained undisturbed. But proceedings were instituted in a Court of Equity on the part of creditors to sell the land, and a decree for its sale having been passed, these devisees had no such interest as rendered them chargeable with the taxes due. The property was in the constructive possession of the Court, and there was in reality no one with whom a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>notice, as a foundation for a sale by the collector, could have been left. As before stated, the proper and only course for the collector to pursue, so long as the land continued under the jurisdiction and control of a Court of Equity, was to make an application to that Court for an order that would, according to the circumstances of the case, be effectual in realizing to him the amount of taxes due.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The fourth exception is that the notice required by Article 81, section 56, of the Code to be given by the county commissioners, does not appear to have been given according to law, it not appearing that the notice was published \u201c once a week for four weeks.\u201d The appellants have chosen to rely upon the certificate of the printer, which states that the notice was published \u201cfor thirty days, beginning February 21st, 1869.\u201d This is not sufficient proof of a compliance with the requirement of the law. <em>Johnson and Wife vs. Robertson, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>488. It may be that a publication for thirty days was once a week for four weeks, (meaning four successive w.eeks,) but it by no means follows. It may have been inserted only every other week, and yet published the number of days stated in the printer\u2019s certificate. The proof in this respect must be affirmative and certain, and not left to conjecture and inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The eighth exception is that the notice of sale was not in accordance with that part of section 59, Article 81, of the Code, which requires such notice to be put up \u201c at the Court House door, and at <em>jtlie\u25a0 most public places in such county.\u201d </em>The statement of the collector, which is taken as proof without objection by either party,* shows that the notice was put up at \u201c <em>three other </em>of the most public places in said county.\u201d This, it is insisted, necessarily implies there were other public places at which it was not put up, thereby rendering the notice insufficient, as the section referred to requires it to be put up at <em>all </em>the most public places. While it is essential that a party claiming title under a tax sale should show affirmatively that the collector had complied with every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>requirement of the law in regard to such sale, Polk <em>vs. Rose &amp; Cronhardt, </em>25 <em>Md., </em>153; <em>Beatty, et al. vs. Mason, et al., </em>30 <em>Md., </em>409, such a reasonable construction must be put upon the law as will render his duties possible, and be in conformity with the true meaning and intent of the Legislature. The Legislature could not have intended that the notice should be put up at <em>all </em>the most public places in the county. It would be imposing a duty which could scarcely be performed, certainly not without great and unnecessary labor and expense. \u201c At the most public places \u201d must be construed to mean at <em>more than one public place, </em>and if this requirement is obeyed by the collector in good faith the \u00a1aw is substantially complied with. Its. object is to prevent secret sales, and the true question to be determined under its provisions is the sufficiency of the notice to accomplish that purpose. If the notices are put up at public places remote and distant from the property to be sold, although it might be a compliance with the letter of the law, yet it might indicate such bad faith on the part of the collector as would invalidate the sale. But in the present ease we can perceive no well founded objection to the notice given. We think the purpose and meaning of the law were complied with, and that the exception ought to have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It lias been argued that the irregularities upon the face of the proceedings are not open for examination upon the final hearing, on the ground that all questions of that kind were finally decided by the Court before passing the order of publication provided for by the Act of 1870, ch. 312. That law, after providing that the collector of taxes shall report the sale of any land made by him, together with all the proceedings in relation thereto, to the Circuit Court of the judicial circuit where the land sold is situated, directs that \u201cthe Court to which such report shall be made shall examine the said proceedings, and <em>if the same appear to be regular and the provisions of bjW in relation thereto have been complied with, </em>shall order notice to be given by advertisement published in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>newspapers as the Court stall direct, warning all persons interested in the property sold to be and appear by a day certain, in the said notice to be named,'to show cause/ if any they have, why said sale should not be ratified and confirmed.\u201d It is true that this law imposes upon the Court the important duty of carefully examining the regularity of ' the collector\u2019s proceedings, and of being satisfied that he has performed all things required of him by the law in making such sale, before granting the order for publication, yet the proceeding is entirely <em>ex parte, </em>and is not intended to be final and conclusive. The order is only preliminary, and all questions touching the validity of the sale properly arise upon the final hearing for ratification.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A_\">(Decided 18th June, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In the present case w\u00e9 think the Court below properly refused to ratify the sale, and its judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
