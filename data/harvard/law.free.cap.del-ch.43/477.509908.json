There are ambiguities in the written agreement, and the Chancellor was accordingly justified in admitting oral evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">2. There was ample evidence to justify the Chancellor\u2019s basic ruling that appellant paid $6000' to appellee to purchase a one-half interest in the partnership; that the \u201cleasehold improvements\u201d were incorrectly included in the balance sheet because the accountant was unacquainted with the facts; and that this alleged asset was not a firm asset. No other item in the account is presently questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">3. The refusal of interest and counsel fees was, under the facts of this case, well within the Chancellor\u2019s discretion and does not constitute reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
