Notwithstanding the terms of the plea agreement, defendant \u2014 accompanied by counsel \u2014 thereafter appeared in Town Court, inexplicably pleaded guilty to at least some of the still-pending misdemeanor charges and was sentenced to time served. Defendant then moved to withdraw his plea in County Court, contending that the People violated the terms of the agreement by failing to dismiss the misdemeanor charges and \u201cforc[ing]\u201d him to plead guilty thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">At sentencing, the People acknowledged that there had been \u201csome sort of mix up\u201d with respect to the handling of the misdemeanor charges and indicated that they would consent to a CPL article 440 motion to vacate defendant\u2019s plea in Town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Court so that he would \u201cget what he was promised.\u201d Noting that defendant had a viable remedy in that regard, County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. The People then asked that defendant be sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement (five years in prison followed by three years of postrelease supervision), in response to which defendant requested that County Court deviate from the negotiated sentence based upon his claim of actual innocence. County Court rejected defendant\u2019s request and imposed the previously agreed-upon sentence. This appeal by defendant ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">We affirm. Preliminarily, based upon our review of the plea colloquy and the written waiver of the right to appeal executed by defendant, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary <em>(see People v Tolliver, </em>92 AD3d 1024, 1024 [2012]; <em>People v Empey, </em>73 AD3d 1387, 1388 [2010] , <em>lv denied </em>15 NY3d 804 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Turning to the merits, to the extent that defendant challenges the factual sufficiency of his plea, any assertion in this regard is foreclosed by his otherwise valid waiver of the right to appeal <em>(see People v Fink, </em>97 AD3d 974, 975 [2012]; <em>People v Dishaw, </em>81 AD3d 1035, 1036 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>16 NY3d 858 [2011] ). Although defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his plea survives his waiver of appeal <em>(see People v Robinson, </em>86 AD3d 719, 720 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>19 NY3d 966 [2012]), defendant did not move to vacate the judgment of conviction, and his written motion to withdraw his plea was not based upon the grounds now asserted \u2014 namely, actual innocence and County Court\u2019s alleged failure to adequately inquire as to defendant\u2019s knowledge of potential defenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find defendant\u2019s argument on this point to be unpreserved for our review <em>(see People v Campbell, </em>81 AD3d 1184, 1185 [2011]; <em>People v Young, </em>81 AD3d 995, 996 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>16 NY3d 901 [2011]; <em>People v Escalante, </em>16 AD3d 984, 984-985 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>5 NY3d 788 [2005]). In any event, defendant did not make any statements during the plea colloquy that negated an element of the crime charged or otherwise called into question his guilt \u201cso as to either trigger the narrow exception to the preservation rule or obligate County Court to inquire whether defendant was aware of a potential . . . defense\u201d <em>(People v Jones, </em>73 AD3d 1386, 1387 [2010]; <em>see People v Morgan, </em>84 AD3d 1594, 1594 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>17 NY3d 819 [2011]), and the record as a whole reveals that County Court adequately apprised defendant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>rights he would be forfeiting. Therefore, we find that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\">Nor are we persuaded that County Court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. As to the asserted violation of the plea agreement, although this argument both survives defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal and is preserved for our review <em>(cf. People v Carter, </em>64 AD3d 1089, 1091 [2009], <em>lv denied </em>13 NY3d 835 [2009]), defendant\u2019s claim that the People breached the plea agreement is lacking in merit. As a general rule, where a guilty plea has been induced by an unfulfilled promise, the plea must be vacated or the promise must be honored <em>(see People v Parsons, </em>3 AD3d 790, 791 [2004]). Here, however, the record does not support a finding that the People breached the terms of defendant\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Although the precise reasons for, and circumstances leading up to, defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty in Town Court are unclear, the record fails to support defendant\u2019s conclusory and unsubstantiated assertion that the People \u201cforced\u201d him to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charges, nor is there any indication that the admitted deviation from the plea agreement was due to malfeasance on the part of the People. Indeed, the People acknowledged at sentencing that the misdemeanor charges should have been dismissed and indicated that they stood ready to abide by and honor the terms of the plea agreement. Based upon that representation, County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">While County Court arguably should have adjourned sentencing pending vacatur of the misdemeanor convictions, the failure of all involved to address this issue prior to sentencing does not entitle defendant to parlay an inadvertent omission into a vacatur of his plea in County Court \u2014 particularly where such omission was \u2014 and still is \u2014 easily remedied. As noted previously, the People agreed at sentencing that they would consent to a CPL article 440 motion \u2014 brought by defendant \u2014 to vacate the conviction in Town Court. To the extent that defendant contends that the People should take the initiative in this regard, although CPL article 440 indeed provides for a postjudgment motion by the People to set aside an invalid sentence <em>(see </em>CPL 440.40), nothing contained therein permits the People to move to set aside a plea or vacate a judgment of conviction <em>(see </em>CPL 440.10; <em>see also People v Moquin, </em>77 NY2d 449, 452 [1991]). Hence, while the cited omission is easily cured, the ball is in defendant\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>Finally, defendant\u2019s belated and conclusory assertion of innocence \u2014 raised for the first time at sentencing \u2014 is belied by the statements made by him during the course of the plea colloquy. Accordingly, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s application to withdraw his plea on this basis (see <em>People v Lynch, </em>156 AD2d 884, 884-885 [1989], <em>lv denied </em>75 NY2d. 921 [1990]). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, to the extent not specifically addressed, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Peters, EJ., Lahtinen and Stein, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-8\">. Defendant\u2019s written motion was premised solely upon the People\u2019s asserted failure to honor the plea agreement by dismissing the misdemeanor charges in Town Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. Defendant\u2019s related ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u2014 to the extent it is properly before us \u2014 is equally lacking in merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
