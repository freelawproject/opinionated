D. 1899, a corporation known as the Alton Railway, Gas &amp; Electric Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois with a capital stock of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, divided into shares of one hundred dollars each, which were fully subscribed and issued; that on the said 8th day of August, A. D. 1899, the two corporations above mentioned were consolidated into one corporation, by the name and style of the Alton Railway, Gas and Electric Company, which is the defendant company in this suit, and that at the time of the consolidation of said companies the capital stock of the defendant company was increased to five hundred thousand dollars, divided into five thousand shares of one hundred dollars each, and the said corporation undertook as one of the terms of consolidation to provide that in lieu of the shares of stock held by the stockholders of the said Alton Railway and Illuminating Company an equal number of the shares of the defendant company should be issued to the respective holders thereof, upon surrender of the certificates held therefor.

' Without an act fixing the terms of consolidation the new company is liable for the debts of the constituent companies as far as the property derived from each may suffice to satisfy creditors. The assets may be followed as a trust fund in equity into the hands of the new company, which takes with notice of the trust. The consolidated company may be expressly required, however, to assume all debts of its constituent parts, without regard to the sufficiency of the property derived from them to satisfy the claims.

Statutes in nearly all cases provide that the new company shall acquire the rights and be subject to the liabilities of the old. Therefore the debts of the old corporation are enforceable against the new. Because, also, when a new corporation is formed by the amalgamation of two or more distinct corporations into one, the new corporation succeeds to all the faculties and rights of the several components; it must, as a necessary consequence, be subject to all the conditions and duties also imposed by the law of their creation, both as to private persons and the public. For corporations can not by their own acts divest themselves of the duties and liabilities imposed upon them by law, the performance of which was the consideration upon which their charters were granted and which thus entered into their contract with the commonwealth. For this reason, unless otherwise provided by statute, the new company succeeds to the rights and liabilities of the old ones. Beach on Private Corporations, Sec. 348; P. &amp; R. I. Ry. Co. v.

Moreover, a member can not. be compelled to accept the stock of another company for his interest, a consolidation of the .two having been made, though he may not be able to prevent consolidation. It is common to provide for the shareholders in the transfer or company exchanging their shares in that company for shares of the same number of value in the company to which the transfer is effected. But it is well settled that as to such transaction as this a majority of shareholders can not bind a minority to take shares in the transferee company. Bo individual shareholder in the one can become a shareholder in the other but by his own free will and his own express assent. In conferring authority to consolidate /corporations the legislature is not to be understood as intending to compel a dissenting or non-concurring stockholder to transfer his interest because a majority of the stockholders consented to the consolidation. Such legislation wTould impair the obligation of contracts, and therefore be invalid; consequently there is no power to force a stockholder of the old corporation to join the new corporation, and to receive stock in it on the surrender of his stock in the old company.

Having embarked money in a venture, they can not be compelled against their will to transfer it to a larger or wider venture. Those who in such matters act without the acquiescence of all the stockholders do so at their peril and must take the consequences if their acts be undone at the instance of dissentient stockholders.

Justice Bigelow</author> <p id=\"AMR\" pgmap=\"180\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b180-9\" pgmap=\"180(11) 181(40)\">On looking for the statute on which this action is assumed to be based, we are informed by counsel for appellee that it is found in section 7 of the act providing for the consolidation of corporations. (See Hurd\u2019s Revised Statutes of 1897, p. 432.) The section reads as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b181-4\" pgmap=\"181\">\u201c Such change of name, place of business, enlargement or change of object for which such corporation was formed, increase or decrease of capital stock, or increase or decrease of number of directors, managers or trustees, or consolidation of one corporation with another, shall not affect suits pending in which such corporation or corporations shall be parties, nor shall such changes affect causes of action, nor the rights of persons in any particular; nor shall suits brought against such corporation by its former name, be abated for that cause.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b181-5\" pgmap=\"181\">This section has, in our opinion, no relation to the stock of a corporation, but relates only to the rights and liabilities of the consolidating companies \u2014 that is, to the credits due them, and the liabilities incurred by them.</p> <p id=\"b181-6\" pgmap=\"181\">Counsel says:</p> <blockquote id=\"b181-7\" pgmap=\"181\">\u201cWe concede that a provision in a charter authorizing consolidation is a part of the contract between the stockholders, and enables two-thirds to effect a consolidation without the consent of the other third, but that is a different thing from the confiscation of the shares by means of this power.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b181-8\" pgmap=\"181\">It is not perceived what is meant by the latter part of the sentence.</p> <p id=\"b181-9\" pgmap=\"181(131) 182(48)\">If two-thirds of the stockholders of each of the two constituent companies could legally consolidate the stock and franchises of the companies in one company, as counsel admits they could do, it is not easy to see that any legal wrong could thereby have been committed upon any stockholder in either company. But as to the innuendo that appellee\u2019s stock has been confiscated by the consolidation of the company which issued it, with the Alton Railway, Gas &amp; Electric Company, it is sufficient to say, that the declaration is entirely silent as to any wrong done appellee by the consolidation. There is no averment in the declaration that the value of appellee\u2019s stock in the Alton Railway and Illuminating Company was any less after than it was before the consolidation. Nor is there any averment that the stock proposed to be issued by the consolidated' company to appellee in lieu of his stock in the constituent company was or would be worth any less than the stock of the constituent company which issued it.</p> <p id=\"b182-5\" pgmap=\"182\">If appellee, at and before the consolidation, could have maintained a suit against the Alton Railway and Illuminating Company for the value of his stock, then this suit was properly brought, and the declaration should be held good and sufficient in law, otherwise it must be held insufficient. Not even the counsel who brought the suit attempt to claim that a suit could have been maintained against the constituent company, and he would be a bold man indeed who would even attempt to argue in favor of such a claim.</p> <p id=\"b182-6\" pgmap=\"182\">The claim of counsel for appellee that by the consolidation the stock of the consolidated company was watered, is shown by his own declaration to be without any foundation.</p> <p id=\"b182-7\" pgmap=\"182\">If the law under which the constituent companies were chartered had not provided that the companies might consolidate in the manner in which they have become consolidated, another and different question would have presented itself for consideration; but as the matter is now presented, none of the authorities cited by counsel for appellee have any controlling force in the case.</p> <p id=\"b182-8\" pgmap=\"182\">To hold that this action can be maintained, would be to practically nullify the law providing for the consolidation of corporations.</p> <p id=\"b182-9\" pgmap=\"182\">The court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s demurrer to appellee\u2019s declaration, and in rendering judgment against appellant, and for these errors the judgment is reversed, with instructions to the Circuit Court to sustain the demurrer.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
