Trial in the Superior Court, before Putnam, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance-as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">The plaintiff contended that he sold the liquors to the defendant on the account of Patrick Bulman, upon the defendant\u2019s original promise to pay for them. The plaintiff, after testifying to a conversation between himself and the defendant, tending to show the promise, proceeded to testify substantially as follows : \u201c The defendant said to me, 1 How am I to get the goods ? \u2019 I said, \u2018 You can order them, and I will send them. The sales are to be made at my store.\u2019 He said, \u2018Will you pay the freight on them? \u2019 I said, \u2018 You will have to pay for the freight, and I will carry them to the freight house for you.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>It appeared that the plaintiff resided and did business in Springfield, and the defendant resided and did business in Turner\u2019s Falls; that the goods in all cases were ordered by mail, and the defendant had no agent in Springfield; that the plaintiff had a license to sell liquors, by wholesale, at his store in Springfield, the license containing in its provisions the statutory conditions required; that the defendant denied the contract and conversation testified to by the plaintiff; that the plaintiff testified that, when the orders came for the goods, he put them up, marked and labelled them, placed them one side, with the bill of lading on the head of the barrels, and the teamster came and took them away to the depot; that the defendant did not pay for the cartage to the depot, and the plaintiff made no charges to the defendant therefor; that the defendant had no actual control of the goods \u00fantil after such delivery of them to the common carrier by the plaintiff; and that the defendant paid the freight on the goods from Springfield to Turner\u2019s Falls. There was no other evidence upon the question of the sale and delivery of the goods than that given by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\">The defendant asked the judge to rule as follows: \u201c1. The liquors having been in fact delivered to the common carrier by the plaintiff, and the freight paid by the consignee, it was an illegal sale, and was made in violation of law and of the conditions of Ms license. 2. If the jury believe that the plaintiff, by the method of his delivery of the liquors, had a purpose to evade the law and the conditions of his license, and, notwithstanding the statements he may have made to the defendant, intended and expected, at the time of the contract, to deliver the goods at the depot, and in carrying out this purpose and intention he did deliver the goods at the depot to the defendant, then it was an illegal sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">The judge declined so to rule; but instructed the jury as follows : \u201c Assuming, for the purposes of the trial, that the sale of the liquors must be completed by a delivery on the premises to make it a legal sale, if you find that, at the time the original promise was made, it was a part of the agreement that the sales should be understood as made at the plaintiff\u2019s store, and delivered by the plaintiff at the depot for the defendant, and further find \u2018 that, upon the receipt of the orders, the \u2019 plaintiff put up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>liquors, marked, them with the defendant\u2019s name, labelled them, and placed them one side, with the bill of lading attached to them, with the purpose and intent on the part of the plaintiff of passing thereby his title to the liquors to the defendant, and they were delivered to a teamster to take, for the defendant, to the depot, then you may find that there was a completed sale of the liquors on the premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-5\"><em>E.
