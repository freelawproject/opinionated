On January 9, 1879, Paige applied to another magistrate to take the oath that he did not at the time of his arrest and at the date of the application intend to leave the state, and also to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors. That magistrate refused to discharge Paige, on the ground that he did at the time of his arrest and at the time of his examination intend to leave the state. On January 25, 1879, Paige applied to the respondent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>take an oath that \u201che does not intend to leave this state.\u201d At the time and place appointed for the hearing, the petitioner appeared specially, and objected to the respondent hearing the evidence and passing on the application of Paige, on the ground that the subject-matter thereof had been already determined. The respondent heard the parties, and decided that Paige was not estopped by the previous finding from applying to take the oath; and proceeded to hear the testimony, and was conducting the hearing up to the time of the filing of this petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-4\">The judge ruled that the respondent did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine Paige\u2019s application; and that a writ of prohibition was the proper remedy; and reported the case for the determination of the full court.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATJ\">In order to warrant an arrest on mesne process in an action of contract, it is only necessary that the plaintiff, or some one in his behalf, should make affidavit of, and prove to the satisfaction of a magistrate, certain facts as to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and the defendant\u2019s property, and \u201cthat he believes, and has reason to believe, that the defendant intends to leave the state, so that execution, if obtained, cannot be served upon him.\u201d Gen. Sts. c. 124, \u00a7 1. The defendant, when so arrested, must be taken before a magistrate, who, if the defendant wishes it, is to issue notice to the plaintiff that the defendant desires to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors, or an oath that he does not intend to leave the state, or both these oaths; \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12 ; and if the defendant \u201c has given notice that he desires to take an oath that he does not intend to leave the state, he shall be examined in relation thereto, and any legal and perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>nent evidence may be mtroduced by either party. If the magistrate is satisfied that the defendant did not when arrested, and does not at the time of examination, intend to leave the state, he shall make certificate thereof, and discharge the defendant from arrest.\u201d \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">It will be observed, that, although the notice issued is of the defendant\u2019s desire to take an oath that he \u201c does not \u201d intend to leave the state, the magistrate, in order to discharge him from arrest, must be satisfied, not only that he does not at the time of examination, but that he \u201cdid not when arrested,\u201d intend to leave the state. The obvious purpose of this provision is, that, as the affidavit and proof that the defendant at the time of his arrest intends to leave the state, on which the arrest is made, are <em>ex </em>parte, the defendant shall have an opportunity to be heard and offer evidence upon the issue so presented by the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit. , When that issue has been passed upon by the judgment of a magistrate on a hearing of both parties, it must be treated as finally determined for the purposes of the suit, unless there is some other provision of statute authorizing that issue to be raised and tried anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Upon examination of the statutes on the subject, with the aid of the elaborate argument of counsel, we find no such provision. On the contrary, \u00a7 25, which provides that if a debtor, arrested on mesne process in an action of contract, and carried before the magistrate, \u201c on his examination, does not swear to the satisfaction of the magistrate that he does not intend to leave the state, and the oath for the relief of poor debtors is refused him, the magistrate shall make a certificate thereof, and the defendant shall be conveyed to jail and there kept until final judgment in the suit in which he was arrested,\u201d is clearly inconsistent with the theory that the defendant, after having failed to satisfy one magistrate, upon a full hearing, that he did not, when arrested, intend to leave the state, should have the right to try that very question anew before another magistrate. The further provision of the same section that, \u201c if the final judgment is against him, he shall be held for thirty days thereafter, in order that he may be taken on execution; unless (if the oath for the relief of poor debtors has not been refused him) he recognizes \u201d for his future appearance, \u201c or gives bail, or bond as provided in section forty, or takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the oath for the relief of poor debtors, or an oath that he does not intend to leave the state, or is discharged by the plaintiff; \u201d does not prescribe how often the defendant may apply to take an oath that he does not intend to leave the state, or confer upon him any additional privilege in that regard, but merely gives him the same rights after, that he has before, the final judgment. The many provisions of the statute, referred to at the argument, authorizing and regulating renewed applications to take the oath for the relief, of poor debtors, do but render the more significant the omission of any similar provision with regard to taking an oath that the defendant does not, and did not when arrested, intend to leave the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">It follows that the respondent, in assuming to entertain the defendant\u2019s application to take the oath that he did not intend to leave the state, after a similar application had once been heard and refused, exceeded the authority conferred upon him by statute ; and that, the facts upon which the question of law depends not being in dispute, a clear case is shown for granting a writ of prohibition, notwithstanding that, under the decision in <em>Hayward\u2019s case, </em>10 Pick. 358, if the respondent should hereafter discharge the defendant, and thereby perhaps do irreparable mischief to the plaintiff, the proceedings might be quashed by writ of certiorari. <em>Mayor of London </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>L.
