The defendant objected to the admission of this record. The judge admitted it; and the defendant excepted.

The judge declined so to rule; and ordered judgment for the plaintiff for the penal sum of the bond, execution to issue for $340.44, the amount of the judgment recovered by Riley against Frank.

The suit is brought by and for the benefit of one Ann Riley, who recovered a judgment in an action of tort against the licensee and principal obligor in the bond for three violations of the fifteenth section of the act, which provides that whoever shall sell or give intoxicating liquor to any minor \u201cshall forfeit one hundred dollars for each offence, to be recovered by the parent or guardian of such minor in an action of tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The surety now contends that the condition of the bond does not cover the case of what he terms a forfeiture under the fifteenth section of the statute. But such a construction would defeat the manifest intention of the Legislature. The object is to require of the licensee sureties that he will comply with all the provisions of the statute. The one hundred dollars which, under the fifteenth section, may be recovered for each offence, is not strictly a forfeiture, but is rather in the nature of fixed or liquidated damages, which may be recovered in an action of tort by the party injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We can have no doubt that, the language of the statute, the \u201c damages incurred by violation of the provisions of this act,\u201d and the equivalent language in the form of the bond, \u201c all damages which shall be recovered from him under and pursuant to the provisions of said act,\u201d were intended by the Legislature to include such liquidated damages as might be recovered under the fifteenth section. It follows that the rulings at the trial were correct. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
