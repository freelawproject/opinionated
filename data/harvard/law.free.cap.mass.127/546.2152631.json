Answer: 1. A general denial. 2.

The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-11\">The judge found that there was an entire special contract; and ruled that the plaintiff could not recover under the pleadings.

The defendant having admitted at the trial that all the items in the account had been furnished, the facts that the amount proved to be due was under a special contract, and was less than the sum of the items included in the plaintiff\u2019s count, did not, as matter of law, prevent the plaintiff from recovering the amount actually due, deducting the sums already paid him.
