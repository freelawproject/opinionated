Sts. <em>c. </em>113, \u00a7 2, <em>cl. </em>11, cannot be maintained by a creditor, to order a trustee to transfer and pay to the plaintiff, upon the future death of the equitable tenant for life of the trust fund, so much of a debtor\u2019s share, as devisee of an equitable remainder in the trust fund, as may be necessary to satisfy the plaintiff's claim.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">Bill in equity, filed April 8,1878, against Francis M. Weld and William Minot, setting forth debts due and payable from the defendant Weld to the plaintiff; and alleging that Christopher M. Weld, deceased, by his last will and testament, duly proved and allowed on April 8, 1878, devised all the residue and remainder of his estate to the defendant Minot, in trust, to pay the income thereof to Mary Ann P. Weld, wife of the testator, during her life, and on her decease to convey the trust property in equal proportions to four persons therein named, one of whom is Francis M.

Weld is entitled to one quarter as aforesaid; that the wife of the testator survived him, and is still living; that Minot has been duly appointed executor of and trustee under the will, and has accepted the trusts; and that Francis M. Weld has a property, right, title or interest, legal or equitable, in said trust and trust property within this state, which cannot be come at to be attached or taken on execution in a suit at law against him, and which should be applied to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">The prayer of the bill was, that the plaintiff might have judgment against Francis M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abh\">The purpose of the statute on which the plaintiff relies is to authorize the present application in equity, to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s debt, of an interest of his debtor, which cannot be come at to be attached or taken on execution at law. Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>113, \u00a7 2, <em>cl. </em>11. The interest sought to be reached in the case before us is the interest of the debtor as devisee of an equitable remainder in a trust fund, after the death of the testator\u2019s widow. The only relief, beyond the establishment of the plaintiff\u2019s debt, prayed for in the bill, or suggested in the form of decree submitted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, is that the trustee may be ordered to transfer and pay to the plaintiff, upon the death of the widow, so much of the debtor\u2019s share in the trust fund as may be necessary to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s debt and interest. Such an order, to take effect at a future and uncertain time, for the transfer to the creditor of property of his debtor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>without ascertaining its value by judicial sale or appraisal, is not warranted by any precedent cited at the bar, and does not appear to the court to be within the contemplation of the statute upon which the bill is founded. <em>Bill dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
