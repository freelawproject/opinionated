then turning and running in about a westerly direction on the said turnpike road to the place of beginning, containing by estimation three fourths of an acre, be the same more or less.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">The second deed described the land therein conveyed as follows : \u201c A certain tract or parcel of marsh land, lying in Water-town aforesaid, containing by estimation about one acre and one quarter, be the same more or less, and bounded as follows, to wit: Beginning at the northeasterly corner of said premises, it is bounded northerly by the West Boston Bridge Road, so called, measuring on said road, from land of Cephas Brackett to land of Farewell Hoar, eleven rods and fourteen feet; thence westerly by land of said Farewell Hoar by a ditch running from said road southerly to Charles River; thence southerly by said Charles River from land of said Hoar to land of said Brackett; thence easterly by land of Cephas Brackett by a line from said Charles River to the said West Boston Bridge Road, being the bounds begun at.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">The alleged breach of the covenant was the existence of a portion of a highway, called Arsenal Street, which the plaintiff contended had been laid out upon a portion of the granted premises by the county commissioners, on July 22,1873, and of which he contended that he had no knowledge until some two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>after the date of his deed. The plaintiff put in evidence the record of the commissioners, and a plan tending to show such laying out; and that a strip of land, containing four thousand nine hundred square feet, lying between the southerly line of such laying out and an old, irregular fence or railing standing on the southerly edge of the wrought road-bed of the highway, and which the plaintiff contended was conveyed to him by said deed, but which had previously been taken by the commissioners for the highway, though riot entered upon, It did not appear when that fence or railing was erected, but it had stood there many years, the plaintiff contending that it had stood there since 1825; and it did not appear but that the lines of the original laying out in 1824 could be made certain by the records thereof. It was conceded that the wrought roadway never ran inside of that fence or railing. It was admitted that portions of the highway, remote from the land in question, had been entered upon and constructed for public travel within two years from said alleged laying out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\">The plaintiff, for the purpose of showing that the land conveyed to him by the defendant extended from the river to the old fence or railing, and that the latter was his northerly boundary, offered in evidence the deed to Merrifield. referred to in the deed from the defendant to himself. This deed, dated June 20, 1872, described the land therein conveyed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">\u201cA certain piece or parcel of land situate in Watertown aforesaid, on the southerly side of the Port Road or Arsenal Street, and containing twenty-eight thousand two hundred and fifty-five square feet of land, more or less, and being bounded and described as follows: northerly, by Arsenal Street aforesaid,, as the fence now stands, there measuring one hundred and sixty-one and five tenths feet, westerly by land of Farewell Hoar, the line being the centre of a ditch, there measuring two hundred and sixty-eight feet, southerly by Charles River, at low-water mark, there measuring about seventy-two feet, and easterly by land of the grantors, now used by them as a stone-yard and wharf, there measuring two hundred and twenty-six feet. This conveyance is made subject to the laying out of the aforesaid Port Road or Arsenal Street, to its original width, as contem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>plated by the county commissioners of the county of Middlesex aforesaid, and no claim is to be made upon the grantors or their heirs or assigns, by the grantee or his heirs or assigns, for any of the conveyed premises taken by such laying out by the said commissionersThe plaintiff contended that the line described in this deed as two hundred and twenty-six feet in length would reach from low-water mark in the river to the old fence. The judge excluded the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">It appeared in evidence that Arsenal Street was originally laid out under the St. of 1824, <em>c. </em>15, and of the same width in the vicinity of the plaintiff\u2019s land as is set forth in the records of the county commissioners, as a turnpike. Under the St. of 1857, <em>c. </em>257, it was abandoned as a turnpike. On March 28, 1871, the town of Watertown petitioned the county commissioners to lay out, relocate and establish the lines of Arsenal <em>Street; </em>and, upon due proceedings had, the commissioners, assuming to have jurisdiction, proceeded to lay out, relocate and establish the lines of said street as shown in their records. In their records, the commissioners state that in the vicinity of the land in question, and against the same, \u201c the lines of said road above described are, as nearly as can now be determined, identical with the original laying out as described in the records of the Court of Sessions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">Upon these facts, the judge ruled that the plaintiff could not maintain his action; directed a verdict for the <em>defendant; </em>and, at the request of the plaintiff, reported the case for the consideration of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-6\"><em>S.

The deeds referred to describe the premises as bounded on the same road. Neither of the three deeds gives any other boundary on the northerly side. The road, therefore, is a monument called for by the deeds, and the premises con\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>veyed are bounded on the road as legally established. <em>Cook </em>v <em>Babcock, </em>7 Cush. 526. The deed to Merrifield is nowhere referred to in the deed to the plaintiff, for the purpose of determining the boundary of the land conveyed to the plaintiff on the side next the road. And the description of the land to be \u201c deducted \u201d from that described in the deeds to Cephas Brackett can have no effect to control the affirmative description of the northerly boundary of the land conveyed to the plaintiff. The only ground on which it is supposed to have that effect is because it describes the dividing line between the \u201c deducted \u201d or Merrifield land and the land conveyed to the plaintiff as being two hundred and twenty-six feet long, which would carry the land farther than to the road. But even if the description of the land conveyed to the plaintiff had been in direct terms, \u201ctwo hundred and twenty-six feet to the West Boston Bridge Road,\u201d the distance given would have had no effect to carry the conveyance beyond the monument; and it is clear that a distance given in the description of land excluded from the conveyance cannot be more effective than the same distance would have been if made a part of the description of the land conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The Merrifield deed was inadmissible for the purpose for which it was offered. As already stated, it was not called for by the deed to the plaintiff. He was not a party to it. Nothing which it contained could convey any rights to him, or work an estoppel in his favor against the defendant. Moreover, if admitted, it could not have aided the plaintiff. It was made before the laying out of the road in 1873, and nothing which it contains could have controlled the subsequent deed, which bounded the plaintiff on the road. It makes no difference in the result whether the action of the county commissioners in 1873 changed the limits of the road, or left them as they were before. As the description in his deed bounded the plaintiff on the road, he took under it only to the road as it legally existed when his deed was made, even if the deeds to Cephas Brackett, referred to, conveyed land which was included in the road as laid out in 1873, and the plaintiff\u2019s deed describes the land conveyed by it as the same premises described in or conveyed by those deeds. <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>14 Pick. 411</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The land conveyed to the plaintiff being bounded on the road, which is a public highway, that road is not an incumbrance on the estate conveyed to him, and he has no cause of action against the defendant; and there must be <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
