Alvord, and, for the purpose of showing malice on the part of the defendant, offered to prove that the defendant, in the fall of 1875, and before the plaintiff was married, uttered to the witness slander*<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>pus words of and concerning the plaintiff. This evidence was objected to by the defendant, and excluded. The defendant testified as a witness, and denied that he mentioned the plaintiff\u2019 s name or used any language about her at the time relied on as the time of the slander; and testified that he did not know her before she was married; and, on cross-examination, testified as follows: \u201cI know Elisha B. Alvord, of Shelburne. I never saw him to speak to him about the plaintiff, in my life. I heard she lived at his house. I did not tell him she was a bad woman. I did not tell him, if Riddell got her, he would take her at second hand. I did not know her.\u201d The plaintiff afterwards recalled Elisha B. Alvord, in rebuttal, who testified as follows: \u201c I had a conversation with the defendant in the fall of 1875. I was standing on the sidewalk and he came along and spoke to me.\u201d The witness was then asked what the defendant said. The defendant objected to the conversation, but the judge ruled that the testimony was admissible, and the witness was allowed, under the objection of the defendant, to testify as follows : \u201c Mr. Thayer said to me, \u2018You are about to lose your housekeeper. I said, \u2018 There seems to be a prospect of it.\u2019 The defendant said, \u2018He will have to take her second hand, won\u2019t he?\u2019 I asked what he meant. He said, \u2018 Why, has n\u2019t she been living with you three or four months ? \u2019 That is all. He said nothing about her-being a woman of bad character.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">It was not contended that the words, \u201c she is a damned bitch,\u201d were actionable. The defendant requested the judge to rule that the words, \u201c she is a bad woman,\u201d were not actionable; and that they should not be taken into consideration by the jury. The judge asked the plaintiff\u2019s counsel if he claimed to include the words, \u201c she is a bad woman,\u201d as part of the actionable language; if so, he should so rule; and, the counsel signifying that he so desired, the judge ruled that, if those words were such as the jury understood to import the commission of the crime of adultery, they might so consider them, and, on this point, further instructed the jury as follows: \u201cWords complained of as slanderous are to be understood in their natural and obvious sense, and to receive the construction which the persons to whom they were addressed would ordinarily and reasonably attach to them; and, in determining the sense in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>which the words were used and understood, the <em>jury may </em>take into account the accompanying words and the surrounding facts.\u20191'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-4\">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-5\"><em>C. </em>Delano, (S. <em>O. Lamb </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-6\"><em>S. T. </em>Field, <em>(A.

Was the testimony of Alvord at the time, and under the circumstances in which it was admitted, competent ? 2. Was the instruction of the court in relation to the phrase \u201c bad woman \u201d correct ?</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">None of the many nice and difficult questions which frequently arise in trials for slander, as to whether the words offered to show malice are merely substantial repetitions of the slanderous words relied on, and whether they import different offences which are different causes of action, arise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">In relation to the first point presented, the only question is whether the testimony of the defendant was material to the issue; for, if material to the issue, there can be no doubt of the right of the plaintiff to contradict it. The defendant offered himself as a witness, and in his testimony in chief denied that he used the words charged against him in the declaration, and denied that he knew the plaintiff before her marriage. It is certain that his denial of having used the words was material. The further facts to which he testified, that he did not mention her name at the time, and that he did not know her before her marriage, were competent, and were material as tending to support the other part of his testimony, that he did not utter the words; and, being material, were subject to contradiction. The distance in time was not so remote as to render the testimony incompetent, but simply to impair its weight. How far it was calculated to impeach his credit was purely a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Under our system of pleading in actions of slander, the declaration need only allege the words relied upon as proof of a criminal charge; no innuendoes are necessary. \u201c If the natural import of the words is not intelligible without further explanation, or reference to facts understood but not mentioned, or parts of the conversation not stated, in either of those cas\u00e9is, after set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ting forth the words, the declaration should contain a concise and clear statement of such things as are necessary to make the words relied on intelligible to the court and jury in the same sense in which they were spoken.\u201d Gen. Sts. p. 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">It does not appear either that there was anything said other than that charged in the declaration, or that there was anything understood between the parties which was not expressed, making any explanation necessary. In itself, the word \u201c bad \u201d imports no crime, and is not actionable. But the moral and legal quality of the word \u201c bad \u201d may be made entirely clear by its context and the connection in which it is used. If one speaks of a prostitute, and calls her such, and therefore pronounces her a bad woman, or if he says, \u201c She is a bad woman because she is a prostitute,\u201d there can be no doubt of the sense in which the word \u201c bad \u201d is used, any more than there can be a doubt of the sense in which it is used if a party says of another, \u201c She is a bad woman, she does not go to church,\u201d or, \u201c She is a bad woman because she does not go to church.\u201d Th\u00e9 party is responsible for the ordinary and natural meaning of language as it would commonly be understood. If the subject of discourse in relation to a female is chastity, the use of the word \u201c bad \u201d might import the want of conjugal fidelity, if the woman were a married woman; and when the charge against a married woman is that she is a bad woman, a bitch, and a whore, the court cannot say, as matter of law, that the word bad does not import a want of chastity, but it is for the jury to determine the sense in which the word was used. And we see no objection to the instruction as given by the presiding judge; when he uses the phrase, \u201c the jury may take into account the accompanying words, and the surrounding facts,\u201d he is not to be understood as referring to those unexpressed but understood circumstances which give character to the language used, but simply to those facts and circumstances which attend the uttering, such as time, place, and words uttered. In setting out the words uttered as \u201c bad woman,\u201d \u201c bitch,\u201d and \u201c whore,\u201d there is no necessity for introducing any colloquium that these words were used in reference to her chastity, because the jury might be warranted without such colloquium in finding that the words used, in the connection in which they were used, did of their own force import to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the ordinary hearer the charge of want of chastity, or of the crime of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We see, therefore, no objection to the instruction of the presiding judge, or to the admission of the testimony of Alvord.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
